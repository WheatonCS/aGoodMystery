addressed to parents
these volumes are intended for young
people from the age ten to fourteen
they complete the series early lessons
 an humble work from which no
literary fame can be acquired but which i
have been most desirous to complete from
the belief that it will be more useful than
any other in my power i have had another
motive for finishing it one which
though it may be no concern the public
 may be permitted to name harry and
lucy was begun by my father above fifty
vil 
years ago for the use his own family
and published at a time when no one 
any literary character excepting dr watts
and mrs barbauld had ever condescended
to write for children that little 
was i believe the very first attempt to
give any correct elementary knowledge or
taste for science in a narrative suited to
the comprehension children and calculated
to amuse and interest as well as
to instruct finding from experience that
it answered the intended purpose my father
continued the at intervals and in
the last part published in i had the
pleasure assisting him he then communicated
many ideas for the completion
 his plan which i thought too valuable
to be abandoned i considered that a full
knowledge his views and long habits
 acquaintance with his mode teaching
might enable me to do justice to his
 
plan though i was aware the difficulty
 combining ingenious with practicable
illustrations and still more sensible the
accuracy requisite for elementary instruction
the want his mind working along
with my own i knew must be in this attempt
peculiarly felt but i have been
encouraged to persevere by the assistance
afforded me by his and my own scientific
friends to name these kind and able
friends would gratify my vanity and might
ensure the confidence parents but it
would perhaps have more the appearance
 ostentation than candour and mightleave
others responsible for errors which
have escaped the most careful revisal
i have endeavoured to pursue in this
conclusion early lessons my father's
object in their commencement to exercise
the powers attention observation reasoning
and invention rather than to teach

any one science or to make any advance
beyond first principles the essential point
is to excite a thirst for knowledge without
which it is in vain to pour the full tide
even to the lips as dr johnson said to
boswell when he was describing the pains
his preceptors had taken to give him learning

sir anybody can bring a horse to the
water but who can make him drink
consistently with the sort instruction
to be conveyed it was impossible to give
as much the amusement arising from
incident and story in this as in some
others but the varying occurrences 
domestic life the frequent changes scene
and the different characters the children
with all their hopes and fears in the pursuit
 their own little schemes and experiments
will i hope produce sufficient
action to create interest and to keep awake

attention no pernicious stimulus has been
driven no deception or cajolery employed
to effect our purpose all attempts to cheat
children by the false promise that they
can obtain knowledge without labour are
vain and hurtful the gods sell everything
to labour and mortals young or
old must pay that price the wages 
industry should however be rendered ascertain
as possible for the pupils will exert
themselves in proportion to their hopes
that their efforts will be recompensed by the
pleasure success i have taken all the
precautions in my power to secure to each
effort attention its just reward
much that would be tiresome and insufferable
to young people if offered by
preceptors in a didactic tone weill be
eagerly accepted when suggested in conversation
especially in conversations bell

tween themselves in these there is always
a certain proportion nonsense an alloy
which is necessary to make sense work
well children can go on talking to one
another much longer than they can bear to
hear the address however wise or eloquent
 any grown person young people 
good disposition learn with peculiar ease
from each other because the young teacher
has not forgotten his own difficulties 
knowing exactly where they lay he sees
how to remove them or to assist another
over the obstacles the great preceptor
standing on the top the ladder learning
can hardly stretch his hand down to
the poor urchin at the bottom looking upto
him in despair but an intermediate
companion who is only a few steps above
can assist him with a helping hand can
show him where to put his foot safely 

and now urging now encouraging can
draw him up to any height within his own
attainment
the system mutual instruction can
be still more advantageously pursued in
teaching the rudiments science than
those literature and may be extended
even to higher branches intellectual
education upon this principle in the
following volumes the young brother is
employed to teach his sister what he has
learned either from his father or from
books
harry's abilities and knowledge will
perhaps appear a little above his age but
this the reader must excuse and attribute
as he pleases to education or to accident
or to natural genius harry will not be
disliked because he is not pedantic and
he has some redeeming faults and foibles
which save him from the odium attached

to a perfect character and from the danger
 being thought too good to be natural
lucy on the other hand may at times
seem too childish and volatile her respect
for accuracy not being at first much
greater than that the sailor who said
we'll not quarrel for a handful degrees
but these faults produce the nonsense
and the action necessary to relieve 
the reader's attention as to the danger
and the penalties her becoming an
affected scientific lady it is left to her
mother's and her own good sense and good
taste to guard against that evil all that
can be said or thought upon the subject by
the other sex is comprised in the edinburgh
wit's declaration 
 i do not care how blue a lady's stockings
may be if her petticoats are but long
enough
my father long ago foresaw what everypreface

body now feels that the taste for scientific
as well as literary knowledge which has
risen rapidly and has spread widely would
render it necessary to make some provision
for the early instruction youth in science
in addition to the oreat and successful
attention paid to classical literature in
public establishments alterations even
when felt to be requisite must for many
reasons be tardy much in the mean time
may be prepared by private instruction
it has been feared by some that the
general diffusion knowledge will tend
to damp the energy genius and that
original invention will decline in consequence
 increased cultivation this
might perhaps be the consequence injudicious
cultivation if the acquisition
 a great quantity learning all kinds
or any kind were made the sole and
ultimate object the mind would be opxvi

pressed and invention extinguished under
the mass but this there is no danger if
the faculties be proportionably exercised
and if the pupil be enabled to arrange
and above all to employ his knowledge
in science the hope future discoveries
and the ambition to invent are great natural
and neverfailing excitements to
young and old
that very ingenious and very mysterious
philosopher dr hooke speaks somewhere
in his works an algebraic formula by
which he could determine what things are
possible or impossible to perform or to
invent without perfectly crediting or
perfectly understanding this veiled prophet
we may hope and believe that the inventive
power may be assisted and improved by
exercise by reasoning and by judicious
experiments many admirable observations
on the nature and conduct the

understanding on the causes which have
prevented our advancement in knowledge
and on the habits false reasoning prepossessions
and prejudices which enslave
and disable our faculties are to be found
in the works bacon and hooke 
locke stewart and mayfair these observations
should not be suffered to lie
dormant in books the admiration only 
the learned nor should we be content with
merely citing them occasionally to adorn
our writings or to point our conversation
metaphysics after being too much in
fashion have been thrown aside too disdainfully
and their use and abuse have
been confounded surely it would be
doing good service to bring into popular
form all that metaphysicians have discovered
which can be applied to practice
in education this was early and long my
father's object the art teaching to inr
vent i dare not say but awakening
and assisting the inventive power by daily
exercise and excitement and by the application
 philosophic principles to trivial
occurrences he believed might be pursued
sith infinite advantage to the rising generation

i have now stated all the objects this
 how far they have been accomplished
must be left to time and parents
and above all to children to decide
maria edgeworth
mayest 
mamma do you recollect two years
ago when my father was explaining tous
the barometer and thermometer and
when he showed us several little experiments
said lucy and she sighed
yes my dear i remember that time
very well said her mother but why
do you sigh
 because i was very happy then said
lucy
and are not you happy now my
dear 
yes mamma but not so very happy
as i was then because now i do not goon
with harry as i used to do

how so i hope that you have not
had any quarrel with your brother
quarrel i oh no mamma it would
be impossible to quarrel with harry he
is so goodnatured and he is as fond 
me as ever i believe but yet i do not
know how it is we do not suit each other
quite so well as we did we are not so
much together i do not know all he is
doing nor go on with all he is thinking
 as i used to do
my dear lucy you and your brother
have been learning different things for
some time past and as you grow older
this must be your different employments
must separate you during a great part 
the day and so much the better you will
be the more glad to be together in your
hours amusement do not you find
this
yes i do mamma said lucy but 
and after this but she sighed again but
now we are not amused always in the
same way harry has grown so excessively
fond mechanics and all those
scientific things which he is always
learning from my uncle and papa
i thought lucy that you were fond 
those things too said her mother
so i am mamma only i am not
nearly so fond them as i was formerly 
i do not exactly know why but in the
first place i suppose because i do not
understand them now nearly so well as
harry does he has got very far before
me
true answered her mother you
have been learning other things which it
is more necessary for a girl to know
yes mamma i remember your saying
just after that happy barometer time
that i thought nothing but experiments 
papa said that must not be then i was
not allowed to go into his room with
harry in the mornings however i learned
more arithmetic and drawings and dancing
and music and work
and you grew fond these so much
the better said her mother this does
not make you less happy does it

no no mamma but then came the
time when harry and i sere quite separated
that long long ltng time
when you were ill mamma and when i
was at my aunt pierrepoint's while i was
with her i read nothing but stories and
poetry and i heard my aunt and people
who were there reading plays she used
to praise me for understanding wit and for
repeating poetry then i grew very fond
 them but harry is so grave always
about wit he never understands it at
first and at last he says is that all 
as to similes they always interrupt
him
thei interrupt him said her mother
 perhaps lucy sou interrupt him
sometimes perhaps i do mamma 
but he always finds out that similies are
not exact this is very provoking i
wonder why he is so much fonder exactness
than i am
probably because in science which
he has been learning he finds at every
step the use the necessity exactness
he could not go on without it in measuring
or in reasoningmamma
i understand the use exactness
in some things in drawing in
perspective and in proportion by a scale
as you taught me harry came to me the
other day and asked me to draw a cart
for him and i was glad to find that i
could help him in something
 and i dare say he will be glad to
help you in his turn you each know
different things which you can learn from
one another and in which you can be 
mutual assistance this is just as it should
be between friends
thank you mamma you make me
feel happy again i will ask harry to
bring me up to him in all he has been
learning as fast as possible that we may
go on together as we used to do if you
have no objection mamma
do so my dear lucy but i warn
you that you should not expect to go
fast you must be content to go slowly
and you must submit to be inferior to
your brother for some time this may
mortify you my dear but it cannot be
avoided you must bear it
every well mamma i can bear it but
mother said lucy hesitating a little
there is one other thing i want to say
before i can be quite happy
 say it then my dear what are you
afraid not me i hope
 oh no mamma not afraid you 
but i am not sure that the person who
said what i want to tell sou would like
that you should know that he said it
you can tell me what was said then
without telling me from whom you heard
it cannot you lucy 
ican and i will said lucy then
you must know mamma that one day
when i was at my aunt pierrepoint's she
was telling somebody that papa used to
teach me scientific things along with
harry but that since i had come to her
i had not learned any thing that sort
and now it comes mamma the gentleman
who is not to be named laughed
v
well there was no great harm in
that
no mamma only that he laughed ina
particular sort way scornfully and
he said that it was well for me i had left
off such learning that i should be a
much more agreeable woman without it
that ladies had nothing to do with science
or ought to have nothing to do with it
he said that scientific ladies are always
displaying what they know or what they
do not know those were his very words
he said that scientific ladies were his abhorrence
and he looked as if he abhorred
them terribly i was very sorry at the
time that he knew papa had taught meany
thing along with harry i was ashamed
and frightened and i thought it was all
wrong but now that i am come home
i think that it was all right for i see
how much papa likes that you should
know the scientific things that he is busy
about and how happy it makes you and
i want to go on again with harry only
i wish mamma that all people were 
the same opinions about this
her mother smiled and said that
can never be my dear lucy you will find
many people have different opinions upon
this subject but all will agree with your
nameless gentleman that when women
pretend to understand what they do not
whether about science or any thing else
they are absurd and ridiculous and if they
talk even what they understand merely
to display their knowledge they must be
troublesome and disagreeable therefore
they should take care not to do so they
should be particularly cautious talking
on scientific subjects because they seldom
obtain accurate knowledge they are
therefore likely to make mistakes and to
be either troublesome in asking questions
or ridiculous in showing ignorance and
conceit
that is said lucy if they set up
for being scientific ladies
yes if they do that they must take
the consequences they will be disliked
said her mother
but then mamma i am so much
afraid being abhorred even if they
are not conceited will they be abhorred
mamma 
not by persons sense my dear
said her mother as far as i can judge
i think that sensible men would be ready
to assist any unaffected unassuming woman
who really wished to inform herself
and would like her the better for being
interested in their conversation their writings
and their pursuits
i hope then mamma that i shall bean
unaffected unassuming woman
i hope so my dear child said her
mother if your father did not hope so
too he would never teach you any more
on these subjects
i should be very sorry for that said
lucy
yes i think you would my dear
for even with your little experience you
b 
feel that there is a real pleasure in going
on as you say with your brother
 that i do indeed mamma
ras you grow older continued her
mother you will perceive that by acquiring
knowledge women not only increase
their power being agreeable
companions to their fathers brothers
husbands or friends if they are so
happy as to be connected with sensible
men but they increase their own pleasure
in reading and hearing scientific experiments
and discoveries they acquire a
greater variety means employing
themselves independently and at home
but above all the acquisition knowledge
not only enlarges but elevates the
mind by filling it with admiration and
gratitude towards that bountiful providence
who has established such wise laws
for the welfare and preservation the
world
yes mother said lucy and after a
pause in which she reconsidered all her
mother had been saying she returned to
what still a little alarmed her imagination
but yet mamma i feel afraid being
abhorred and if the acquiring knowledge
should make me vain there is the
danger
there is the danger to be sure
said her mother but as far as i have
observed ignorant women are as vain
and often more so than those who are
well informed and now when almost
all are so educated that they have a
taste for literature and some acquaintance
with scientific subjects there is less danger
that any should be vain what is no peculiar
distinction
 oh mother i will take the greatest
care said lucy you shall see as i
grow up and thank you for explaining
this to me
perhaps my dear part what i
have been saying is rather above your
comprehension
no mamma not at all if it is not
conceited to say so i think i understand
it all perfectly well and now i know what
is right and wrong and my mind is settled 
and i am happy gain and very glad
that i may have the pleasure learning
again from papa and above all glad
that i may go on again with harry and
here he comes mamma i see him from
this window coming along the path from
my uncle's oh mamma he has a great
walking stick in his hand and he is hobbling
like an old man an hundred and
ten
 i hope he has not hurt himself
said her mother coming to the window

 no mamma i believe he is only in
play there the old man is running as
well as ever he did in his life and i will
run and meet him
as soon as lucy was near enough to
make her voice heard she asked her
brother why he walked with his uncle's
walking stick as she supposed it to be
it is not his said harry it is mine 
my uncle has given it to me
yours and it is quite new i never
saw it before how beautifully varnished 
and what a pretty head but why did my
uncle give it to you harry it would be
 use to him and it will be none to
you said tilly
there you are mistaken i beg your
pardon lucy it will be as much use
to me as it would be to him and the
same sort use said harry
 same sort use said lucy but
 what sort
guess said harry
i suppose you mean in play to act an
old man as you did just now 
no in earnest useful said harry
what can you do with it said lucy
for you are too young to walk with it
and too old to ride upon it
too old to be sure i am said
harry indignantly i have not ridden
upon a stick these hundred years guess
again
lucy now wanted to examine this wonderful
stick more closely in hopes discovering
what its merits might be but
harry seemed unwilling to let it out his
hands
oh i know what it is it is full 
money it is like the staff which the
man had in the trial in don quixote
which sancho panza found out was full 
money because he would not let it out 
his hands
i do not in the least know what you
mean said harry for there is no
money in this
then let me look at it i will not runaway
with it how heavy it is observed
lucy what wood can it be made
 this outside seems to be mahogany
but i never felt any so heavy it cannot
be all wood it must be hollow and there
must be something with inside it
stop stop do not shake it do not
turn it upside down you will spoil it
cried harry
ho ho then there is something withinside
 it i have found that much out
said lucy and you say do not turn
it upside down like the words on the box
 glass that came last week keep this
side uppermost so i guess that there is
glass within your stick you smile there
is glass then perhaps it is a spyglass
 a telescope a magnifying
glass a microscope no none 
these what can it be what use
can glass be in a walking stick harry
 a great deal as you will acknowledge
when you find it out guess again
said harry it is a thing that you have
seen
but i have seen so many things said
lucy
and which you know the use
said harry
but i know the use many things 
tell me a little more said lucy what
is it used for 
for weighing something said harry 
 stay i am not sure that it is quite fair
to say it is used for weighing a thing and
yet it is something
 i know now said lucy that motion
you made with your hand up and
down against the air told me the something
that it is used for weighing is air
and it is a barometer
now you have found it out said
harry
and now i know what makes your
stick so heavy said lucy the quicksilver
 the mercury i remember feeling
the weight mercury when papa put
into my hands two cups the same
size one full water and the other full 
mercury how stupid i was not to think
 this at first and not to guess it was a
barometer 
harry now showed where his walking
stick opened and he showed her withinside
 it a barometer and thermometer 
he explained to her how the quicksilver
was screwed up tight so as to prevent it
from shaking he told her this was called
a portable barometer
yes it is portable said lucy it
can easily be carried from place to place
it must be convenient to travellers but
is it in any other way better than the barometer
which hangs up in papa's room or
than that which stands upon three legs in
my uncle's library
harry said that he was not sure that it
was better for common use to show the
changes the weather but this said
he is not merely a weatherglass as barometers
are sometimes called this is
intended for another purpose
what other purpose said lucy
 first let me tell you why my uncle
gave it to me said harry becatr
he was pleased with my having taken pains
two years ago to understand the barometer
and with my remembering it now
then he bid me try to find out the particular
use this portable barometer
 and did you harry
 yes but i was helped my father
who was present put me in the right
road i was very stupid at first my
head went quite off the wrong way but
my father was very patient and brought
it back again and set it upon the right
road still i was very slow my uncle
thought i should never find it out he
said it was too difficult and that my father
had better tell rne but papa said
he was almost sure that i should find it
out myself this encouraged me and i
tried and thought again and my uncle
left off walking up and down the room
fretting he was so good as to be patient
too
 that was kind him said lucy 
i know it is very difficult to be patient
with people if they are slow in
finding a thing out when one knows it
all the time one longs to tell or to
push them on to it
papa did not push me said harry
that would have thrown me down but
he pulled he helped me on gently step
by step as he does so nicely and he let
me find it out at last quite by myself
well then you can do the same forme
harry
i will try said harry
 thank you but first let me tell you
all that i have been saying to mamma and
all that mamma has said to me
she repeated it all as well as she could
ending with mamma tells me that i
may go on with you harry as we used
to do and she said she thought that
you would be so kind as to bring me upto
you in all you have been learning
i will try said harry
i hope i shall not be very stupid
said lucy
no no lucy dare say you will
not do not begin by thinking you will
that is a very bad way because then
you go on thinking you are afraid you
will be stupid instead attending to
what is asked and said to you now
lucy suppose you were at the bottom
 a deep well
if i were at the bottom a well
then i should find out the truth because
you know the common proverb as mr
cranbourne said that truth is at the bottom
 a well
nonsense my dear lucy cried harry
now if you go to your wit and what
mr cranbourne says i cannot attempt
to talk to you about the barometer
well i will be very attentive said
lucy suppose then i was at the
bottom a well but should not i be
drowned added she in a low voice
very true i should not have said the
bottom a well but the bottom a deep
pit said harry
oh that is another affair said lucy
i like that better now then i am at
the bottom a deep pit
now then which do you think would
weigh the heaviest the air at the bottom
 this pit or the air at the top a high
house
i think it would weigh heaviest at
the bottom the pit said lucy
why asked harry
oh my dear such an easy question
said lucy
well answer it at any rate said
harry
 because in the bottom the pit
the air in the pit is added to the air that
is above the pit and also you must add
all the air that reaches to the top the
house
 i believe you understand it suppose
you took this barometer to the bottom 
the pit do you think that the mercury
would rise or fall my dear lucy pray
think before you answer
lucy thought and answered i think
it would rise at the bottom the pit
 right now if you took it to the top
 a high house would it rise or fall
i think it would fall replied lucy
why said harry
because then there would be less
weight pressing upon the quicksilver in
the cup and therefore less quicksilver
would be pressed up into the tube
very well indeed lucy i see you
remember all papa taught us about the
barometer now suppose the pit was
sixty feet deep and that the house was
forty feet high forty and sixty make a
hundred you know
to be sure said lucy well 
well said harry i must go
slowly suppose that you observe exactly
how much the quicksilver falls when you
take it from the bottom the pit to the
top the house you would have a measure
by which you could judge the
whole height and depth
i see i should said lucy i see i
i see the use your barometer and it is
very useful
but you do not see all yet said
harry by marking this you would not
only know how much the quicksilver falls
in that hundred feet but by dividing it
and making a scale you might know the
same thing afterwards in any number 
feet in any height to which you might
take the barometer and by this you
would have an easy way measuring
the height mountains
very ingenious very convenient 
said lucy now i understand the use
 your portable barometer perfectly
not perfectly said harry there
is a great deal more to be learned about
heat at different heights and rarefaction
 the air but i will not puzzle you
with that especially as i am not clear
about it yet myself but this is the
general notion which papa says is quit
enough at first
quite enough for me said lucy
thank you harry for telling me no
more
i wish oh how i wish cried
harry that we had a mountain to measure
with my portable barometer 
but said lucy a mountain w
not come to you for wishing for it anymore
than to mahomet
mahomet repeated harry what
do you mean
do not you know harry the common
saying since the mountain will
not come to mahomet mahomet must
go to the mountain you were by
harry when i read this in our universal
history to mamma do not you remember
it
no i forget it how much better
you lucy remember some sorts things
than i do
and how much worse i understand
other sorts things than you do therefore
as mamma says we can help one
another and then in time we shall know
twice as much between us my dear
harry how convenient that will be and
how happy we shall be
very happy but we cannot be always
together said harry so we must
learn to remember what we want for ourselves
or it will be rather inconvenient
when we are separate
we shall not be separated for a great
while said lucy papa said yesterday
to mamma i heard him that you are not
to go to school yet
 i am very glad that said harry
for i shall be so happy going on at home
learning from my father and with you
lucy but my dear to go back to mahomet
for i do not like to let that go
without in the least understanding what
it means
never mind only a bit wit said
lucy
 but cannot you explain it to me
said harry
no it is so easy that if you do not
see it at first i cannot make it plainer
said lucy
do try said harry
it means only that mahomet was
foolish for commanding the mountain ina
braggadocio way to come to him and
when all the people standing by expected
perhaps that the mountain should obey
him and come at his bidding and when
it did not stir he came off in a shabby
way by saying that since the mountain
did not come to him he must go to the
mountain
ais that all said harry but you
told me it was a common saying
yes afterwards it came to be a com
vol i c
mon saying whenever a person proposes
something which seems fine and grand
and which they cannot really do and
when they come off with doing something
common and easy then comes the
saying about mahomet and the mountain

thank you said harry in a tone as
if he had said thank you for nothing
but still i do not understand how this
applied to my wishing for a mountain to
measure with my portable barometer
oh my dear harry do not be so
grave about it said lucy
i only look grave because i am trying
to understand said harry how the
story applied
i suppose it did not apply as you
call it said lucy after considering for a
few moments but do not let us talk
any more it
only tell me how it came into your
head said harry
i cannot tell said lucy when you
said something about wishing the mountain
would come to you 
no no interrupted harry that
was not what i said exactly
well never mind exactly about such
a thing as this my dear harry said
lucy i only know that whatever it was
that you said the sound the words
about mountain brought the mountain
and mahomet into my head
the sound the words said harry 
so after all the words only came
jingling into your head from the sound
and had nothing to do with the business 
and i have been all this while trying to
make sense nonsense
i told you it was nonsense at first
said lucy
you told me it was wit said harry
well my dear if one tries to explain
wit it often turns into nonsense
 then what great good is there in
wit 
if you understand it at first it is very
diverting that is good said lucy
c
but if i cannot understand it at first
said harry
why then i cannot help it said
lucy
 that is rather provoking said harry
 more provoking for me said lucy
this time i have been trying and trying
to explain but in explaining the wit
is lost the pleasure at least is all gone
but that was not my fault said
harry
yes but it was my dear for not
understanding it at first
that is the same thing you said before
my dear lucy
because it is the truth my dear and
i have nothing else to say harry
and i have only to make the same
answer i made before lucy that if i
cannot understand it i cannot
and i come round again to i cannot
help it harry 
that is arguing in a circle as papa
says observed harry
i do not know what is meant by
arguing in a circle said lucy suppose
it is something in euclid
no my dear euclid never argues ina
circle he only argues about a circle or
circles
 and about said lucy oh let
us say no more about it i hate saying
so much about one thing
i like to stick to one thing till i understand
it said harry
but when you can't said lucy 
you really are so slow harry about
wit
perhaps i am a little slow said
harry but recollect lucy that you
acknowledged yourself at last that the
story did not apply so how could i understand
it
well i acknowledge said lucy 
 but that excuse will do only for this
once
i dare say i shall find another next
time said harry but now look
lucy at those two men carrying that
long ladder across the lawn what are
they going to do with it i want to know 
they were going to carry it to a church
in the village the steeple which wanted
some repair his father followed the men
and harry asked if lucy and he might
go with him his father gave him leave
and harry carried his portable barometer
with him saying that he thought he could
try it at the top the church
in the church there were stairs which
led up to the gallery but there was noway
 going up to the top the tower
but by means a ladder the men
fixed it steadily and harry's father went
up harry wanted to follow but his father
said he must not come yet because he
had not time to think him till their
business was finished
 my dear harry said lucy i think
it is very dangerous you will never be
able to go to such a height i am almost
afraid to look at papa going up it makes
my head giddy
and when his father called him she
held the flap his coat and said indeed
harry you had better give it up
 give it up no that he would not
he began to run up the ladder with
he barometer in his hand but his father
called to him and bid him stop and ordered
him to give the barometer to one
 the masons who was behind him whom
he requested to carry it for him and to
follow him up the ladder
oh papa i am used you know to
mounting ladders and i am safe without
any body to take care rae
do as you are desired or you shall
not come up at all said his father
harry obeyed and when he got high
up on the ladder he felt that his father
was right for though he had been used
to go up ladders he had never gone up
one that was nearly so high he felt an
unusual sensation giddiness in his head
he was glad the man was close behind
him he held fast to the sides the ladder
stepped up very carefully and seized
his father's hand who was waiting for
him at the top when landed safely on
the roof the tower he looked about
him when he looked down his head still
felt a little giddy and it was some moments
before he recovered himself sufficiently
to think even his portable barometer
then he recollected that in his
hurry to come up he had forgotten to mark
how high the mercury stood when he was
on the ground he did not like the
thoughts immediately going down the
ladder again it occurred to him that it
would do exactly as well to mark the
height at which the quicksilver now stood
at the top the tower and afterwards to
see how much it would rise when he got
to the bottom but lucy had his pencil
and paper below he wrote the figures
on a bit slate which one the men had
in his hand after being a little used toit
he grew quite at ease at this height
and could think as well as when on the
firm ground when he was to go down
the ladder he was a little startled by hearing
lucy cry out oh harry take

care
his father stopped him told lucy she
was very foolish to call out desired her
to go into the church and wait there till
they should come which she did and
very glad she was when she saw harry
and her father come down safely
upon examining the bit slate on
which he had written his figures and
which he had put into his bosom while
he came down the ladder he found that
they were so rubbed that it was impossible
to make them out
lucy who was afraid his going up
again was by turns sure that one figure
was an eight a nine or a nought
this would not do for harry he must
go up again his father said he was
right and this time he wrote down what
the barometer was before he went up and
carried paper and pencil with him his
father was so good as to accompany him
it was all done rightly and this time lucy
did not say a word till harry's foot was
c 
off the last rung the ladder and safe on
the ground
now they knew exactly how much the
quicksilver had fallen in going up to the
top the tower and at what it had stood
at the bottom harry said that this must
be compared with a table measures
which he had at home which would tell
the height in feet and inches
and here be it noted that on this
and many other occasions lucy's readiness
in arithmetic was use to her brother
when he came to his calculations the
habit writing her figures exactly underneath
each other in the right rows and
 drawing straight lines and making neat
little figures all proved advantage when
she was called upon to write down totals
for him in a great hurry or to go over
and copy clearly his scrawled sums in
addition multiplication subtraction and
division
on the present occasion difficulties occurred
and lucy sat beside harry for a
quarter an hour writing down and rubbing
out figures upon a slate and complying
by turns with contrary orders
lucy my dear write down and
subtract it from have you done it
stay a bit presently yes
my dear i meant to say add did 
say subtract no add add
swell i have added
now multiply that by no stay 
first it must be divided stop i do not
understand this table there is something
about height above the level the sea
here that i cannot make out then what
is this about expansion continued he
reading oh my dear lucy we are
all wrong i do not know how to allow
for the thermometer and here is a calculation
about expansion and proportion
and heaven knows what oh it is all
wrongs i do not know what i am about
this lucy had suspected but she had
the good nature not to say so and as
all she had done was right she found it
easy to be patient harry ran to look
for the article ore barometer no barometer
portable in a cyclopedia but
there opened to harry's eyes such a quarto
scene tables and fractions and algebraic
signs as quite dismayed hiniand
lucy stood in stupefied silence beside him
at length he observed
there is a great difference between
having a general notion any thing and
knovsing it thoroughly i thought i understood
the use this barometer perfectly
but when i come to try i cannot make it
out well
it is too difficult said lucy you
will only puzzle yourself she offered
to shut the 
no no will try and puzzle it out
and when papa comes in he will help
me and show me my mistake
when his father came in he did help
harry and with his assistance and patience
it was all made clear
but after all said lucy though
you have found out the height the
church it was a difficult way doing
it with all these calculations would not
it have been easier to have measured it
by letting down from the top a string and
a freight a plumb line as it is called i believes
then you could have measured the
string and you would have had no difficulty

very true said harry that would
have been the easiest way in this instance
because we could get to the top the
church at once and let down a plumb
line but consider lucy when we want to
measure high crooked mountains miles
high with ins and outs and ups and
downs how difficult that would be besides
this puzzle with the portable barometer
would not plague me again it was
only because it was my first time trial 
and i am glad that we have conquered
the difficulty
it is very good you to say we for
i did nothing but write down the figures
and do the sums said lucy
but that helped me very much and
thank you for doing it so patiently you
did not yawn above six times and now
my dear lucy if we had but a mountain
to measure 
 how happy we should be going to
the top it together at any rate said
lucy
lccy your hair is hanging into your
eyes this morning said her mother
yes mother said lucy because
it is quite out curl
 did you curl it last night lucy 
said her mother
yes mamma i did indeed and it
curled very nicely this morning early 
but i went out in hopes meeting my
uncle who was to have come to breakfast
 and by the time that i came in
again my hair was all as you see the
breakfast bell rang and i had not time to
curl it again
her mother was satisfied since lucy
had not neglected to curl it at night
which had sometimes been the case her
father asked if she knew what had uncurled
her hair when she went out
 the damp the morning papa
said she my hair always goes out 
curl in damp weather
so does mine lucy said her mother
 it is not peculiar to your hair to
go out curl in damp weather
 but lucy what do you mean by your
hair going out curl said her father
just what you see papa that it hangs
straight
 you told me the moisture the morning
uncurled it do you know how or why
it does so said her father
no papa not in the least i wish
you would tell me
 when your hair is curled the parts
 one side each hair are pressed close
together and the parts on the other side
are stretched out give me that piece 
packthread
it was loosely twisted he coiled up
a bit it and showed her that in the
inner circle the parts are pressed together
and in the outer they are stretched
now i see said lucy and you
mean that it is just the same with my
hair when i curl it but still i do not
understand how the damp straightens it
that you shall see directly said her
father and he dipped the curled packthread
into a cup water when it was
all wet it became straight
yes it has uncurled like my hair
said lucy but how 
look and you will see that the water
has filled all the interstices or vacancies
which you observed between the different
parts the cord now there are in your
hair and in all hair pores or small vacancies
which can be filled with moisture
like the interstices in this packthread and
which imbibe moisture from the air as
this packthread imbibed the water and
you see it filled the pores on the inside
as well as on the outside
thank you papa said lucy that
is very nice to know why my hair uncurls
is at least a comfort now i understand
it all
not all said her father there is
a property hair which you do not yet
know that when it is wet that is when
its pores are filled with moisture 
 i see papa you mean it swells out
and becomes thicker like this cord
not exactly like that cord lucy that
cord shortens as it swells out in breadth 
but hair lengthens when it is moist all
human hair is easily affected by moisture
very easily indeed said lucy dividing
her uncurled locks on her forehead
and trying to put them out her way
i was not in the damp above ten minutes
and yet you see how straight my
hair has become indeed papa as you
say human hair is very easily affected by
moisture
yes fortunately said harry
fortunately repeated lucy unfortunately
you mean why do you say
fortunately 
i have a reason and a good one
said harry it is fortunate that hair has
that property for one reason for one
purpose useful to all men and women but
especially to men science
fortunate and useful said lucy
brother how can it possibly be fortunate
or useful to you or to men 
science in particular or to any body that
my hair should so easily go out curl in
damp weather
not your hair in particular lucy
but hair in general said harry
what use said lucy if everybody's
hair in the whole world was to
go out curl like this every damp day 
what use could it be but to make them all
look very deplorable as mamma says i
do when my hair is in this condition
what good would this do to men 
science or any men
 you do not understand me said
harry smiling did you never hear 
an hygrometer
hygrometer said lucy eyes i
have often heard an hygrometer i
heard papa talking to you about hygrometers
very lately and reading a great deal
last wednesday no last thursday
 no matter my dear interrupted her
father what day you heard me reading
about it do you know or do you not
know what an hygrometer is
lucy confessed she did not know
exactly what it was but she thought it
had something to do with a barometer
and a thermometer because it ends in
meter and she remembered long ago
her father had told her that meter meant
measure and comes from some greek
word that means to measure therefore
she supposed an hygrometer must be a
machine or an instrument for measuring
something but what she did not know 
she guessed it was something about the
air
her father said that she was so far
right in thinking that it is an instrument
used to measure something he told her
that it measures moisture in the air and
that the name hygrometer is composed 
two greek words hugros moist or moisture
and matron measure
lucy liked this name which contains
as she observed the history the thing 
and now she knew this she thought she
could never forget it
their uncle had not yet come in to
breakfast and their father beginning to
read the newspaper to their mother
harry and lucy went on at the farther
 the room talking to each other
now you can guess said harry
why i said that it was very lucky that
your hair uncurls so easily in the damp
you observed yourself that you could
always know by your hair whether it is
a damp day or not whether air is moist
or not
so hair is an hygrometer said lucy
 for it measures moisture i am sure my
hair might say if it could speak greek
hygrometer or in plain english inoist
i measures
very true said harry but still
you do not know the measure exactly 
how moist how damp the day may be 
do you 
yes on very very damp days my
hair comes quite out curl as you see
it now said lucy and hangs quite
straight but it only comes a little out
 curl on days that are only a little damp
or dampwish
a little damp dampish repeated
harry that is very well for
common talking but it does not describe
exactly how damp i do not know what
degree moisture you mean to express
by dampi
pish echoed lucy harry would
not smile
you have not yet told me lucy
said he gravely how the hygrometer
is made to show the measure moisture
exactly
i do not know exactly brother but
suppose for instance you knew how long
my hair is when it is quite dry then in
damp weather when it is moist and hangs
straight you could measure how long it
has grown i mean how much it has
lengthened by the damp
i could measure said harry but
how 
you could see whether my hair comes
down as far as to my eyebrows or only
this far or this far said lucy touching
different points on her forehead if i
had a lookingglass i would measure this
for myself
this might do said harry but at
best it would do only for yourself and
but badly for yourself because you must
to mark your points have disagreeable
spots on your forehead always
 should not like that said lucy
nor would mamma i am sure
besides continued harry it
would be rather inconvenient to me to
run in search you with a pair 
compasses and my ruler to measure your
hair and your scale on your forehead
this would be rather an inconvenient
hygrometer
rather i acknowledge said lucy
you would twitch all the hair off my
head too in measuring each hair i suppose
 and i should be afraid that you
would put out my eyes with the points
 your compasses when you came to
measure the scale on my forehead i
should not like to be your hygrometer
i would much rather have one that
would always stand or hang in my room
said harry or one that i could carry
about in my pocket better still could
you manage that for me could you
find out how to do that i found out
how to do it
did you indeed brother and do you
think i can
yes if you think well and if you
go on thinking said harry
 i will then but tell me exactly what
i am to think about and what is to be
done said lucy
harry pulled a hair out his own
head and laid it on a piece white
paper before her there said he
stretching it out you see its length we
will suppose this hair is as dry as it can
be now i will dip it into this bason 
water now that it has been wet it is
longer than it was when it was dry
yes but we want to know how much
longer said lucy well it is easy to
lay it on this sheet paper and measure
as exactly as you please how much
longer it is when it is wet than it was
when it was quite dry
very well said harry and i can
tell you that you would find it to be one
fortieth its length longer then you
have the utmost lenoth between extreme
moisture and extreme dryness
and continued lucy i could
divide this line on the paper between the
two black dots by which you marked the
points to which it stretched when it was
dry and when it was damp and if divided
exactly it would be what you calla
scale you could measure how much
in different degrees damp or dry it
stretches or shortens
very well indeed said harry and
the scale on paper would be better than on
your forehead you see that's one point
fixed
that's one point gained said lucy
now what is to be done next
next you are to find out how without
the trouble continually plucking
hairs out my head or yours and wetting
or drying and measuring them you might
know every day or hour or at any time
you please how damp the air is or how
much moisture it contains
 if i could but make the hair measure
itself said lucy and mark or show
how far it shrinks or lengthens on this
paper in any time
aye if you could said harry that
is the question
suppose i had a very very very little
weight said lucy so little that this
hair could support it without breaking
then i could tie it to one the hair
and hang the hair by the other to
something suppose a piece wire stuck
into the wall and i would put this paper
vol d
with our scale upon it against the wall
just behind the weight and when you look
at it you would see how much the hair
had shrunk or lengthened at any time in
damp or dry
there papa cried harry lucy
has made out as far as i did the first
time i thought making an hygrometer 
lucy looked much pleased with herself
and with her brother for being pleased with
her
and have i really invented an hygrometer
harry cried she
yes but not a perfect one my dear
said harry there is a great deal more
to be done
what more said lucy 
to come to breakfast in the first place
said her father
this lucy was ready to do for she was
a little tired but by the time she had
refreshed herself by eating half her breakfast
she returned to the question 
what more is to be done brother about
the hygrometer 
to make it more convenient said
harry in your way it must always be
stuck up against a wall and besides
your divisions are so very very small
that you can hardly see how much the
hair lengthens or shortens
you might take a magnifying glass
said lucy
well that would help but cannot
you think another way 
lucy thought for a little while and went
on eating her breakfast and presently answered
 no brother i can think only
 taking a larger magnifying glass a glass
that magnifies more will that do
still there is an easier method put
the magnifying glass out your head
it must be a more difficult instead 
an easier way for i cannot find it out
said lucy
but it is easier i assure you when
you have found it out said harry
come i will help you a little continued
he after she had considered for
some time look at the hand that
d 
 
clock and he pointed to the dialplate 
a pendule which was on the chimneypiece
opposite to the breakfasttable
look the hand now points at ten do
you see how far it is from ten to eleven 
suppose that hand was to move frol
ten to eleven 
well suppose said lucy i can
easily suppose this
 then which would have moved the
farthest which would have gone over the
most space the point the hand which
is at the outside the dialplate or that
part the hand which is closest to the
centre 
the point the hand which is at the
outermost part the circle would have
gone the farthest i mean would have
moved over the most space the part
nearest to the centre would have moved
so little that i suppose i should hardly
be able to see or measure by my eye how
much
 true said harry you could not
but you could see and you could measure
the space from ten to eleven easily could
not you
certainly said lucy
you could guess the measure even by
your eye without taking compasses or
magnifying glass said harry
 now i see what you are about said
lucy i must have a little beetle hand
and dial plate for my hygrometer to
show and to measure the least motion 
the hair in shortening or lengthening
right said harry so far right
do not tell me any more said lucy 
i can do it all for myself now and in a
minute
do not be in such a hurry my dear
said harry or you will never do it
hurry i am not in the least hurry
said lucy only i like to be quick
well i would fasten the the hair to
the axle so as to make every the smallest
motion the hair move the hand
she paused she was not quite clear
 the manner in which this was to be
done
i will help you said harry suppose
 
suppose said his mother that you
were to let lucy finish her breakfast
i will and welcome said harry 
for now she has the principle an hygrometer
which papa was explaining tome
the other day and which i will
show her a plate after breakfast
plate said lucy i may as well
have the plate at breakfast may not i 
by a plate i mean an engraving
said harry did not you know that 
oh yes to be sure said lucy 
i was only in play
breakfast finished harry went to the
library to look for the and lucy
followed eager to see the drawing and
description what she had been trying
to invent he showed her in trees's cyclopedia
two engravings different hygrometers

this said he pointing to one was
invented by a great english engineer 
the name smeaton and this other by
monsieur de saussure the famous swiss
traveller yours lucy my dear is not
exactly either these it is most like
smeaton's but he uses a cord with a
weight hung to it instead a hair it
is said however that a hair is better thana
cord for our purpose
and how does the other man m de
saussure manage with the hair said
lucy
harry pointed to the engraving and
showed her that one the hair is
fastened as she had proposed to the axle
 the hand and the hair wound round
the axle but the other instead 
having a weight hung to it is strained
tight and fastened to a frame wood
below then when the hair shortens or
lengthens with dryness oi moisture it
turns the axle the hand a lite or much
according to the shortening the hair
turns the axle the hand repeated
lucy i see it would turn when the
hair shortens because that would pull it
round but i do not see how when the
hair lengthens that it would turn back the
axle and the hand i think that the hair
would only loosen round the axle
true lucy and accurate cried harry
with pleasure in his eyes but look
again at this engraving see here a weight
hanging to this little cord which is wound
round the axle in a contrary direction to
the hair the weight is just enough to
keep the hair constantly strained so as to
prevent it from loosening as you rightly
said it would round the axle if there was
not any thing to prevent it when the hair
lengthens from moisture then as it
is kept stretched it turns the axle and
hand
yes now i see no difficulty said
lucy i understand it quite and i am
glad i told you the difficulty for you
have cleared it away i hate to feel that
i have only half understood and to leave
off in a puzzle but harry here are
prints a great many more hygrometers
yes made different substances
said harry many things beside hair
you know can be used to show the
changes moisture and dryness all
things which show these easily some 
them we have observed ourselves often
oh yes said lucy salt and sugar
for instance and some kinds wood
which warp with the changes the weather
from wet to dry the wood this
window frame i remember was swelled
so much during the rain last week that
we could not open the sash
yes that sash is made deal the
wood fir tree you know said harry
and this sort wood shrinks and expands
quickly with dryness and moisture
i recollect interrupted lucy i
read something about a creeping wooden
hygrometer in the notes to the botanic
garden my dear i remember it perfectly
because it was entertaining there was a
wooden automaton a machine that moved
 itself
i know no such machine inter

rusted harry if it moved it must have
been moved by some cause
 well the damp i suppose was the
cause now let me go on harry it was
a wooden automaton with a long back
and four feet with ironpointed shoes
which clawed on little by little so that it
walked or crept or clawed quite across
the floor its master's room in a month's
time from the changes damp and dry
i do not know how but it was very entertaining
and it will entertain me now much
more if you can show me how it was contrived
there was i remember something
about pflueino the bits wood that
made the back i do not rightly know
how said lucy crossways
crossgrain i suppose you mean
said harry we will look for it by and
by and i will try if i can understand and
explain it to you but now go on and
guess some other substances which hygrometers
are made
 i do not recollect any more help mea
little said lucy
harry pointed to his mother's harp
i see mamma's harp said lucy but
that only puts me in mind the last tune
she played
do not you recollect that a string
broke yesterday
yes i do and how troublesome it
was said lucy i remember that
mrs 
 stay now do not go to mrs anybody
but think the cause that string
breaking
mamma said that it was cracked bv
the sudden change the weather
what change 
 from dry to damp i believe said
lucy oh now i understand it and i
know what you mean in damp weather
the moisture from the air gets into the
strings and swells them out and so shortens
them that if they are held tight at each
 they crack those strings are made
 catgut catgut then would be a good
thing for an hygrometer
yes said harry but now i will
tell you another thing used for hygrometers
which i do not think you could guess
ivory
ivory no i never should have thought
 that said lucy i never knew that
ivory lengthens and shortens in damp or
dry weather
 it does though said harry there
are a great many pores in ivory we cannot
see them without a magnifying glass but
the moisture gets into these pores and
swells it out but now lucy there is another
common thing which you see everyday
which you might guess when you
dip it in water you may see its great pores
swelling without any magnifying glass
and then when you squeeze the water out
and dry it it shrinks so that you could
hold in your shut hand what when full
 water was as large as my head
a spunge a spunge cried lucy
but if a spunge is left in a room by
itself would it suck up water from the
air
yes whether it is left in a room by
itself or not said harry it will absorb
do not say suck up moisture from the air 
and it grows heavier when it is filling
moisture or lighter as it dries the
spunge hygrometer is measured or measures
by weight not by lengthening or
shortening expanding or contracting
you do not look as if you understand
this lucy
i do said lucy but i am growing
tired i think i have had enough
about hygrometers
no no you cannot be tired so soon 
 guess once more said harry you
may easily guess this because it is a thing
used in your dress
lucy had observed she said that her
gloves often grew damp in wet weather
she guessed leather it was not what
harry meant but he said that he thought
leather would do and he did not know
why it had not been used perhaps as it
takes in moisture so easily it may not expand
or contract equally
encouraged by harry's approbation 
her good guess leather lucy was willing
to try and guess again but help mes
said she
harry told her that the thing he meant
is stiff and yet not so stiff but that it can
be bent it is springy and elastic
she thought several things which can
be bent but she could not guess right
and then yawning and stretching herself
she repeated that she was tired and that
she could not guess any more harry
must tell her
then i will tell you whalebone my
dear come have done yawning said
harry i will not make you guess anymore
 now i will show you something
entertaining i will show you a nice little
hygrometer made an arabian oats
beard
show it me said lucy stopping in
the midst a full stretch
 here in this print said harry
only a print i thought you had the
real beard said lucy
you might make an hygrometer yourself
i dare say a common english oat
beard said harry
well that i should like said lucy 
you were right after all harry when
you said it was lucky that my hair uncurled
so easily how odd it is harry
that i have been carrying all my life on
my head without ever thinking it till
this morning one the best hygrometers
 my having an hygrometer without
knowing it is like the man who talked
prose all his life without knowing it
i do not know what man you mean
said harry come now look at it this
arabian oat hygrometer lucy it is the
great doctor hook's
 i do not care about the great doctor
hook said lucy but let me tell you
about the man who talked prose without
knowing it he was a man in a play a
very entertaining play papa was reading
one evening when you were not listening
there was a maidservant teachings her
old master his letters and asking him
what he does when he says the letter u
now you shall be the old man and i
will be the maid and i will teach you
say u
nonsense my dear said harry
not at all nonsense said lucy 
you may ask papa
well but i have not time now said
harry
and the maid taught him to fence
continued lucy if i had but a stick i
would show you
now your head is gone quite off to
the play i shall have no more good 
you said harry looking mournfully
but here comes my uncle continued
he as his uncle at this moment entered
the room uncle will you look at this
hygrometer for me
i will harry with pleasure said his
obliging uncle
and so will i harry said lucy to
oblige you my head is come back from
the play now
for about three minutes she was attentive
and she understood and admired to
harry's hearts content the arabian oat
hygrometer
then now lucy i will show you a
much better cried harry one which is
made a kind indian grass which grass
is extremely sensible
extremely sensible grass interrupted
lucy laughing uncle i never heard
 extremely sensible grass before did
you
i think iou are not extremely sensible
now my little niece said her uncle to
begin punning instead minding what
your brother is telling you surely you
know that sensible means sensitive that is
having quick or great sensibility you
know these words are applied to plants
for you have heard the sensitive plant
oh yes to be sure uncle said
lucy i was only playing i know the
two meanings the word sensible as well
as any body and i have not only heard
 the sensitive plant but seen it at aunt
pierrepoint's and not only seen it and
its leaves closing up and shrinking back
from my touch but what is more uncle i
have learned by heart dr darwin's lines on
the sensitive plant the mimosa
she repeated them and her uncle said
that they were pretty lines and that she
repeated them well
and would not they make a good
motto for an hygrometer uncle said
she
 very good said her uncle 
and now resumed harry let me
show you this hygrometer
one other motto my dear uncle i
have thought for the barometer continued
lucy without considering how
much she was trying her brother's patience
she went on repeating while she
held her uncle by the flap his coat
you charmed indulgent sylphs their learned toil
and crown'd with fame your torricel and boyle
a torricel cried harry i suppose
you mean torricelli
 no it is torricel in the lines i assure
you said lucy
 it is torricelli out the lines i assure
you said harry there never was
such a man as torricel was there uncle
their uncle whispered to lucy that
harry was right
well never miid it must be torricel
here for the sake the line said lucy
else it would be too long let me oro
on i will tell you what the indulgent
sylphs taught these people she went
on repeating
 beautiful lines lucy said her uncle 
but i am sure you cannot understand
them as you are not yet acquainted with
the air pump
but harry is said lucy and he will
explain it to me will not you harry
harry looked very serious sighed and
said nothing
why do you sigh harry
because said her uncle he is afraid
that he shall never be able to make you
understand the air pump or any thing
else if you are not more attentive
harry i beg your pardon said lucy
but you know i was very attentive at
first
and will be very attentive at last i
hope said her uncle come we will
both be serious added he sitting down
at the table and drawing lucy towards
him he seated her on half his chair put
one arm round her and leaned his other
on the table in an attitude attention
now harry explain your hygrometer
and spare the remains that poor pen
but lucy looks tired said harry
have you a mind to see the hygrometer
or not 
i have a little mind said lucy that
is i have a great mind to please you
brother only we need not go through
them all said she as he placed the plates
before her
no do not be frightened said harry 
i am not going to show them all to you 
i am going to show you only the very
best
stay said his uncle putting his handover
the engraving to which harry was
pointing do not show her that show
her any other she must not yet see that
why not i wonder why said lucy
i have a reason said her uncle
but never mind or think about that
which i hide under my hand my dear
attend to what your brother is going to
show you
which shall i show her uncle said
harry shall i show her de luc's ivory
or whalebone hygrometer
the whalebone for that is the most
simple i think replied his uncle
harry with the article hygrometer before
him began 
look here lucy do you see little 
and little b this represents a small thin
bit whalebone cut across the grain you
know what is meant by the grain the
whalebone but do you see little a and
little
no lucy instead looking at little
a b was peeping at the back the
page and reading something about a little
man and a little woman and a weatherglass

here is something very entertaining
brother said she i must read it to you
 in the dutch toys called weather glasses
one the index supports a small
image a man and the other a woman
the former appears or is brought out in
bad weather the latter in fair weather
i remember said lucy that once
at our widow green's farm i saw a weather
glass this sort but i was not then
wise enough to know that it was called
an hygrometer
there is no great wisdom in knowing
that names said her uncle
 i wish you would show me how to
make this thing brother said lucy that
would be something indeed
i can answered harry and i will
another day lucy but i can show you
but one thing at a time now pray mind
what you are about because i have other
things to do
yes lucy consider your brother's
time said her uncle he wants to goto
his own affairs pray mind what you
are about
i will i will indeed uncle i will
harry cried lucy
harry began again with
little z is a thin piece whalebone
cut across the grain he was
going on with his explanation and went
through c d and e confident that lucy
was following him but by that time he
heard the sound an illsuppressed laugh
and looking up he saw lucy with both
her hands pressed against her mouth to
prevent her laughter from bursting forth
what can you be laughing at lucy
said he
only at the odd figures the little
old man and woman in the weather glass
which i never can think without laughing
 the woman with her cap and red
ribbons all awry and her eyes crooked
too and her arm akimbo and her pipe in
her mouth doubled back against her snub
nose flattening it this way look harry
look uncle 
her uncle instead joining in lucy's
merriment said gravely that she was wrong
to waste her brother's time and that he
was afraid she would never learn any thing
 science if she were not more attentive
her mother came into the room while
her uncle was speaking and lucy looked
ashamed and mortified writhing as if with
bodily pain she said i did attend as
long as ever i could but i could not any
longer i was so shockingly tired
it was my fault said harry i
kept you too long and told you too much
at a time but i did that because you told
me you wanted to get on and to learn all
i had learned as quickly as possible
that is true said lucy i was
wrong there i confess
and since we are all confessing said
her uncle i suppose i should confess i
was wrong in praising you lucy for repeating
those lines
 yes indeed my dear uncle i think
you were said lucy for that encouraged
me to repeat more though i knew
my brother did not like that i should
 i was wrong i suppose not to like
it said harry but i will try to like
poetry better
and i will not repeat it at the wrong
time said lucy but harry another
day you must not tell me such a quantity
and keep me so long at it
 i will not said harry i know it
was wrong but i was so eager and happy
myself and besides you said you wanted
to get on fast
well but will be content to go a
little slower and not to do so much at
once
 right my dear lucy said her uncle 
the only way to be quick at last in
science at least is to be content to go
slowly at first
you may remember lucy said her
mother that was the way you began in
arithmetic you used to tell me every day
vol i e
mamma this is very slow work but
now you can go on with it quickly
a great deal more quickly than i can
i am sure said harry
well harry i will be as slow as you
please in scientific things said lucy
and i will never tire you again so
sadly said harry if i can help it
i will never be tired again said lucy
if i can help it
 if i can help it repeated their mother
 is a wise and safe addition
the next day harry and lucy having
finished their morning's business were
anxious to return to the hygrometer and
to try their resolution mutual forbearance
but they had taken no exercise
this day their uncle advised them to
run out to their gardens and divert themselves
for an hour or two
remember said he aesop's good
old fable and excellent principle unbending
the bow
t
j
yes said lucy the strings mamma's
harp never crack when she remembers
to let them down to loosen them in
time
after having refreshed themselves ban
hour that voluntary hard bodily
work which children all aoes aoree
to call play and after they had rested and
cooled themselves while they gathered a
basket full their own strawberries 
which course they ate a proper proportion
to determine whether they were or
were not ripe they returned to the house
intending to offer these their first strawberries
to their uncle but not in the
library nor in the breakfast room senor
up the lawn nor at the wood was he 
and it was concluded that he was gone
home to his own house which was about
a quarter a mile's walk from theirs
we had better run after him with our
basket said lucy
no he will come back before dinner
i am sure said harry for mamma said
he was to dine here and there is his great
e 
coat still in the hall now let us go to the
hygrometer
lucy set down her basket strawberries
at the farthest the room
lest the smell should disturb her and
harry took down and opened his large
volume but their hands were in no condition
to touch delicate engravings his
were brown with garden mould and hers
pink with the juice strawberries the
dressing bell had rung and their mother
strongly advised their dressing before they
began to read
this advice to dress firsts and then you
are ready to do whatever you please afterwards
so often given by age to youth
and so seldom taken or well taken was
in this instance acted upon instantly without
one murmur the tongue or one
writhing the body
in all the selfcomplacency and safety
 being ready half an hour before dinner
time they met again in the library where
they found their uncle
oh uncle i am glad you are heres
cried lucy and after presenting to him
their strawberries they went to their 
harry asked whether he should go on
with old whakhojie or not
go on with old whalebone said his
uncle lucy should not leave that
without understandings it not that it signifies
whether she understands that particular
thing or not but this will be a trial
 her attention
i well be very attentive said lucy
but observing that her uncle placed
his arm as before so as to cover one 
the hygrometers in the engraving her curiosity
a little disturbed her her uncle
remarking the turn her eye said
 i advise you lucy to repress your
curiosity do not think what is under
my elbow but what sour brother is
showing you
lucy repressed her curiosity and commanded
her attention harry explained
slowly and she followed step by step
patiently undisturbed by the fear being
too slow or the hope showing that lie
was very quick and without one glance
at her uncle's arm or one thought 
what might be his reason for keeping it
in that position she went regularly through
the a h c r de luc's whalebone hygrometer
and understood it to her own
and to her brother's complete satisfaction
her uncle was as he said glad to perceive
that lucy had so far kept her resolution
 and he told her that if she steadily
went on in the same manner she would
find it in time easy to do what she now
felt so difficult to fix her attention
and now said he removing his arm
from the print you shall know my
reason for covering this and i will show
you what i went home for
he took from his pocket and placed
between harry and lucy a small cylindrical
case about three inches high
covered with morocco leather
 it is like the case mamma's opera
glass cried lucy is there an opera
glass in it
 no harry smiled for he knew what
was in it immediately le knew that it
was his favourite hygrometer his uncle
took it out the case and placed it beside
the engraving which he had covered
with his arm telling lucy that he had
wished only to delay showing her the
engraving till she could compare it with
the original which he had walked home
to bring for them it was so simple that
upon looking at it and examining the
plate lucy understood it directly it is
composed a kind indian grass
which like the beard the arabian and
 the english oat twists and untwists
with dryness or moisture but in a much
greater degree making it is said from
ten to sixteen revolutions from the extreme
 moisture to the extreme dryness
harry told lucy that in the
description which he had read this
hygrometer it is said that it shows more
easily and quickly than any other the
changes moisture in the atmosphere
 it is so sensible continued harry
as to be affected by the shutting and
opening a door or window and is
sure to feel the approach any person
and to indicate it by the motion its
hands
let us try now if it will indicate my
approach said lucy
as she approached the hands began
to move and when as her brother bid
her she took it up and held it nearer to
her the motion increased and when ashe
desired she breathed through the holes
in the sides one hand affected by her
breath seemed to fly round the circle
while the other numbered the revolutions
lucy was pleased full as much even asher
brother could expect she stood
watching its quick variations as she
breathed upon it or withdrew her breath
but brother said she did not
you tell me that this has been but lately
invented how comes that why did
not people think it before was not
the grass always there wherever this was
found in india
i suppose it was said harry but
nobody had observed it aw i know
about it is that in trees's cyclopedia it
says that this kind grass was discovered
in india about the year i
think was not it uncle by captain
eater who was employed in making
some survey or some observations and
who wanted a very accurate hygrometer
to measure the smallest quantities 
moisture and he tried this grass and
found it succeed and found that it lasts
better and is more sensible than the english
oat
accurately remembered harry said
his uncle but pray does the cyclopedia
tell you how it happened that captain
eater took notice this grass 
no uncle said harry how was
itr
he told a friend mine that one
evenings as he was walking without boots
in that grass he was annoyed by its frequent
catching in his stockings and when
he took them off at night he found them
full this grass which had twisted itself
e 
into them when he pulled it out he
observed it particularly then his attention
being fixed he remarked the sensibility
 this grass to moisture and he
thought using it for his scientific purposes
as an hygrometer
 how very lucky that it plagued him
that day said lucy by sticking in his
stockings
how well it was that he observed its
properties when he took it out said
harry and that he thought applying
it to some good use i am afraid i
should have thrown it away without observing
it at night particularly i might
have been sleepy and tired and then
uncle the world would never have had
this nice little convenient instrument
 would you harry and would you
lucy said their uncle like to have this
nice little convenient instrument for your
own
their eyes brightening with pleasure
they answered that they should like it
very much
then it is yours my dears said their
uncle i give it you in the hope that it
will teach you accuracy and patience
they said that they would try to keep
a register it regularly but lucy added
that if it was only to teach her patience
she should not like it so well as if she
thought it would be also some use to
her uncle or for some other purpose
her uncle assured her that it would
be useful to him he said that he had
two friends one living in ireland the
other in america they wished to keep
a register the damp or dryness the
atmosphere in those countries to be compared
with england
 then cried lucy we will keep
the register for england with pleasure 
that will be something grand and worth
while
 but said her uncle if you attempt
this it must be done with accuracy
or it will be no use remember
i tell you it will be a trial 
your patience do not begin it unless
you think you can keep it regularly for
six months
half a year said lucy that is a
very long time harry however was
not afraid to undertake it because he
had tried and had kept a register a
barometer for a whole year he said
his register was not neat though it was
accurate his figures were too large and
straggling often out their proper columns
 but now he could use lucy as
his secretary and she could make nice
even figures
their uncle wrote for them some necessary
directions he said that it would
be requisite to do every time they registered
their hygrometer a sum in division
 a certain large number figures
this did not alarm lucy for she was
expert in division and she rejoiced that
she should be able to do this sum readily
for her brother and that she should be
wanted and useful every day or may be
twice a day they were eager to show
their hygrometer to their father but he
had gone from home for a few days
it was settled that the first thing they
should do every morning their lives
must be to examine and write down their
hygrometer registry harry was always
to xad off and lucy to write down
whoever has tried to keep a daily register
or to do any thing regularly everyday
and at a certain hour must know
that it is not a very easy task and where
two persons are concerned the difficulty
is more than doubled with the chances
 one or the other failing in punctuality
and quarrelling about whose fault it might
be harry and lucy therefore by the
experienced and the candid will be allowed
some credit for keeping their register
accurately every day for a month
without having complained each other
lucy repeated that she was very glad it
was to be some great use to her uncle
at the the time for that without
this motive and the pleasure helping
her brother and making nice figures
for him she confessed that she should not
have patience to go on with it
thank you again and again mamma
for allowing me to learn with harry as i
used to do i am much happier already
but mamma if i knew ever so much if
harry was not fond me and i him
we could not be really happy could we
do you think mamma
in truth my dear child i do not think
you could said her mother
 i am sure quite sure we could not
continued lucy suppose i knew all
the histories and all the poems and all
the stories in the whole world and that i
could draw and play on the pianoforte
and dance better than any body in the
universe i am sure mother i could never
be happy unless i loved my brother and
he loved me nor could he be happy
even if he knew all the scientific dialogues
and all the mechanics and hydrostatics
and optics 
 but oh cried lucy interrupting
herself in this enumeration the ics
 there is papa come home i could not
think mamma what made you start up so
quickly in the middle my optics
lucy had too much discretion to produce
their hygrometer the very moment her father
came home she waited till he had
finished what he was saying to her mother
 comprehending that this might be
 more consequence to him and more
interesting than even their new possession
and their new arrangements as
soon however as he had leisure to attend
to her when he turned to lucy and holding
out his hand to her said have you
any thing new to tell me my little girl 
she answered eagerly yes papa a great
deal he made room for her on one side
 him and for harry on the other and
then they showed him their hygrometer 
and lucy told him how much she wished
to understand what her brother had been
learning the preceding years and she told
him harry's intention to bring her up to
him in science she promising to go as
slowly and he as fast as he could and to
tire her as little as possible her father
was glad that harry had learned by his
first attempt that he should not on any
subject tell all he knew to his sister at
once nor expect that she could at once
take as great an interest as he did on subjects
 which she was ignorant particularly
when she had to endure all the labour
and mortification which a beginner must
go through before learning any new
science can be easy or entertaining his
father advised harry not to attempt to
describe all the small parts and detail 
machines not to go over all the a b cs
 descriptions in engravings which however
requisite for those who are to make
them would be unnecessary to lucy he
advised harry to try to give his sister a
clear knowledge the principles some
 the most useful inventions and discoveries
he promised to assist whenever
he came to any difficulty but he desired
him to try first how he could go on
by himself in explaining to his sister
and he repeated to lucy what her mother
and uncle had said to her about attention
he told her that whenever he
had attempted lately to teach her he had
observed that she did not attend as well
as formerly
i know it papa i try all lean but i
cannot i do not know how it is i cannot
said lucy every word that is said
seems as it were to awaken some other
words and every thing i see and hear
makes me recollect something else and
my thoughts are flying off backwards and
forwards and sideways and every way
while harry's can go on straight forward
always thinking what he is about or 
the very thing that is said to him i used
to be able to do the same said lucy
sighing
 sigh no more lucy said her father
smiling no great harm is done your
habits attention have been spoiled and
your power attending is consequently
diminished but with your own good will
and good sense we shall soon set all this
to rights again your perceiving and reflecting
upon what passes in your own
mind will assist you very much
papa said lucy i know how it all
happened aunt pierrepoint did not think
it signified much whether i attended strictly
as my uncle says or not she said i was
quick enough and i will tell you papa
what made a great impression upon m
once i heard a gentleman talking about
genius and he said me that he wondered
how i learned every thing with so
little attention that i was always looking
about and listening to all that people said
and yet that i was so quick i am ashamed
papa to tell you any more said lucy
stopping
 you have said quite enough my dear
little girl to prove to me that you are not
quite a goose as long as any person is
ashamed being flattered there is hope
that they will learn to despise and dislike
flattery i give up only those who get
over the pain the shame and who then
like it shamelessly and swallow down more
and more it till at last they by being
fools to flattery without knowing their
wretched state
 i hope i shall never be in that wretched
state mamma said lucy with a look 
much apprehension harry will you take
care me 
and myself said harry
 well now to business said their
father what do you wish to learn
first lucy
she said that she wished to be made perfectly
acquainted with the air pump because
harry had reproached her with not
having understood that fine poetic description
 it which she had learned by
heart and repeated he said that to be
sure he could easily make her understand
his uncle's air pump because she already
knew the principle a common water
pump
do i said lucy smiling i did
not know that i knew it and here she
again thought the man who had talked
prose all his life without knowing it but
she refrained from making an allusion to
him though it was ready on her lips
harry recalled to her mind the experiments
which their father had shown them
two years ago
do not you remember aid he the
experiment he showed us with a roll 
tape that was put under a wine glass
which was turned down and plunged into
a bason water and then the tape was
pulled out and unrolled by degrees
lucy remembered all this
 and what happened said harry
when the tape was pulled from under the
glass 
lucy answered that the water rose
in the glass
 and why said harry
because when the tape was taken out
there was left in its place a vacancy a
vacuum you call it then the water which
was in the bason rose into that vacant
place
 and why did it rise pursued harry
 because it was pressed by the weight
 the air pressing on all the water in the
basin and it was forced up into the glass
where there was no air nothing to prevent
or resist it
very well now i am satisfied said
harry you remember it clearly
because i understood it clearly at ths
time it was first shown to me said lucy 
 my father was so patient and explained
it to me so slowly and clearly
well said harry you have proved
to me that you understand the first principle
on which pumps are made for all
depends on making a vacuum into which
the water rises or is raised the first
thing to be done is to make a vacuum
now lucy in a common pump such
as there is in the yard for pumping up
water where do you think the vacuum
must be before the water can rise 
lucy said she supposed that it must be
in the inside the body or tube the
pump
yes we call it the bore said harry
now tell me how you would make a
vacuum within it
oh my dear harry that is too difficult
a question for me said lucy how
can i tell how to make a vacuum in the
byre as you call it a great pump 
where is the difficulty said harry
 do not be frightened by the word bore 
or if you are alarmed by the idea a great
pump suppose a little one as small as you
please as small suppose as the glass tube
 the barometer
 that would be easy to suppose but
could there be so small a pump said
lucy
to be sure as well as the largest
size only it would raise less water but
now go on straight forward lucy my
dear do not ask me any your starting
off questions you must let me ask you
questions and you are to answer 
if i can said lucy
you can i assure yon my dear said
harry in his most persuasive tone if you
will only believe that you can and keep
steady i ask you how you would make a
vacuum in this tube
 let me consider let me recollect
what did my father do when he made a
vacuum in the wine glass said lucy to
herself he put in a roll tape which
filled up the whole glass and then drew
it out little by little so as not to let any
air into the glass while he was pulling it
out again but i cannot get a roll tape
into the small tube said lucy
no not a roll tape said harry 
but if you consider what was the purpose
or use putting the roll tape into
the glass and drawing it out again you
will perceive that putting in and drawing
out any thing else in the same manner
would do as well
the purpose was first to force the
air that was in the glass out it said
lucy and to prevent any more afterwards
from getting into the place which
the tape took up and which remained vacant
as it was drawn out leaving a vacuum
at last
 now you are coming on very well
lucy said harry
 if i can put in any thing any sort
into the little tube which forces the air
out and then if i could keep the air out
there would be a vacuum for you harry
very well you will now quite understand
a pump and you will soon know
how to use it lucy
as to that said lucy i know how
to pump already only i am not strong
enough
 stay stay lucy knowing how to
pull a handle up and down which i suppose
is all you mean is not understanding
what i mean by knowing what pumping
is or how it is done
 i have seen men and maids often
pumping at the pump in the yard said
lucy
what happens when they pump said
harry
 the water comes out the spout after
they have pumped a little while said lucy
what do you mean by pumping
persisted harry
i cannot tell you exactly harry because
i never saw the inside the pump
i only know that they move the handle up
and down and i believe there is something
fastened to it which i suppose
brings up the water but i do not know
how exactly
i believe not indeed said harry 
 then you see mrs quickquick you
did not understand what i meant by pumping
now come with me and i will
show you in my room the nice glass pump
which my father made for me you cannot
see into the inside the pump in the
yard but when once you have seen my
glass pump you will understand the inside
 all others
he showed her in the first place a glass
tube in which there was a spout near the
top the tube was open at the top and
at the bottom there was a little door or
vol i f
 
valve which opened upwards only he
poured water into this tube to shove her
that the water would rest upon this valve
without its letting any it through he
then emptied out the water now said
he you know there is nothing but air
in this tube look at this which is called
the piston a pump the piston was
a cylinder which fitted tight into the
tube at the top it there was a valve
like that at the bottom the tube which
also opened one way and that was upwards
harry pushed it up several times
with his finger to show lucy that it
opened easily and he made her feel that it
did so he then put the tube into a tub
 water the tube resting on two blocks 
wood which raised it from the bottom 
the tub so that there was room for the
water to flow in through the lowest valve
lucy as he desired held the glass tube
upright while he pushed down the piston
to which there was a long handle
now lucy what happens within 
side the tube said harry
nothing that i know said she
but that you have pressed the air in the
tube closer together
 very true do you see the valve at
the bottom is it shut or open
lucy said it was shut
and what keeps it shut 
the air that you are pressing down
upon it said lucy
he pressed the piston down farther
now look again said he and tell
me what happens 
 i see the little door at the top the
piston open said she
harry asked her what she thought had
opened it
the air said she underneath it
which i suppose you could not compress
any more and which has forced its way
up
he now drew up the piston and again
asked what happened lucy saw the
valve at the top the piston shut and she
saw the water rush through the valve at
the bottom the glass pump and rise in
f 
its tube and when harry again plunged
down the piston the water came through
the valve in the piston and when he drew
it up again it carried up all the water to
the top the tube where it flowed out
 the spout
just as it does in the great real pump
said lucy
and now you do know what i mean
by pumping said harry
he pumped on for some time and then
let her take the handle and work for herself
he questioned her and made her
repeat her explanation till he was satisfied
and she was satisfied that she clearly
understood that the thing to be done in
pumping and by pumping is to force the
air out a certain space to produce a vacancy
or vacuum into which the ester
rushes and rises or rather said harry
to speak more accurately is pressed and
supported by the surrounding air and
water perhaps i ought to tell you that
there is no perfect vacuum but i will not
be too exact with you at first lest i should
tire you therefore i will not tell you all
the differences between a lifting pump
and a sucking pump and a forcing pump 
besides i am not sure that i know them
all myself i weill not tell you even about
water always finding its own level
i am very much obliged to you said
lucy
nor will i tell you continued harry
about the weight the column water
which a certain quantity air can sustain

 i think i do know something about
that said lucy or i did know it once
however thank you for not telling me too
much at a time especially about all the
different pumps you talked leave my
head quite clear with the vacuum that
i understand now and the use which is
made it and i understand all that happens
when the piston the pump is pulled
up and pushed down
 and now that you know said harry
what pumping is i will ask mamma tolet
us go to the great pump in the yard
that you may see lucy the same sort 
thing in large that you have seen in
small
their mother went with them to look at
the pump in the yard the handle was
so high that harry could not well manage
to use it but his mother called for one 
the servants who pumped for them
the servant filled a tub with the water
which he had pumped up and as he
lifted it to carry it away he said that he
and all the servants in the house were very
glad that the pump which had been out
 order was now well repaired because
it had been great labour to them to go to
the windlasswell in the garden for water
whenever it was wanted and to bring
heavy tubs it many times aday this
observation made lucy the more sensible
as she said the great convenience a
pump
this is a really and truly useful machine
continued she useful to great
great numbers people for the commonest
business that must be done everyday
and almost every hour and it is as
easy for ignorant people to use as for the
most learned what an excellent contrivance
 how happy the man must have
been who made the first pump when he
found it would do and felt the water coming
and saw it pouring out at the spout 
 delightful said harry
now harry my dear tell me something
about the air pump
 no no my dear that would be too
much said harry looking very prudent
one pump aday is enough for you i
will keep the air pump till tomorrow
after all this wisdom what did they do
next how did harry and lucy spend
the remainder this morning two whole
hours
if we tell we shall not be believed except
by those who are themselves children
or by those who know children right welland
their sudden falls from the heights 
wisdom to the depths folly
harry and lucy spent all that remained
 this morning in pumping up through
the little glass pump the water a puddle
in harry's garden they could have ladled
it all out in three minutes and two moderate
sized tubs would have held it and
have carried it all away but this would
have been too obvious too easy a way 
going to work it must all pass through
the glass pump and so they worked on
till their backs ached and till the dirty puddle
water had so soaked into the leather 
the piston and so clogged the valve with
mud that it would move no more
during this pumping and draining 
the puddle many misadventures befel
harry's trowsers and lucy's clean frock 
clean no more it may be recorded for
the advantage little washerwomen who
with hands unskilled may unadvisedly
attempt to wash out fresh spots that the
more lucy tried to get rid hers the
more they appeared what seemed quite
out while it was wet came in again as
soon as it dried and the spots spread
into blotches with obstinate edges yellow
so that altogether the frock instead
 looking better for these operations was
worse than ever 
before it was half dry oh how unlucky
 before it had half dried after dip
and scrub the fifth the sound carriagewheels
was heard morning visitors
their garden was full in sight the
house up jumped harry upon what he
called his throne a heap stones from
whence he had a full view the carriage
it was one he had never seen before
lucy clambered after him to share the
exalted view from his throne and to assist
his judgment with her eyes and her imagination
a lady was getting out the
carriage lucy did not know who it was
she confessed but she imagined that it
must be a certain mrs hanbury who
owed her mother a visit
 i am sure it is mrs hanbury and i
dare say that her daughter is with her
therefore i will not go in for miss hanbury
is always very fine and i should not
like that she should see me in this frock
in this sad condition and oh harry
f
they must not see you in those trowsers
i will show you how mrs hanbury and
miss hanbury would look at us we will
not go in
go in upon no account said harry
as to my trowsers i do not care what
your fine miss hanbury or mrs hanbury
think or how they look at them or at me
but i hate going into a room where there
are strangers
harry observed however that notwithstanding
lucy's certainty that the visitors
were mrs and miss hanbury no girl got
out the carriage and there was a gentleman

how can that be said lucy for
there is no mr hanbury let them be
who they may we will not go in repeated
she
to this harry heartily assented he
disliked morning visitors particularly
 so do i so does every body said
lucy i hope they will not see us
from the house i hope mamma will not
send for us harry we had better sit up
in your observatory in the great sycamore
tree
come up then this instant cried
harry give me your hand and i will
pull you up
in harry's observatory in the great sycamore
tree they both sat snugly for sometime
till he saw through the branches
some people standing at the drawingroom
window that they might not be seen by
these people harry advised leaving the
observatory and removing a step higher
into what he called his dark attics where
the branches were so thick that he was
sure no morning visitors could see them
or think looking for them he had sat
there many a time he said while ladies
had passed under the tree chattering without
ever spying him scarcely however
had they mounted and safely lodged themselves
in the attics which to say the
truth were ill able to hold two lodgers at
a time when harry exclaimed
 it is all over with us there is mamma
herself at the window beckoning to us
but she cannot see us said lucy
certainly not said harry unless
she saw my white trowsers when i was
clambering up here into the attics
 white trowsers oh no i am sure
she did not said lucy
 but there she is said harry waving
her handkerchief lucy
 do not go do not go in for now i
have a green streak worse than all the
rest said lucy i am sure mamma
does not see us and i dare say she does not
want us really herself but perhaps mrs
hanbury asked for me and mamma just
beckoned
the signal was repeated at intervals
two or three times lucy had some doubts
but the fear mrs hanbury s seeing her
dirty gown prevailed the handkerchief
ceased to wave and they remained in
their tree nearly an hour a much longer
time than they had expected harry had
been resolute from the first and had no
wavering during this hour as he sat
quite at ease in his tree he said now
is a good time to think the puzzle my
uncle gave me about a three gallon a
five gallon and an eight gallon vessel
lucy interrupted him several times by
scrambling up and down to see if the carriage
vas gone or whether mamma waved
her handkerchief again at length having
succeeded in solving his problem he
held her fast by the gown insisting upon
her sitting still and thinking it which
as he assured her would make the time
appear to go much faster there was a
gentleman who had two haymakers one
hot day they worked very hard making hay
and when they had finished the hay rick
late in the evening the gentleman called
them to his hall door and said my
good men you must be very thirsty i will
give you some beer to drink here are
eight gallons for you but you must divide
this beer so that each you may have
exactly half and this you must do before
you drink a drop it
that was very easily done said
no
lucy each was to have four what
puzzle is there in this 
stay stay mrs quickquick you will
be puzzled yet before you have done
the gentleman had only three vessels in
his house it is said the first held eight
gallons the beer was in this the second
held five gallons and the third three gallons
and these two were empty now
manage it as you will lucy and with
these vessels divide the beer so that you
can prove to me that each man has four
gallons exactly you may pour the beer
backwards and forwards as often as you
please from one these vessels to another

lucy began and poured from one to
another in imagination for some time
without success pour how she would
there was at the her measures
always five gallons in the eight gallon
vessel and three in the five at last she
perceived how it could be done and
showed how she could prove to harry
ill
that she had divided it equally four
gallons harry in the eight gallon vessel
and four gallons in the five gallon
vessel
so completely had her attention been
absorbed by this puzzle that she had not
heard the sound the departing wheels
 the visitors carriage and when she
again peeped out their hiding place
they were surprised to see that the
carriage was qone
when they went in their mother told
them that she was sorry they had not
sooner made their appearance because
the lady and gentleman who had been
with her were remarkably agreeable people
and had told many things that were
entertaining and interesting
then mamma it was not mrs and
miss hanbury said lucy how very
provoking i am sorry mamma we have
missed hearing entertaining things who
were the people
sir rupert and lady digby friends
 your father's
i never lizard them before said
lucy
 very likely my dear
mamma what sort entertaining
things did they tell said lucy
they gave us an account a shipwreck
which happened lately on part 
the sea shore near the place where they
ive
 oh mamma tell it me cried
harry
 yes pray mamma said lucy
 first tell me did not you see me
beckoning and making signals to you to
come in my dears said their mother
 yes mamma we saw you said
harry but we thought that it would
be tiresome and we did not like to go
in i liked better to go on with what i
was about
his mother told harry that she would
not have beckoned to him unless she had
til ought it was worth his while to come
in and added she smiling you
must now abide by your own choice
for i will never tell you the shipwreck

 pray at least mamma tell it to
harry said lucy because it was all
my fault that we did not come in i
did not like to come because look at
my frock mamma
it is very much soiled indeed said
her mother
with the water from my puddle and
my glass pump mamma said harry 
 that was my fault
her mother asked lucy why she could
not put on another frock have not you
any other lucy 
yes mamma said lucy colouring
 i have but i could not put on any 
them because one is so short it comes
up to here and i forgot to let down the
tucks and another has a great tear in
it i intended to have given it to be
mended this morning and one sleeve is
half out the third mamma i tore it
last night as i was reaching down a 
from the uppermost shelf
her mother said that there must be no
more experiments any kind till lucy
should have these things mended
i know that is quite right mamma
said lucy i expected you would say
so i will go up to my room directly
and let down the tucks but mamma
while i am away could you be so
kind as to tell harry the story the
shipwreck 
i could said her mother smiling
but i will not in the first place i
should be sorry to tell it when you were
not present but i do not intend to tell
it to him at all for if i were to repeat
to him every thing entertaining which i
heard this morning he would depend
upon my doing the same another time
and he would not exert himself to conquer
that feeling bashfulness which
prevents his coming into a room where
there are strangers and which makes him
always say i would rather stay out
 the room and go on with my own
affairs 
now brother for the air pump cried
lucy as you used to say now papa
for the barometer
 my uncle said harry has been so
good as to lend me his portable air pump
to show you was not it good him to
lend it
very good indeed said lucy and
how convenient to have so many things
portable portable barometer portable hygrometer
portable air pump
now lucy recollect what was the
great thing to be done in pumping said
harry
was not it to make a vacuum said
lucy hesitating as if she was afraid 
making a mistake
yes to be sure my dear said harry
be quite certain about that
i am quite certain said she i was
only afraid to say it at first lest i should
not be riorht
but do not be afraid when you
know a thing know it very firmly the
truth cannot alter between yesterday and
to day nor can the truth ever alter you
know
that is a great comfort said lucy
 was not it boyle who invented the air
pump or was it torricelli 
neither said harry it was that
poetry you repeated which put that mistake
into your headand when once
one has got any thing wrong into one's
head there is no getting it out again
but you are partly right boyle improved
the airpump very much and it
is sometimes called the boileau vacuum
that is boyle's vacuum but boyle was
too honest a man to claim for his own
the first vacuum i mean the first making
use it for the air pump he knew
and always said it was otto garrick's
invention
 well i dare say it was said lucy 
you need not say any more about it
i do not care much who made the first
vacuum nor who first made use it for
the air pump
you do not lucy my dear consider
what you say suppose i had invented
the air pump or something as
great would you my sister like that
somebody else should take from me the
honour and glory the invention
no i should not said lucy but
you are my brother and alive and to be
sure i should be anxious that you were
not robbed the glory but those other
people mr otto guerick and mr boyle
are nothing to me besides they have
been dead and buried long ago and
what signifies it now to any body
 it signifies a great deal said harry
 suppose it was my father or my grandfather
or my great grandfather should
not i care would not you then so
would otto guerick's or boyle's children
or grandchildren or great grandchildren
if there are any living and there is a
great family boyle i know and do
you think that for the world they would
give up the boileau vacuui
i suppose not said lucy but
now let us go on to the air pump itself
and the vacuum let it be whose it will
so we will said harry but before
i show it to you remember that what
you are going to see is a pump for pumping
out air not for pumping up water so
put water quite out your head
 i have put water quite out my head
i understand that the air pump is to pump
out air but brother before you begin
let me say one thing
say it then if it is not poetry
no it is only that i think a pair 
bellows is a sort air pump hey
harry 
 well that is not foolish lucy you
may call a pair bellows a sort air
pump only that bellows never could be a
right air pump without two valves but
do not go on thinking them all the time
i am explaining to you now look at my
uncle's air pump you see this glass
continued harry and he pointed to a
lai'de glass bell which stood over a sort
 frame or stand lucy what do you
think is in this glass
air i suppose said lucy
 it is full air and nothing else
said harry the thing to be done is
to get all the air that is in the bell out
 it and that is to be done by means
 these pumps continued he pointing
to two tall cylinders brass which stood
upon the stand with the glass bell they
communicated at the bottom with a pipe
which opened into the bell there was
a handle by which as he told lucy she
could move the pistons these pumps up
and down
 just in the way in which the piston
moved up and down in the water pump
yesterday said she i see i see it
is all nearly the same thing only that
this pumps air out as you said and
the other water i understand it all perfectly

 stay stay mrs quickquick you do
not understand it all perfectly yet you
see only the likenesses but there are differences
which you do not see yet and
cannot my dear mrs quickquick because
it takes a great deal more time to
see the differences than to catch the likenesses
mrs quick 
she put her hand upon his mouth before
he could repeat the offensive words
brother do not call me mrs quickquick
and i will be as slow as you
please and i will not tell you any 
the likenesses i see i will be quite silent
and only nod my head when i understand
ever so perfectly
 then look at the air pump which is
before you said harry and observe
what i do i am going to move the
handle which you see at the top which
will raise up one the pistons what is
underneath the piston
nothing said lucy at first but
afterwards she added i believe there is
a vacuum
true and what happens directly
said harry
air comes in directly to fill it i suppose
said she
where does it come from said
harry
it must come from the bell through
this pipe said lucy which leads from
the bell to the bottoms the pumps
then when that happens there is
less air in the bell than there was before
is not there said harry now move
the piston down again and what happens

 you would press the air that is under
the piston back again up the pipe into the
bell said lucy if there is not a valve at
the bottom the pump that shuts against
it and prevents it from going back but
though i do not see it i suppose there is
such a valve because you told me that it
was necessary in all pumps
 you suppose rightly and you remember
very well said harry there
is such a valve and it prevents the air
from going back into the bell when i
vol i g
push the piston down but what becomes
 the air
 it comes out into the open air through
the valve in the piston i suppose
very true now i will move the
handle again and repeat the operation
i should have told you that we are assisted
in pumping by the expansive force
 the air
i do not understand that said lucy
yes you do my dear if you will only
recollect the experiments papa showed you
with a bladder said harry
ages ago said lucy
yes you remember seeing the bladder
swell out with the expansive force
 the air and you may recollect that
after blowing in air for some time when
we tried to force in more air we could
not the bladder swelled out so that we
could hardly hold its mouth together to
tie it
i remember it said lucy
 if we had let go the string said
harry and the mouth the bladder
had opened what would have happened

 the air would have forced its way
out said lucy
yes air you know will expand and
fill every empty place now i have
pumped out all the air that i can from
the bell and now that it is as empty as
we can make it we call it a vacuum
though very accurate people would tell
you lucy that it is not a perfect vacuum

it will do for me said lucy and
i think i understand the air pump really
now is there any other difference between
it and the water pump brother
you said there was a difference
i did say so and i will explain to
you what it is if you will answer my
questions patiently what was it in the
glass water pump that you saw yesterday
that pressed up the water into the vacuum
below the piston said harry
it was the outer air the weight 
g 
the outer air pressing upon the surface
 the water that was in the tub forced
the water up into the tube
true the same in all water pumps
said harry but here is no water for
it to press upon how then is this vacuum
filled 
by the weight or force the air
itself only i believe said she
 what air said harry
it must be the air in the bell said
she for i see no other but that is so
little that there cannot be weight enough
in that
no said he it is not by weight
that this pump acts but by the spring'wess
 the air itself this is the difference
which i wanted you to observe between
the air pump and water pumps
by the springiness the air said
lucy
yes said harry you felt the force
 that springiness in the bladder when it
was full air
lucy said she should like to feel it
acrain she had almost forgotten it harry
blew into a bladder and filled it with air
and when it was full bid her try to press it
together when she tried to do it she perceived
the sort resistance that it made
and she felt the force with which after she
had squeezed it it returned to its former
place and form
the same springiness said harry
 or what is called the elasticity the air
in the bell is what fills the vacuum below
the piston each time it is drawn up nowhere
is the description and plate it in
scientific dialogues and this is all that
you need know about it at present stay
i will just look at the print the air pump
in trees's cyclopedia and see if i have
left out any thing that i ought to tell you
as he opened the and as lucy
saw the engravings she looked a little
alarmed
there seem to be as many different
air pumps as hygrometers said she
sighing
 do not be afraid i am not going to
show them to you all said harry but
now that you know the general principle
you would soon feel it easy as i did to
understand them
 oh no said lucy there seem to
be such a number pipes and valves and
little as and s and p's and s
they only relate to the contrivances to
prevent the outer air from coming in while
we are pumping the air out the vessel
that is to be emptied which it is constantly
trying to do one pump is better than another
only as it does this most effectually
and most easily and as it more perfectly
empties or exhausts the vessel by the
bye i should tell you that this glass vessel
is called a receiver and when it is
emptied it is called an exhausted receiver
i was puzzled at first by those words exhausted
receiver
thank you harry for remembering
that for me
now my dear lucy you shall work a
little at the air pump yourself as you did
at the water pump yesterday
oh thank you thank you said she
joyfully there is nothing like working
oneself it fixes a thing so well in my
memory i remember the look and touch
 the things much better afterwards
while harry was placing the machine
so that it should be convenient to lucy
she turned to look at the engravings
that lay open on the table
 how well this air pump is done
said she it is very like my uncle's 
not quite perhaps i will take care to
mind about the differences
this is very like it said harry
there is no difference any consequence

if we had not had my uncle's said
lucy i think you could have made me
understand the air pump quite well from
this engraving that is after my having
seen the glass pump yesterday and its
valve and the piston but without that i
could not have understood it from this
representation because i see here only
the outside a pump even though you
had described the valves and explained
them to me ever so clearly i should not
have understood them so well as by having
seen and touched them and moved them
myself
certainly said harry but next to
seeing the real thing these engravings
or drawings help one very much look
though you see only the outside the
pump in that perspective view here is the
inside an air pump all laid open for
you you know what is meant by a section
 
soh yes said lucy suppose anything
to be cut in two what you see inside
 each part when they are separated
is a section papa explained that and
showed it to me when he cut a lemon in
two for me i remember this minute as
well as if i saw it before my eyes the
look the lemon with the pippins cut in
half each in their little cells the cells cut
open too and i remember 
very well my dear interrupted
harry you remember very well what
is meant by a section therefore you will
understand this plate and this figure
but lucy never be ashamed to tell me
if you do not understand you know
i have but just learnt these things myself
and i remember the odd mistakes i used
to make and the puzzles i was in when
papa was teaching me
lucy looked at the engravings now
without alarm because as she knew what
they represented they did not puzzle her
and she was not afraid being tired
after having looked at the section she
said it made the whole as plain to her eye
as if it had been made glass something
farther she said to herself about a
man's having a window in his breast but
either she did not say it loud enough for
harry to hear or he did not think it much
to the purpose for without attending to it
he shut the saying now we have
had enough the prints i thought just
now you were very eager to work the air
pump yourself lucy
 so i am still said lucy only it
g 
was not quite ready and i looked at
the prints between times now let me
pump
pump away this way said he showing
her how to hold the handle and how
to move it backwards and forwards and
how she worked two pistons at the same
time
she worked it but not without difficulty
after she had pumped for some minutes
she found the difficulty increasing and
asked from what this arose
harry said from the resistance made by
the pressure the outward air which becomes
greater as the receiver is more and
more exhausted he took off the receiver
and put her hand over the hole at the top
 the pipe which communicates with the
pumps and bid her move the pistons
with her other hand gently she did so
and felt that part the palm her hand
which was over the pipe drawn in her
brother repeated gently gently as she
moved the handle indeed soon there
was no occasion to say so to her for she
felt the palm drawn in so as to be quite
painful and she grew red with fright
 oh brother it hurts me very much
i cannot take my hand away what shall
i do
stop pumping said he and do not
be frightened there is no danger
she stopped pumping and her brother
turned a screw so as to let the air into the
receiver this relieved her hand she
held it up to show him a purple circle all
round the inside the hand
he pitied it a little a very little lucy
thought not quite enough
 i know said he exactly how much
it hurts you because i have done the same
a hundred times to my own hand my
dear i wanted you to feel as i did myself
there is as you said nothing like feeling
to make one remember well what do
you think caused this 
at first lucy answered that she did not
know
because you are thinking the pain
in your hand said he
that is true said lucy but it is
pretty well over now what did you ask
me
 i asked you what caused that kind 
sucking in your hand into the exhausted
receiver f
she thought for an instant and answered

i believe it was the pressure the
outer air which was trying to get in at
that hole to fill the vacuum and which
was prevented by the palm my hand
which it then drove in as much as it could
well now i am sure i have felt the
pressure the viewless air and now
you must let me repeat the line
the spring and pressure the viewless air
harry repeated it after her declaring it
was a very pretty line besides it had some
common sense in it lucy had said it
quite at the right time when it did not
interrupt him or any thing that was going
on he was so much pleased with it that
he begged her to repeat all those lines
j
again for him and when they went out to
their garden soon afterwards instead 
beginning to dig he desired her to say
the lines once more for that he must learn
them by heart thus he learnt from her
some her taste for poetry while she
acquired from him some his love 
science
in repeating these lines lucy observed
which them alluded to the barometer
and which to the air pump yhen she
had first learned them by rote barometer
and air pump had been so jumbled in her
head that she could not understand them
c
how up exhausted tubes bright currents flow
 liquid silver from the lake below
weigh the long column th incumbent skies
and with the changeful moment fall or rise 
she now knew described the barometer
and the succeeding lines the air pump 
how as in brazen pumps the pistons move
the membrane valve sustains the weight above 
stroke follows stroke the gelid vapour falls
and misty dewdrops dim the chrystal walls 
rare and more rare expands the fluid thin
and silence dwells with vacancy within
while harry was learning these lines
by heart lucy stopped as she prompted
the couplet concerning gelid vapour
and misty dewdrops and objected i
do not understand about misty dewdrops
on the chrystal walls i did not perceive
any vapour on the glass bell
her brother told her that these lines
alluded to a fact which he had not yet
mentioned to her which his father had
but very lately told him and he was not
clear enough yet about it to attempt to
explain it to her
lucy said she was satisfied to wait
that it was best not to know every thing
at once and pleasant to have something
to look forward to but altogether she
confessed that though the air pump was
curious and ingenious to use the air to
drive itself out yet the water pump she
thought a much grander and a much more
useful machine she thought the air
pump was not any use
harry smiled and answered so i
thought at first but my dear that was
owing to my ignorance and when you
know more you will find that the air pump
is great use there are many experiments
in natural history as papa showed
me that could never have been tried and
discoveries that could never have been
made without it for instance to give
you a little peep into the matter we could
never without an air pump have known
that a guinea and a feather would fall to
the ground in the same time if there was
no air to resist the fall either them
a guinea and a feather a heavy
guinea and a light feather i oh brother t
very true i assure you as you will
see one these days
 harry now i think i recollect i heard
this about the guinea and the feather before
or read it somewhere and something
else too about the guinea's making no
more noise than the feather when it falls
you will show me this too will you
i am not sure that i can lucy said
harry i tried in this air pump and i
did not find it was so the guinea fell
on the metal plate here at the bottom and
this plate touches the outer air and rings
makes a noise
i do not clearly understand why it
should make a noise when it falls or why
it should not said lucy
i cannot explain it yet said harry
 and i must try the experiment about the
noise over again to make myself sure
whether i am right or wrong i am certain
that the feather and guinea come to the
ground in the same time for that experiment
i have tried often and it always succeeded

show it to me now said lucy
no not now but you shall see all
this and a great deal more in time said
harry but lucy how could you say
that the air pump is no use when
you know more about it you will see
how much you were mistaken you will
find that all we know about the specific
gravities the different weights bodies
and a great many curious facts about
sound and i cannot tell you how many
delightful experiments and discoveries
about the air that comes out vegetables
and about the growing seeds and 
plants and other experiments about different
kinds gases as they are called 
i say my dear lucy as my father told
me none these could have been known
without the air pump and then as to the
gases oh my dear i cannot explain
to you yet what amazing consequence
the erases are
lucy opened her eyes and stood looking
as if she thought she could never admire
enough after a reverend pause she
simply repeated the word gases i
my dear do not ask me about them
yet you are a great great way yet from
the gases but if you are good i will put
you into boiling water tonight at tea and
get you on to steam and the steam engine

thank you said lucy without knowing
clearly what was to happen to her
now let us finish the new road to my
garden said harry but before we
go i hope you will acknowledge the air
pump besides being very ingenious is as
useful as the water pump at least hey
mrs lucy you look as if you were not
convinced yet
i must wait till i have seen and till i
can understand all these things before i
can decide said lucy
very provokingly prudent and slow
all at once muttered harry striking the
stones the new road with his pounder
why brother how can i possibly say
more when you tell me i am so far from
the gases and i am sure i did not understand
a word you said about specific gravities
 as to the experiment about the
feather and the guinea i long to see that
with all my heart and i dare say i shall
like the others about sound and seeds
and vegetables particularly but these
are all curious experiments for grand philosophers
with your airpump they maybe
useful to your men science brother 
but what i say is that the common pump
is more useful to common people everyday
and i do say that i like those machines
best which are most useful
all the rest harry heard patiently or
passively as he went on pounding his
road but when she came to the last words
and i do say that i like those machines
best which are most useful he threw down
his pounder exclaiming you are very
ungrateful lucy and he wiped his forehead
for he was very hot but checking
himself he added ungrateful to the air
pump i mean
my dear i did not mean to be ungrateful
to the air pump said lucy surprised
that he could grow so warm about
it i did not mean to affront the air
pump or you i am sure i did not know
you cared which i preferred what can
make you care so much about the pumps 
i do not know said harry but i
was vexed because you would not do justice
to the air pump and you gave your
opinion against it without knowing all i
thought that you were like that foolish
woman who said to the great chemist
 what use is all your chemistry if it
cannot teach you to tell me how to take
the ironmoulds out my gown lucy
i hope you will never be so foolish
never i hope said lucy and i
hope you do not think i ever shall
no i hope not said harry but
now i must say for the air pump there is
a use that may be made it in common
every day in hot weather to make something
that is exceedingly agreeable
what can it be said lucy
particularly with sweetmeats and
creams continued harry very good
 pine apple and pleasant tea mamma
told me not bad even water
do you mean ice said lucy
yes said he the air pump can
make ice
oh harry i cannot believe that how
can that possibly be done 
go to conversations on chemistry
my dear and you will be answered
very well i will go to conversations
on chemistry said lucy but not till i
have dug this bed in my garden and tied
up all my carnations and fed my white
rabbit and finished drawing the last snake
 my head medusa and put by the sulphur
in the cabinet and practised the
rising the lark
very little chance indeed through all
that jumble things your remembering
on chemistry and the air
pump said harry
you shall see said lucy i have
always a good memory for what i wish
to do
harry i have done all that i said i
would i have duo the bed in mv garden
tied up my carnations fed my white
rabbit finished my medusa's snakes put
the sulphur into their cabinet practised
my rising the lark and read and understood
all that you marked forme in conversations
on chemistry
eighth edition vol i from page to 
really you have done a great deal
said harry much more than i expected
i thought the white rabbit would have
made you forget every thing else and
do you quite understand all you have
read
i do said lucy for it is very
clear as i was reading i thought i saw
every thing that was described and after
i had finished i was more anxious than
before to see the experiment you promised
to show me will you let me see
it now before i forget what i understand
and while my head is it as you say 
i will show it to you as soon as ever
i can said harry with my father's
assistance he says that i must not attempt
to try this experiment by ourselves
because sulphuric acid which must be
used in it is very dangerous to meddle
with if we dropped any it on our 
clothes it would burn holes in them and
if we were to let a drop fall on ourselves
it would hurt us exceedingly so take
care lucy not to meddle with it
i will take great care said lucy i
will look but not touch
while harry went out the room to
his father who was preparing for their
experiment lucy talked to her mother
about the entertaining account which she
had just been reading the method 
making ice in india even in the hottest
nights
 how glad they must be mamma
said lucy when in the morning they
see the ice in the shallow pans which
they leave out doors during the night 
mamma continued she i think that
the emily and caroline in this must
have been very happy seeing all the nice
experiments mentioned here and talking
to their mother about them and learning
from her this mrs b seems to be a
very good kind mother i should like to
know her if she is really a live person
is there such a real person as mrs b
mamma
 yes there is lucy
there is and are you acquainted with
her mamma lucy asked eagerly
i am my dear
you are and what sort person is
she do you like her oh yes mamma
i see by your look before you speak you
like her very much
i do indeed lucy
i am glad she is an acquaintance 
yours mamma i hope i shall see her
some time
she is more than an acquaintance 
mine she is my friend and if you deserve
it my dear daughter i hope that she will
some time be yours
oh brother what do you think mamma
has just told me cried lucy running
to meet harry who at this instant opened
the door and came in followed by his
father
oh papa do you know 
but observing that her father's hands
were full and that he and harry were
intent upon bringing in the air pump
she wisely ceased her exclamations and
stopped short in what she was going to say
right to be silent my dear said her
father as she stood by without uttering a
words all the time they were preparing to
show her the experiment it is very
troublesome and disagreeable to have little
girls or little any bodies or great any
bodies talking all the time we are busy
preparing experiments
 busy and anxious too you know
papa for some experiments are dangerous
said harry
lucy had learned from what she had
just read that sudden evaporation produces
cold sufficient to freeze in a vacuum
even when the outer air is much
above the freezing point a thermometer
was near the air pump and lucy
looked at it as harry desired she would
she saw that the mercury stood at 
degrees and she felt that the room was
warm
her father placed under the receiver a
large shallow saucer filled with sulphuric
vol i h
acid and in it a small cup water
raised on a little stand with a thermometer
in it as described in conversations on
chemistry
he asked lucy if she knew for what
purpose the sulphuric acid was put there
she said that the had told her that
the use the sulphuric acid was to attract
and absorb what was evaporated from
the water before it is frozen
and why should it be absorbed
said her father
because we want to freeze the water
said lucy
true but you have not explained tome
why we desire that the sulphuric acid
should absorb this vapour
because papa that vapour fills up
part the vacuum and it must be taken
away and the sulphuric acid does this as
it absorbs it
 she understands it said harry now
we may go on look lucy at what happens
 keep your eyes fixed upon the
water
she did so and she soon saw little
bubbles appearing on its surface
it is beginning to do something said
she but it looks more as if it were going
to boil than to freeze
you know said he that before
water can freeze it must appear to boil
yes appear i understand why you
say appear that was explained to me in
the 
now it begins to freeze said harry
look at the little spikes ice
lucy saw this and said it was very
curious but still she did not look quite so
much surprised and pleased as harry had
expected because els she said she saw
only such tiny spikes ice she had imagined
that all the remaining water in
the cup would have been turned at once
into a solid lump
harry had talked to her about pineapple
ice and various other kinds ice
which were so pleasant to eat in hot weather
and which he boasted that the air
pump was so useful in assisting people to
h 
make but from the tiny spikes she had
seen she could scarcely conceive that a
sufficient quantity could be made for this
good purpose harry asked his mother if
she would give them some cream and some
sweetmeat to make sweet icecream he
wished exceedingly to show lucy that it
could really be done in the air pump
their kind mother provided them with all
that harry desired but she doubted that
they would be able to succeed as it was
difficult even to freeze water harry was
determined to try for he had heard that it
was a common practice in london to make
use an air pump in making icecream
his father warned him that he was mistaken
but that he mighty and that he
would then find out what his mistake had
been
harry put the cream into a small teacup
and lucy mixed with it their raspberry
jelly they put the tea cup into a
larger cup filled with water and this they
placed on a little stand which rested on a
saucer filled with sulphuric acid within
the glass bell the air pump it happened
as it too often happens to young
experimenters and to old ones also that
their experiment did not succeed they
could not freeze the cream
they tried to console themselves by eating
the cream and sweetmeat this was
however but an imperfect consolation to
harry the honour the air pump and
his own were at stake and he recurred to
the subject immediately
i suppose my mistake was in putting
the cream and sweetmeat into the air
pump i was only told that the air pump
was useful in making ice how they make
the ice cream with it i cannot guess said
harry
i can tell you that said lucy for i
once saw the housekeeper make raspberry
icecream
have you said harry and how
did she do it
she put some cream and sweetmeat
into a tin cylinder tin i believe it was or
pewter and this she surrounded with
a great deal pounded ice and salt
then she kept turning and turning the
cylinder round with the cream in it till at
last it was all frozen
oh oh said harry then now i see
how it is the air pump produces ice
enough to freeze the cream that must bethe
way it is useful
 but how can it produce it in such
quantities as would be necessary it would
be a year at the rate i saw it going on with
a little cupful water said lucy
harry acknowledged this and they appealed
to their father
he told them that for this purpose
much larger air pumps than they had ever
seen would be necessary that consequently
a greater vacuum was produced
and more water frozen
then it is true lucy you see the air
pump does make the ice that makes the ice
cream and it is used for this purpose in
london is not it papa 
not in london answered their father
it is too expensive a process to be 
much advantage in this country but i believe
it has been found useful in india
ein india there lucy you see how
useful it is and how far its fame goes
said harry
did they really send an air pump
made in england to india for this purpose

yes said her father and when
we go to london i will show you mr
carey's apparatus for making ice
oh thank you father and i shall
really see it made not in little spikes butin
quantities said lucy
now lucy you will acknowledge
said harry that the air pump is useful
for common purposes
i will i do said lucy
and you will have much more to
acknowledge on this subject by and by
said her father you will see other purposes
for common life to which it is applied

oh what father cried harry
that i will not tell you now harry
in the evening before tea time harry
and lucy played at spilling and afterwards
a game chess in which harry was
beaten because he was thinking something
he was going to tell lucy about the
steam engine and he missed seeing a rogue
 a knight that had got so close to his
king that he could not stir without being
checkmated
now for the steam engine which you
promised to explain to me said lucy
harry was afraid that he could not and
turning to his father asked him to explain
it but his father desired that he would
first thy what he could do
this will be service to you harry
for you will be then certain whether you
comprehend it yourself or not people
are never sure they understand any thing
perfectly till they have explained it to another
if lucy is puzzled i will help you
out your difficulty whatever it may be
harry said he would try and began
with these words 
in the first place a steam engine is a

machine there he stopped and began
aofain with
in the first place lucy you must know
that the machine called a steam engine was
invented he stopped short again and
a third time he attempted it but he hesitated
and blushed and turning again to his
father he said i cannot explain it before
you father i am so anxious it is very
odd i am not the least afraid you you
know but i feel so ashamed and anxious
i think i should do it a great deal better if
you were not by
very well said his father laughing 
then either you or i must go out the
room it seems luckily for you i am just
going into the next room ls that far
enough off though the folding doors are
o o o
open i assure you i shall not hear you
that will do perfectly said harry
 but what will you do about mamma 
she must stay to make tea said lucy
look here is the urn coming in had
not you better come out into the hall with
me harry 
h 
 no no said harry i do not mind
mamma and now i think it i want
the urn lucy look at the steam coming
from the top that urn do you recollect
a great while ago my father's holding a
cold plate over the steam coming from the
urn
yes lucy said she remembered it
well though it was a great while ago
she remembered that the cold the plate
had turned the steam into water again condensed
it she recollected the drops on
the plate which afterwards ran into each
other and down into little streams when
the plate was sloped
 yes interrupted harry you have
recollected enough that you are clear
then that cold can condense steam that is
can turn it back again into water
 perfectly clear said lucy
now recollect another thing said
harry which took up most room the
steam when it was steam or when it was
turned into water 
it took up much the most room when
it was steam said lucy i am sure
that cloud steam which you see rising
from the tea urn and which takes up so
much room in the air might if you held a
cold plate over it this minute be condensed
into a few drops which would not half
fill a tea spoon
very true said harry now do not
think any more about that but do you recollect
our talking a great while ago
about the tea kettle's boiling over as it is
called and do you remember my saying
that if the top the tea kettle was
screwed down tight and if the spout was
stopped so that no steam could get out
that i thought the tea kettle would burst
i remember it all said lucy and
papa said you were very right and i
remember afterwards the bursting and explosion
 my chesnuts and the story papa
told us his pouring the hot lead into the
damp elder to make a pencil and the
fact i read about the bursting a little
scientific dialogues
hollow brass ball in which there was water
that turned to steam and which caused
an explosion that blew a whole founder
to pieces
 then you have some idea the power
 steam when it expands said harry
to be sure i have said lucy i
know it is terribly great bursting and
killing people and tearing away how
frightened i should have been if i had
been papa when he was a little boy when
the lead bounced up to the top the
ceiling i am sure i was frightened enough
when my own horse chesnuts bounced
but if this terribly great power said
harry is carefully used and cleverly
used it will do as you shall see the most
surprising and the most useful things it
would raise water high as the house and
higher from the bottom the deepest
mine it could raise the weight this
room and all that is in it as high as the
top the highest tree and higher
 oh brother brother said lucy
it is quite tie it can do more in an
hour than two hundred horses and fourteen
hundred men it can drag loaded
waggons full coal such as you have
seen going step by step the horses pulling
hard it can pull these waggons up as
easily as i can pull your little cart
my dear brother how can i believe
it said lucy
it can drive across the sea against the
power the wind and the tide a great
ship with all the people in it and all their
horses and carriages and all that they
have in the world
is it really possible said lucy i
have heard people talking steam boats
and the working steam engines and
i remember papa's asking a gentleman who
was here the other day whether his steam
engine was an hundred horse power but
i never knew how this was nor could i
conceive that steam could do all this by
itself only steam like that said she
fixing her eyes upon the steam that still
came from the tea urn
yes only steam like that repeated
harry think what we men can make
it do at our bidding
really and truly harry said lucy
 it does more at men's bidding than any
 the genii in the arabian tales more
than any the slaves aladdin's lamp
for the hardest working them could only
be made to carry one house
very true indeed said harry and
for once he was pleased with an allusion
but continued lucy i should be
very much afraid its doing some great
mischief some day like the african magician
do you remember 
 but my dear interrupted harry
 do not tell me any thing more about
the african magician
only this one thing harry if you
would let me get it out my head i
should attend so much better
no my dear lucy is it not very
hard upon me that you are to say everything
that comes into your head and that
puts out mine all that i want to remember
about the steam engine for you 
i beg your pardon said lucy i
will not say a word more the african
magician go on
but poor harry could not go on immediately
 where was i said he to
himself what was i going to say
as he spoke he rubbed his forehead first
and then ran his fingers through his hair
from the roots upwards till it was all
pushed up and stood erect like quills
upon the fretful porcupine
now i recollect what i was going to
say cried harry look at the tea urn
lucy ah but now it is too late there
is not steam enough it is not strong
enough to do what i wanted you to see
but at first when the water was boiling
and the steam rushing out at top you
might have seen it pushing up the lid 
the urn till the steam got out then the
lid fell and lay still till more steam was
formed and pushed it up again i wish
you had seen it going up and down
 i have often seen it said lucy and
watched it moving because sometimes i
was afraid the top would be quite lifted
up and blown off
and so it would said harry if it
were not for these little holes look here
through which the steam escapes and
which were made on purpose to let it
escape without blowing off the top or
doing any mischief
that is very prudent i am glad the
holes are there said lucy
 but suppose they were not there
said harry and the top left loose as
it is now if the water boiled well as
people say if a great deal steam came
rushing up and pushing out through this
place where the top goes on you know
the top would be lifted up and suppose
i lay on the top this weight continued
he taking up from the table a small weight
which was used for keeping down papers 
 and suppose i put a lamp under the urn
so as to keep the water boiling and sending
up fresh steam what do you think
would happen then 
i am not sure said lucy it would
either burst the urn or lift up the top with
that weight upon it it would i am
sure lift up the top and weight because
that would be the easiest way for the steam
to get out
to be sure it would require much
less force said harry to lift this little
weight than to burst the urn the expansive
force steam you know i told
you would lift the house now suppose
that instead that urn with a little lamp
under it there was a great fire as large
as a kitchen fire and larger and a great
iron boiler as large as the boiler you have
seen in the kitchen and larger with water
boiling in it and over the mouth that
boiler suppose we put a cylinder like the
body a pump as large as that in the
yard and closed well round at the place
where it is put in so that the steam the
boiling water can get out no way but up
the cylinder
then said lucy how the steam
would rush up through the valve in the
piston what a cloud steam would come
out at the top 
stay stay lucy i was going to have
told you that in this piston there is to be
no valve it is to be a tight stopper now
suppose before i let the steam in that i
have the piston down at the bottom the
pump
 why then before you let in the steam
you must put a great weight to keep the
piston down or it would be thrown up to
the ceiling as the lead in papa's pencil
case was
and i believe said harry your
great weight would be thrown through
the ceiling and would break it to pieces
consider my dear if the small quantity
 water that was in papa's elder pencil
case could when turned into steam force
the lead up to the ceiling and if the
small quantity water that was left in
the little brass ball could burst and blowup
a whole founder such a quantity 
steam as this would be able to lift up
and blow up this room and all that is
in it
but if that is your only way lifting
gi'eat weights and lifting the house i
do not see how it can be useful
patience lucy suppose that we
know beforehand the weight whatever
we wish to lift we can calculate and
lessen the fire and lessen the steam till
it is just enough and no more than enough
to lift the weight gently up to whatever
height we please suppose now to the
top the pump then you do no mischief
you see
very well said lucy if you can
calculate exactly and make no mistake
that is very nice
but now suppose you want to do this
more than once to lift several weights
one after another could you do it you
have the piston and the weight up at the
top and the steam in the cylinder the
pump
i do not know said lucy for i
dare not take the weight off the piston i
dare not touch it
i would not advise you to touch it
indeed said harry
then what can i do said lucy
think said harry
but the idea the steam going oncoming
up through the pump frightens
me i will tell you what i would do 
i would put out the fire directly throw
water upon it
very well thought said harry
but then there is steam in the boiler
i would throw water into that if i
could but i cannot get at it i would
throw cold water all over the outside and
that would cool the steam
 but still there would be the steam in
the body the pump said harry
 and i cannot throw water into it because
 the stopper said lucy well
i will throw cold water over it all down
the sides and over the piston at top and
cool it and make it as cold as the plate
papa held over the urn and colder then
it would condense the steam within and
turn it into a very small quantity water
then what would happen said
harry
the piston would fall down there
would be nothing to hold it up the
steam would be all gone
and what would there be or would
there be any thing in the place the
steam asked harry
there would be nothing but a little
water there would be a vacuum all but
those drops water said lucy
very well indeed said harry now
you have the piston down how will you
raise it again i want to have another
weight brought up
then you know i must light the fire
and boil the water again said lucy
aye and wait till the cylinder is
heated too for till that is heated it will
condense the steam said harry
certainly said lucy you must wait
till it is hot
 but it would be very inconvenient
said harry to wait while you light the
fire and boil the water and so on cannot
you find any better way condensing
the steam without putting out the fire
every time 
lucy thought for a few moments and
answered perhaps without putting out
the fire it would do as well if i could but
let cold water into the boiler and into the
cylinder the pump
but why into the boiler said harry
because the fresh steam would come
up continually if i did not prevent it
said lucy
but suppose said harry you have
condensed the steam in the cylinder and
you only want the vacuum for an instant
or two just to let the piston fall and suppose
that for that little time the steam
from the boiler could be prevented from
coming in i need not tell you how but
it can
then i need not put out the fire
but i may condense the steam in the
cylinder said lucy that will be
much more convenient because afterwards
the steam will be ready to be let
in again under the bottom the piston
if you want another weight to be sent up
but still i do not know how to get the
cold water into the body the pump i
mean into the cylinder to condense the
steam
the steam said harry is let off
into a separate vessel called from its use
a condenser this vessel is surrounded by
cold water so that the steam is condensed
as soon as it comes into it
 and is this all the steam engine
said lucy
no my dear lucy it is only the
general principle i cannot explain all
to you i should only puzzle you there
are different sorts steam engines in
that invented by mr watt the expansive
force the steam is used in different
degrees to raise the piston and to force
it down
i did not know that the steam was
ever let in above the piston said lucy
yes it is i did not tell you that at
first lest i should puzzle you and i will
not now tell you exactly how it is done
and there is a great deal more to be explained
about the ways making the
steam engine raise weights or water or
work machinery in different directions
ours was but an awkward way raising
weights by putting them on the top the
piston suppose i want to raise water
from a pond you must put a beam out
from the top the piston like a scale
beam and with this you might work the
piston a pump fastened at the other 
 this beam
very convenient said lucy and
very simple
there are a great many other contrivances
said harry and ways 
making it turn wheels and pull and push
sideways or in any direction in which
you want to have work done or force
 
applied but i should tire and puzzle you
to death if i were to tell you all at once
papa took several days to explain to me
the parallel motion and the fly wheel
and the sun and planet motion and the
excentric
oh my dear brother cried lucy
stopping her ears this would puzzle me
to death indeed
therefore my dear i tell you i will
not say one word about any these
things today but i will leave your head
quite clear as i hope it is in the general
principle as papa calls it and here he
comes with his letter in his hand
mamma is beginning to pour out tea 
said lucy let us go to her
stay one minute lucy said harry
 now pray when you are called upon
to explain to papa be quite steady do
not be a coward and fancy that you do
not know what you do and do not be
too quick neither above all do not go
the least beyond what you really know
do not put in any your its like this 
vol i i
or it's like that when you have no
more to say stop
i will said lucy i will not say
one word more than is necessary nor make
one allusion or quotation i will be like
your own dear menelaus i'll say no more
than just the thing i ought
now papa will you ask lucy to explain
to you what she knows the
principle the steam engine said
harry walking up with her to the tea
table with a composed countenance
first harry said his father i
must ask your mother to read this letter
for me and i have a great deal to say to
her about it
harry sat down with a resigned look
and swallowed tea and eat bread and
butter without hearing one word 
what was going on till at last his
father turned to lucy and said now
my dear i am ready for you and the
steam engine
lucy who had been listening to the
letter declared she was afraid that the
whole the steam engine had gone out
 her head
in astonishment harry stared at her
and in a tone indignation exclaimed
is it possible lucy 
 stay do not frighten me said lucy
and perhaps i may get it back again
she did and she recollected all harry
had said to her she distinctly said no
more than just the thing she ought her
father was doubly pleased by the clearness
with which she made her explanation because
it showed that harry had understood
well what had been taught him
i promise you both said he that
the first time i have an opportunity i
will show you a steam engine
harry was delighted with this promise
and lucy clapped her hands and added
i know harry that the opportunity will
come soon
harry was going to ask her how she
knew this but his attention was taken
i 
off by his father's observing to him that
he had done well to refrain from describing
to his sister any the lesser
parts the machinery
lucy said it was not at all difficult
to me papa for he brought me up to the
steam engine by degrees and i was quite
surprised when i found i was at it i did
not know what he was about when he
began with your cold plate and the tea
urn and the expansive force the steam
and the condensing the water but i saw
plainly afterwards when i found out
where i was it was just like his way 
leading me blindfold on the gravel walk
and taking me to this place and that and
i do not know where i am or where he is
leading me till he takes the bandage off
my eyes then i am quite surprised at
what i see before me
ha ha lucy i thought you could
not get through without an allusion said
harry but he was well enough pleased
with this his spirits were so much raised
by this commendation and by the promise
 seeing a steam engine and a steamboat
and by lucy's success and his own
that he could not refrain from saying a
little more than just the thing he ought
he would now go on to tell her the names
 the first second third and fourth inventors
and improvers the steam engine
but he was fortunately stopped by his father's
getting up to look for a in
which he said he could find a poetic description
 the wonders performed by the
expansive force steam
oh i know that said lucy 
it is the same harry in which there
are the lines on the barometer and air
pump
the description the steam engine
said their father begins by doing honour
due to him who
bade with cold streams the quick expansion stop
and sunk the immense vapour to a drop
who was that lucy 
the inventor the steam engine
the man who first thought throwing
cold water upon it to condense the steam
said lucy
salary or the marquis worcester
i do not know which said harry you
know father there have been many disputes
for the honour this great invention

yes but let these rest for the present
harry said his father salary
is the person alluded to in these lines
do go on reading papa said lucy
i like those lines so much
her father continued 
pressed by the ponderous air the piston falls
resistless sliding through its iron walls
quick moves the balanc'd beam giant birth
wields its large limbs and nodding shakes the
earth 
the giant power from earth's remotest caves
lifts with strong arm her dark reluctant waves
each cavern'd rock and hidden depth explores
drags her dark coals and digs her shining ores
 yes i understand said lucy that
describes the steam engine bringing up
water from the bottom mines and dragging
the coal waggons as harry told me it
could
her father went on reading 
 next in close cells ribbed oak confined
gale after gale he crowds the struggling wind
th imprisoned storms through brazen nostrils roar
fan the white flame and fuse the sparkling ore
 the great bellows in forges and founders
which are moved by the steam engine
said harry i never should have
thought they could have roared so well in
poetry pray go on papa
here high in air the rising steam he pours
to claybuilt cisterns and to leadlin'd towers 
fresh through a thousand pipes the waves distils
and thirsty cities drink th exuberant rills 
these the vast millstone with inebriate whirl
on trembling floors his forceful fingers twirl
whose flinty teeth the golden harvests grind
feast without blood and nourish humankind
do you understand lucy said harry
i forget my dear whether i told you
that the steam engine keeps com mills
and all sorts mills going
lucy nodded do not let us interrupt
papa i will tell when i do not understand
said lucy but i understand
all as far as he has gone
now his hard hands on mona's rifted c'est
bosomed in rock her azure ores arrest 
with iron lips the rapid rollers seize
the lengthening bars iu their expansion squeeze 
descending screws with ponderous flywheels wound
the tawny plates the new medallions round
hard dies steel the cupreous circles cramp
and with quick fall his massy hammers stamp
the harp the lily and the lion join
and george and britain guard the sterling coin
 lucy i am sure you cannot understand
this said harry
no i was just going to say so harry 
i waited only till papa came to a full stop
but i know that mona means anglesey
her father said that she was right that
the azure ores allude to copper mines in the
isle anglesey or mona which are
worked by the steam engine cupreous
means coppers and the ores copper
being blueish the poet calls them mona's
azure ores the succeeding lines describe
machinery for coining copper first rolling
out thick bars it into plates thin as halfpence
then cutting those plates into circular
forms and stamping them with the arms
 ireland france and england the harp
the lily and the lion all which is done
by machinery without the hands men
and that machinery is kept at work by the
motion and power a steam engine
harry looked triumphant while his father
spoke these wonders performed by steam 
lucy could not conceive how it could do
all this her father repeated his promise
that whenever he had an opportunity he
would show her how it is done and lucy
whispered again to harry every soon too
perhaps
 is there no more father is there
nothing about the steam boat asked
any
 there is said his father and it
is curious that these lines were written
several years before steam boats had been
brought into use and at a time when it was
scarcely believed by any but a few courageously
ingenious persons that the steam
engine could ever be successfully or safely
i 
employed in driving forward vessels on the
water this prophecy at the time it was
made most people thought merely poetical 
and instead expecting that it would be
soon accomplished it was thought that it
would never be effected 
soon shall thy arm unconquer'd steam afar
drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car 
the slow barge now goes as fast as
you please said harry the rapid caris
to come and i dare say that will be accomplished
soon papa do not you think it
will and oh father read this here is
something about a flying chariot which we
did not hear 
or on idewaving winds expanded bear
the flying chariot through the fields air 
his father had purposely omitted to read
these and prudently declined giving his
opinion
harry became silent and thoughtful for
some minutes but occupied himself with
burning a lump sugar whose amber
drops as fast as they fell and cooled he
put into lucy's mouth and when the
sugar bason was taken from him he found
new recreation for his fingers and thoughts
in his mother's tambour needle which he
pushed and pulled up and down through
silk and through paper till she took that
from his hand and then he had no resource
but to lean with both his elbows on her
frame and to watch her plying the needle
lucy whispered from time to time 
will not you come and play at travellers
with me 
but in vain she twitched his elbow it
remained fixed
my mother's work is like a chain said
harry link within link loop within
loop
yes said lucy it is called chain
stitch
he watched the lengthening chain
which with the quick noise successful
pricks advanced towards him forming
a line from one the frame to the
other which was accomplished in two minutes
counted by the watch then scallops
and leaves pointed and round grew
under her hand nothing too difficult for
the dexterous hooked needle
it goes on so easily said harry it
seems to do it itself
 and do you think you could do it
harry as mamma does mamma pray
let mm have the needle and try
harry had little doubt that he should
succeed if he might be allowed to try because
he had most carefully observed all
his mother did he had watched her hand
under the frame and had seen as he said
how by a little quick motion she hung
the cotton or silk whichever it was over
the hook the needle and then pulled
both up together through the muslin exactly
through the middle the last link
and then dragged on a new loop with a
little twitch and twist and down again
with the needle
well observed and accurately described
i grant said his mother you are perfect
in the theory but now for the practice
she put the tambour needle into his
hand the feeling which he liked particularly
because its ivory handle was as
large as a pencil case and something fit
for a man to hold
now we shall see how the man will
work tambour work said lucy aye
down goes the needle pop through the
muslin easily enough but now get it up
again and the silk with it if you please
and can
harry turned the ivory handle to this
side and to that and leaned it this way
and that way and twisted and doubletwisted
the silk on the hook beneath and
twitched and plucked and pulled in vain
and came to pooh and pshaw and
 do not look at me pray i cannot do it
if you look at me
nor if we do not look at you said
lucy
i have done it said he dragging up
the needle by main force and making a
hole in the muslin through which he
hauled it
 oh harry what a hole 
i do not know how it happened said
harry but the needle is up at any rate
and the loop with it and i have one link
 the chain what you call one stitch and
now for the next which you see i will do
better
he tried again but the hole made it impossible
 he pulled out his first his only
stitch and tried again in a fresh corner
nothing ever did try his patience or ashe
thought nothing ever did try human
patience so much but by taking thought
he did get the needle and the loop safe
through this time without tearing the
muslin he persevered and in a quarter
 an hour had really worked a quarter
 an inch chain all crooked
dragged out short and long links various
sizes sad chainstitch as lucy
called it but still she could not deny that he
had done it his fingers were so hot that
he spread them out to cool and groaned
and took breath as his father said a coal
porter might do after setting down the
heaviest load
his father next took the needle in hand
with a theory as perfect with somewhat
more diffidence but with little better success
there was a knack in it which could
be learned only by practice but the gentlemen
talked very learnedly to each other
about it and agreed that their perfect theory
had helped would help or should have
helped them very much
but how wonderfully quickly my mother
does it said harry do it again
mamma pray how can you go on so
quickly with the work 
you think i go on quickly said his
mother but all that i could do in a daw
could be done by a machine harry in an
hour and by what machine do you think 
by your dear steam engine this is a use
for it which you never thought
 is it possible cried harry
 can these ms and outs and all this
delicate work and these pointed leaves
be all done by a steam engine said lucy
 a huge steam engine said harry
mamma how i should like to see it at
work doing the tambour work said lucy
perhaps i shall be able to show it to
you my dear said their father
 and soon whispered lucy to her
brother
what can you mean said harry i
heard you say ail soon over and over
again
my dear did not you hear the letter
and all papa and mamma were saying
about it said lucy
not i said harry
 you were sitting at the teatable all
the time beside me said lucy
very likely said harry i did not
hear a word that was said
what could you be thinking said
lucy
i do not know answered harry 
a bell crank i believe when i saw mamma
pull the bell cord i thought i would
show you the bell crank in the passage tomorrow
and explain by that the crank
motion in the steam engine
how full your head must be this
steam engine said lucy
 and you lucy my dear i was
thinking something to show to you
 thank you said lucy then i will
now tell you all that i heard that you did
not hear the letter was papa's answer to
sir something somebody the man the
gentleman husband to the lady dio told
 the shipwreck when she called here the
morning that i spotted my gown with the
dirty water from the pump and pond
but never mind that now said harry
get on my dear i want to hear what is
to come
papa's letter was to thank that gentleman
for the trouble he has taken in lookingfor
a house somewhere a great way off by
the seashore
and why did papa thank him for
that said harry
my dear any you are so slow in
understanding said lucy the house
is to be for papa and mamma and if there
is but room enough in it for us we are
to go with them
you do not say so cried harry starting
upright with joy
i do say so i heard it with these ears
and very good ears they are said lucy 
and papa told me i might hear his
letter said towards the it i hope
there may be two little rooms for harry
and lucy their mother and i wish to have
them with us
how kind oh any sort little
rooms any little dens would do said
harry i could sleep in a drawer ina
nutshell could not you lucy
to be sure said lucy but if they
cannot in any way find room for us we are
to be left with my uncle
oh cried harry uttering something
like a groan i hope we shall not be left
with my uncle though in general i like to
be with him very much but i never went
a journey a long journey and with papa
and mamma lucy think how delightful
it would be to see mountains and go
up them with my portable barometer
and to be by the sea side said lucy
i never saw the sea and i shall pick up
shells by the sea shore beautiful shells
and seaweed and sea urchins and we
shall live in a cottage oh think 
living in a cottage
and we shall see a steam boat and a
steam engine cried harry now i understand
it all but remember it is not
certain yet that we are to go lucy i will
not think it any more lest we should be
disappointed at last
 joy joy joy for you harry joy for
botvof us cried lucy the great black
trunk and the little black trunk and the
seatboxes and the carpet bag are coming
down from the garret to mamma s dressingroom
packing up is beginning and weare
to go
we but are you certain lucy how
do you know said harry i should not
like to be disappointed my dear
who would said lucy but no
danger my dear harry i heard the answer
to papa s letter and it says that there is
room for us only that one us must be
put in a very little closet which can just
hold a bed and a chair
i do not care how small it is if i can
but be crammed into it cried harry
nor do i said lucy i can sleep
on a sofa or anywhere so that we may
both go
 if we do not both go there will be no
joy said harry
but i tell you we shall both go mamma
says she can manage it they are to
set out the day after tomorrow at six o'clock
in the morning and i asked mamma
continued lucy if i might pack up your
things and mine today in the little black
trunk she says i may if i can only she
is afraid i cannot do it well enough but i
think i can bring me directly harry to
the dressing room all the things you want
to take with you and i will get all mine ina
minute
presently two great heaps appeared on
the dressingroom floor
there are all my goods said harry
pointing to one heap all these must go
and here are mine i hope they will
all go in said lucy looking doubtfully at
the little black trunk which stood between
them
harry pressing his hand down on lucy's
heap observed that they could be
squeezed almost to nothing cram my
things in any way said he i do not
care how so that they go only make
haste i will go and finish my latin lessons
and be back by the time you are
ready to lock the trunk ram my things
any way my dear repeated he as he left
the room
mamma is to see how the trunk is
packed when it is finished said lucy
and i must do it well
she packed and packed and squeezed
and crammed and rammed but in vain
she could not get in above half these
things
then she took out the trunk all she
had put in and by her mother's advice
began to sort her brother's and her own
into two classes necessaries and necessaries
by this operations her brother's
heap was diminished above twothirds and
her own nearly half when harry returned
he was not at all contented with her arrangement
and to satisfy him she gave up
several her books and reduced her portion
to exactly the same size as his
harry left her to pack the think and this
time having listened to her mother's advice
to lay each thing as she put it in as flat as
possible and to leave no holes or hollows
she succeeded in putting in all things
necessary there was one luxury her
own which she much desired to carry it
was a pasteboard tray that was made for
holding shells she emptied out all its
contents that she might fill it with a new
collection from the sea shore to her
great satisfaction there appeared just room
for it at the top in the arched lid the
trunk
her mother was called to see how easily
it locked and she examined the packing
and pronounced that it was as well done
as could be expected from so young a
packer she ran to report her success to
harry and to summon him to see how
nicely her shell tray lay at the top all the
things fitting under the arched roof the
trunk she met him coming up stairs with
a huge as she thought under his
arm he asked eagerly if she had finished
packing the trunk
 quite finished said she come and
look at it and you shall lock it yourself
harry looked disappointed and said that
he was very sorry the trunk was quite full
because he had found something else to put
in which he wished particularly to carry
with him and his father had just told him
that it must not go loose in the carriage
what is it said lucy fetch it if
it is not very large perhaps i can squeeze
it m
harry half ashamed to ask the question
said could you get in what i have
here under my arm 
this immense quarto harry
impossible cried lucy it is as large
as half the whole trunk
it is only a false my dear said
harry
false or true that does not make it
less said lucy
but as it opens said harry and has
an almost empty inside it will hold a great
quantity it will take up scarcely any
room in the trunk only the thickness its
own sides and they are very thin wood
covered with paper do my dear lucy
try if you can get it in it is a camera
obscura which my uncle has just given tome

 indeed said lucy well my dear
i will try my very best
but on opening the false she observed
that it was not nearly empty that
there was some apparatus with inside it
which took up a gieat deal room she
saw especially a glass which she was
afraid would be broken if she put anything
with inside he urged her however
to try if it were packed with soft things
such as her frocks all would be safe if
we can but carry the camera obscura with
us said he when we get to any pretty
country and to the cottage by the sea side
we shall see such beautiful landscapes in
it and the boats and ships sailing oh do
lucy contrive to carry it
i will give up my shell tray cried
lucy sand then i can make room for it
perhaps
there is a dear good girl said harry
she ran and he followed her to the
trunk he saw how nicely the tray fitted
and he saw her take it out and put it
quite away he heard a little sigh as she
locked the closet door upon it after putting
it out sight
my dear lucy said he i cannot
bear that you should give up your tray i
dare say you wish to carry that and your
shells as much as i wish for my camera
obscura
never mind said lucy
but i do mind and the more because
you do not said harry
but i will tell you why you need not
care so much harry said lucy i can
vol i k
make another tray pasteboard easily
when we get to our journey's and that
will be time enough for my shells at the
sea shore but you harry could not make
a camera obscura
every true said harry thank you
but you have all to unpack which you
had packed so neatly
never mind repeated lucy if i
can but get it in
you need not unpack to the bottom
stop my dear said harry the camera
obscura is only about onethird the depth
 the trunk
in it went and there was a little space
at its ends and beyond its breadth into
which things could be crammed and should
be crammed as harry observed to keep it
tight the greatest trial lucy's patience
was his standing by all the time she
was repacking advising all the while and
saying as she put in each thing that
will not go there or this would fit
better c after she had to the best 
her skill repacked the trunk there remained
on the floor a new jacket and
trowsers harry's the jacket too was
covered in front with innumerable hard
sugarloved shaped buttons which took
up a terrible quantity room and which
could not be compressed harry would
have found an easy remedy by leaving
jacket and trowsers and all behind he
thought he could do perfectly well without
them so did not his mother upon appeal
to her she decided that they must
go what was to be done harry though
it would give lucy a great deal trouble
thought he saw how it could be managed
i do not mind the trouble said lucy
if i can succeed at last but i think it is
really downright impossible to get more
into that trunk without breaking the hinges
in squeezing it down
harry suggested that if lucy would
unpack the whole trunk and put the
camera obscura at the bottom perhaps she
could get in more because his jacket with
its hard buttons might then lie at the top
as her tray had lain under the curve the
k
top the trunk by having the flat box
uppermost some that space he thought
was lost
lucy was not quite clear that he was
right but however she in a most obliging
manner began to unpack the trunk
again and said she would try it his way
all any age who have a good opinion
 their own powers packing and who
has not will give lucy more credit for
this than for all the rest she gave up her
own opinion and repacked upon her brother's
suggestion with as much zeal and
alacrity as if it had been an idea her
own we are happy to state that this
time she succeeded in putting in what was
required camera obscura jacket trowsers
and all to harry's joy and admiration
her mother was pleased
 my dear little girl said she i am
glad to see not only that you are goodnatured
to your brother that i did not
doubt but i am glad to perceive that
you are goodhumoured too good temper
is necessary even to the most goodnatured
people i have often seen goodnatured
people more ready to make great
sacrifices than little ones for their friends 
but the little ones are most frequently
wanted especially from women almost
every day their lives and if they
make these in a good humoured obliging
manner as you lucy did just now
they will be beloved and as far as they
can will make the friends they live with
happy
yes mamma said lucy as you do
you came into my head when i was unpacking
the trunk for harry i recollected
your unpacking the great trunk one night
at coventry when the maid was out and
you were tired to death and aunt pierrepoint
wanted something which she said
was at the bottom the tank and it was
not there after all mamma i recollect
another thing one day when you gave up
going to warwick castle which i know you
wished very much to see well mamma
on this journey which we are going to take
you shall see that if i have any trials i
will be as good i mean in proportion
said lucy
harry at this moment returned to the
room with their hygrometer and its register
in his hand he told lucy that he
thought it would be useless for them to
keep the register while they were travelling
as they should change every day to
different parts england and it was a
register the weather in one place that
was required lucy was glad he had
found out that it would be useless she was
sure that it would have been impossible for
them to keep it while on their journey 
and she felt relieved from a great responsibility
when harry determined to leave it
with their uncle till their return lucy
further observed that it would also be impossible
she feared to go on regularly
with harry in his course scientific lessons
for which she was really sorry though
the pleasures travelling she acknowledged
might make up for this interruption

yes said harry that is true we
must give up our regular lessons till we
come back but as papa has just been
telling me it will do us both a great deal
 good and me in particular to see new
things
delightful said lucy and thank
you papa and thank you mamma for
thinking such a pleasant way doing
us good
at six o'clock in the morning harry and
lucy were seated opposite to their father
and mother in an open carriage bags
books parcels nicely packed in and harry's
portable barometer snug beside him
drive on
the young travellers stood holding by
something no doubt according to the ever
repeated and nevertobe toooftenrepeated
counsel they looked from side to side
as they passed bidding goodbye to each
well known object half sorry to leave home
yet glad to go on to something new it
was a fine morning the sun shining the
air fresh and
tt
herb tree fruit and flower
glittering with dew
their way led through a lane the hedges
on each side full honeysuckles with
white and pink bind weed straggling above
about and underneath the ground under
the hedges was covered with wild flowers
 many colours abundance that most
delicate weed if weed it should be called
which paints the banks with blue well
known to all the world by one name or
other to the unlearned as speedwell to the
learned as veronica chancery there was
also abundance that erect plant with its
spire crimson bells spotted or plain by
peasants foxgloves by botanists digitalis
called valued by the old as a cure for the
dropsy and loved by the young for the
loud pop pop pop which in skilful
hands can be made by its flowers harry
asked lucy if she knew why the foxglove
is called digitalis
no said lucy why
because digit ale is the latin for a
finger a glove said harry
and the shape these bells is very
like the finger a glove said lucy but
whybglove foxes do not wear gloves
their father said that perhaps it might
have been called so from growing in the
haunts foxes
when they came to the the lane
and the road opened to the view freshly
mown meadows and extensive com fields
lucy exclaimed
look look harry at the gossamer
glittering in the sun all over that field as
far as we can see do you see it weaving
up and down with every breath wind
pray mamma look at this immense cobweb
net all spangled with dew is it not
beautiful most beautiful harry
harry answered eyes but it was ayes
uttered in a cold tone which did not satisfy
lucy yet he looked at the gossamer
earnestly but he was always more curious
about the causes whatever he saw
than pleased by their appearance while
k 
lucy had been admiring the glittering
floating waving net harry had been considering
how or by what this net was
made lucy said that in her favourite
 insects and in other books she
had read something about gossamer he
begged she would tell him all she knew
 it directly
and as fast as she could she told him
that all these shining threads are made
by a very small insect the garden spider
who like other spiders can throw out from
their bodies a sort glutinous substance
which hardens in the air some say that
the spider leaves the threads behind him
as he darts through the air in search 
food others say that he has the power
 throwing it out before him and that it
catches upon the blades grass or on the
rough edges leaves and bushes and then
being pulled tight by the animal forms as
it were a bridge or road in the air for
him to pass from place to place he has
been called by some people the flying
dialogues on entomology trees cyclopedia
spider and the threads are called air
threads and sometimes these are seen
floating over head and sometimes they are
borne down by the weight the dew and
then caught on the bushes harry asked if
lucy ever saw the spider throw out or leave
behind him these air threads
she had not seen it herself but she
remembered that one man in particular
who wrote about the flying spider declared
that he one day saw him throw
out from his body this substance and saw
him afterwards mount and ride away
upon it
exact harry was preparing to question
whether the flying spider flew or crept or
rode walked or darted upon the gossamer
or whether he moved his own free will
or was blown or borne away by the wind
but lucy too quick for his questions
hastened to tell him something more that
she had read another insect called the
silk spider who spins silk which is almost
as fine some say finer than that the
silk worm a pair stockings were actually
made the spidersilk they were
presented as lucy assured him to the
french academy sciences and were
much admired harry's attention became
more respectful when he heard the
academy sciences
i was thinking said he that great
use might be made all that gossamer if
it could be spun and woven
that has been thought often said
lucy people at the time the stockings
were made hoped that the spider would
do as well as the silkworm and they set
the spiders at work in paper cases made
on purpose but after they had been kept
many months spinning in their paper cells
their work was measured and it was
found that nearly three hundred pf the
hardest working spiders cannot produce
as much silk in the same time as one good
active silk worm
still harry contended that since there
are so many spiders the great numbers
might make up for the little they do and
as we have them always ready how much
better it would be to set them properly to
work than to brush them and their
cobwebs away or to crush them to
death
to this lucy replied that the common
house spider who is or ought to be
brushed away is not the silk spinner that
the silk spinners were not as common as
harry imagined besides many faults
continued she are found with their way
 working they break their threads or
spin them only in short pieces so that
their silk cannot be wound it can only be
spun and the reeling takes off its lustre
this want lustre was complained in
the famous pair spidersilk stockings
presented to the french academy on
the contrary the silk worm spins her silk
without breaking she winds it round and
round into cocoons which can be easily
unwound by a careful person what
length harry do you think the silk worm
can spin without breaking 
harry was no judge spinning but
since he must guess he would say about
as long as the field over which the gossamer
spread perhaps about a quarter
 a mile
he did not think it possible but he said
it on purpose to guess something provokingly
beyond what he supposed any silkworm
could do
a quarter a mile repeated lucy
that is a good large guess but you must
know that a silkworm can spin without
breaking as much as when unwound is six
miles long and if she is not lazy can do
this in nine days believe it or not
harry as you please but i assure you it
is true and what spider ever did as
much
harry looked as if he wished to urge
something more in favour the spiders
but had nothing else to say except that
still he did not doubt that some way
would be invented making them useful
oh my dear exclaimed lucy i
forget my very best argument spiders
can never work together like good silkworms
because they quarrel and fight
and eat up one another my insect 
says that i do not know how many
above forty or fifty that were shut up
together in one room with plenty flies
and pith quills and all the delicacies
they like only two them were at the
 some days found alive and you
know it would be impossible to give each
 them a separate house so there is an
 the matter
an the matter indeed said
harry i should never have thought 
having any thing to do with them if you
had told me at first that they eat one another
well lucy continued harry
thanks to you and your insect books
we have had a great deal diversion out
 that field gossamer
i feel much more pleasure in looking
at things said lucy when i know
something about them even if it is ever
so little
and then there is the hope tjw
grand thing that we are to see by and by
said harry papa when do you think
we shall see a steam engine 
very soon my dear said his father
we are now in lancashire where there
are many manufactories in which the machinery
is worked by steam engines i
hope that in the town in which we are to
breakfast i shall be able to show you
the grand thing as you call it harry
to day this morning exclaimed
lucy
harry in grave delight rose from his
seat to return his very best thanks and
in an uncommonly emphatic tone began
with 
i am very much obliged to you in
deed father
but while he was pronouncing this in
his sober manner a branch a tree under
which they were going caught his hat
and candied it off a little thing could
make lucy laugh before breakfast when
she was weak and hungry and long after
the hat had been regained and replaced
and after the accident was forgotten by
their father and mother who were quietly
reading lucy shook with inextinguishable
laughter even till they came in sight
 the town where they were to breakfast
after breakfast they walked with their
father and mother through the town to
the place where they were to see a steam
engine a variety objects caught lucy's
attention as they walked through the busy
streets but harry was so intent upon
what he expected to see at the his
walk that he did not look either to the
right or the left as he passed
much as his expectations had been
raised he was not disappointed when he
came to the reality the ease and silence
with which the huge beam the steam
engine moved up and down struck him
with admiration and he stood for sometime
satisfied with watching its uniform
motion next he enjoyed the pleasure
 recognizing each part the great machinery
that he had seen in the engravings
which he had studied and which
he had understood the descriptions
lucy could not immediately comprehend
what she saw she could not extend
her ideas from the small scale the
engravings to the great size the machine
which she now beheld another
difficulty occurred she could not at one
view take in all the parts she did not
know where to look for the boiler and the
cylinder and all the innumerable small
pipes puzzled her however with her
father's assistance she by degrees made
out the principal parts as they were seen
in different stages the building for all
could not be seen at once
goodnatured harry delayed to gratify
his own curiosity till lucy was quite clear
in every thing she wished to understand 
then he began to question his father he
wanted to know what work this steamengine
was doing he heard some sounds
like the working machinery and he
wished to see what was doing the
guide who had admitted them now
threw open a door and they saw a verylarge
apartment full whirling whirring
machinery rows spindles full 
cotton like the spindles a spinningwheel
standing upright in frames which
reached nearly across the room each
spindle being supplied by a long line 
untwisted cotton from spools or bobbins
above between each row stood a woman
or child watching the work and
keeping the machinery clean
this is one arkwright's cotton
mills said the guide all this machinery
is kept at work by this steam
engine and two other rooms full 
cottonframes which you may see if you
please above and below stairs
lucy uttered an exclamation surprise
harry was silent with admiration
turning back towards the steam engine
he looked about to find where and how
the motion was communicated from the
engine to the spinning machinery his
father who guessed what he was looking
for showed him where the shaft was carried
through the wall
harry had once seen a cotton manufactory
long ago but he had only a
confused remembrance whirling spools
and noise and dust here as he observed
there was scarcely any dust and
but little noise he was easier to examine
and anxious to understand all he saw
but while he was watching them the
quick motion the spinning spindles
suddenly ceased and looking back to
the steam engine he saw the huge beam
descending with a soft seemingly expiring
motion
what is the matter cried harry
nothing master answered the guide
smiling at his alarm nothing but that
it is our dinner time we stop the engine
and all the machines leave off working
for an hour till we come back and
set the engine going again
and is it possible that the steamengine
and all these machines can be
stopped so soon and so easily cried
harry
the man pleased by the great interest
which he saw that harry felt showed
him how the whole was stopped by
closing the valves the cylinder and
how the steam was let off after the engine
had been stopped
the women and children were now
clearing out the large room to go to
their dinners and in a few minutes the
apartment was emptied human creatures
and all was rest and silence harry
looked blank he was afraid that he
should not see hear or learn any thing
more and he told lucy he thought it
very unlucky that they had come at the
workmen's hour dinner but on the
contrary this proved a happy circumstance
 for their father asked and obtained
permission to stay during this
quiet hour in the cotton mill and he
made use this time to explain it and
to give them some account the beginning
and progress the invention and 
its improvement
probably all spinning said he was
originally done as it is now in the east
and in some the southern parts 
europe by holding in the left hand something
like a distaff with the material to
be spun wrapped round it with the right
hand the spinner draws out the fibres 
this material whatever it may be from
the distaff as in common spinning it is
twisted by a spool or spindle hanging at
the the thread the spool being
previously twirled by the finger and thumb
when the motion ceases or diminishes so
as not to be sufficient to twist the thread
what is spun is wound upon the spool and
the twirling is renewed this is a simple
but tedious mode spinning by degrees
it was improved and that ingenious contrivance
the spinningwheel such as that
with which you are well acquainted lucy
was brought into use in england for spinning
flax for spinning wool you know a
different sort machine is used
yes said lacy i recollect the large
high wheel with which i saw a woman
spinning wool
 now let us go on to the spinning 
cotton said her father and the machinery
for that purpose to understand and
follow the history any invention the first
thing necessary is to have a clear idea 
what is required to be done and the
difficulties that are to be conquered when
cotton is taken out the bale or large
parcel in which it is brought from the indies
it is generally in hard lumps sometimes
stringy to prepare it for carding
it is beaten with sticks to loosen it otherwise
it would break or spoil the teeth
 the cards it is then carded the sole
object which is to separate all the fibres
from each other cards something like those
you have seen used in carding common
wool are employed for this purpose the
cotton is taken from the card in the form
 a roll or tail about a foot long formerly
in the old way spinning the next
operation was to attach the this roll
to a wooden spindle placed horizontally
which could be turned round by a large
wheel the spinner gave the wheel a
twirl and immediately carrying back her
hand in which she held the other 
the roll the cotton was lengthened suppose
from one foot to five and at the
same time it was twisted the direction in
which the hand moved had always a certain
inclination to the spindle so that the
thread might slip off over the the
spindle at every revolution by this
means it is twisted
 yes said lucy i understand this 
i have seen it in spinning common wool
very well this is called longwheel
spinning continued her father but it
occurred to a poor weaver the name 
hargrave that he could improve this method
as but little strength was employed
in drawing out the cotton thread or in
turning the spindle which twisted it he
perceived that if one woman had ten pair
 hands and ten spindles and could move
them at once in the proper direction in
drawing out the cotton thread she could
spin ten times as much in the same
time
 papa interrupted lucy if the woman
had had a hundred spindles and a
hundred hands like briareus she might
have spun a hundred times as much
 not unless she had known how to use
her hundred hands said her father hands
without head would do little but now
without talking briareus how do you
think one head contrived to supply the
place many hands hargrave's difficulty
was to hold fast and draw out many threads
at once keeping them separate and pulling
them evenly while the spindles were
twisting them to accomplish this purpose
he took two slips wood and cut
their edges so that they could lie close together

like the edges a parallel ruler
said lucy
 yes said her father and between
the edges these he held fast the ends 
the several rolls cotton wool which
vol i li

 
were to be drawn out and twisted the
other ends the rolls course you know
were fastened on the spindles one on each 
and after they had been drawn out and
twisted the motion the spindles continuing
the thread was wound round upon
them now suppose the spindles to beset
in motion and that while they are turning
he draws his ruler back then you see
each roll cotton would be drawn out
and twisted at once as if each were spun
by a separate hand
i see said lucy at least i understand

 there are some contrivances necessary
in doing this which i will not
describe to you all the particulars lest i
should puzzle you added her father
 thank you papa said lucy but
how did the man set the spindles in motion
you said suppose they were turning
but you did not tell us how
he placed the spindles perpendicularly
side by side in a row eight i
think he tried at first and he set them in
motion by means the large wheel or
loig wheel as they call it which his wife
used in spinning wool so that they should
all move at once the wheel had a handle
which was turned by his wife whilst the
ruler which held the cotton roving was
drawn back and they were as he had expected
pulled out and twisted at the same
time
 how happy he must have been cried
harry when he first saw it do when
he saw the eight threads drawn out and
the spindles spinning them all at once 
how i should like to have been him at that
instant 
 i should have liked to have been in
his wife's place at that instant said lucy
how happy she must have been and his
children if they were standing by looking
at it so it succeeded perfectly
 not so fast lucy my dear it succeeded
for so much but far from perfectly
said her father his first was but a
very rude machine and he had much difficulty
in bringing it to a state fit for work

ing then he advanced from eight to ten
twenty eighty spindles and he improved
his machine so that it was brought into
common use and he called it a spinning
jenny
a spinning jenny very right
cried lucy i suppose his vsife's name
was jenny i hope he made a great deal
 money poor man to support his family
 i wonder how he came first to think
 this invention said harry
it is said answered his father but
i am not sure that it is true that the first
idea it was suggested to hargrave by
an accident a number young people
were one day assembled at his house at
the hour usually allotted for dinner they
were at play and they by chance overturned
the wheel at which hargrave's wife
was spinning wool the thread remained
in her hand and the spindle was then perpendicular
and the wheel horizontal the
wheel being prevented by the frame work
from touching the ground it continued to
turn round with the motion which had been
given to it and kept the spindle in motion
hargrave's attention was fixed upon it and
it is said that he uttered exclamations 
delight and again and again set the wheel
in motion while it lay on the floor and
stood looking at it a long time the bystanders
thinking that he did so only from
idleness
 aye but he was not idle said harry 
he was at work inventing at that moment
 but how did the overturning the
wheel help him 
 that part the story i am not
clear answered harry's father it is said
that hargrave had made attempts to spin
with two spindles with the common wheel
for spinning wool and that he had tried to
use his left hand as well as his right in
drawing out the thread but that he had
always found this attempt ineffectual on
account the horizontal position the
spindles but when he observed them
standing perpendicularly in the overturned
wheel he saw this difficulty obviated and
he thought so placing his spindles
so then cried lucy his invention
was made by accident by the lucky accident
 the overturning that spinning wheel
how often and how many inventions are
made by accident
no said her father inventions are
never made by accident to invent is to
combine or put things together for a particular
purpose this which requires
thought cannot be done by mere chance 
though accident may and often does suggest
the first hint an invention to an
observing mind or to a mind intent upon
accomplishing a particular purpose and
discovers the means that may be used 
as in this instance was the case with
hargrave how many people have seen
spinning wheels overturned without ever
inventing a spinning jenny but now
let me go on to tell you the next improvement
that was made in cotton spinning

 what did not the spinning jennies
do it all perfectly said lucy
 no no lucy said her father you
must not be in such a hurry we cannot
come to perfection so soon the spinning
jennies did only part what was wanted
the cottonthread spun by the jenny was
found to be rough spongy and weak it
could be used only for the woof in weaving
cotton the warp could not be made 
it the warp was then made linenthreads
which were strong and smooth
from what did this defect in the cotton
spun by the spinning jenny arise
from the fibres the cotton not being
laid smooth and parallel to each otherwhile
it was drawn out and twisting in
spinning by hand lucy you recollect seeing
the spinner not only draw the thread
out but press and move it at the same time
between her finger and thumb this
smoothed the fibres the cotton and
kept them parallel with each other now
this was wanting in the spinning jenny
the motion the hand in drawing out
the thread was well imitated by the rulers
or clasps which holding it fast when
drawn back answered the same purpose 
but the motion the spinner's finger and
thumb and the effect produced by it was
to be supplied
how did hargrave do that said
harry
he did not do it answered harry s
father it was accomplished by another
person mr arkwright who like hargrave
was originally a poor and illiterate
man but who had the habit observation
and the power invention
well how did arkwright do it said
harry eagerly
 by passing the cotton between rollers
said his father by passing it successively
between three pair rollers placed
near each other the upper roller each
pair is pressed down with different weights
the first pair rollers through which the
cotton is pressed and passed turns slowly 
the second faster and the third more
quickly each with a steady motion now
suppose harry that the last pair rollers
moved eight times as fast as the first pair
then eight times more length cotton
would pass between that pair rollers
than what had passed between the first
pair consequently the same quantity would
be drawn out to eight times the length and
eight times the fineness
very ingenious said harry i wonder
how arkwright came to think passing
the cotton between rollers
it is said harry replied his father
that arkwright had had frequent opportunities
 seeing in iron works iron bars
drawn out by being passed between rollers
and he afterwards applied this idea to
the drawing out cotton
i am surprised he ever thought it
said harry because the fine fibres 
cotton wool and iron bars are so different
still there is some likeness said
lucy in the motion drawing out the
thread thinner and thinner and smoother
and smoother so you see harry there
is good sometimes in observing likenesses
what i have said continued their
father may give you some idea the
effect the action the rollers i should
l
further tell you that in the undermost 
each pair rollers were cut fine little
grooves or furrows along the whole its
surface to roughen it so as to prevent the
cotton from slipping the upper rollers
were covered with leather the passing
the cotton iovings between these rollers
pressed together as i have described to
you with different weights and moving
with different velocities had the same
effect upon the cotton as that which is produced
by the pressure and motion the
spinner's finger and thumb smoothing
down the loose fibres laying and keeping
them parallel with each other and at the
same time drawing them out so as to make
a finer thread
so at last said lucy arkwright did
by the use rollers what a woman did
at first by the motion her finger and
thumb
yes said harry but consider how
much more was done in the same time in
one day perhaps by the rollers than a woman
could do in her whole life spinning
and how difficult and how very ingenious
it was to imitate by machinery that motion
 the finger and thumb and this
was mr arkwright's great invention
it was said his father
but what became the spinning
jennies said harry were they laid
aside when arkwright made these improvements
and erected these mills
the spinning jennies are very much
laid aside i believe said his father inconsequence
 the defects which i mentioned
but for some purposes the cotton
they spin is preferable and for these the
jennies are still used
 since arkwright's time have any
great improvements been made father
said harry
no improvement has been made in
the principle his mode spinning but
many in the simplicity and the perfecting
 the machinery the use steam and
steam engines instead water and waterwheels
for keeping these mills in motion
is in many places great importance
 the various improvements in the detail
 the machinery i will only mention one
to you an invention made by a mr samuel
crompton
that's right said harry i am glad
papa always remembers and tells the name
 the inventors
mr crompton observed and joined
together much that was essentially useful
in hargrave's spinning jenny and in arkwright's
rollers or twist frame and he made
a third machine which combined many 
the advantages the former two and
which is preferred for spinning fine cotton
but is inferior in spinning coarse this
machine is called the mule
 should like to see the mule said
harry
but you cannot see and understand
every thing at once said his father
 hear the workmen coming from dinner
said lucy
now we shall see this cottonmill 
arkwright's at work said harry
the guide coming in at this moment
and hearing the last words harry said and
the name arkwright began to speak 
the immense fortune which sir richard had
made by his inventions and improvements
sir richard interrupted hairy
how did he grow into sir richard
the king conferred upon him the honour
 knighthood answered the workman
and he went on speaking the fine
houses and estates sir richard arkwright
and his descendants have purchased
did you ever hear sir said he 
the birthday present which sir richardson
made to each his six sons each
found on his table on the morning his
birthday twenty thousand pounds
twenty thousand pounds six times
twenty said lucy that is one hundred
and twenty thousand pounds what a
sum 
and all the consequence one man's
invention said harry
and industry and perseverance said
his father arkwright had great difficulties
to struggle with not only in perfecting
his contrivance but in reducing it
to practice and in establishing his right to
the invention
the workmen were by this time pouring
into the room men women and children
and the machinery was set agoing again ina
minute or two and all were busy even
lucy as well as harry had some idea 
what was doing they knew the use 
the spindles and the cylinders without
being perplexed by the smaller parts
 the machinery they had a complete
view each process that the cottonwool
undergoes after it is taken out its
pod till it is manufactured into the finest
cotton
as they were leaving one the rooms
the guide showed them a heap hanks or
skeins cotton yarn all which as he told
them had been spun by the mule from a
single pound fine cotton
there are here three hundred and
fifty hanks said he and each hank
would measure eight hundred and forty
yards and the whole if stretched out
would make a thread one hundred and
sixtyseven miles in length
 one hundred and sixty seven miles
repeated lucy what would your flying
spiders say to this harry
or your silkworms lucy said
harry i think your good active best 
silkworms never spun more than a silk
the length six miles
at any rate said lucy men and
women beat spiders and silkworms both
in spinning
her father observed that the proper
object comparison between rival spinners
is not the length the thread but
the fineness and i apprehend said
he that either a silkworm or spiders
thread is as fine as one fibre cotton
wool and the finest thread cotton must
be composed many fibres so that
notwithstanding lucy's exultation in the
superiority men and women spinners
over worms and spiders harry was compelled
to give judgment in favour the
animals
 but their superiority is owing only to
instinct and ours to ingenuity and reason
you know harry said lucy it is no
merit theirs that they have their materials
prepared for them better than we
have
here the debate about the spiders and
silkworms was interrupted by the entrance
 a gentleman who was the principal
proprietor the cotton manufactory
and the conversation turned upon the prodigious
sale cotton goods and muslin
in different parts the world especially
in england
you are aware madam said he
turning to lucy's mother that muslin
were formerly all made in india and that
it is only thirty or forty years since we
first attempted to make them in england
and not till within these few years that we
have brought them to their present perfection

lucy's mother was well aware this 
she said she remembered when she was a
child seeing some the first muslin made
in england and that it was coarse and
rough and looked ill and wore ill and
that no one then thought english could
ever equal indian muslin but now it is
difficult for the nicest eye to detect the difference
in the appearance and in the wearing
 they are as good if not better
harry's father turned to him and whispered
 if you put me in mind i will tell
you some other time by what ingenious and
bold contrivance that roughness in the
first english muslin which your mother
complained was afterwards prevented
the gentleman continued speaking and
when harry heard his voice again he was
telling the immense quantity and value
 the muslin now made in england and
scotland
all this we owe said he to our
using ingenious machinery in these countries
instead doing all by the labour
 men's hands as in india perhaps you
are not yet aware sir said he turning
to harry's father the magnitude 
the cotton manufacture ita machinery
earns for england one thousand pounds
every working hour forty thousand
pounds weight cotton wool is spun and
in three minutes the length the thread
spun would more than circumscribe the
whole earth
as this was said they were passing
through an apartment where lucy saw a
machine for winding the pretty little balls
 cotton she wished to stay to look at it
 oh papa may i not look at this
but her father answered no my
dear you have seen and heard enough 
quite enough if you were to see more
you would confuse what i hope is now
clear in your heads come away
in the evening lucy acknowledged that
she was rather tired and was glad to rest
and to stay with her mother who did not
wish to go out again but harry boasting
that he was as fresh as ever was proud
to be allowed to accompany his father who
was going to walk out to see the town
after passing through several streets
they came to a broad public walk on a
high terrace shaded with trees from
whence looking back they had a fine
view the town by the red light the
setting sun which beautifully illuminated
several windows especially those a
gothic church as harry was returning
through the streets he regretted that lucy
had not been with them and he asked his
father whether they were to go avvay from
this town early in the morning or if he
would stay another day his father who
perhaps was thinking something else
answered in an absent manner i do not
know my dear that will depend upon
circumstances
harry was considering as he trudged
on what could be meant by that will
depend upon circumstances when on
turning the corner the street his thoughts
were stopped and his eyes struck with a
sudden blaze lights gas lights harry's
admiration lasted in silence the whole
length the street when turning into
another still more bright he exclaimed
it is almost as light as day father
what kind lights are these and what
are they made 
his father told him that they were
called gas lights and that they were made
 gas obtained from coal
harry asked how is gas different
from other flame candle or fire 
his father told him that all flame is gas
set on fire in a common fire in a candle
or lamp what you see and call flame is
gas which when set on fire continues to
flame when exposed to the air
harry asked how is gas got out 
coal
his father told him by the coal
being strongly heated in iron vessels called
retorts which have but one opening for the
gas to escape from into the reservoir where
it is preserved
harry next inquired how the gas gets
from the reservoir to the small pipes so
as to light all the houses in the street
where he saw gas flaming at the windows
suppose a tumbler to be inverted in a
bason water said his father you
know that as there is air with inside the
tumbler that air will prevent it from sinking
in the water
certainly said harry
but you may put weight upon the
tumbler till you compress the air in the
inside and then the water will first rise to
supply the place the compressed air and
what will happen afterwards harry 
i think nothing would happen father
but that the water in the bason would continue
pressing up the air till it had forced
it into the smallest space possible
very true to the smallest space to
which it is possible for the water to compress
it but the air being compressed its
elasticity continually increases till it not
only resists the pressure the water but
drives out the water from the tumbler and
raises it in the surrounding bason now
suppose one a small pipe were
introduced under the edge the tumbler
what would happen
the compressed air would be forced
into the pipe to be sure said harry
and if the pipe were open at the
other said his father
the air would go out at the other
 said harry
and what would happen to the
tumbler said his father
the tumbler would continue descending
till all the air was driven through the
pipe answered harry
it would so now instead common
air suppose your tumbler filled with
gas exactly the same thing would take
place this is called a gas holder and
this is the manner in which the gas is continually
forced from the reservoir through
the pipes
i understand it said harry and
i hope you will some time or other show
this experiment to lucy it would be
very easily done with a glass and
bason
 you may show it to her yourself
said his father
does the gas light immediately 
itself when it comes into the air
no when a person wants to light it
he holds a candle to it and it flames as
you see in the open air
suppose it was to rain or suppose
the wind blew strong said harry what
would become these lights look at
these flaring without any glass round
them in the open window in this butcher's
shop would not they be extinguished
 
not by slight rain or wind said his
father one great advantage gaslights
is that they are not easily extinguished
by rain or wind
harry's admiration increasing the more
he heard their advantages and considered
their convenience and beautiful
brightness he wondered why people had
not thought using them sooner and
he asked if this gas had never been known
to exist till now
his father told him that it had been
long known as what we see in the flame
 fire and candles but that till lately
no one had thought obtaining it in
quantities and bringing it into common
use in the manner in which he now saw
it i could tell you harry two curious
anecdotes which i heard from a friend
can you father said harry then
pray do will you be so good as to tell
them to me now 
if you will mind where you are going
and not run into the gutter said his
father
about forty years ago a certain lord
dundonald had a patent for making what
is called coat from coal coat is halfburnt
coal such as you have seen used
in forges to obtain the coat he halfburned
the coal and the tar and gas which
were in the coal were by this process separated
the coat being his only object the
gas was conducted under water many hundred
yards in large tunnels in order to
condense the tar and the gas escaped out
 a high chimney how it became lighted
my friend said he did not know but once
lighted it continued to burn and the
flame illuminated the country for twenty
miles round
i wish i had seen it said harry
how grand and beautiful it must have
looked but when people saw this i wonder
no one thought directly making use
 the gas and obtaining it in the same
way for lamps
it is the more surprising said his
father because it was in fact a gas apparatus
like that at present used only the
gas was suffered to escape and waste itself

but father said harry what was
the other anecdote 
long before this lord dundonald s
time there was a chemist whose name i
do not recollect who made gas from coal
and stored it in bladders and frequently
vol i m
amused his friends by pricking a hole in
the bladder and then applying a light toit
this was portable gas such as people
are now beginning to use only in a different
case
well this is more extraordinary still
said harry because that gas in the bladder
was in such a convenient form for
carrying about it is wonderful that neither
he nor any his friends who saw it ever
thought making use it for lamps i
wish i had been by when he showed the
bladder and pricked it and set fire to
the gas father even such a boy as
i might have thought it might not
i
 you might harry said his father
but how few men to say nothing boys
observe what they see any day or everyday
or think what use can be made it 
but so striking a thing and so obvious
a use said harry what seems
so easy and natural now that it is done 
true harry the thing was there
before their eyes but useless because they
did not think making use it
and for forty years and more said
harry
after a long silence during which
harry stumbled sundry times he exclaimed

father i am thinking 
not where you are going said
his father
but i am thinking father that there
are a gieat many other little things which
people have not yet observed that may
lead to great things if people think 
putting them to use
undoubtedly said his father in
this you are very right
 and father do you think that if i
try to observe and consider what use i
could put things to i shall ever discover
or invent any thing new
harry was here interrupted by stumbling
over a walking stick with which
a man whom they met was feeling his
way and which harry had not observed
 
i wish that man would not poke out
his stick so said harry it nearly threw
me down
the man begged his pardon said he
was blind and was forced to grope his
way with his stick harry now begged
his pardon for running against his stick
and guided him across to the next street
and the old man wished him a good night
and said
 may you never be blind as i am and
whenever you are old may you meet with
help as i have from you
as soon as the blind man had left them
harry began to recollect what he was saying
when he first met him and he would
have resumed the conversation but his father
told him that he could not talk to him
any more now and that he must walk fast
for it was getting late harry trudged on
as quickly as he could his father thought
he must be tired and so he was but he
scorned to complain
it was late when they reached the inn
tea had been waiting some time and
lucy after struggling to keep herself
awake had fairly given up the point and
had fallen asleep her head resting on her
arms which were crossed on the table
she was so fast asleep that she could
hardly be wakened sufficiently when harry
came in to ask whether he had had a pleasant
walk after swallowing a cup tea
with her eyes half shut she submissively
obeyed the signal the chambermaid with
bedchamber candles and retired to that
rest which she much wanted
harry would stay up to listen to a conversation
between his father and a postillion
from which he hoped to discover
what would be done in the morning and
what was meant by that will depend
upon circumstances but before he had
made this out he fell fast asleep across the
great black trunk where he lay unobserved
till the waiter tumbled over his legs and
let fall a spoon upon his head harry
started up he had dreamt as he said
that he had been struck by the beam a
steam engine his mother exhorted him
to go and dream in bed she took up a
candle to light him on his way but he
turned and stood looking at the postillion
astonished to see him still standing there
and his father still talking to him
mother what an immense time this
man has been standing talking said
harry
 not above five minutes my dear
replied his mother
five minutes only cried harry i
have been in that time all the way to germany
and back again at a palace magnificently
lighted up with flaming crocuses
 gas i asked whose house it was do
not you know said the man it is your
friend the great otto guerick's i was not
surprised that he was living still i only said
i would go and see him but the inside
 the palace was like a cottonmill and
there was a great steam engine going on
working away through all the workmen
and women and children i went on
asking for otto guerick till at last one
guideman said he would show me the
s
ay to otto's laboratory where he was
trying experiments always in his silk nightgown
but the man said the laboratory
was at the top the house and asked if
i could follow him up high ladders oh
yes i said as high as ever he pleased so
i went scrambling on after him and if my
foot had slipped i should have gone down
down down i do not know where but i
reached the top and a door opened and
i heard the rustling otto guerick's
silk nightgown and i was just going in
when that spoon which i thought was the
beam a steam engine fell upon my
head oh mother i wish it had not
fallen it was so provoking to be wakened
at that moment just when i was going into
see otto guerick i wish that i could
dream it over again
you had best sleep again harry my
dear said his mother and this time
sleep in your bed come said she
showing him the way through the passage
to his bedroom where she put into his
hands his nightcap which lucy even in
the depth her own sleepiness had remembered
to leave ready for him
harry slept nine hours without intermission
but he saw no more otto
guerick or his gas illuminated mansion
he was still fast asleep when his
mother called him during breakfast his
father and mother talked about the various
noises they had heard in this inn all night
and by which they had been so much disturbed
that they could not sleep his
mother said that a coach had arrived or
set out every half hour that she had heard
bells and calls hostlers and chambermaids
and waiters running to and fro in
the passages continually and people calling
perpetually for their trunks and portmanteaus
and parcels and bills harry's
father said that the partition between their
room and the next was so thin that they
could hear every sound and there was a
man in that room who seemed to be pulling
off his boots and throwing them down
and throwing wooden legs after them all
night
harry and lucy looked at each other
when their father and mother talked 
all these noises they were surprised for
they had slept so soundly that they had
not heard them
during breakfast harry told lucy that
it depended upon circumstances whether
they were to go on with their journey today
or to stay in this town lucy said
she was not at all the wiser as she did
not know what circumstances he meant
their mother told them that it depended
upon a letter which his father expected to
receive by the post to tell him whether
his friend would return home this
day or not harry's only reason for wishing
to stay was that lucy might see the
pretty walk he had taken the preceding
evening but as it was now raining they
could not walk and he was glad that they
were not to spend the day at the inn
where they had nothing to do
what shall we see next said lucy
as she got into the carriage i like sfo
ino on to something new
m 
o
 if you had your choice harry what
would you wish to see next said lucy
a mountain said harry who was
faithful to his old wish for a mountain to measure
with his portable barometer while
he had been taken up with the cotton manufactory
and the steamengine and the gaslights
this wish had slept in his mind but
it was now awakened with fresh eagerness
as they journeyed on he eyed the outline
 every hill on the horizon but he observed
a discreet silence upon the subject
even when lucy exclaimed here's a
mountain coming for you harry he replied
soberly so i see my dear but it
is not near enough yet i will speak when
i think it is time
at last when they came into derbyshire
and into the hilly parts that county
harry spoke for he thought it was time
 father here are plenty mountains 
will you be so good as to stop the carriage
and to let me get out that i may measure
this one which is almost close to us i will
not detain you above twenty minutes mother
if you could be so good as to wait 
in ten minutes i would run up in ten minutes
i would be down again may i
father
no harry said his father we cannot
stop for you now it would detain
us much longer than you imagine your
eye deceives you in judging distances
and heights to which it is unaccustomed

for your comfort harry added his
mother we are going to matlock a
place where you will find yourself surrounded
by fine mountains upon which
you may try your own and your barometer's
measuring powers at leisure for we
shall stay there two or three days
delightful thought harry thank
you mother said he
presently they entered a narrow but
beautiful valley a stream ran through it
and there were hills on each side their
banks were covered to a great height with
trees the softest foliage and various
shades green tinged here and there with
the brown and yellow colours autumn
above high above the young feathery
plantations and the scrubby brushwood
rose bare whitish rocks sometimes
stretching in perpendicular smooth masses 
sometimes broken in abrupt craggy summits
huge fragments from which had fallen
into the river below the river flowed
tranquil and placid till when opposed by
these massy fragments it foamed and
frothed against their immoveable sides 
then separating the waters whirled round
them in different currents and joining
again the stream ran on its course sparkling
in the sunshine the road now lying
beside this river brought them soon to
the pretty straggling village matlock
the morning after their arrival they
went out to walk at a lite distance from
the hotel where they lodged was a walk
up masonhill it was a zigzag path cut
through a wood fir trees reaching to
the summit called the heights abraham
they went part the way up this path
and harry was eager to go to the very top
but his mother was not able she said to
go quite to the heights abraham she
and his father and lucy went to see a
cave in this hill but his father told harry
that he might go on by himself if he liked
it to the top masonhill and take its
height with his barometer and compare
this with the reputed height which is said
to be about feet
harry to lucy's surprise stood hesitating
with his barometer in his hand instead
 going on with the alacrity she expected

 what is the matter would you rather
come with us to see the cave said lucy
no said harry that is not the
thing
what then said lucy ado you
want me to go with you i should like it 
but you know mamma said that i must not
go running about everywhere with you
here as i do at home i must stay with
mamma but you look afraid to go by
yourself added lucy laughing
afraid my dear i am not the least
afraid to go by myself anywhere in the
world said harry proudly am not
going to do any thing wrong what should
i be afraid 
i do not know said lucy that is
what i want you to tell me i am sure
there is something you do not like or else
why do not you set off
there is something i do not like
said harry that i acknowledge i do
not like to meet those people who are
there farther up on the walk
 what harm will they do you harry
said his father
no harm father only i do not like to
meet them because they are strangers
but since as you observed harry you
are not going to do any thing wrong you
need not be ashamed i will not say
afraid to meet them said his mother
that is very true mother said harry
i know it is very foolish well i will
conquer it i will go on by myself added
he resolutely
go on and prosper then said his father
 i dare say that those people will
never think about you unless you do something
to attract their attention
harry walked off as fast as he could 
nor stopped till he reached the heights 
abraham then he took out his barometer
and noted down the height at which
the mercury stood both in the barometer
and thermometer then he went down
the hill and as soon as he had reached
the bottom he looked at the mercury
again in each noting down carefully
these heights also finding a retired
nook away from the public path he sat
down to work at his calculations resolved
not to stir till he had completed
them on his barometer there was engraved
a table the heights at which
the mercury stands at different elevations
calculated when the atmosphere is at the
freezing point besides this he had taken
care to bring with him a certain little 
 an expeditious method determining alti
containing an expeditious method 
calculating altitudes the want which
had in his first attempt to measure the
church prevented his succeeding to his satisfaction
now understanding and following
the directions contained in this
little trusty companion to his dear portable
barometer he made his calculations
sufficiently accurate to satisfy his conscience
he brought his answer within two
feet the height which his father had
told him had been determined by previous
measurement
he next went to look for the cave
it was a large deep dark cavern at the
farther which he perceived light 
and as he advanced he saw the forms 
men the guides who held torches
and he heard lucy's voice and the voices
 his father and mother and soon disquietudes
with the new portable mountain barometer 
with a description that instrument by sir harry
englefield bart
a little tract which is or ought to be sold with
every portable barometer
gushed their figures they were all
looking up at the roof on which the
guides with raised torches threw a strong
light from the roof which appeared encrusted
all over with yellow earth hung
multitudes what seemed like earthy
icicles the same colour and enormous
bulk
my dear harry are you there cried
lucy i am glad you are come i was
so afraid you would not come in time to
see these are not they beautiful do you
know what they are they are stalactites

and how came they there said
harry and what are they you tell me
they are stalactites but that tells me nothing
but their name
it is a good thing in the first place
said lucy to know the name because
then we can ask people questions and
then they will know what we are talking
about she told him all she had just
learned from what she had heard the
guides and her father say that these
s
stalactites were formed by the water
oozing through the roof the cavern
and depositing as it trickled downs some
calcareous earth which it had dissolved
in its course through the soil and rocks
along and down which it had passed
she believed that these rocks were calcareous
or limestone she had further
heard one the guides say that some
stalactites found in this country became
almost as hard as stones were various
colours and had been polished and made
into necklaces and different ornaments
the tides had broken off from the sides
 the cave some the stalactites and
had given pieces them to lucy some
 these which had been newly formed
were softish and crumbled easily when
pressed between the fingers some were
a little harder and crisp cracking rather
than mouldering when pressed others
were as hard harry observed as some
petrifaction which he had seen in his
uncle's collection his father told him
that those petrifaction had been formed
in the same manner in which these stalactites
were formed and the guides
said that they would show him plenty 
petrifaction and crystals and beautiful
spars different colours for which derbyshire
is famous
while all this was saying lucy's mother
who did not like standing still long
in this damp cavern had by gentle
degrees alternately drawing lucy on by
the hand and urging harry forward by
the shoulder kept moving onwards till
they found themselves again at the entrance
or the exit the cave they were
glad to see the daylight to feel the fresh
warm air and to tread again on dry
ground
several boys and girls met them in
their way to the hotel with baskets
 crystals spars and petrifaction in
one basket lucy saw a petrified wig
the guides told her that the people 
matlock amuse themselves by putting
wigs and different things in these calcareous
springs to have them as they say
converted into stone such they seem
to turn into as no appearance the
original substance is left except the form
but as harry observed it is not that the
substance turns into stone but that the
calcareous deposition covers it all over
and the original substance in time decaying
nothing afterwards is left but calcareous
stone in another basket lucy saw
spars various colours some purple
and some amber different shades
in rainbow stripes or cloudlike streaks
some these spars were made into
hearts and necklaces and boxes and
urns and eggs and various trinkets
lucy's mother told her that she might
choose any one these things she liked
lucy chose a polished shaded
purple spar it seemed transparent and
looked as if you could see into it to a
great depth but when lucy tried to open
it she found that it did not open
 what use then can it be 
it had a little gold ring at the top it
and was intended to be used as a netting
weight lucy had been long making a
purse for her father she was sure that
the pleasure using this pretty weight
would encourage her to go on netting it
as soon as ever they should come to the
 their journey but how was the
egg to be carried her father said he
could not have it rolling about the carriage
and the pockets were already filly
occupied lucy would have been reduced
to take a flat heart instead her
beautiful egg if harry good at need
had not stepped forward and opening
wide as he could stretch the mouth 
his waistcoat pocket bid her put her egg
in there where there is plenty and
plenty room added he shrinking in
his stomach to show the ample space
my dear harry you are very good
said lucy
not the least said harry i
should be very bad if i did not recollect
how good you were about my camera
obscura which you crammed into the
trunk come drop your egg in here at
once and say no more about it
she dropped it into the pocket
 but my dear harry it looks as if you
had a great swelling people will stare
i do not care said harry let them
stare
this was indeed as lucy knew a great
proof harry's affection for in general
he disliked excessively to be stared at
and avoided every thing that could bring
upon him such a misfortune
besides added he patting down the
egg in his pocket it does not stick out
now more than my ball which i have
often carried here and nobody ever
noticed it except my mother indeed
now i have got it into the corner you see
it is not a greater lump than my pocket
handkerchief which sticks out as much
on the other side so all's right
but if you were to tumble down the
hard egg might hurt you harry
i might hurt it said harry for i
should break it i suppose but my dear
i never that is hardly ever tumble down 
and now i have this egg it will make me
more careful so say no more about it
now i want to tell you about the heights
 abraham
he had prudently forborne to speak
 his operations while her head had
been full stalactites and spars and
wigs she now listened to him with due
sympathy and was delighted when he
informed her that his barometer measurement
came right within two feet his
father congratulated him upon his success
with which he was particularly pleased
because it was the consequence perseverance
he was glad to see that his
son would not be satisfied till he had
rectified his errors and had been as exact
as he possibly could this promised
well for his future progress all the rest
was mere child's play very few
uncles said he would have given a
portable barometer to a boy your age
i am glad you can prove to him that you
have been able to use his present and
that it has been service to you
harry
it was lucky for me said harry
 that there was nobody by on those
heights abraham when i was at my
work and lucky too when i came to
the bottom the hill that i found a snug
place out the way every body where
i made my calculations or else i am sure
they would have been all wrong
 that would have been a pity said
lucy after all your pains
therefore it would be a oreat advantage
to you harry said his father
 if you could learn to calculate and to
be able to go on with whatever you are
doing when people are looking at you
as well as when you are by yourself
because you cannot hope always to be
alone when you want to think nor can
you always hope to find snug solitary
places for your calculations every common
schoolboy is forced to learn his
lesson and to cast up sums without being
disturbed by strangers all this is easily
learned by practice
aye by practice i dare say said
harry
and i will tell you what you can da
by your own sense added his father 
upon every opportunity try to conquer
your dislike to going among strangers and
then you will get over your bashfulness
father then if you please i will go
with you to day and dine at the public
table instead staying with my mother
and lucy
right my boy so you shall
when dinner time came harry went
along with his father and as he walked
into the public room said to himself
i am doing nothing wrong i need not
be ashamed i will not be bashful
still a mist confusion came before his
eyes when seated beside his father at a
very long table he saw opposite to him
a line strangers and on all sides 
him strangers he scarcely ventured to
look up at their faces he was seized
vol i n
with one his fits the cramp bashfulness
under which he sat suffering and
stiffened blushing and conscious that he
was blushing scarcely able to answer
yes or no thank you when he was
asked what he would have he thought
that every body must take him for a fool
and this made him feel more uneasy and
awkward he scarcely saw or knew what
he was doing he threw down first one
thing then another first his fork then his
bread in reaching for the fork then the
salt cellar and at last a glass water
into his father's plate it was weh it was
no worse his father set the glass up
again sent away his plate and said nothing
about it harry wished he was in his
mother's room or under the table or anywhere
but where he was his blunders
and disasters had more and more provoked
him with himself and he thought
he had disgraced himself for ever and
that people must think he was a vulgar
creature or a child not fit to dine with
men or gentlemen nor used to dine anywhere
but in the nursery his face was
by this time all burning with shame and
scarlet up to the roots his hair
while he was in this condition the lady
who was sitting beside him asked him if
she should help him to some oysters he
happened to dislike oysters and he answered
 no thank you in rather a surly
tone and then thinking he had done
wrong to answer so gruffly held his plate
out and said if you please ma'am
but you have not finished your sweetmeat
i did not observe that said the
lady you do not like sweetmeats and
oysters together do you my dear
 i do not care ma'am thank your said
harry
you are not the young gentleman
are you said the lady whom met
this morning with a barometer in his
hand 
i do not remember meeting you
ma am said harry but i had a barometer
in my hand
really i should not have thought you
n
were the same may i ask what you were
doing with that barometer
i cannot explain it to you ma'am
now said harry
a gentleman luckily asked her at this
moment to drink a glass wine and she
turned away from harry and thought no
more about him or her question still his
father took no notice him but left him
to recover himself by degrees and to find
out the truth that people were thinking 
themselves much more than him gradually
he came to the use his senses and
understanding so far as to hear and comprehend
something entertaining which a
gentleman who sat opposite was relating
as soon as harry became interested in listening
to what this gentleman was saying
he stiffened looked up moved forward
on his chair forgot his blushes and his
blunders and all his fears having disgraced
himself in short he forgot himself
altogether
the gentleman was giving an account
 the plundering a vessel which had
been stranded on the coast south wales
in st bride's bay it was a transport
laden with ordnance stores from america
harry made out that ordnance stores
here meant gunpowder and guns some
 the people on the coast saw the signals
 distress which were made by the persons
on board the vessel but instead 
putting out boats and going to their assistance
these wicked people thought only 
plundering the vessel and carrying away
every thing they could for themselves
they assembled on the beach and waited
there till the ship was driven on shore
and wrecked while the poor people onboard
were trying to save their lives these
plunderers were busy carrying off all they
could from the wreck they boarded her
as soon as possible because they knew that
as soon as ever the gentlemen the country
should hear that a vessel had been
wrecked they would come to assist the
sufferers and to prevent the plunder
the mob made such haste that they got
possession their prey and landed a considerable
quantity gunpowder from the
stranded vessel many the plunderers
were loaded with as much as they could
carry while others were struggling for
their share the booty as their confederates
were dragging it on the shore
in this scene confusion and in these
struggles a quantity the gunpowder
was scattered on the shore and on the
rocks one the ringleaders the mob
quarrelling with another who had got possession
 a musket which he wanted to
have for himself seized it and threw it
from him with violence what happened
none could exactly see as it all passed so
quickly but probably the musket had
struck against a flint a single spark was
enough set fire to the gunpowder which
was scattered over the rock one explosion
after another was heard one
train communicated to another and in a
few seconds the whole strand and rocks
seemed wrapped in fire and smoke many
 the plunderers were killed on the spot
others were dreadfully maimed and died
lingering deaths the man who threw the
musket absconded and was never heard
 afterwards
while harry listened to this dreadful but
true story pity for the shipwrecked people
who perished for want timely assistance
indignation against the wretches who
thought only plundering the wreck
wretches such as he could hardly believe
to exist horror at the catastrophe an awful
sense the justice the punishment
which they immediately brought upon
themselves and satisfaction that they
gained nothing by their crime altogether
filled his mind and these successive sentiments
and reflections so absorbed hin
that he completely forgot every thing else
forgot where he was and who was by
and all his own little foolish feelings
what was become his bashfulness it
was all gone gone off with that superfluous
anxiety which he had felt about the
opinions the surrounding people might
form him
after they left matlock the road appeared
uninteresting to our travellers
but they had books in the carriage and
lucy's mother began to read at first to
herself and afterwards to her companions
when she found any thing that she thought
would entertain them
 here is an account said she the
various stinging insects which infest parts
 south america where the inhabitants
pass their lives complaining the insufferable
torment the moschettoes
will you be so good as to read it tous
now said lucy i am so very comfortably
settled with your dressing box
under my feet
 persons who have not navigated the
great rivers south america for instance
the oroonoko and the rio magdalena can
scarcely conceive how at every instant 
life you may be tormented by insects flying
in the air and how the multitude 
these little animals may render vast regions
almost uninhabitable they cover
your face and hands pierce clothes with
their long sucker in the form a needle
get into your mouth and nostrils and set
you coughing and sneezing whenever you
attempt to speak in the open air in the
villages on the banks the oroonoko
which are surrounded by immense forests
the plague flies affords an inexhaustible
subject conversation when two persons
meet in the morning the first questions
they address to each other are how did
you find the zancudoes during the night
how are we today as to moschettoes 
at new barcelona the wretched inhabitants
generally stretch themselves on the
ground and pass the night buried in sand
three or four inches deep leaving out their
heads only which they cover with handkerchiefs
farther on the traveller fares
worse for he comes to the region the
sorrowful people as they are called who are
doomed to be for ever tortured by these in
humboldt personal narrative vol v
n 
sects one poor monk who had spent
as he said his twenty years moschet
toes in that country desired humboldt and
his companions to tell the people in europe
what the poor monks suffer m the
forests south america when an inferior
monk commits any fault his superior
exiles him to this country and they call it
being condemned to the moschettoes
lucy said she was glad she was not condemned
to the moschettoes and she asked
her mother if there was any more that was
entertaining about them her mother read
to her an account the different kinds 
stinging insects which mount guard at
different hours the day and night just
at the time when one party are flying
away and when the next have not fixed
or as soldiers would say at the time 
relieving guard there is an interval repose
the different hours the day and
night are marked and known to the inhabitants
by the different stinging flies so
that as they say they could tell blindfold
what hour it is by the sting the last or
the hum the coming torment
horrible creatures said lucy i
am very glad we have none them in our
country
horrible repeated harry in an absent
tone he seemed to be heartily glad
to have this history the moschettoes
finished and to get rid them they
had prevented him from fixing his attention
upon something which he wanted to
think 
the moment his mother's closing tone
announced that she had finished he threw
himself half over his side the carriage
and beoan to watch the hind wheel
is there anv think the matter with the
wheel brother said lucy
 nothing my dear i am only thinking
 something
take care harry said his mother
i think you will fall out
 no thank you mamma there is no danger
 that i am holding by the holders
said harry
there was nothing more to be said about
the safety the position he had chosen 
something might perhaps have been said
about its unsociability but his mother went
on reading and his father and lucy were
listening to her
oh harry cried lucy listen to
this here are the termites the great ants
will not you hear about them
thank you said harry i have
heard enough about them
she left him to his wheel for some time
but presently returned again with 
 oh harry did you hear that about
the jaguar that came bounding to the
shore to play with the little girl and tore
the skin her forehead and she drove
him away with the bough a tree only
think the jaguar 
 my dear lucy you jogged me and put
me out in my count now i must begin
all over again said harry
she drew back but after some little time
exclaimed again 
harry oh harry hear this i shirt
tret i my dear harry a real name a real
tree fifty feet high shirts ready made grow
upon them without a seam 
one hundred and fiftyfive i am very
glad it one hundred and fiftyseven
said harry continuing to count on
if the shirttree won't do nothing
will thought lucy and she sat down
and sat still during many pages then starting
up again she threw her arm round him
 oh harry harry the most beautiful
story you ever heard a mother in
search her children who went through
such difficulties and such places as no person
had ever the courage to go through
before and lived for four days on nothing
but black ants and was stretched upon the
rack at last and tortured oh harry
won't you listen to the it
two hundred and twentyone my
dear another time you will tell it to me 
two hundred and twentytwo
lucy gave it up left him to himself and
listened to the the story sorry
however that he could not or would not
enjoy the pleasure with her
after this story the piedra del la
madre or rock the mother was finished
lucy's mother was tired reading aloud
her father took up a to read to himself
and lucy who had the happy power
either travelling or at home being able
to amuse herself began to point out to her
mother every thing or animal she saw on
the road which she thought would look
pretty in drawing
 look mamma at that woman who is
crossing the field with a basket hay on
her back and the cow following without
her perceiving it and eating the hay is it
not like one the vignettes in bewick
mamma as you are not busy now whenever
i see what i think would be a good
bewick on the road i will tell you and
you will tell me whether you think it
would be pretty or not
look at this old tired soldier stopping
beside the well and the little girl holding
up a tin can that she has just filled now
he is stooping to drink and she is putting
back her hair off her forehead and the
setting sun full on her face would not
this be a pretty bewick
her father who had now finished what
he was reading and who was always
cheerful and sociable put away his 
and looked out the window joining with
lucy and her mother in their diversion
presently he saw an old man and woman
trudging together down a lane that led to
a wood and he began to sing a favourite
song lucy's in which she immediately
joined 
 there was an old man who lived in a wood
as you may plainly see
he said he could do more work in a day
than his wife could do in three

with all my heart the old woman said
if you will me allow
you shall stay at home to day
and i'll go follow the plough
harry turned about and looked much
discomfited by the singing and lucy
said 
join us harry oh join us you know
it
but harry replied only by stopping both
his ears and hanging again out the
carriage window further than before the
singing in full glee was continuing when
harry drew in his head and rubbing his
hands exclaimed as he threw himself back
in his corner 
 i have it i have found it out papa 
his father did not ask what he had
found out but went on singing
father said harry will you explain
to me now what is meant by a patent
or by taking out a patent for an invention

i am singing do not you hear said
his father go on lucy go on singing
with me
when they had finished the song harry
asked his question again about the patent
for an invention but his father did not
listen to him
 papa cried harry after eagerlywaiting
for the moment when as he thought
he could fix his attention i want to
tell you what i have been thinking all
this time
i do not want to hear it harry said
his father i cannot turn my mind to what
you are thinking i will go on with my
own thoughts
so saying his father put himself into
harry's late position hanging over the
side the carriage
well said he at last turning to
harry who looked doleful you feel how
unpleasant it is not to have people ready
to sympathize with you you feel how disagreeable
it would be to you if we could
not turn our thoughts to what you are
thinking when you wish for our attention

harry looking ashamed said that is
true papa i believe i have been all day
very disagreeable but i did not mean it 
i was thinking something that i hoped
you would be pleased with and i did not
like to leave off till i had quite invented it
or at least made it as good as could
oh papa said lucy may i speak 
you ought to be pleased with his going on
persevering through all the noises we made
and every interruption i am sure i could
not so have fixed my attention
 lou and your brother my dear lucy
said her father have two opposite faults
and i wish you both to know them that
you may take care and use your power
over your own minds to cure them your
attention lucy passes too quickly from
one thing to another you are what isis
vulgarly called bird witted you should
endeavour to prevent your mind from flying
off from one subject to another i encourage
you to fix it as steadily and as
long at a time as you can you are 
such an affectionate sympathizing temper
that there is no danger that you should
not be ready enough to turn your thoughts
to the pursuits and amusements others
whenever it is necessary or agreeable
you harry have acquired the power and
habit fixing your attention steadily on
your own pursuits but you cannot easily
turn your mind from your own thoughts to
what is going on near you or to what
other people wish you to think now
consider that your sister and your mother
and i and every body like syrnpalliiy as
well as you do probably and if you acquired
this unsociable habit never joining
in what we are donor or beings interested
in what we are saying or hearing
you would become a very disagreeable
companion
i hope i shall not said harry with a
look serious alarm
 you have perseverance and laudable
ambition enough continued his father
 but the danger for you is that you should
confine your attention too much to one small
circle objects and not enlarge your mind
by general observation and knowledge
 
you perceive that i speak to you not
as to a foolish child but as to a reasonable
creature who is desirous to improve
himself on this journey you will have
opportunities curing yourself this
fault when you are going through a
new country look about you observe everything
when you are with people who
are talking on subjects that are new to you
listen to what they say much knowledge
and amusement can be gained by the ear
as well as by the eye ears and no ears 
might make a good tale as well as eyes
and no eyes 
he did listen the other day papa
said lucy and heard what the gentleman
told about the wreck and the gunpowder
 harry repeated it to me afterwards

as he was so well rewarded by hearing
what was entertaining and by your
remembering it so kindly said her father
 i hope he will continue to attend to conversation

 if people did not talk so much nonsense
generally in company sir said
harry i should listen oftener
pick out the sense if you try to do
so you will always find some golden
grains sense even in an ocean nonsense
and suppose you should not it
will be use to your own mind to interrupt
even by nonsense the course your
thoughts the mind becomes stupefied
when it has thought too long on any one
point
true said harry so i found today
when i was thinking about my measuring
wheel when i had thought and thought
for a great while i grew quite tired and
stupid i could not tell what was the matter
with me i could not invent what i wanted
 and listening even to the moschettoes
which i hated at the time did me good
harry is so candid said his mother
that there is really some pleasure in finding
fault with him
he was not like those foolish boys who
when they are told any fault think only
how soon the person who is speaking will
have done that they may get rid the immediate
pain nor was he one those who
think only what excuse they can make
nor yet was he one those the most foolish
who grow sulky and sit or stand like
statues feeling all the time as if the nightmare
prevented them from stirring it is
true that harry was acquainted with this
disagreeable sensation arising partly from
shame and partly from pride but he
struggled against it and threw it off as
soon as possible
 lucy what were you doing before all

every quarter edinburgh has its own peculiar
boast so that the city together combines
within its precincts if you take the word 
the inhabitants on the subject as much variety
as beauty as much historical interest as
 natural sublimity our claims in behalf 
the canongate are not the slightest or least interesting
the castle may excel us in extent
 prospect and natural sublimity site the
canton had always the superiority its unrivalled
panorama and has late added to them
that its towers bridges and triumphal arches
the high street we acknowledge had the distinguished
honour being defended by fortifications
 which we can show no vestiges we will
not descend to notice the claims mere upstart
districts called old new town and new
new town not to mention the favourite moray
place which is the newest new town all
we will not match ourselves except with our
equals and with our equals in age only for indignity
we admit none we boast being the
court the town possessing the palace
and the sepulchral remains ancient monarchs
and that we have the power to excite in a degree
unknown to the less honoured quarters 
the city the dark and solemn recollections 
the ancient grandeur which occupied the precincts
 our venerable abbey from the time 
st david till her deserted halls were once more
made glad and her long silent echoes awakened
by the visit our present gracious sovereign

my long habitation in the neighbourhood
and the quiet respectability my habits have
given me a sort intimacy with good mrs
the housekeeper in that most interesting
part the old building called queen
mary's apartments but a circumstance which
lately happened has conferred upon me greater
privileges so that indeed i might i believe
venture on the exploit chaplet who was
executed for being found secreted at midnight
in the very bedchamber scotland's mistress
it chanced that the good lady i have mentioned
was in the discharge her function
showing the apartments to a cockney from london
 not one your quiet dull commonplace
visitors who gape yawn and listen with an acquiescent
humph to the information doled out by
the provincial cicerone no such thing this was
the brisk alert agent a great house in the city
who missed no opportunity doing business
as he termed it that is putting off the goods
 his hemp oyer and improving his own account
 commission he had fidgeted through
the suite apartments without finding the least
opportunity to touch upon that which he considered
as the principal his existence
even the story rizzio's assassination presented
no ideas to this emissary commerce
until the housekeeper appealed in support 
her narrative to the dusky stains blood upon
the floor
these are the stains she said nothing
will remove them from the place there they
have been for two hundred and fifty years 
and there they will remain while the floor is
left standing neither water nor anything else
will ever remove them from that spot
now our cockney amongst other articles
sold scouring drops as they are called and
a stain two hundred and fifty years standing
was interesting to him not because it had been
caused by the blood a queen's favourite
slain in her apartment but because it offered
so admirable an opportunity to prove the efficacy
 his unequalled detergent elixir down
on his knees went our friend but neither in
horror nor devotion
two hundred and fifty years ma'am and
nothing take it away why if it had been five
hundred i have something in my pocket will
fetch it out in five minutes d'ye see this
elixir ma'am i will show you the stain vanish
in a moment
accordingly whetting one his handkerchief
with the alldeterging specific he began
to rub away on the planks without heeding
the remonstrances mrs she good
soul stood at first in astonishment like the
abbess st bridget's when a profane visitant
drank up the vial brandy which had long
passed muster among the relics the cloister
for the tears the blessed saint the venerable
guardian st bridget probably expected
the interference her patroness she
 holy rood might perhaps hope that david
rizzio's spectre would arise to prevent the
profanation but mrs stood not long in
the silence horror she uplifted her voice
and screamed as loudly as queen mary herself
when the dreadful deed was in the act perpetration

harrow now out and walawa she cried
i happened to be taking my morning walk in
the adjoining gallery pondering in my mind
why the kings scotland who hung around
me should be each and every one painted with
a nose like the knocker a door when lo the
walls once more reechoed with such shrieks as
formerly were as often heard in the scottish
palaces as were sounds revelry and music
somewhat surprised at such an alarm in a place
so solitary i hastened to the spot and found
the wellmeaning traveller scrubbing the floor
like a housemaid while mrs dragging
him by the skirts the coat in vain endeavoured
to divert him from his sacrilegious purpose
it cost me some trouble to explain to the
zealous purifier silkstockings embroidered
waistcoats broadcloth and deal planks that
there were such things in the world as stains
which ought to remain indelible on account
 the associations with which they are connected
our good friend viewed everything oi
the kind only as the means displaying the
virtue his vaunted commodity he comprehended
however that he would not be permitted
to proceed to exemplify its powers on the
present occasion so took his leave muttering
that he had always heard the scots were a
nasty people but had no idea they carried it sofar
as to choose to have the floors their palaces
bloodaltered like banquo's ghost when to
remove them would have cost but a hundred
drops the infallible detergent elixir prepared
and sold by messrs scrub and rub in five
shilling and ten shilling bottles each bottle being
marked with the initials the inventor to
counterfeit which would be to incur the pains
 forgery
freed from the odious presence this lover
 cleanliness my good friend mrs was
profuse in her expressions thanks and
yet her gratitude instead exhausting itself
in these declarations according to the way 
the world continues as lively at this moment
as if she had never thanked me at all it is
owing to her recollection this piece good
service that i have the permission wandering
like the ghost some departed gentlemanusher
through these deserted halls sometimes
as the old irish ditty expresses it
thinking on things that are long enough ago 
and sometimes wishing i could with the good
luck most editors romantic narrative
light upon some hidden crypt or massive antique
cabinet which should yield to my researches
an almost illegible manuscript containing
the authentic particulars some the
strange deeds those wild days the unhappy
mary
my dear mrs baliol used to sympathize with
me when i regretted that all the godsend 
this nature had ceased to occur and that an author
might chatter his teeth to pieces by the
seaside without a wave ever wafting to him a
casket containing such a history as that automatic
 that he might break his shins in
stumbling through a hundred vaults without
finding anything but rats and mice and become
the tenant a dozen sets shabby tenements
without seeing any manuscript but the weekly
bill for board and lodging a dairymaid 
these degenerate days might as well wash and
deck her dairy in hopes finding the fairy tester
in her shoe
it is a sad and too true a tale cousin
said mrs baliol i am sure we all have occasion
to regret the want these ready supplements
to a failing invention but you most 
all have right to complain that the fairies have
not favoured your researches you who have
shown the world that the age chivalry still
exists you the knight croftangry who
braved the fury the london prentice bold
in behalf the fair dame and the memorial
 rizzio's slaughter is it not a pity cousin
considering the feat chivalry was otherwise
so much according to rule is it not i
say a great pity that the lady had not been a
little younger and the legend a little older 
why as to the age at which a fair dame
loses the benefits chivalry and is no longer
entitled o crave boon brave knight that i
u
leave to the statutes the order errantry 
but for the blood rizzio i take up the gauntlet
and maintain against all and sundry that i
hold the stains to be no modern date but
to have been actually the consequence and the
record that terrible assassination
as i cannot accept the challenge to the
field fair cousin i am contented to require
proof
the unaltered tradition the palace and
the correspondence the existing state things
with that tradition
explain if you please
i will the universal tradition bears that
when rizzio was dragged out the chamber 
the queen the heat and fury the assassins
who struggled which should deal him most
wounds dispatched him at the door the anteroom
there therefore the greater quantity
 the blood was spilled and there the marks 
it are still shown it is reported further by historians
that mary continued her entreaties for
his life mingling her prayers with screams and
exclamations until she knew that he was assuredly
slain on which she wiped her eyes and
said i will now study revenge 
all this is granted but the blood would
it not wash out or waste out think you in so
many years 
i am coming to that presently the constant
tradition the palace says that mary
discharged any measures to be taken to remove
the marks slaughter which she had resolved
should remain as a memorial to quicken and
confirm her purposed vengeance but it is added
that satisfied with the knowledge that it
existed and not desirous to have the ghastly
evidence always under her eye she caused
a traverse as it is called that is a temporary
screen boards to be drawn along the
under part the anteroom a few feet from
the door so as to separate the place stained
with the blood from the rest the apartment
and involve it in considerable obscurity now
this temporary partition still exists and by
running across and interrupting the plan 
the roof and cornices plainly intimates that it
has been intended to serve some temporary
purpose since it disfigures the proportions 
the room interferes with the ornaments the
ceiling and could only have been put there for
some such purpose as hiding an object too disagreeable
to be looked upon as to the objection
that the bloodstains would have disappeared
in course time i apprehend that if measures
to efface them were not taken immediately
after the affair happened if the blood in
other words were allowed to sink into the
wood the stain would become almost indelible
now not to mention that our scottish palaces
were not particularly well washed in those days
and that there were no patent drops to assist
the labours the mop i think it very probable
that these dark relics might subsist for a long
course time even if mary had not desired or directed
that they should be preserved but screened
by the traverse from public sight i know
several instances similar bloodstains remaining
for a great many years and i doubt whether
after a certain time anything can remove
them save the carpenter's plane if any seneschal
by way increasing the interest the
apartments had by means paint or any other
mode imitation endeavoured to palm upon
posterity supposititious stigmata i conceive that
the impostor would have chosen the queers cabinet
and the bedroom for the scene his trick
placing his bloody tracery where it could be distinctly
seen by visitors instead hiding it behind
the traverse in this manner the existence
 the said traverse or temporary partition is
also extremely difficult to be accounted for if the
common and ordinary tradition be rejected in
short all the rest this striking locality is so
true to the historical fact that i think it may
well bear out the additional circumstance the
blood on the floor
 i profess to you answered mrs baliol
that i am very willing to be converted to
your faith we talk a credulous vulgar
without always recollecting that there is a vulgar
incredulity which in historical matters as
well as in those religion finds it easier to
doubt than to examine and endeavours to assume
the credit an esprit fort by denying
o
whatever happens to be a little beyond the very
limited comprehension the sceptic and so
that point being settled and you possessing as
we understand the open sesamum into these
secret apartments how if we may ask do you
intend to avail yourself your privilege 
do you propose to pass the night in the royal
bedchamber 
for what purpose my dear lady if to
improve the rheumatism this east wind may
serve the purpose
improve the rheumatism heaven forbid 
that would be worse than adding colours to the
violet no i mean to recommend a night on
the couch the rose scotland merely to
improve the imagination who knows what
dreams might be produced by a night spent ina
mansion so many memories for aught i
know the iron door the postern stair might
open at the dead hour midnight and as at the
time the conspiracy forth might sally the
phantom assassins with stealthy step and ghastly
look to renew the semblance the deed
there comes the fierce fanatic ruthven party
hatred enabling him to bear the armour which
would otherwise weigh down a form extenuated
by wasting disease see how his writhen
features show under the hollow helmet like
those a corpse tenanted by a demon whose
vindictive purpose looks out at the flashing eyes
while the visage has the stillness death 
yonder appears the tall form the boy darnley
as goodly in person as vacillating in resolution
 yonder he advances with hesitating step
and yet more hesitating purpose his childish
fear having already overcome his childish passion
he is in the plight a mischievous boy
who has fired a mine and who now expecting
the explosion in remorse and terror would give
his life to quench the train which his own hand
lighted yonder yonder but i forget the
rest the worthy cutthroats help me if
you can
summon up said i the postulate
george douglas the most active the gang
let him arise at your call the claimant 
wealth which he does not possess the partaker
 the illustrious blood douglas but which
vol i b
in his veins is sullied with illegitimacy paint
him the ruthless the daring the ambitious so
nigh greatness yet debarred from it so near
to wealth yet excluded from possessing it a
political tantalus ready to do or dare anything
to terminate his necessities and assert his imperfect
claims
admirable my dear croftangry but what
is a postulate 
pooh my dear madam you disturb the
current my ideas the postulate was in
scottish phrase the candidate for some benefice
which he had not yet attained george douglas
who stabbed rizzio was the postulate for
the temporal possessions the rich abbey 
arbroath
i stand informed come proceed who
comes next
who comes next yon tall thinmade 
man with the petronel in his hand
must be andrew er alongside a brother's
son i believe the celebrated sir david
er cessford his look and bearing those
 a border freebooter his disposition so savage
that during the fray in the cabinet he presented
his loaded piece at the bosom the young
and beautiful queen that queen also being
within a few weeks becoming a mother
bravo beau cousin well having raised
your bevy phantoms i hope you do not intend
to send them back to their cold beds to
warm them you will put them to some action
and since you do threaten the canongate with
your desperate quill you surely mean to novelist
or to dramatize if you will this most singular
 all tragedies 
worse that is less interesting periods 
history have been indeed shown up for furnishing
amusement to the peaceable ages which
have succeeded but dear lady the events are
too well known in mary's days to be used as
vehicles romantic fiction what can a better
writer than myself add to the elegant and forcible
narrative robertson so adieu to my
vision i awake like john bunyan and behold
it is a dream well enough that i awake
without a sciatica which would have probably
rewarded my slumbers had i profaned queen
mary's bed by using it as a mechanical resource
to awaken a torpid imagination
this will never do cousin answered mrs
baliol you must get over all these scruples if
you would thrive in the character a romantic
historian which you have determined to embrace
what is the classic robertson to you the
light which he carried was that a lamp to illuminate
the dark events antiquity yours is
a magic lantern to raise up wonders which never
existed no reader sense wonders at your
historical inaccuracies any more than he does
to see punch in the showbox seated on the
same throne with king solomon in his glory
or to hear him hallowing out to the patriarch
amid the deluge mighty hazy weather master
noah 
do not mistake me my dear madam said
i i am quite conscious my own immunities
as a taleteller but even the mendacious
mr fang assures us that though he never scruples
to tell a lie at his master's command yet it
hurts his conscience to be found out now
this is the reason why i avoid in prudence all
wellknown paths history where every one
can read the fingerposts carefully set up to advise
them the right turning and the very
boys and girls who learn the history britain
by way question and answer hoot at a poor
author if he abandons the highway
m do not be discouraged however cousin
chrystal there are plenty wildernesses in
scottish history through which unless i am
greatly misinformed no certain paths have
been laid down from actual survey but which
are only described by imperfect tradition which
fills up with wonders and with legends the periods
in which no real events are recognized to
have taken place even thus as mat prior
says 
geographers on pathless downs
place elephants for want towns 
if such be your advice my dear lady said
i the course my story shall take its rise
upon this occasion at a remote period history
and in a province removed from my natural
sphere the canongate
it was under the influence those feelings
that i undertook the following historical romance
which often suspended and flung aside
is now arrived at a size too important to be
altogether thrown away although there may belittle
prudence in sending it to the press
i have not placed in the mouth the characters
the lowland scotch dialect now spoken
because unquestionably the scottish that day
resembled very closely the anglosaxon with
a sprinkling french or norman to enrich it
those who wish to investigate the subject may
consult the chronicles wanton and the history
 bruce by archdeacon barbour but
supposing my own skill in the ancient scottish
were sufficient to invest the dialogue with its
peculiarities a translation must have been necessary
for the benefit the general reader
the scottish dialect may be therefore considered
as laid aside unless where the use peculiar
words may add emphasis or vivacity to the
composition
aunt valentine's bay 
the fair maid perth
chapter i
behold the tiber the vain roman cried
viewing the ample tay from beglie's side 
but where's the scot that would the vaunt repay
and hail the puny tiber for the tay 
among all the provinces in scotland if an
intelligent stranger were asked to describe the
most varied and the most beautiful it is probable
he would name the county perth a
native also any other district though his partialities
might lead him to prefer his native
county in the first instance would certainly
class that perth in the second and thus give
its inhabitants a fair right to plead that prejudice
apart perthshire forms the fairest portion
 caledonia it is long since lady mary
worsley montague with that excellent taste
which characterises her writings expressed her
opinion that the most interesting portion 
every country and that which exhibits the varied
beauties natural scenery in greatest perfection
is that where the mountains sink down
upon the champaign or more level land the
most picturesque if not the highest hills are to
be found there the rivers find their way out
 the mountainous region by the wildest leaps
and through the most romantic passes above
the vegetation a happier climate and soil is
mingled with the magnificent characteristics 
mountainscenery and woods groves and thickets
in profusion clothe the base the hills
ascend up the ravines and mingle with the precipices
it is in such favoured regions that the
traveller finds what the poet gray or some one
else has termed beauty lying in the lap 
terror
from the same advantage situation this
favoured province presents a variety the most
pleasing character its lakes woods and mountains
may vie in beauty with any that the highland
tour exhibits while perthshire contains
amidst this romantic scenery and in some places
in connexion with it many fertile and habitable
tracts which may vie with the richness merry
england herself the country has also been
the scene many remarkable exploits and events
some historical importance others interesting
to the poet and romancer though recorded
in popular tradition alone it was in these vales
that the saxons the plain and the gael the
mountains had many a desperate and bloody
encounter in which it was frequently impossible
to decide the palm victory between the
mailed chivalry the low country and the
plaided clans whom they opposed
perth so eminent for the beauty its situation
is a place great antiquity and old tradition
assigns to the town the importance a
roman foundation that victorious nation it
is said pretended to recognize the tiber in the
much more magnificent and navigable tay and
to acknowledge the large level space well known
by the name the north inch as having a near
resemblance to their campus martins the city
was often the residence our monarchs who
although they had no palace at perth found
the cistercian convent amply sufficient for the
reception their court it was here that james
the first one the wisest and best the
scottish kings fell a victim to the jealousy 
the vengeful aristocracy here also occurred
the mysterious conspiracy gowrie the scene
 which has only late been effaced by the
destruction the ancient palace in which the
tragedy was acted the antiquarian society 
perth with just zeal for the objects their
pursuit have published an accurate plan this
memorable mansion with some remarks upon
its connexion with the narrative the plot
which display equal acuteness and candour
one the most beautiful points view
which britain or perhaps the world can afford
is or rather we may say was the prospect from
a spot called the wicks beglie being a species
 niche at which the traveller arrived after
a long stage from kinross through a waste
and uninteresting country and from which as
forming a pass over the summit a ridgy eminence
which he had gradually surmounted he
beheld stretching beneath him the valley the
tay traversed by its ample and lordly stream 
the town perth with its two large meadows
or inches its steeples and its towers the hills 
moncrieff and kinnoul faintly rising into picturesque
rocks partly clothed with woods the rich
margin the river studded with elegant mansions
 and the distant view the huge grampian
mountains the northern screen this exquisite
landscape the alteration the road
greatly it must be owned to the improvement
 general intercourse avoids this magnificent
point view and the landscape is introduced
more gradually and partially to the eye though
the approach must be still considered as extremely
beautiful there is still we believe a footpath
left open by which the station at the wicks 
beglie may be approached and the traveller
by quitting his horse or equipage and walking
a few hundred yards may still compare the
real landscape with the sketch which we have
attempted to give but it is not in our power
to communicate or in his to receive the exquisite
charm which surprise gives to pleasure
when so splendid a view arises when least expected
or hoped for and which chrystal croftangry
experienced when he beheld for the first
time the matchless scene
childish wonder indeed was an ingredient
in my delight for i was not above fifteen years
old and as this had been the first excursion
which i was permitted to make on a pony my
own i also experienced the glow independence
mingled with that degree anxiety
which the most conceited boy feels when he is
first abandoned to his own undirected counsels
i recollect pulling up the reins without meaning
to do so and gazing on the scene before me as
if i had been afraid it would shift like those in a
theatre before i could distinctly observe its different
parts or convince myself that what i saw
was real since that hour and the period is
now more than fifty years past the recollection
 that inimitable landscape has possessed the
strongest influence over my mind and retained
its place as a memorable thing when much that
was influential on my own fortunes has fled
from my recollection it is therefore natural
that whilst deliberating on what might be
brought forward for the amusement the public
i should pitch upon some narrative connected
with the splendid scenery which made so
much impression on my youthful imagination
and which may perhaps have that effect in setting
off the imperfections the composition which
ladies suppose a fine set china to possess in
heightening the flavour indifferent tea
the period at which i propose to commence
is however considerably earlier than either 
the remarkable historical transactions to which
i have already alluded as the events which i
am about to recount occurred during the last
years the fourteenth century when the scottish
sceptre was swayed by the gentle but feeble
hand john who reigned under the title 
robert the third

chapter 
perth boasting as we have already mentioned
so large a portion the beauties inanimate
nature has at no time been without its
own share those charms which are at once
more interesting and more transient to be called
the fair maid perth would at any period
have been a high distinction and have inferred
no mean superiority in beauty where there
were many to claim that muchenvied attribute
but in the feudal times to which we now call
the reader's attention female beauty was a quality
 much higher importance than it has been
since the ideas chivalry have been in a great
measure extinguished the love the ancient
cavaliers was a licensed species idolatry
which the love heaven alone was theoretically
supposed to approach in intensity and which
in practice it seldom equalled god and the ladies
were familiarly appealed to in the same
breath and devotion to the fair sex was as peremptorily
enjoined upon the aspirant to the
honour chivalry as that which was due to
heaven at such a period in society the power
 beauty was almost unlimited it could level
the highest rank with that which was immeasurably
inferior
it was but in the reign preceding that 
robert iii that beauty alone had elevated a
person inferior rank and indifferent morals to
share the scottish throne and many women less
artful or less fortunate had risen to greatness
from a state concubinage for which the manners
 the times made allowance and apology
such views might have dazzled a girl higher
birth than catharine or katie glover who was
universally acknowledged to be the most beautiful
young woman the city or its vicinity and
whose renown as the fair maid perth had
drawn on her much notice from the young gallants
 the royal court when it chanced to be
residing in or near perth insomuch that more
than one nobleman the highest rank and most

distinguished for deeds chivalry were more
attentive to exhibit feats horsemanship as
they passed the door old simon glover in
what was called couvrefew or curfew street
than to distinguish themselves in the tournaments
where the noblest dames scotland
were spectators their address
but the glover's daughter for as was common
with citizens and artizans that early
period her father simon derived his sirname
from the trade which he practised showed
no inclination to listen to any gallantry which
came from those a station highly exalted
above that which she herself occupied and
though probably in no degree insensible to her
personal charms seemed desirous to confine her
conquests to those who were within her own
sphere life indeed her beauty being 
that kind which we connect more with the
mind than with the person was notwithstanding
her natural kindness and gentleness disposition
rather allied to reserve than to gaiety
even when in company with her equals 
vol i c
and the earnestness with which she attended
upon the exercises devotion induced many
to think that catharine glover nourished the
private wish to retire from the world and bury
herself in the recesses the cloister but to
such a sacrifice should it be meditated it was
not to be expected her father reputed a wealthy
man and having this only child would yield a
willing consent
in her resolution avoiding the addresses 
the gallant courtiers the reigning beauty 
perth was confirmed by the sentiments her
parent let them go he said let them go
catharine those gallants with their capering
horses their jingling spurs their plumed bonnets
and their trim moustaches they are not 
our class nor will we aim at pairing with them
tomorrow is saint valentine's day when
every bird chooses her mate but you will not
see the linnet pair with the sparrowhawk nor
the robin redbreast with the kite my father
was an honest burgher perth and could use
his needle as well as i can did there come
war to the gates our fair burgh down went
needles thread and shandy leather and out
came the good headpiece and target from the
dark nook and the long lance from above the
chimney show me a day that either he or i
were absent when the provost made his musters
 thus we have led our lives my girl
working to win our bread and fighting to defend
it i will have no soninlaw that thinks
himself better than me and for these lords and
knights i trust thou wilt always remember
thou art too low to be their lawful love and too
high to be their unlawful loon and now lay
by thy work lass for it is holytide eve and it
becomes us to go to the evening service and
pray that heaven may send thee a good valentine
tomorrow
so the fair maid perth laid aside the
splendid hawking glove which she was embroidering
for the lady drummond and putting on
her holiday kirtle prepared to attend her father
to the blackfriars monastery which was adjacent
to couvrefew street in which they lived
on their passage simon glover an ancient and
esteemed burgess perth somewhat stricken
in years and increased in substance received
from young and old the homage due to his velvet
jerkin and his gold chain while the beauty
 catharine though concealed beneath her
screen which resembled the mantilla still worn
in flanders called both obeisance and coffins
 the bonnet from young and old
as the pair moved on arm in arm they were
followed by a tall handsome young man dressed
in a yeoman's habit the plainest kind but
which showed to advantage his fine limbs as
the handsome countenance that looked out from
a quantity curled tresses surmounted by a
small scarlet bonnet became that species headdress
he had no other weapon than a staff in
his hand it not being thought fit that persons
 his degree for he was an apprentice to the
old glover should appear on the street armed
with sword or dagger a privilege which the jackmen
or military retainers the nobility esteemed
exclusively their own he attended his
master at holytide partly in the character a
domestic or protector should there be cause for
his interference but it was not difficult to discern
by the earnest attention which he paid to
catharine glover that it was to her rather than
to her father that he desired to dedicate his
good offices generally speaking there was no
opportunity for his zeal displaying itself for a
common feeling respect induced passengers
to give way to the father and daughter
but when the steel caps barrels and plumes
 squires archers and menatarms began to be
seen among the throng the wearers these warlike
distinctions were more rude in their demeanour
than the quiet citizens more than once
when from chance or perhaps from an assumption
 superior importance such an individual
took the wall simon in passing the glover's
youthful attendant bristled up with a look defiance
and the air one who sought to distinguish
his zeal in his mistress's service by its ardour
as frequently did conachar for such was
the lad's name receive a check from his master
who gave him to understand that he did not
wish his interference before he required it
foolish boy he said hast thou not lived
long enough in my shop to know that a blow
will breed a brawl that a dirk will cut the skin
as fast as a needle pierces leather that i love
peace though i never feared war and care not
which side the causeway my daughter and i
walk upon so we may keep our road in peace
and quietness conachar excused himself as
zealous for his master's honour yet was scarce
able to pacify the old citizen what have we
to do with honour said simon glover if
thou wouldst remain in my service thou must
think honesty and leave honour to the swaggering
fools who wear spurs at their heels and
iron on their shoulders if you wish to wear
and use such garniture you are welcome but it
shall not be in my house or in my company
conachar seemed rather to kindle at this rebuke
than to submit to it but a sign from catharine
if that slight raising her little finger
was indeed a sign had more effect than the
angry reproof his master and the youth
laid aside the military air which seemed natural
to him and relapsed into the humble follower
 a quiet burgher
meantime the little party were overtaken by
a tall young man wrapped in a cloak which obscured
or muffled a part his face a practice
often used by the gallants the time when
they did not wish to be known or were abroad
in quest adventures he seemed in short
one who might say to the world around him
u i desire for the present not to be known
or addressed in my own character but as i
am answerable to myself alone for my actions i
wear my incognito but for form's sake and care
little whether you see through it or not he
came on the right side catharine who had
hold her father's arm and slackened his pace
as if joining their party
good even to you goodman
the same to your worship and thanks 
may i pray you to pass on our pace is too slow
for that your lordship our company too
mean for that your father's son
my father's son can best judge that old
man i have business to talk with you and
with my fair st catharine here the loveliest
and most obdurate saint in the calendar
with deep reverence my lord said the
old man i would remind you that this is
good st valentine's eve which is no time for
business and that i can have your worshipful
commands by your serving man as early as it
pleases you to send them
there is no time like the present said the
persevering youth whose rank seemed to be 
a kind which set him above ceremony i wish
to know whether the buff doublet be finished
which i commissioned some time since 
and from you pretty catharine here he sank
his voice to a whisper i desire to be informed
whether your fair fingers have been employed
upon it agreeably to your promise but i need
not ask you for my poor heart has felt the pang
 each puncture that pierced the garment which
was to cover it traitress how wilt thou answer
for thus tormenting the heart that loves
thee so dearly 
let me entreat you my lord to forego this
wild talk it becomes not you to speak thus
or me to listen we are poor rank but honest
manners and the presence the father
ought to protect the child from such expressions
even from your lordship
this she spoke so low that neither her father
nor conachar could understand what she said
well tyrant answered the persevering
gallant i will plague you no longer now
providing you will let me see you from your
window tomorrow when the sun first peeps
over the eastern hill and give me right to be
your valentine for the year
not so my lord my father has but now
told me that hawks far less eagles pair not
with the humble linnet seek some court lady
to whom your favours will be honour to me 
your highness must permit me to speak the plain
truth they can be nothing but disgrace
as they spoke thus the party arrived at the
gate the church your lordship will i
trust permit us here to take leave you
said her father i am well aware how little
you will alter your pleasure for the pain and
uneasiness you may give to such as us but
from the throng attendants at the gate your
lordship may see that there are others in the
church to whom even your gracious lordship
must pay respect
yes respect and who pays any respect
to me said the haughty young lord a
miserable artizan and his daughter too much
honoured by my slightest notice have the insolence
to tell me that my notice dishonours them
well my princess doeskin and blue silk i
will teach you to rue this
as he murmured thus the glover and his
daughter entered the dominican church and
their attendant conachar in attempting to follow
them closely jostled perhaps not unwillingly
the young nobleman the gallant starting
from his unpleasing reverie and perhaps
considering this as an intentional insult seized
on the young man by the breast struck him
and threw dm from him his irritated opponent
recovered himself with difficulty and
grasped towards his own side as if seeking a
sword or dagger in the place where it was
usually worn but finding none he made a
gesture disappointed rage and entered the
church during the few seconds he remained
the young nobleman stood with his arms folded
on his breast with a haughty smile as if defying
him to do his worst when conachar
had entered the church his opponent adjusting
his cloak yet closer about his face made a
private signal by holding up one his gloves
he was instantly joined by two men who disguised
like himself had waited his motions at
a little distance they spoke together earnestly
after which the young nobleman retired in
one direction his friends or followers going off
in another
simon glover before he entered the church
cast a look towards the group but had taken
his place among the congregation before they
separated themselves he knelt down with the
air a man who has something burthensome on
his mind but when the service was ended he
seemed free from anxiety as one who had referred
himself and his troubles to the disposal
 heaven the ceremony high mass was
performed with considerable solemnity a number
 noblemen and ladies rank being present
preparations had indeed been made for
the reception the good old king himself but
some those infirmities to which he was subject
had prevented robert iii from attending the
service as was his wont when the congregation
were dismissed the glover and his beautiful
daughter lingered for some time for the
purpose making their several shifts in the
confessionals where the priests had taken their
places for discharging that part their duty
thus it happened that the night had fallen dark
and the way was solitary when they returned
along the now deserted streets to their own dwelling
most persons had betaken themselves to
home and to bed they who still lingered in the
street were nightwalkers or revellers the idle
and swaggering retainers the haughty nobles
who were much wont to insult the peaceful passengers
relying on the impunity which their
masters court favour was too apt to secure
them
it was perhaps in apprehension mischief
from some character this kind that conachar
stepping up to the glover said master walk
faster we are dogg'd
dogg'd mayest thou by whom and by
how man 
by one man muffled in his cloak who follows
us like our shadow
then will i never mend my pace along the
couvrefew street for the best one man that ever
trode it
 but he has arms said conachar
and so have we and hands and legs and
feet why sure conachar you are not afraid
 one man 
 afraid answered conachar indignant at
the insinuation you shall soon know if i am
afraid
 now you are as far on the other side the
mark thou foolish boy thy temper has no
middle course there is no occasion to make a
brawl though we do not run walk thou before
with catharine and i will take thy place we
cannot be exposed to danger so near home as
we are
the glover fell behind accordingly and certainly
observed a person keep so close to them
as the time and place considered justified some
suspicion when they crossed the street he
also crossed it and when they advanced or
slackened their pace the stranger's was in proportion
accelerated or diminished the matter
would have been very little consequence had
simon glover been alone but the beauty his
daughter might render her the object some
profligate scheme in a country where the laws
afforded such slight protection to those who had
not the means to defend themselves concha
and his fair charge having arrived on the
threshold their own apartment which was
opened to them by an old female servant the
burgher's uneasiness was ended determined
however to ascertain if possible whether there
had been any cause for it he called out to the
man whose motions had occasioned the alarm
and who stood still though he seemed to keep
out reach the light come step forward
my friend and do not play at bopeep 
knowest thou not that they who walk like
phantoms in the dark are apt to encounter the
conjuration a quarterstaff step forward i
say and show us thy shapes man
why so i can master glover said one 
the deepest voices that ever answered question
i can show shapes well enough only i wish
they could hear the light something better
body me exclaimed simon i should
know that voice and is it thou in thy bodily
person harry gow nay beshrew me if thou
passes this door with dry lips what man
curfew has not rung yet and if it had it were
no reason why it should part father and son
come in man dorothy shall get us something
to eat and we will jingle a can ere thou leave
us come in i say my daughter kate will
be right glad to see thee
by this time he had pulled the person whom
he welcomed so cordially into a sort kitchen
which served also upon ordinary occasions
the office parlour its ornaments were
trenchers pewter mixed with a silver cup
or two which in the highest degree cleanliness
ornamented a range shelves like those
 a beaufort popularly called the sink a
good fire with the assistance a blazing lamp
spread light and cheerfulness through the apartment
and a savoury smell some victuals
which dorothy was preparing did not at all
offend the unrefined noses those whose appetite
they were destined to satisfy
their unknown attendant now stood in full
light among them and though his appearance
was neither dignified nor handsome his face and
figure were not only deserving attention but
seemed in some manner to command it he was
rather below the middle stature but the breadth
 his shoulders length and frankness his
arms and the muscular appearance the whole
man argued a most unusual share strength
and a frame kept in vigour by constant exercise
his legs were somewhat bent but not in a manner
which could be said to approach to deformity 
on the contrary which seemed to correspond
to the strength his frame though it injured
in some degree its symmetry his dress was 
buffhide and he wore in a belt around his
waist a heavy broadsword and a dirk or poniard
as if to defend his purse which burgherfashion
was attached to the same cincture
the head was well proportioned round close
cropped and curled thickly with black hair
there was daring and resolution in the dark
eye but the other features seemed to express
a bashful timidity mingled with good humour
and obvious satisfaction at meeting with his old
friends abstracted from the bashful expression
which was that the moment the forehead
 henry gow or smith for he was indifferently
so called as both words equally indicated
his profession was high and noble
but the lower part the face was less happily
formed the mouth was large and wellfurnished
with a set firm and beautiful teeth the
appearance which corresponded with the air
 personal health and muscular strength which
the whole frame indicated a short thick beard
and moustaches which had lately been arranged
with some care completed the picture his
age could not exceed eightandtwenty
the family appeared all well pleased with
the unexpected appearance an old friend
simon glover shook his hand again and again
vol i u
dorothy made her compliments and catharine
herself offered freely her hand which henry
held in his massive grasp as if he designed to
carry it to his lips but after a moment's hesitation
desisted from fear lest the freedom might
be ill taken not that there was any resistance
on the part the little hand which lay passive
in his grasp but there was a smile mingled
with the blush on her cheek which seemed to
increase the confusion the gallant her father
on his part called out frankly as he saw
his friend's hesitation 
her lips man her lips and that's a proffer
i would not make to every one who crosses my
threshold but by good st valentine whose
holiday will dawn tomorrow i am so glad to
see thee in the bonny city pertly again that
it would be hard to tell the thing i could refuse
thee
the smith for as has been said such was
the craft this sturdy artizan was encouraged
modestly to salute the fair maid who yielded
the courtesy with a smile affection that might
have become a sister saying at the same time
let me hope that i welcome hack to perth a
repentant and amended man
he held her hand as if about to answer then
suddenly as one who lost courage at the moment
relinquished his grasp and drawing
back as if afraid what he had done his dark
countenance glowing with bashfulness mixed
with delight he sate down by the fire on the
opposite side from that which catharine occupied

come dorothy speed thee with the food
old woman and conachar where is conachar

he is gone to bed sir with a headach
said catharine in a hesitating voice
go call him dorothy said the old glover
 i will not be used thus by him his
highland blood forsooth is too gentle to lay a
trencher or spread a napkin and he expects to
enter our ancient and honourable craft without
duly waiting and tending upon his master and
teacher in all matters lawful obedience go
call him i say i will not be thus neglected
dorothy was presently heard screaming upstairs
or more probably up a ladder to the
cockloft to which the recusant apprentice had
made an untimely retreat a muttered answer
was returned and soon after conachar appeared
in the eating apartment there was a gloom
 deep sullenness on his haughty though handsome
features and as he proceeded to spread
the board and arrange the trenchers with salt
spices and other condiments to discharge in
short the duties a modern domestic which
the custom the time imposed upon all apprentices
 he was obviously disgusted and indignant
with the mean office imposed upon him
the fair maid perth looked with some anxiety
at him as if apprehensive that his evident
sullenness might increase her father's displeasure
 but it was not till her eyes had sought
out his for a second time that conachar condescended
to veil his dissatisfaction and throw
a greater appearance willingness and submission
into the services which he was performing

and here we must acquaint our reader that
though the private interchange looks betwixt
catharine glover and the young mountaineer
indicated some interest on the part the former
in the conduct the latter it would have
puzzled the strictest observer to discover whether
that feeling exceeded in degree what might
have been felt by a young person towards a
friend and inmate the same age with whom
she had lived on habits intimacy
thou hast had a long journey son henry
said glover who had always used that affectionate
style speech though noways akin to
the young artizan ay and hast seen many
a river besides tay and many a fair bigging
besides st johnston
but none that i like half so well and none
that are half so much worth my liking answered
the smith i promise you father
that when i crossed the wicks beglie and saw
the bonny city lie stretched fairly before me like
a fairy queen in romance whom the knight
finds asleep among a wilderness flowers i felt
even as a bird when it folds its wearied wings
to stoop down on its own nest
aha so thou canst play the maker yet
said the glover what shall we have our
ballets and our roundels again our lusty caold
scottish tor poet
rots for christmas and our mirthful springs to
trip it round the maypole 
such toys there may be forthcoming father
said henry smith though the blast 
the bellows and the clatter the anvil make
but coarse company to lays minstrelsy but
i can afford them no better since i must mend
my fortune though i mar my verses
right again my own son just answered
the glover and i trust thou has made a saving
voyage it 
nay i made a thriving one father i sold
the steel habergeon that you wot for four
hundred marks to the english warden the
east marches sir magnus median he scarce
scrupled a penny after i gave him leave to try
a sworddint upon it the beggarly highland
thief who bespoke it boggled at half the sum
though it had cost me a year's labour
what dost thou start at conachar said
simon addressing himself by way parenthesis
to the mountain disciple wilt thou
never learn to mind thy own business without
listening to what is passing round thee what
is it to thee that an englishman thinks that
cheap which a scotchman may hold dear 
conachar turned round to speak but after a
moment's consideration looked down and endeavoured
to recover his composure which had
been deranged by the contemptuous manner in
which the smith had spoken his highland
customers henry went on without paying any
attention to him
i sold at high prices seme swords and lingers
when i was at edinburgh they expect war
there and if it please god to send it my merchandize
will be worth its price st dunstan
make us thankful for he was our craft in
short this fellow laying his hand on his purse
who thou knowest father was somewhat lank
and low in condition when i set out four months
since is now as round and full as a sixweeks
porker
and that other leathernsheathed ironhinted
fellow who hangs beside him said the glover
 has he been idle all this while come
jolly smith confess the truth how many brawls
hast thou had since crossing the tay 
nay now you do me wrong father to
ask me such a question glancing a look at catharine
in such a presence answered the armourer
 i make swords indeed but i leave
it to other people to use them no no seldom
have i a naked sword in my fist save when i
am turning them on the anvil or grindstone 
and they slandered me to your daughter catharine
that led her to suspect the quietest burgess
in perth being a brawler i wish the best 
them would dare say such a word at the hill 
kinnoul and never a man on the green but he
and i
ay ay said the glover laughing we
should then have a fine sample your patient
sufferance out upon you henry that you will
speak so like a knave to one who knows thee so
well you look at kate too as if she did not
know that a man in this country must make his
hand keep his head unless he will sleep in slender
security come come beshrew me if thou
hast not spoiled as many suits armour as thou
hast made
why he would be a bad armourer father
simon that could not with his own blow make
proof his own workmanship if i did not
sometimes cleave a helmet or strike a sword's
point through a harness i should not know what
strength fabric to give them and might jingle
together such pasteboard work as yonder
edinburgh smiths think not shame to put out
 their hands
aha now would i lay a gold crown thou
hast had a quarrel with some edinburgh 
upon that very ground 
a quarrel no father replied the perth
armourer but a measuring swords with
such a one upon st leonard's crags for the honour
 my bonny city i confess surely you
do not think i would quarrel with a brother
craftsman 
ah to a surety no but how did your brother
craftsman come off
why as one with a sheet paper on his
bosom might come off from the stroke a lance
or rather indeed he came not off at all for
when i left him he was lying in the hermit's
lodge daily expecting death for which father
jervis said he was in heavenly preparation
well any more measuring weapons 
said the glover

chapter iii
the armourer's heart swelled big with various
and contending sensations so that it seemed
as if it would burst the leathern doublet under
which it was shrouded he arose turned
away his head and extended his hand towards
the glover while he averted his face as if desirous
that his emotion should not be read upon
his countenance
nay hang me if i bid you farewell man
said simon striking the flat his hand against
that which the armourer expanded towards him
i will shake no hands with you for an hour
to come at least tarry but a moment man
and i will explain all this and surely a few
drops blood from a scratch and a few silly
words from a foolish wench's lips are not to
part father and son when they have been so
long without meeting stay then man if ever
you would wish for a father's blessing and st
valentine's whose blessed eve this chances to
be
the glover was soon heard loudly summoning
dorothy and after some clanking 
keys and trampling up and down stairs dorothy
appeared bearing three large rummer cups
 green glass which were then esteemed a great
and precious curiosity and the glover followed
with a huge bottle equal at least to three quarts
 these degenerate days here is a cup 
wine henry older by half than i am myself
my father had it in a gift from stout old crabbe
the flemish engineer who defended perth so
stoutly in the minority david the second
we glovers could always do something in war
though our connexion with it was less than yours
who work in steel and iron and my father had
pleased old crabbe some other day i will tell
you how and also how long these bottles were
concealed under ground to save them from the
reiving southron so i will empty a cup to the
soul's health mv honoured father maw his
sins be forgiven him dorothy thou shalt drink
this pledge and then be gone to thy rockloft
i know thine ears are itching girl but i have
that to say which no one must hear save henry
smith the son mine adoption
dorothy did not venture to remonstrate but
taking off her glass or rather her goblet with
good courage retired to her sleeping apartment
according to her master's commands the two
friends were left alone
it grieves me friend henry said simon
filling at the same time his own glass and his
guest's it grieves me from my soul that my
daughter retains this silly humour but alsome
thinks thou nights mend it why wouldst
thou come hither clattering with thy sword and
dagger when the girl is so silly that she cannot
bear the sight these dost thou not remember
that thou hadst a sort quarrel with her
even before thy last departure from perth because
thou wouldst not go like other honest quiet
burghers but must be ever armed like one 
the rascally jackie that wait on the nobility
sure it is time enough for decent burgesses to
arm at the tolling the common bell which
calls us out odin in effeir war
why my good father that was not my
fault but i had no sooner quitted my nag than
i run hither to tell you my return thinking
if it were your will to permit me that i would
get your advice about being mistress catharine's
valentine for the year and then i heard from
mrs dorothy that you were gone to hear mass at
the black friars so i thought i would follow
thither partly to hear the same mass with you
and partly our lady and st valentine forgive
me to look upon one who thinks little enough
 me and as you entered the church methought
i saw two or three dangerouslooking
men holding counsel together and gazing at
you and at her and in especial sir john ramorn
whom i knew well enough for all his
disguise and the velvet patch over his eye and
that is not in dread war but in the guise which cjf'eirs
or belongs to war in arms namely offensive and defensive m bodin
in fear war a frequent term in old scottish history and
muniments means arrayed in warlike guise
his cloak so like a serving man's methought
father simon that as you were old and yonder
slip a highlander something too young to do
battle i would even walk quietly after you not
doubting with the tools i had about me to bring
any one to reason that might disturb you in
your way home you know that yourself discovered
me and drew me into the house whether
i would or no otherwise i promise you
i would not have seen your daughter till i had
donned the new jerkin which was made at berwick
after the latest cut nor would i have appeared
before her with these weapons which she
dislikes so much although to say truth so
many are at deadly feud with me for one unhappy
chance or another that it is as needful
for me as for any man in scotland to go by
night with weapons about me
the silly wench never thinks that said
simon glover she never has sense to consider
that in our dear native land scotland
every man deems it his privilege and duty to
avenge his own wrong but harry my boy
thou art to blame for taking her talk so much
to heart i have seen thee bold enough with
other wenches wherefore so still and tonguetied
with her 
because she is something different from
other maidens father glover because she is
not only more beautiful but wiser higher holier
and seems to me as if she were made better
clay than we that approach her i can hold
my head high enough with the rest the lasses
round the maypole but somehow when i approach
catharine i feel myself an earthly
coarse ferocious creature scarce worthy to look
on her much less to contradict the precepts
which she expounds to me
il you are an imprudent merchant harry
smith replied simon and rate too high
the goods you wish to purchase catharine is
a good girl and my daughter but if you make
her a conceited ape by your bashfulness and your
flattery neither you nor i will see our wishes
accomplished
i i often fear it my good father said the
smith for i feel how little i am deserving 
catharine
vol i
feel a thread's said the glover
feel for me friend smith for catharine and
me think how the poor thing is beset from
morning to night and by what sort persons
even though windows be down and doors shut
we were accosted today by one too powerful
to be named ay and he showed his displeasure
openly because i would not permit him
to gallant my daughter in the church itself
when the priest was saying mass there are
others scarce less reasonable i sometimes wish
that catharine were some degrees less fair that
she might not catch that dangerous sort admiration
or somewhat less holy that she might
sit down like an honest woman contented with
stout henry smith who could protect his wife
against every sprig chivalry in the court 
scotland
and if i did not said henry thrusting out
a hand and arm which might have belonged to
a giant for bone and muscle i would i may
never bring hammer upon anvil again ay
an it were come but that length my fair catharine
should see that there is no harm in a man
having the trick defence but i believe she
thinks the whole world is one great minsterchurch
and that all who live in it should behave
as if they were at an eternal mass
nay in truth said the father she has
strange influence over those who approach her 
the highland lad conachar with whom i have
been troubled for these two or three years although
you may see he has the natural spirit 
his people obeys the least sign which catharine
makes him and indeed will hardly be
ruled by any one else in the house she takes
much pains with him to bring him from his rude
highland habits
here harry smith became uneasy in his chair
lifted the flaggon set it down and at length exclaimed
 the devil take the young highland
whelp and his whole kindred what has catharine
to do to instruct such a fellow as he 
he will be just like the wolfcub that i was fool
enough to train to the offices a dog and everyone
thought him reclaimed till in an ill hour
i went to walk on the hill moncrieff when
he broke loose on the laird's flock and made
a havock that i might well have rued had the
laird not wanted harness at the time and i
marvel that you being a sensible man father
glover will keep this highland young fellow
a likely one i promise you so nigh to catharine
as if there were no other than your daughter
to serve him for a schoolmistress
fie my son fie now you are jealous
said simon a poor young fellow who to
tell you the truth resides here because he may
not so well live on the other side the hill
ay ay father simon retorted the smith
who had all the narrowminded feelings the
burghers his time an it were not for fear
 offence i would say that you have even too
much packing and peeling with yonder loons
out burgh
i must get my deerhides kidskins and
so forth somewhere my good harry and
highlandmen give good bargains
they can afford them replied henry
drily for they sell nothing but stolen gear
well well be that as it may it is not my
business where they get the bestial so i get
the hides but as i was saying there are certain
considerations why i am willing to oblige
the father this young man by keeping him
here and he is but half a highlander neither
and wants a thought the dour spirit a
glueamie after all i have seldom seen him
so fierce as he showed himself but now
you could not unless he had killed his
man replied the smith in the same dry tone
nevertheless if you wish it harry i'll set
all other respects aside and send the landholder
to seek other quarters tomorrow morning
nay father said the smith you cannot
suppose that harry gow cares the value a
smithydander for such a cub as yonder catmountain
 i care little i promise you though all
his clan were coming down the shoe gate with
slogan crying and pipes playing i would find
fifty blades and bucklers would send them back
faster than they came but to speak truth
though it is a fool's speech too i care not to
see the fellow so much with catharine res
cinder
member lather glover your trade keeps your
eyes and hands close employed and must have
your heedful care even if this lazy lurdane
wrought at it which you know yourself he seldom
does
and that is true said simon he cuts
all his gloves out for the right hand and never
could finish a pair in his life
no doubt his notions skincutting are
rather different said henry but with your
leave father i would only say that work he
or be he idle he has no bleared eyes no hands
seared with the hot iron and walked by the
use the forehammer no hair rusted in the
smoke and singed in the furnace like the hide
 a badger rather than what is fit to be covered
with a christian bonnet now let catharine
be as good a wench as ever lived and i will uphold
her to be the best in perth yet she must
see and know that these things make a difference
betwixt man and man and that the difference
is not in my favour
here is to thee with all my heart son
harry said the old man filling a brimmer to
hi companion and another to himself u i see
that good smith as thou art thou keenest not
the mettle that women are made thou must
be bold henry and bear thyself not as if thou
wert going to the gallowlee but like a gay young
fellow who knows his own worth and will not
be slighted by the best grandchild eve ever
had catharine is a woman like her mother
and thou thickest foolishly to suppose they are
all set on what pleases the eye their ear must
be pleased too man they must know that he
whom they favour is bold and buxom and
might have the love twenty though he is
seeing for theirs believe an old man women
walk more by what others think than by what
they think themselves and when she asks for
the boldest man in perth whom shall she hear
named but harry burnthewind the best
armourer that ever fashioned weapon on anvil 
why harry smith again the tightest dancer
at the maypole why the lusty smith the
gayest troller ballads why who but harry
gow the best wrestler swordandbuckler
player the king the weaponshowing the
breaker mud horses the tamer wild highlander
 ever more it is thee thee no one
but thee and shall catharine prefer yonder
slip a highland boy to thee pshaw she
might as well make a steel gauntlet out kid's
leather i tell thee conachar is nothing to
her but so far as she would fain prevent the
devil having his due him as other highlander
 god bless her poor thing she would
bring all mankind to better thoughts if she
could
m in which she will fail to a certainty said
the smith who as the reader may have noticed
had no good will to the highland race
i will wager on old nick whom i should
know something he being indeed a worker in
the same element with myself against catharine
on that debate the devil will have the
tartan that is sure enough
ay but catharine replied the glover
hath a second thou knowest little father
clement has taken the young reiver in
hand and he fears a hundred devils as little
as i do a flock geese
 father clement said the smith you
are always making some new saint in this godly
city saint johnston pray who for a
devil's drubber may he be one your hermits
that is trained for the work like a wrestler
for the ring and brings himself to trim by fasting
and penance is he not 
no that is the marvel it said simon 
father clement eats drinks and lives much
like other folks all the rules the church
nevertheless strictly observed
oh i comprehend a buxom priest that
thinks more good living than good lifetipple
a can on eastern's eve to enable him to
face lent has a pleasant in principio and
confesses all the prettiest women about town 
you are on the bowhand still smith i
tell you my daughter and i could nose out either
a fasting hypocrite or a full one but father
clement is neither the one nor the other
but what is he then in heaven's name 
one who is either greatly better than half
his brethren saint johnston put together
or so much worse than the worst them that
it is sin and shame that he is suffered to abide
in the country
methinks it were easy to tell whether hebe
the one or the other said the smith
content you my friend said simon
with knowing that if you judge father clement
by what you see him do and hear him say
you will think him as the best and kindest
man in the world with a comfort for every
man's grief a counsel for every man's difficulty
the rich man's surest guide and the poor man's
best friend but if you listen to what the dominicans
say him he is benedicite here
the glover crossed himself on brow and bosom 
a foul heretic who ought by means earthly
flames to be sent to those which burn eternally

the smith also crossed himself and exclaimed
 saint mary father simon and do you
who are so good and prudent that you have
been called the wise glover perth let your
daughter attend the ministry one who the
saints preserve us may be in league with the
foul fiend himself why was it not a priest
who raised the devil in the meal vermes when
hodge jackson's house was blown down in the
great wind did not the devil appear in the
midst the tay dressed in a priest's scapular
gambolling like a peach amongst the waves
the morning when our stately bridge was swept
away 
i cannot tell whether he did or no said
the glover i only know i saw him not as
to catharine she cannot be said to use father
clement's ministry seeing her confessor is old
father francis the dominican from whom she
had her shrift today but women will sometimes
be wilful and sure enough she consults
with father clement more than i could wish 
and yet when i have spoken with him myself
i have thought him so good and holy a man
that i could have trusted my own salvation with
him there are bad reports him among the
dominicans that is certain but what have we
laymen to do with such things my son let us
pay mother church her dues give our alms
confess and do our penances duly and the
saints will bear us out
ay truly and they will have consideration
 said the smith for any rash and unhappy
blow that a man may deal in a fight
when his party was on defence and standing
up to him and that's the only creed a man
can live upon in scotland let your daughter
think what she pleases marry a man must
know his fence or have a short lease his life
in any place where blows are going so rife five
nobles to our altar have cleared me for the best
man i ever had misfortune with
let us finish our flask then said the old
glover for i reckon the dominican tower is
tolling midnight and hark thee son henry beat
the lattice win do won our eastgableby the very
peep dawn and make me aware thou art come
by whistling the smith's call gently i will contrive
that catharine shall look out at the window
and thus thou wilt have all the privileges
 being a gallant valentine through the rest 
the year which if thou canst not use to thine
own advantage i shall be led to think that for
all thou best covered with the lion's hide nature
has left on thee the long ears the ass
amen father said the armourer a
hearty good night to you and god's blessing
on your rooftree and those whom it covers
you shall hear the smith's call sound by cockcrowing
i warrant i put sir chanticleer to
shame
so saying he took his leave and though
completely undaunted moved through the deserted
streets like one upon his guard to his
own dwelling which was situated in the mill
wynd at the western perth
chapter 
the sturdy armourer was not it may be
believed slack in keeping the appointment assigned
by his intended fatherinlaw he went
through the process his toilette with more
than ordinary care throwing as far as he could
those points which had a military air into the
shade he was far too noted a person to venture
to go entirely unarmed in a town where
he had indeed many friends but also from the
character many his former exploits several
deadly enemies at whose hands should they
take him at advantage he knew he had little
mercy to expect he therefore wore under
his jerkin a secret or coat chainmail made
so light and flexible that it interfered as little
with his movements as a modern underwaistcoat
yet such proof as he might safely depend
upon every ring it having been wrought
and joined by his own hands above this he
wore like others his age and degree the
flemish hose and doublet which in honour 
the holy tide were the best superfine english
broad cloth light blue in colour slashed outwith
black satin and passamented laced that
is with embroidery black silk his walking
boots were cordovan leather his cloak 
good scottish grey which served to conceal a
whinger or couteau de chasse that hung at his
belt and was his only offensive weapon for he
carried in his hand but a rod holly his
black velvet bonnet was lined with steel quilted
between the metal and his head and thus
constituted a means defence which might
safely be trusted to
upon the whole henry had the appearance
to which he was well entitled a burgher
 wealth and consideration assuming in
his dress as much consequence as he could
display without stepping beyond his own rank
and encroaching on that the gentry neither
did his frank and manly deportment though
indicating a total indifference to danger bear the
least resemblance to that the bravoes or swashbucklers
 the dav amongst whom henry was
sometimes unjustly ranked by those who imputed
the frays in which he was so often engaged
to a quarrelsome and violent temper resting
upon a consciousness his personal strength
and knowledge his weapon on the contrary
every feature bore the easy and goodhumoured
expression one who neither thought
 inflicting mischief nor dreaded it from others
baying attired himself in his best the honest
armourer next placed nearest to his heart
which throbbed at its touch j a little gift
which he had long provided for catharine
glover and which his quality valentine
would presently give him the title to present
and her to receive without regard to maidenly
scruples it was a small ruby cut into the
form a heart transfixed with a golden arrow
and was inclosed in a small purse made
 links the finest work in steel as if it had
been designed for a hauberk to a king round
the verge the puree were these words 
cleave hearts
this device had cost the armourer some
thought and he was much satisfied with his composition
because it seemed to imply that his
skill could defend all hearts saving his own
he wrapped himself in his cloak and hastened
through the still silent streets determined to
appear at the window appointed a little before
dawn
with this purpose he passed up the high
street and turned down the opening where
saint john's church now stands in order to
proceed to curfew street when it occurred to
him from the appearance the sky that he
was at least an hour too early for his purpose
and that it would be better not to appear at the
place rendezvous till near the time assigned
other gallants were not unlikely to be on the
watch as well as himself about the house o the
fair maid perth and he knew his own foible
eat thane
i g
s
a souffle arising betwixt them i have the advantage
he thought by my father simon's
friendship and why should i stain my fingers
with the blood the poor creatures that are not
worthy my notice since they are so much less
fortunate than myself no no i will be wise
for once and keep at a distance from all temptation
to a broil they shall have no more time
to quarrel with me than just what it may require
for me to give the signal and for my father
simon to answer it i wonder how the old
man will contrive to bring her to the window 
i fear if she knew his purpose he would find
it difficult to carry it into execution
while these loverlike thoughts were passing
through his brain the armourer loitered in his
pace often turning his eyes eastward and eying
the firmament in which no slight shades 
grey were beginning to flicker to announce
the approach dawn however distant which
to the impatience the stout armourer seemed
on that morning to abstain longer than
usual from occupying her eastern barbican he
was now passing slowly under the wall saint
anne's chapel not failing to cross himself and
say an are as he trode the consecrated ground
when a voice which seemed to come from behind
one the flying buttresses the chapel
said he lingers that has need to run
who speaks said the armourer looking
around him somewhat startled at an address so
unexpected both in its tone and tenor
u no matter who speaks answered the same
voice do thou make great speed or thou
wilt scarce make good speed bandy not words
but begone
saint or sinner angel or devil said henry
crossing himself your advice touches me
but too dearly to be neglected saint valentine
be my speed 
so saying he instantly changed his loitering
pace to one with which few people could have
kept up and in an instant was in couvrefew
street he had not made three steps towards
simon glover's which stood in the midst 
the narrow street when two men started from
under the houses on different sides and advanced
as it were by concert to intercept his passage
the imperfect light only permitted him to
discern that they wore the highland mantle
clear the way cathedral said the armourer
in the deep stern voice which corresponded
with the breadth his chest
they did not answer at least intelligibly
but he could see that they drew their swords
with the purpose withstanding him by violence
conjecturing some evil but what
kind he could not anticipate henry instantly
determined to make his way through whatever
odds and defend his mistress or at least
die at her feet he cast his cloak over his
left arm as a buckler and advanced rapidly and
steadily to the two men the nearest made a thrust
at him but henry smith parrying the blow with
his cloak dashed his arm in the man's face and
tripping him at the same time gave him a severe
fall on the causeway while almost at the same
instant he struck a blow with his linger at the
fellow who was upon his right hand so severely
applied that he also lay prostrate by his associate
meanwhile the armourer pushed forward
in alarm for which the circumstances 
the street being guarded or defended by strangers
who conducted themselves with such violence
afforded sufficient reason he heard a suppressed
whisper and a bustle under the glover's
windows those very windows from which he
had expected to be hailed by catharine as her
valentine he kept to the opposite side the
street that he might reconnoitre their number
and purpose but one the party who were
beneath the window observing or hearing him
crossed the street also and taking him doubtless
for one the sentinels asked in a whisper
 what noise was yonder kenneth why
gave you not the signal 
villain said henry you are discovered
and you shall die the death 
as he spoke thus he dealt the stranger a
blow with his weapon which would probably
have made his words good had not the man
raising his arm received on his hand the blow
meant for his head the wound must have been
a severe one for he staggered and fell with a
deep groan without noticing him farther henry
smith sprung forward upon a party men
who seemed engaged in placing a ladder against
the lattice window in the gable henry did not
stop either to count their numbers or to ascertain
their purpose but crying the alarmword
 the town and giving the signal at which the
burghers were wont to collect he rushed on the
night walkers one whom was in the act 
ascending the ladder the smith seized it by
the rounds threw it down on the pavement and
placing his foot on the body the man who had
been mounting prevented him from regaining
his feet his accomplices struck fiercely at
henry to extricate their companion but his
mailcoat stood him in good stead and he repaid
their blows with interest shouting aloud
help help for bonnie st johnston bows
and blades brave citizens bows and blades 
they break into our houses under cloud 
night
these words which resounded far through
the streets were accompanied by as many fierce
blows dealt with good effect among those whom
the armourer assailed in the meantime the
inhabitants the street began to awaken and
appear on the street iu their shirts with swords
and targets and some them with torches
the assailants now endeavoured to make their
escape which all them effected excepting the
man who had been thrown down along with the
ladder him the intrepid armourer had caught
by the throat in the scuffle and held as fast
as the greyhound holds the hare the other
wounded men were borne ois by their comrades

here are a sort knaves breaking peace
within burgh said henry to the neighbours
who began to assemble make after the rogues
they cannot all get off for i have maimed some
 them the blood will guide you to them
some highland catherine said the citizens
 up and chase neighbours 
ay chase chase leave me to manage
this fellow continued the armourer
the assistants dispersed in different directions
their lights flashing and their cries resounding
through the whole adjacent district
in the meantime the armourer's captive entreated
for freedom using both promises and
throats to obtain it as thou art a gentleman
he said let me go and what is past
shall be forgiven
i am no gentleman said henry i am
hal the wynd a burgess perth and i
have done nothing to need forgiveness
villain thou hast done thou knowest not
what but let me go and i will fill thy bonnet
with gold pieces
i shall fill thy bonnet with a cloven head
presently said the armourer unless thou
stand still as a true prisoner
what is the matter my son harry said
simon who now appeared at the window i
hear thy voice in another tone than i expected 
what is all this noise and why are the neighbours
gathering to the affray 
there have been a proper set glimmers
about to scale your windows father simon 
but i am like to prove godfather to one them
whom i hold here as fast as ever vice held
iron
hear me simon glover said the prisoner
 let me but speak one word with you iu
private and rescue me from the gripe this
ironfisted and leadenpated clown and i will
show thee that no harm was designed to thee
or thine and moreover tell thee what will
much advantage thee
i should know that voice said simon
glover who now came to the door with a darklantern
in his hand son smith let this
young man speak with me there is no danger
in him i promise you stay hut an instant
where you are and let no one enter the house
either to attack or defend i will be answerable
that this galliard meant but some saint
valentine's jest
so saying the old man pulled in the prisoner
and shut the door leaving henry a little surprised
at the unexpected light in which his 
had viewed the affray a jest 
he said it might have been a strange jest
if they had got into the maiden's sleeping
room and they would have done so had it
not been for the honest friendly voice from betwixt
the buttresses which if it were not that 
the blessed saint though what am i that the
holy person should speak to me could not
sound in that place without her permission and
assent and for which i will promise her a wax
candle at her shrine as long as my linger 
and i would i had had my twohanded broadsword
in stead both for the sake st johnston
and the rogues for a certain those lingers
are pretty toys but more fit for a boy's hand
than a man's oh my old twohanded trojan
hadst thou been in my hands as thou hengist
presently at the tester my bed the legs 
those rogues had not carried their bodies so clean
off the field but there come lighted torches
and drawn swords so ho stand are you
for st johnston if friends to the bonnie
burgh you are well come
we have been but bootless hunters said
the townsmen we followed by the tracks 
the blood into the dominican burialground
and we started two fellows from amongst the
tombs supporting betwixt them a third who
had probably got some your marks about him
harry they got to the postern gate before we
could overtake them and rang the sanctuary
bell the gate opened and in went they so
they are safe in girth and sanctuary and we
may go to our cold beds and warm us
ay said one the party the good
dominicans have always some devout brother
 their convent sitting up to open the gate 
the sanctuary to any poor soul that is in trouble
and desires shelter in the church
yes if the poor hunted soul can pay for it
said another but truly if he be poor in purse
as well as in spirit he may stand on the outside
till the hounds come up with him
a third who had been poring for a few minutes
upon the ground by advantage his torch
now looked upwards and spoke he was a
brisk forward rather corpulent little man called
oliver proudfute reasonably wealthy and
a leading man in his craft which was that 
bonnetmakers he therefore spoke as one in
authority canst tell us jolly smith for
they recognised each other by the lights which
were brought into the streets what manner
 fellows they were who raised up this fray
within burgh 
the two that i first saw answered the
armourer seemed to me as well as i could
observe them to have highland plaids about
them
like enough like enough answered the
citizen shaking his head it's a shame the
breaches in our walls are not repaired and that
these landlouping highland scoundrels are left
at liberty to take honest men and women out 
their beds any night that is dark enough
but look here neighbours said oliver
proudfute showing a bloody hand which he
had picked up from the ground when did such
a hand as this tie a highlands's brogues it
is large indeed and bony but as fine as a
lady's with a ring that sparkles like a gleaming
candle simon glover has made gloves for
this hand before now if i am not much mistaken
for he works for all the courtiers the
spectators here began to gaze on the bloody token
with various comments
if that is the case said one harry smith
had best show a clean pair heels for it
since the justiciar will scarce think the protecting
a burgess's bouse an excuse for cutting
off a gentleman's band there be hard laws
against mutilation
fie upon you that you will say so michael
webster answered the bonnetmaker are
we not representatives and successors the
stout old romans who built perth as like to their
own city as they could and have we not charters
from all our noble kings and progenitors
as being their loving liegemen and would you
have us now yield up our rights privileges and
immunities our outran and infant our handhabet
our backbearing and our bloodsuits
and amerciaments escheats and commodities
and suffer an honest burgess's house to be assaulted
without seeking for redress no brave
citizens craftsmen and burgesses the tay shall
flow back to ducked before we submit to such
injustice 
and how can we help it said a grave old
man who stood leaning on a twohanded sword 
what would you have us do 
marry bailie craigdallie i wonder that
you all men ask the question i would have
you pass like true men from this very place to
the king's grace's presence raise him from his
royal rest and presenting to him the piteous
case our being called forth from our beds at
this season with little better covering than these
shirts i would show him this bloody token and
know from his grace's own royal lips whether
it is just and honest that his loving lieges should
be thus treated by the knights and nobles his
deposed court and this i call pushing our
cause warmly
warmly sayst thou replied the old burgess
 why so warmly that we shall all die 
cold man before the porter turn a key to let
us into the royal presence come friends the
night is bitter we have kept our watch and
ward like men and our jolly smith hath given a
warning to those that would wrong us which
shall be worth twenty proclamations the
king tomorrow is a new day we will consult
on this matter on this selfsame spot and
consider what measures should be taken for
discovery and pursuit the villains and therefore
let us dismiss before the heart'sblood freeze
ill
bravo bravo neighbour craigdallie st
johnston for ever v
oliver proudfute would still have spoken for
he was one those pitiless orators who think
that their eloquence can overcome all inconveniences
in time place and circumstances but
no one would listen and the citizens dispersed
to their own houses by the light the dawn
which began now to streak the horizon
they were scarce gone ere the door glover's
house opened and seizing the smith by the
hand the old man pulled him in
where is the prisoner demanded the armourer

he is gone escaped fled what do i
know him said the glover he got out
at the back door and so through the little garden
 think not him but come and see the
valentine whose honour and life you have saved
this morning
let me but sheathe my weapon said the
smith let me but wash my hands
there is not an instant to lose she is up
and almost dressed come on man she shall
see thee with thy good weapon in thy hand and
with villain's blood on thy fingers that she may
know what is the value a true man's service
she has stopped my mouth over long with her
pruderies and her scruples i will have her
know what a brave man's love is worth and a
bold burgess's to boot
chapter 
startled from her repose by the noise 
the affray the fair maid perth had listened
in breathless terror to the sounds violence
and outcry which arose from the street she
had sunk on her knees to pray for assistance
and when she distinguished the voices neighbours
and friends collected for her protection
she remained in the same posture to return
thanks she was still kneeling when her father
almost thrust her champion henry smith
into her apartment the bashful lover hanging
back at first as if afraid to give offence
and on observing her posture from respect to
her devotion
father said the armourer she prays 
vol i k
i dare no more speak to her than to a bishop
when he says mass
now go thy ways for a right valiant and
courageous blockhead said her father and
then speaking to his daughter he added 
heaven is best thanked my daughter by
gratitude shown to our fellowcreatures here
comes the instrument by whom god has rescued
thee from death or perhaps from dishonour
worse than death receive him catharine as
thy true valentine and him whom i desire to
see my affectionate son
not thus father replied catharine i
can see can speak to no one now i am not
ungrateful perhaps i am too thankful to the
instrument our safety but let me thank the
guardian saint who sent me this timely relief
and give me but a moment to don my kirtle
nay godmercy wench it were hard
to deny thee time to busk thy bodyclothes since
the request is the only words like a woman that
thou hast uttered for these ten days truly
son harry i would my daughter would put off
being entirely a saint till the time comes for
her being canonized for st catharine the second

nay jest not father for i will swear she
has at least one sincere adorer already who
hath devoted himself to her pleasure so far as
sinful man may faretheewell then for the
moment fair maiden he concluded raising
his voice u and heaven send thee dreams as
peaceful as thy waking thoughts i go to watch
thy slumbers and woe with him that shall intrude
on them 
nay good and brave henry whose warm
heart is at such variance with thy reckless hand
thrust thyself into no farther quarrels tonight 
but take the kindest thanks and with these
try to assume the peaceful thoughts which you
assign to me tomorrow we will meet that
i may assure you my gratitude farewell
and farewell lady and light my heart 
said the armourer and descending the stair
which led to catharine's apartment was about
to sally forth into the street when the glover
caught him by the arm
i shall like the ruffle tonight said he
better than i ever thought to do the clashing
 steel if it brings my daughter to her senses
harry and teaches her what thou art worth
by st macgrider i even love these restorers
and am sorry for that poor lover who will never
wear lefthanded chevron again ay he
has lost that which he will miss all the days 
his life especially when he goes to pull on his
gloves ay he will pay but half a fee to my
craft in future nay not a step from this
house tonight he continued h thou dost
not leave us i promise thee my son
i do not mean it but i will with your
permission watch in the street the attack
may be renewed
and if it be said simon thou wilt have
better access to drive them back having the
vantage the house it is the way fighting
which suits us burghers best that resisting
from behind stone walls our duty watch
and ward teaches us that trick besides enough
are awake and astir to ensure us peace and quiet
till morning so come in this way
so saying he drew henry nothing loath
into the same apartment where they had supped
and where the old woman who was on foot
disturbed as others had been by the nocturnal
affray soon roused up the fire
and now my doughty son said the glover
 what liquor wilt thou pledge thy father
in
henry smith had suffered himself to sink
mechanically upon a seat old black oak and
now gazed on the fire that flashed back a ruddy
light over his manly features he muttered to
himself half audibly good henry brave
henry ah had she but said dear henry 
what liquors be these said the old glover
laughing my cellar holds none such 
but if sack or rhenish or wine gascony
can serve why say the word and the flagon
foams that is all
the kindest thanks said the armourer
still musing that's more than she ever said
to me before the kindest thanks what may
not that stretch to 
it shall stretch like kid's leather man
said the glover if thou wilt but be ruled
and say what thou wilt take for thy morning's
draught
whatever thou wilt father answered the
armourer carelessly and relapsed into the analysis
 catharine's speech to him she spoke
 my warm heart but she also spoke my
reckless hand what earthly thing can i do
to get rid that fighting fancy certainly
i were best strike my right hand off and nail
it to the door a church that it may never dome
discredit more
you have chopped off hands enough for one
night said his friend setting a flagon wine
on the table why dost thou vex thyself
man she would love thee twice as well did
she not see how thou contest upon her but it
becomes serious now i am not to have the
risk my booth being broken and my house
plundered by the hellraking followers the
nobles because she is called the fair maid 
perth and please ye no she shall know i am
her father and will have that obedience to which
law and gospel give me right i will have her
thy wife henry my heart gold thy wife
my man metal and that before many weeks
are over come come here is to thy merry
bridal jolly smith
the father quaffed a large cup and filled it
to his adopted son who raised it slowly to his
head then ere it had reached his lips replaced
it suddenly on the table and shook his head
nay if thou wilt not pledge me to such a
health i know no one who will said simon
what canst thou mean thou foolish lad here
has a chance happened which in a manner places
her in thy power since from one the city
to the other all would cry fie on her if she should
say thee nay here am i her father not only
consenting to the cutting out the match but
willing to see you two as closely united together
as ever needle stitched buckskin r and with all
this on thy side fortune father and all thou
loosest like a distracted lover in a ballad more
like to pitch thyself into the tay than to woo
a lass that may be had for the asking if you
can but choose the lucky minute
ay but that lucky minute father i question
much if catharine ever has such a moment
to glance on earth and its inhabitants as might
lead her to listen to a coarse ignorant borrel
man like me i cannot tell how it is father 
elsewhere i can hold up my head like another
man but with your saintly daughter i lose heart
and courage and i cannot help thinking that it
would be well nigh robbing a holy shrine if i
could succeed in surprising her affections her
thoughts are too much fitted for heaven to be
wasted on such a one as i am
e'en as you like henry answered the
glover my daughter is not courting you anymore
than i am a fair offer is no cause feud 
only if you think that i will give into her foolish
notions a convent take it with you that
i will never listen to them i love and honour
the church he said crossing himself i pay
her rights duly and cheerfully tithes and alms
wine and wax i pay them as justly i say as
any man in perth my means doth but i cannot
afford the church my only and single ewelamb
that i have in the world her mother
was dear to me on earth and is now an angel
in heaven catharine is all i have to remind
me her i have lost and if she goes to the
cloister it shall be when these old eyes are
closed for ever and not sooner but as for
you friend gow i pray you will act according
to your own best liking i want to force no
wife on you i promise you
nay now you beat the iron twice over
said henry it is thus we always father
by your being testy with me for not doing
that thing in the world which would make
me happiest were i to have it in my power
why father i would the keenest dirk i ever
forged were sticking in my heart at this moment
if there is one single particle in it that is not
more your daughter's property than my own
but what can i do i cannot think less her
or more myself than we both deserve and
what seems to you so easy and certain is to meas
difficult as it would be to work a steel hauberk
out hards flax but here is to you
father he added in a more cheerful tone 
and here is to my fair saint and valentine
as i hope your catharine will be mine for the
season and let me not keep your old head
longer from the pillow but make interest with
your featherbed till daybreak and then you
must be my guide to your daughter's chamberdoor
and my apology for entering it to bid her
good morrow for the brightest that the sun will
awaken in the city or for miles round it 
no bad advice my son said the honest
glover but you what will you do will
you lie down beside me or take a part conachar's
bed 
neither answered harry gow i
should but prevent your rest and for me this
easychair is worth a down bed and i will sleep
like a sentinel with my graith about me
as he spoke he laid his hand on his sword
nay heaven send us no more need weapons
 good night or rather good morrow
till daypeep and the first who wakes calls up
the other
thus parted the two burghers the glover
retired to his bed and it is to be supposed to
rest the lover was not so fortunate his bodily
frame easily bore the fatigue which he had
encountered in the course the night but his
i 
mind was a different and more delicate
mould in one point view he was but the
stout burgher his period proud alike his
art in making weapons and wielding them
when made his professional jealousy personal
strength and skid in the use arms brought
him into many quarrels which had made him
generally feared and in some instances disliked
but with these qualities were united
the simple goodnature a child and at the
same time an imaginative and enthusiastic temper
which seemed little to correspond with his
labours at the forge or his combats in the field
perhaps a little the hairbrained and ardent
feeling which he had picked out old ballads
or from the metrical romances which were his
sole source information or knowledge may
have been the means pricking him on to some
 his achievements which had often a rude
strain chivalry in them at least it was certain
that his love to the fair catharine had in ita
delicacy such as might have become the squire
 low degree who was honoured if song speaks
truth with the smiles the king hungary's
daughter his sentiments towards her were certainly
as exalted as if they had been fixed upon
an actual angel which made old simon and
others who watched his conduct think that his
passion was too high and devotional to be successful
with maiden mortal mould they
were mistaken however catharine coy and
reserved as she was had a heart which could
feel and understand the nature and depth the
armourer's passion and whether she was able
to repay it or not she had as much secret pride
in the attachment the redoubted henry gowns
a lady romance may be supposed to have
in the company a tame lion who follows to
provide for and defend her it was with sentiments
 the most sincere gratitude that she
recollected as she awoke at dawn the services
 henry during the course the eventful
night and the first thought which she dwelt
upon was the means making him understand
her feelings
arising hastily from bed and half blushing
at her own purpose i have been cold to him
and perhaps unjust i will not be ungrateful
she said to herself though i cannot yield to
his suit i will not wait till my father compels
me to receive him as my valentine for the year 
i will seek him out and choose him myself i
have thought other girls bold when they did
something like this but i shall thus best please
my father and but discharge the rites due to
good saint valentine by showing my gratitude
to this brave man
hastily slipping on her dress which nevertheless
was left a good deal more disordered
than usual she tripped down stairs and opened
the door the chamber in which as she had
guessed her lover had passed the hours after
the fray catharine paused at the door and
became half afraid executing her purpose
which not only permitted but enjoined the valentines
 the year to begin their connexion
with a kiss affection it was looked upon asa
peculiarly propitious omen if the one party
could find the other asleep and awaken him or
her by performance this interesting ceremony

never was a fairer opportunity offered for
commencing this mystic tic than that which
now presented itself to catharine after many
and various thoughts sleep had at length overcome
the stout armourer in the chair in which
he had deposited himself his features in repose
had a more firm and manly cast than catharine
had thought who having generally seen
them fluctuating between shamefacedness and
apprehension her displeasure had been used
to connect with them some idea imbecility
he looks very stern she said if he
should be angry and then when he awakes 
we are alone if i should call dorothy if i
should wake my father but no it is a thing
 custom and done in all maidenly and sisterly
love and honour i will not suppose that henry
can misconstrue it and i will not let a childish
fear put my gratitude to sleep
so saying she tripped along the floor the
apartment with a light though hesitating step
and a cheek crimsoned at her own purpose and
gliding to the chair the sleeper dropped a
kiss upon his lips as light as if a roseleaf had
fallen on them the slumbers must have been
slight which such a touch could dispel and
the dreams the sleeper must needs have been
connected with the cause the interruption
since henry instantly starting up caught the
maiden in his arms and attempted to return
in ecstasy the salute which had broken his repose
but catharine struggled in his embrace 
and as her efforts implied alarmed modesty
rather than maidenly coyness her bashful lover
suffered her to escape a grasp from which
twenty times her strength could not have extricated
her
nay be not angry good henry said catharine
in the kindest tone to her surprised
lover i have paid my vows to saint valentine
to show how i value the mate which he
has sent me for the year let but my father
be present and i will not dare to refuse thee
the revenge you may claim for a broken sleep
let not that be a hinderance said the old
glover rushing in ecstasy into the room to
her smith to her strike while the iron is
hot and teach her what it is not to let sleeping
dogs lie still
thus encouraged henry though perhaps
with less alarming vivacity again seized the
blushing maiden in his arms who submitted
with a tolerable grace to receive repayment 
her salute a dozen times repeated and with an
energy very different from that which had provoked
such severe retaliation at length she
again extricated herself from her lover's arms
and as if frightened and repenting what she
had done threw herself into a seat and covered
her face with her hands
cheer up thou silly girl said her father
and be not ashamed that thou hast made the
two happiest men in perth since thy old father
is one them never was kiss so well bestowed
and meet it is that it should be suitably returned
look up my darling look up and let
me see thee but give one smile by my honest
word the sun that now rises over our fair city
shows no sight that can give me greater pleasure
 what he continued in a jocose tone
thou though st thou hadst jamie eddie's
ring and couldst walk invisible but not so my
fairy the dawning just as i was about to
rise i heard tby chamber door open and watched
thee down stairs not to protect thee against
this sleepyheaded henry but to see with my
own delighted eyes my beloved girl do that
which her father most wished come put
down these foolish hands and though thou
blushes a little it will only the better grace
st valentine's morn when blushes best become
a maiden's cheek
as simon glover spoke he pulled away
with gentle violence the hands which hid his
daughter's face she blushed deeply indeed
but there was more than maiden's shame in her
face and her eyes were fast filling with tears
what weeping love continued her father
 nay nay this is more than need 
henry help me to comfort this little fool
catharine made an effort to collect herself
and to smile but the smile was a melancholy
and serious cast
i only meant to say father said the fair
maid perth with continued exertion that
in choosing henry gow for my valentine and
rendering to him the rights and greeting the
vol i i
morning according to wonted custom i meant
bat to show my gratitude to him for his manly
and faithful service and my obedience to
you but do not lead him to think and oh
dearest father do not yourself entertain an idea
that i meant more than what the promise to be
his faithful and affectionate valentine through
the year requires me
ay ay ay ay we understand it all
said simon in the soothing tone which nurses
apply to children we understand what the
meaning is enough for once enough for once
thou shalt not be frightened or hurried loving
true and faithful valentines are ye and
the rest as heaven and opportunity shall permit
come prithee have donewring not
thy tiny hands nor fear farther persecution
now thou hast done bravely excellently 
and now away to dorothy and call up the old
sluggard we must have a substantial breakfast
after a night confusion and a morning
 joy and thy hand will be needed to prepare
for us some these delicate cakes which no
one can make but thyself and well hast thou
a right to the secret seeing who taught it thee
ah health to the soul thy dearest mother
he added with a sigh how blithe would she
have been to see this happy st valentine's
morning 
catharine took the opportunity escape
which was thus given her and glided from the
room to henry it seemed as if the sun had
disappeared from the heaven at midday and left
the world in sudden obscurity even the highswelled
hopes with which the late incident had
filled him began to quail as he reflected upon
her altered demeanour the tears in her eyes 
the obvious fear which occupied her features 
and the pains she had taken to show as plainly
as delicacy would permit that the advances
which she had made to him were limited to the
character with which the rites the day had
invested him her father looked on his fallen
countenance with something like surprise and
displeasure
in the name good st john what has befallen
you that makes you look as grave as an
owl when a lad your spirit having really
such a fancy for this poor girl as you pretend
ought to be as lively as a lark 
alas father replied the crestfallen lover
 there is that written on her brow which
says she loves me well enough to be my valentine
especially since you wish it but not well
enough to be my wife
now a plague on thee for a cold downhearted
goosecap answered the father i
can read a woman's brow as well and better
than thou and i can see no such matter on
hers what the foul fiend man there thou
wast lying like a lord in thy elbowchair as
sound asleep as a judge when hadst thou been
a lover any spirit thou wouldst have been
watching the east for the first ray the sun
but there thou latest snoring i warrant thinking
nought about her or anything else and
the poor girl rises at peep day lest any one
else should pick up her most precious and vigilant
valentine and wakes thee with a grace
which so help me st macgrider would
have put life in an anvil and thou awakes
to hone and pine and moan as if she had
lj
drawn a hot iron across thy lips i would to
st john she had sent old dorothy on the errand
and bound thee for thy valentine service
to that bundle dry bones with never a tooth
in her head she were fittest valentine in
perth for so craven a wooer
as to craven father answered the smith
there are twenty good cocks whose combs i
have plucked can tell thee if i am craven or no
and heaven knows that i would give my good
land held by burgess tenure with smithy bellows
tongs anvil and all providing it would
make your view the matter the true one but
it is not her coyness or her blushes that i
speak it is the paleness which so soon followed
the red and chased it from her cheeks 
and it is the tears which succeeded it was
like the april shower stealing upon and obscuring
the fairest dawning that ever beamed
over the tay
tutti tahiti replied the glover neither
rome nor perth were built in a day thou hast
fished salmon a thousand times and nights
have taken a lesson when the fish has taken
the fly to pull a hard strain on the line would
snap the tackle to pieces were it made wire
ease your hand man and let him rise take
leisure and in halfanhour thou layesthim on
the bank there is a beginning as fair as you
could wish unless you expect the poor wench
to come to thy bedside as she did to thy chair 
and that is not the fashion modest maidens
but observe me after we have had our breakfast
i will take care thou hast an opportunity
to speak thy mind only beware thou be neither
too backward nor press her too hard give
her line enough but do not slack too fast and
my life for yours upon the issue
do what i can father answered henry
you will always lay the blame on me either
that i give too much head or that i strain the
tackle i would give the best habergeon i ever
wrought that the difficulty in truth rested with
me for there were then the better chance its
being removed i own however i am but an
ass in the trick bringing about such discourse
as is to the purpose for the occasion
come into the booth with me my son and
i will furnish thee with a fitting theme thou
knowest the maiden who ventures to kiss a
sleeping man wins him a pair gloves
come to my booth thou shalt have a pair 
delicate kidskin that will exactly suit her hand
and arm i was thinking her poor mother
when i shaped them added honest simon with
a sigh and except catharine i know not
the woman in scotland whom they would fit
though i have measured most the high beauties
 the court come with me i say and
thou shalt be provided with a theme to wag thy
tongue upon providing thou have courage and
caution to stand by thee in thy wooing
chapter v
never to man shall catharine give her hand
taming a shrew
the breakfast was served and the thin soft
cakes made flour and honey according to
the family receipt were not only commended
with all the partiality a father and a lover
but done liberal justice to in the mode which
is best proof cake as well as pudding they
talked jested and laughed catharine too
had recovered her equanimity where the dames
and damsels the period were apt to lose theirs
in the kitchen namely and in the superintendence
 household affairs in which she was an
adept i question much if the perusal seneca
for as long a period would have had equal
effect in composing her mind
old dorothy sate down at the boardend as
was the homespun fashion the period and
so much were the two men amused with their
own conversation and catharine occupied
either in attending to them or with her own reflections
 that the old woman was the first
who observed the absence the boy conachar
it is true said the master glover go
call him the idle highland loon he was not
seen last night during the fray neither at least
i saw him not did any you observe him 
the reply was negative and henry's observation
followed 
there are times when highlanders can
couch like their own deer ay and run from
danger too as fast i have seen them do so
myself for the matter that
 and there are times replied simon
when king arthur and his round table could
not make stand against them i wish henry you
would speak more reverently the highlanders
they are often in perth both alone and in
numbers and you ought to keep peace with
them so long as they will keep peace with you
an answer defiance rose to henry's lips
but be prudently suppressed it
why thou knowest father he said smiling
 that we handicrafts best love the folks
we live by now my craft provides for valiant
and noble knights gentle squires and pages
stout menatarms and others that wear the
arms which we make it is natural i should
like the ruthless the lindsay the ogilvys
the oliphant and so many others our brave
and noble neighbours who are sheathed in
steel my making like so many paladins
better than those naked snatching mountaineers
who are ever doing us wrong especially
since no five each clan have a rusty shirt
 mail as old as their br attach and that is but
the work the clumsy clansmith after all
who is no member our honourable mystery
but simply works at the anvil where his father
wrought before him i say such people can
have no favour in the eyes an honest craftsman

well well answered simon i prithee
 standard
let the matter rest even now for here comes
the loitering boy and though it is a holiday
morn i want no more bloody puddings
the youth entered accordingly his face was
pale his eyes red and there was an air discomposure
about his whole person he sate
down at the lower the table opposite to
dorothy and crossed himself as if preparing
for his morning's meal as he did not help
himself to any food catharine offered him a
platter containing some the cakes which had
met with such general approbation at first
he rejected her offered kindness rather sullenly 
but on her repeating the offer with a smile 
good will he took a cake in his hand broke it
and was about to eat a morsel when the effort
to swallow seemed almost too much for him 
and though he succeeded he did not repeat it
you have a bad appetite for saint valentine's
morning conachar said his goodhumoured
master and yet i think you must
have slept soundly the night before since i conclude
you were not disturbed by the noise 
the scuffle why i thought a lively glunami
would have been at his master's side dirk in
hand at the first sound danger which arose
within a mile us
i heard but an indistinct noise said the
youth his face glowing suddenly like a heated
coal which i took for the shout some
merry revellers and you are wont to bid me
never open door or window or alarm the house
on the score such folly
well well said simon i thought a
highlander would have known better the difference
betwixt the clash swords and the
twanging on harps the wild warcry and the
merry hunts up but let it pass boy i am
glad thou art losing thy quarrelsome fashions
eat thy breakfast any way as i have that to
employ thee which requires haste
i have breakfasted already and am in haste
myself i am for the hills have you any message
to my father 
none replied the glover in some surprise
but art thou beside thyself boy or what
a vengeance takes thee from the city like the
wing the whirlwind
my warning has been sudden said concha
speaking with difficulty but whether arising
from the hesitation incidental to the use 
a foreign language or whether from some other
cause could not easily be distinguished there
is to be a meeting a great hunting here
he stopped
and when are you to return from this
blessed hunting said his master that is
if i may make so bold as to ask
i cannot exactly answer replied the apprentice
 perhaps never if such be my father's
pleasure continued conachar with assumed
indifference
i thought said simon glover rather seriously
 that all this was to be laid aside
when at earnest intercession i took you under
my roof i thought that when i undertook being
very loath to do so to teach you an honest
trade we were to hear no more hunting or
hosting or clangatherings or any matters 
the kind
i was not consulted when i was sent hither
said the lad haughtily i cannot tell
what the terms were
but i can tell you sir conachar said
the glover angrily that there is no fashion
u
 honesty in binding yourself to an honest
craftsman and spoiling more hides than your
own is worth and now when you are age
to be some service in taking up the disposal
 your time at your pleasure as if it were your
own property not your masters
reckon with my father about that answered
conachar he will pay you gallantly 
a french mutton for every hide i have spoiled
and a fat cow or bullock for each day i have
been absent
close with him friend glover close with
him said the armourer drily l thou wiltbe paid
gallantly at least if not honestly methinks i
would like to know how many purses have been
emptied to fill the goatskin sporranf that is to
be so free to you its gold and whose pastures
mouton a french gold coin so called from its being impressed
with the image a lamb
f the highland pouch generally formed goatskin and
worn in front the garb is called in gaelic a sporran a
sporranmouuach is a shaggy pouch formed as they usually
are goatskin or some such material with the rough side
outermost
the bullocks have been calved in that are to be
sent down to you from the grampian passes
you remind me friend said the highland
youth turning haughtily towards the
smith that i have also a reckoning to hold
with you
keep at arm'slength then said henry
extending his brawny arm i will have no
more close hugs no more bodkin work like
last night i care little for a wasp's sting yet
i will not allow the insect to come near me if i
have warning
conachar smiled contemptuously i meant
thee no harm he said my father's son did
thee but too much honour to spill such churl's
blood i will pay you for it by the drop that it
may be dried up and no longer soil my fingers
peace thou bragging ape said the smith 
the blood a true man cannot be valued in
gold the only expiation would be that thou
shouldst come a mile into the low country
with two the strongest galloglasses thy
clan and while i dealt with them i would leave
thee to the correction my apprentice little
nankin
here catharine interposed peace she
said my trusty valentine whom i have a right
to command and peace you conachar who
ought to obey me as your master's daughter
it is ill done to awaken again on the morrow
the evil which has been laid to sleep at night
farewell then master said conachar after
another look scorn at the smith which he
only answered with a laugh farewell and i
thank you for your kindness which has been
more than i deserved if i have at times seemed
less than thankful it was the fault circumstances
and not my will catharine he
cast upon the maiden a look strong emotion
in which various feelings were blended he hesitated
as if to say something and at length
turned away with the single woidfarewell five
minutes afterwards with highland buskins on
his feet and a small bundle in his hand he
passed through the north gate perth and directed
his course to the highlands
there goes enough beggary and pride
for a whole highland clan said henry he
talks as familiarly gold pieces as i would 
silver pennies and yet i will be sworn that the
thumb his mother's worsted glove might hold
the treasure the whole clan
like enough said the glover laughing at
the idea his mother was a largeboned woman
especially in the fingers and wrist
and as for cattle continued henry i
reckon his father and brothers steal sheep by
one at a time
the less we say them the better said
the glover becoming again grave rt brothers
he hath none his father is a powerful man 
hath long hands reaches as far as he can and
hears farther than it is necessary to talk 
him
and yet he hath bound his only son apprentice
to a glover in perth said henry
why i should have thought the gentle craft
as it is called st crispin would have suited
him best and that if the son some great mac
or o was to become an artizan it could only be
in the craft where princes set him the example
this remark though ironical seemed to away
i k
ken our friend simon's sense professional
dignity which was a prevailing feeling that
marked the manners the artizans the time
you err son henry he replied with much
gravity the glovers are the more honourable
craft the two in regard they provide
for the accommodation the hands whereas
the shoemakers and cordwainers do but work
for the feet
both equally necessary members the
body corporate said henry whose father had
been a cordwainer
it may be so my son said the glover 
but not both alike honourable bethink you
that we employ the hands as pledges friendship
and good faith and the feet have no such privilege
brave men fight with their hands 
cowards employ their feet in flight a glove
is borne aloft a shoe is trampled in the mire 
a man greets a friend with his open hand
he spurns a dog or one whom he holds as mean
as a dog with his advanced foot a glove on
the point a spear is a sign and pledge 
faith all the wide world over as a gauntlet

flung down is a gage knightly battle while
i know no other emblem belonging to an old
shoe except that some crones will fling them
after a man by way good luck in which
practice i avow myself to entertain no confidence

m nay said the smith amused with his
friend's eloquent pleading for the dignity the
art he practised i am not the man i promise
you to disparage the glover's mystery bethink
you i am myself a maker gauntlets
but the dignity your ancient craft removes
not my wonder that the father this concha
suffered his son to learn a trade any
kind from a lowland craftsman holding us
as they do altogether beneath their magnificent
degree and a race contemptible drudges unworthy
 any other fate than to be ill used
and plundered as often as these barebreeches
dunniewassals see safety and convenience for
doing so
ay answered the glover but there
were powerful reasons for for he
withheld something which seemed upon his
lips and went on for conaclmr's father acting
as he did well i have played fair with
him and i do not doubt but he will act honourably
by me butconachar's sudden leavetaking
has put me to some inconvenience he
had things under his charge i must look
through the booth
can i help you father said henry undeceived
by the earnestness his manner
you no said simon with a dryness
which made henry so sensible the simplicity
 his proposal that he blushed to the eyes at
his own dulness comprehension in a matter
where love ought to have induced him to take
his cue easily up you catharine said the
glover as he left the room entertain your
valentine for five minutes and see he departs
not till my return come hither with me old
dorothy and bestir thy limbs in my behalf
he left the room followed by the old woman 
and henry smith remained with catharine almost
for the first time in his life entirely alone
there was embarrassment on the maiden's part
and awkwardness on that the lover for about
ua
minute when henry calling up his courage
pulled the gloves put his pocket with which
simon had supplied him and asked her to permit
one who had been so highly graced that
morning to pay the usual penalty for being
asleep at the moment when he would have
given the slumbers a whole twelvemonth to
be awake for a single minute
nay but said catharine the fulfilment
 my homage to st valentine infers no such
penalty as you desire to pay and i cannot
therefore think accepting them
these gloves said henry advancing his
seat insidiously towards catharine as he spoke
were wrought by the hands that are dearest
to you and see they are shaped for your
own he extended them as he spoke and taking
her arm in his robust hand spread the gloves
beside it to show how well they fitted look
at that taper arm he said look at these
small fingers think who sewed these seams 
silk and gold and think whether the glove
and the arm which alone the glove can fit ought
to remain separate because the poor glove has
had the misfortune to be for a passing minute
in the keeping a hand so swart and rough as
mine
they are welcome as coming from my father
said catharine and surely not less so
as coming from my friend and there was an
emphasis on the word as well as my valentine
and preserver
let me aid to do them on said the smith
bringing himself yet closer to her side they
may seem a little over tight at first and you
may require some assistance
you are skilful in such service good henry
gow said the maiden smiling but at the
same time drawing farther from her lover
in good faith no said henry shaking his
head my experience has been in donning
steel gauntlets on mailed knights more than in
fitting embroidered gloves upon maidens
i will trouble you then no further and
dorothy shall aid me though there needs no assistance
 my father's eye and fingers are faithful
to his craft what work he puts through his
hands is always true to the measure
let me be convinced it said the smith 
let me see that these slender gloves actually
match the hands they were made for
some other time good henry answered
the maiden i will wear the gloves in honour
 st valentine and the mate he has sent me for
the season i would to heaven i could pleasure
my father as well in weightier matters at present
the perfume the leather harms the headach
i have had since morning
headeach dearest maiden echoed her
lover
if you call it heartach you will not misname
it said catharine with a sigh and proceeded
to speak in a very serious tone henry
she said i am going perhaps to be as
bold as i gave you reason to think me this
morning for i am about to speak the first upon
a subject on which it may well be i ought to
wait till i had to answer you but i cannot
after what has happened this morning suffer my
feelings towards you to remain unexplained
without the possibility my being greatly misconceived
 nay do not answer till you have

heard me out you are brave henry beyond
most men honest and true as the steel you
work upon 
stop stop catharine for mercy's sake 
you never said so much that was good concerning
me save to introduce some bitter censure
 which your praises were the harbingers
i am honest and so forth you would say buta
hotbrained brawler and common shorter
or stabber
i should injure both myself and you in
calling you such no henry to no common
stabber had he worn a plume in his bonnet
and gold spurs on his heels would catharine
glover have offered the little grace she has this
day voluntarily done to you if i have at times
dwelt severely upon the proneness your spirit
to anger and your hand to strife it is because
i would have you if i could so persuade
you hate in yourself the sins vanity and
wrath by which you are most easily beset i
have spoken on the topic more to alarm your
own conscience than to express my opinion i
know as well as my father that in thcbe force

lord and desperate days the whole customs 
our nation nay every christian nation maybe
quoted in favour bloody quarrels for trifling
causes the taking deadly and deep revenge
for slight offences and the slaughter 
each other for emulation honour or often in
mere sport but i know that for all these
things we shall one day be called into judgment
 and fain would i convince thee my
brave and generous friend to listen oftener to
the dictates thy good heart and take less
pride in the strength and dexterity thy unsparing
arm
i am i am convinced catharine exclaimed
henry thy words shall henceforward
be a law to me i have done enough
far too much indeed for proof my bodily
strength and courage but it is only from you
catharine that i can learn a better way 
thinking remember my fair valentine that
my ambition distinction in arms and my
love strife if it can be called such do not
fight evenhanded with my reason and my
milder dispositions but have their patrons and
sticklers to egg them on is there a quarrel 
and suppose that i thinking on your counsels
am something loth to engage in it believe
you i am left to decide between peace or war at
my own choosing not so by st mary there
are a hundred round me to stir me on why
how now smith is thy mainspring rusted says
one jolly henry is deaf on the quarrelling
ear this morning says another stand to it
for the honour perth says my lord the provost
 harry against them for a gold noble
cries your father perhaps now what can a
poor fellow do catharine when all are hallooing
him on in the devil's name and not a soul
putting in a word on the other side 
nay i know the devil has factors enough
to utter his wares said catharine but it is
our duty to despise such idle arguments though
they may be pleaded even by those to whom we
owe much love and honour
then there are the minstrels with their
romaunt and ballads which place all a man's
praise in receiving and repaying hard blows
it is sad to tell catharine how many my
sins that blind harry the minstrel hath to answer
for when i hit a downright blow it is
not so save me st john to do any man
injury but only to strike as william wallace
struck
the minstrels namesake spoke this in such
a tone rueful seriousness that catharine
could scarce forbear smiling but nevertheless
she assured him that the danger his own and
other men's lives ought not for a moment to be
weighed against such simple toys
ay but replied henry emboldened by
her smiles methinks now the good cause 
peace would thrive all the better for an advocate
suppose for example that when i am pressed
and urged to lay hand on my weapon i could
have cause to recollect that there was a gentle
and guardian angel at home whose image would
seem to whisper henry do no violence it
is my hand which you crimson with blood 
henry rush upon no idle danger it is my
breast which you expose to injury such
thoughts would do more to restrain my mood
than if every monk in perth should cry hold
thy hand on pain bell and candle 
if such a warning as could be given by the
voice sisterly affection can have weight in the
debate said catharine do think that in striking
you empurple this hand that in receiving
wounds you harm this heart
the smith took courage at the sincerely affectionate
tone in which these words were delivered

and wherefore not stretch your regard a
degree beyond these cold limits why since you
are so kind and generous as to own some interest
in the poor ignorant sinner before you
should you not at once adopt him as your scholar
and your husband your father desires it 
the town expects it glovers and smiths are
preparing their rejoicing and you only you
whose words are so fair and so kind you will
not give your consent 
henry said catharine in a low and tremulous
voice believe me i should hold it my
duty to comply with my father's commands
were there not obstacles invincible to the
match which he proposes
fcc yet think think but for a moment 
have little to say for myself in comparison 
you who can both read and write but then
i wish to hear reading and could listen to your
sweet voice for ever you love music and i
have been taught to play and sing as well as
some minstrels you love to be charitable i
have enough to give and enough to keep as
large a daily alms as a deacon gives would
never be missed by me your father gets old
for daily toil he would live with us as i should
truly hold him for my father also i would be
as chary mixing in causeless strife as 
thrusting my hand into my own furnace and
if there came on us unlawful violence its wares
would be brought to an illchosen market
may you experience all the domestic happiness
which you can conceive henry but
with some one more happy than i am
so spoke or rather so sobbed the fair maiden
 perth who seemed choking in the attempt
to restrain her tears
you hate me then said the lover after
a pause
heaven is mv witness no
or you love some other better 
it is cruel to ask what it cannot avail you
to know but you are entirely mistaken
yon wildcat conachar perhaps said
henry i have marked his looks 
you avail yourself this painful situation
to insult me henry though i have little deserved
it conachar is nothing to me more
than the trying to tame his wild spirit by instruction
might lead me to take some interest
in a mind abandoned to prejudices and passions
and therein henry not unlike your own
it must then be some these flaunting
silk worm sirs about the court said the armourer
his natural heat temper kindling
from disappointment and vexation some 
those who think they carry it off through the
height their plumed bonnets and the jingle
 their spurs i would i knew which it was
that leaving his natural mates the painted and
perfumed dames the court comes to take
his prey among the simple maidens the
burgher craft i would i knew but his name
and surname 

henry smith said catharine shaking off
the weakness which seemed to threaten to overpower
her a moment before this is the language
 an ungrateful fool or rather a frantic
madman i have told you already there
was no one who stood at the beginning this
conference more high in my opinion than he
who is now losing ground with every word he
utters in the tone unjust suspicion and senseless
anger you had no title to know even what
i have told you which i pray you to observe
implies no preference to you over others though
it disowns any preference another to you it
is enough you should be aware that there is as
insuperable an objection to what you desire as
if an enchante had a spell over my destiny
spells may be broken by true men y said
the smith i would it were come to that
thorbiorn the danish armourer spoke a
spell he had for making breastplates by singing
a certain song while the iron was heating
i told him that his runic rhymes were no proof
against the weapons which fought at loncarty
what farther came it it is needless to tell 
but the corslet and the wearer and the leech
who salved his wound know if henry gowan
break a spell or no
catharine looked at him as if about to return
an answer little approving the exploit he had
vaunted which the downright smith had not
recollected was a kind that exposed him to
her frequent censure but ere she had given
words to her thoughts her father thrust his
head in at the door
henry he said i must interrupt your
more pleasing affairs and request you to come
into my working room in all speed to consult
about certain matters deeply affecting the weal
 the burgh
henry making his obeisance to catharine
left the apartment upon her father's summons
indeed it was probably in favour their future
friendly intercourse that they were parted on
this occasion at the turn which the conversation
seemed likely to take for as the wooer
had begun to hold the refusal the damsel as
somewhat capricious and inexplicable after the
degree encouragement which in his opinion
g
she had afforded catharine on the other hand
considered him rather as an encroacher upon
the grace which she had shown him than one
whose delicacy rendered him deserving such
favour
but there was living in their bosoms towards
each other a reciprocal kindness which on the
termination the dispute was sure to revive
inducing the maiden to forget her offended delicacy
and the lover his slighted warmth 
passion

chapter 
this quarrel may draw blood another day
henry part 
the conclave citizens appointed to meet for
investigating the affray the preceding evening
had now assembled the workroom 
simon glover was filled to crowding by personages
 no little consequence some whom
wore black velvet cloaks and gold chains around
their necks they were indeed the fathers 
the city and there were bailies and deacons in
the honoured number there was an ireful
and offended air importance upon every
brow as they conversed together rather in
whisper than aloud or in detail busiest among
the busy the little important assistant the
previous night oliver proudfute by name and
bonnetmaker by profession was bustling among
the crowd much after the manner the seagull
which flutters screams and sputters most
at the commencement a gale wind though
one can hardly conceive what the bird has better
to do than to fly to its nest and remain quiet
till the gale is over
be that as it may master proudfute was in
the midst the crowd his fingers upon everyone's
button and his mouth in every man's ear
embracing such as were near to his own stature
that he might more closely and mysteriously
utter his sentiments and standing on tip
toe and supporting himself by the cloakcollars
 tall men that he might dole out to them
also the same share information he felt
himself one the heroes the affair being
conscious the dignity superior information
on the subject as an eyewitness and much disposed
to push his connexion with the scuffle a
few points beyond the modesty truth it
cannot be said his communications were in
especial curious and important consisting chiefly
 such assertions as these 
it is all true bv st john i was there
and saw it myself was the first to run to the
fray and if it had not been for me and another
stout fellow who came in about the same time
they had broken into simon glover's house
cut his throat and carried his daughter off to
the mountains it is too evil usage not to be
suffered neighbour crookshank not to be endured
neighbour glass not to be borne neighbours
balneaves pollock and christen it
was a mercy that i and that stout fellow came
in was it not neighbour and worthy bailie
craigdallie 
these speeches were dispersed by the busy
bonnetmaker into sundry ears bailie craigdallied
a portly guildbrother the same who had
advised the prorogation their civic council to
the present place and hour a big burly goodlooking
man shook the deacon from his cloak
with pretty much the grace with which a large
horse shrugs off the importunate fly that has
beset him for ten minutes and exclaimed silence
good citizens here comes simon glover
in whom no man ever saw falsehood we will
hear the outrage from his own mouth
simon being called upon to tell his tale did
so with obvious embarrassment which he imputed
to a reluctance that the burgh should be
put in deadly feud with any one upon his account
it was he dared to say a masking or
revel on the part the young gallants about
court and the worst that might come it
would be that he would put iron sanctions
on his daughter's window in case such another
frolic
why then if this was a mere masking or
mummery said craigdallie our townsman
harry the wynd did far wrong to cut off a
gentleman's hand for such a harmless pleasantry
and the town may be brought to a
heavy fine for it unless we secure the person
 the mutilator
our lady forbid said the glover did
you know what i do you would be as much
afraid handling this matter as if it were
glowing iron but since you will needs put
your fingers in the fire truth must be spoken
and come what will i must say that the
matter might have ended ill for me and mine

but for the opportune assistance henry goethe
armourer well known to you all
and mine also was not wanting said
oliver proudfute though i do not profess to
be utterly so good a swordsman as our neighbour
henry gow you saw me neighbour
glover at the beginning the fray 
i saw you after the it neighbour
answered the glover drily
true true i had forgot you were in your
house while the blows were going and could
not survey who were dealing them
peace neighbour proudfute i prithee
peace said craigdallie who was obviously
tired the tuneless screeching the worthy
deacon
there is something mysterious here said
the bailie but i think i spy the secret our
friend simon is as you all know a peaceful
man and one that will rather sit down with
wrong than put a friend or say a neighbourhood
in danger to seek his redress thou
henry who art never wanting where the
burgh needs a defender tell us what thou knowest
 this matter
our smith told his story to the same purpose
which we have already related and the meddling
maker bonnets added as before and
thou safest me there honest smith didst thou
not 
not i in good faith neighbour answered
henry but you are a little man you know
and i might overlook you
this reply produced a laugh at oliver's expense
who laughed for company but added
m i was one the foremost to the rescue for all
that
why where wert thou then neighbour 
said the smith for i saw you not and i
would have given the worth the best suit 
armour i ever wrought to have seen as stout a
fellow as thou at my elbow
i was no farther off however honest smith 
and whilst thou wert laying on blows as if on an
anvil i was parrying those that the rest the
villains aimed at thee behind thy back and that
is the cause thou safest me not
i have heard smiths old time who
had but one eye said henry i have two
but they are both set in my forehead and so i
could not see behind my back neighbour
the truth is however persevered master
oliver there i was and i will give master
bailie my account the matter for the smith
and i were first up to the fray
enough at present said the bailie waving
to master proudfute an injunction silence
the precognition simon glover and henry
gow would bear out a matter less worthy 
belief and now my masters your opinion
what should be done here are all our burgher
rights broken through and insulted and you
may well fancy that it is by some man power
since no less dared have attempted such an outrage
my masters it is hard on flesh and blood
to submit to this the laws have framed us 
lower rank than the princes and nobles yet it
is against reason to suppose that we will suffer
our houses to be broken into and the honour 
our women insulted without some redress
it is not to be endured answered the citizens
unanimously
here simon glover interfered with a very
anxious and ominous countenance i hope
still that all was not meant so ill as it seemed
to us my worthy neighbours and i for one
would cheerfully forgive the alarm and disturbance
to my poor house providing the fair city
were not brought into jeopardy for me i beseech
you to consider who are to be our judges
that are to hear the case and give or refuse redress
i speak among neighbours and friends
and therefore i speak openly the king god
bless him is so broken in mind and body that
he will but turn us over to some great man
amongst his councillors who shall be in favour
for the time perchance he will refer us to
his brother the duke albany who will make
our petition for righting our wrongs the pretence
for squeezing money out us
we will none albany for our judge
answered the meeting with the same unanimity
as before
or perhaps added simon he will bid
the duke rothsay take charge it and the
wild young prince will regard the outrage as
something for his gay companions to scoff at
and his minstrels to turn into a song
away with rothsay he is too gay to be
our judge again exclaimed the citizens
simon emboldened by seeing he was reaching
the point he aimed at yet pronouncing the
dreaded name with a half whisper next added
would you like the black douglas better to
deal with 
there was no answer for a minute they
looked on each other with fallen countenances
and blanched lips but henry smith spoke out
boldly and in a decided voice the sentiments
which all felt but none else dared give words
to
the black douglas to judge betwixt a
burgher and a gentleman nay a nobleman for
all i know or care the black devil hell
sooner you are mad father simon so much
as to name so wild a proposal
there was again a silence fear and uncertainty
which was at length broken by bailie
craigdallie who looking very significantly to
the speaker replied you are confident in a
stout doublet neighbour smith or you would
not talk so boldly
i am confident a good heart under my
doublet such as it is bailie answered the undaunted
henry and though i speak but little
my mouth shall never be padlocked by any
noble them all
wear a thick doublet good henry or do
not speak so loud reiterated the bailie in the
same significant tone there are border menin
the town who wear the bloody heart on their
shoulder but all this is no rede what shall
we do 
short rede good rede said the smith
let us to our provost and demand his countenance
and assistance
a murmur applause went through the
party and oliver proudfute exclaimed that
is what i have been saying for this half hour
and not one ye would listen to me let us
go to our provost said i he is a gentleman
himself and ought to come between the burgh
and the nobles in all matters
hush neighbours hush be wary what
you say or do said a thin meagre figure a
man whose diminutive person seemed still more
reduced in size and more assimilated to a shadow
by his efforts to assume an extreme degree
 humility and make himself to suit his argument
look meaner yet and yet more insignificant
than nature had made him
m pardon me said he i am but a poor 
nevertheless i have been bred in paris
and learned my humanities and my cursus mededi
as well as some that call themselves learned
leeches methinks i can tent this wound
and treat it with emollients here is our friend
simon glover who is as you all know a man
 worship think you he would not be the
most willing us all to pursue harsh courses
here since his family honour is so nearly concerned
 and since he blenches away from the
charge against these same revellers consider if
he may not have some good reason more than
he cares to utter for letting the matter sleep it
is not for me to put my finger on the sore but
alack we all know that young maidens are
what i call fugitive essences suppose now an
honest maiden i mean in all innocence leaves
her window unlatched on st valentine's morn
that some gallant cavalier may in all honesty
i mean become her valentine for the season 
and suppose the gallant be discovered may she
not scream out as if the visit were unexpected
and and bray all this in a mortar and then
consider will it be a matter to place the town
in feud for 
the pottingar delivered his opinion in a most
insinuating manner but he seemed to shrink
into something less than his natural tenuity
when he saw the blood rise in the old cheeks
 simon glover and inflame to the temples
the complexion the redoubled smith the
last stepping forward and turning a stern look
on the alarmed pottingar broke out as follows
 thou walking skeleton thou asthmatic
gallipot thou poisoner by profession if
i thought that the puff vile breath thou hast
left could blight for the tenth part a minute
the fair fame catharine glover i would
pound thee quacksalver in thine own mortar
and beat up thy wretched carrion with flower
 brimstone the only real medicine in thy
booth to make a salve to rub mangy hounds
with 
hold son henry hold cried the glover
in a tone authority no man has title to
speak this matter but me worshipful bailie
craigdallie since such is the construction that
is put upon my patience i am willing to pursue
this riot to the uttermost and though the
issue may prove that we had better have been
patient you will all see that my catharine hath
not by any lightness or folly hers afforded
grounds for this great scandal
the bailie also interposed u neighbour henry
said he we came here to consult and not
to quarrel as one the fathers the fair city
i command thee to forego all evil will and maltalent
you may have against master pottingar
dwining 
he is too poor a creature bailie said
henry gow for me to harbour feud with 
i that could destroy him and his booth with
one blow my forehammer
peace then and hear me said the official
 we all are as much believers in the honour 
the fair maiden perth as in that our
blessed lady here he crossed himself devoutly
 but touching our appeal to our provost
are you agreed neighbours to put matter like
this into our provost's hand being against a
powerful noble as is to be feared 
the provost being himself a nobleman 
squeaked the pottingar in some measure released
from his terror by the intervention the
bailie god knows i speak not to the disparagement
 an honourable gentleman whose
forebears have held the office he now holds for
many years 
by free choice the citizens perth
said the smith interrupting the speaker with
the tones his deep and decisive voice
ay surely said the disconcerted orator
by the voice the citizens how else i
pray you friend smith interrupt me not i
speak to our worthy and eldest bailie craigdallied
according to my poor mind i say that
come amongst us how he will still this sir patrick
charter is is a nobleman and hawks will
not pick hawks eyes out he may well bear
us out in a feud with the highlandmen and
do the part our provost and leader against
them but whether he that himself wears silk will
take our part against broidered cloak and cloth
 gold though he may do so against tartan and
irish frieze is something to be questioned take
a fool's advice we have saved our maiden 
whom i never meant to speak harm as truly i
knew none they have lost one man's hand
at least thanks to harry smith 
and to me added the little important
bonnetmaker
and to oliver proudfute as he tells us
continued the pottingar who contested no man's
claim to glory provided he was not himself
compelled to tread the perilous paths which lead
to it i say neighbours since they have left
a hand as a pledge they will never come in
couvrefew street again why in my simple mind
we were best to thank our stout townsman and
the town having the honour and these rakehells
the loss that we should hush the matter
up and say no more about it
these pacific counsels had their effect with
some the citizens who began to nod and
look exceedingly wise upon the advocate acquiescence
with whom notwithstanding the offence
so lately given simon glover seemed also
to agree in opinion but not so henry smith
who seeing the consultation at a stand took up
the speech in his usual downright manner
i am neither the oldest nor the richest
among you neighbours and i am not sorry
for it years will come if one lives to see
them and i can win and spend my penny like
another by the blaze the furnace and the
wind the bellows but no man ever saw me
sit down with wrong done in word or deed to
our fair town if man's tongue and man's hand
could right it neither will i sit down with
this outrage if i can help it i will go to the
provost myself if no one will go with me he
is a knight it is true and a gentleman free
and trueborn blood as we all know since
wallace's time who settled his greatgrandsire
amongst us but if he were the proudest nobleman
in the land he is the provost perth
and for his own honour must see the freedoms
and immunities the burgh preserved ay
and i know he will i have made a steel doug
i m
blet for him and have a good guess at the kind
 heart that it was meant to cover
surely said bailie craigdallie it would
be to no purpose to stir at court without sir
patrick charteris's countenance the ready answer
would be go to your provost you borrel
loons so neighbours and townsmen if you will
stand by my side i and our pottingar divining
will repair presently to kinfauns with sin
glover the jolly smith and gallant oliver
proudfute for witnesses to the onslaught and
speak with sir patrick charteris in name 
the fair town
nay said the peaceful man medicine
leave me behind i pray you i lack audacity
to speak before a belted knight
never regard that neighbour you must
go said bailie craigdallie the town hold
me a hotheaded carle for a man threescore 
sim glover is the offended party we all know
that harry gow spoils more harnesses with his
sword than he makes with his hammer and
our neighbour proudfute who take his own
word is at the beginning and every
fray in perth is course a man action wc
must have at least one advocate amongst us for
peace and quietness and thou pottingar must
be the man away with you sirs get your boots
and your beasts horse and mattock i say and
let us meet at the east port that is if it is
your pleasure neighbours to trust us with the
matter
there can be no better rede and we will
all avouch it said the citizens if the provost
take our part as the fair town hath a
right to expect we may bellthereat with the
best them
it is well then neighbours answered the
bailie so said so shall be done meanwhile
i have called the whole towncouncil together
about this hour and i have little doubt looking
around the company that as so many 
them who are in this place have resolved to
consult with our provost the rest will be compliant
to the same resolution and therefore
neighbours and good burghers the fair city
 perth horse and mattock as i said before
and meet me at the east port
a general acclamation concluded the sitting
 this species privy council or lords the
articles and they dispersed the deputation to
prepare for the journey and the rest to tell their
impatient wives and daughters the measures
they had taken to render their chambers safe in
future against the intrusion gallants at unseasonable
hours
while nags are saddling and the towncouncil
debating or rather putting in form what
the leading members their body had already
adopted it may be necessary for the information
 some readers to state in distinct terms
what is more circuitously intimated in the course
 the former discussion
it was the custom at this period when the
strength the feudal aristocracy controlled the
rights and frequently insulted the privileges 
the royal burghs scotland that the latter
where it was practicable often chose their provost
or chief magistrate not out the order
 the merchants shopkeepers and citizens who
inhabited the town itself and filled up the roll
 the ordinary magistracy but elected to that
preeminent state some powerful nobleman or
baron in the neighbourhood the burgh who
was expected to stand their friend at court in
such matters as concerned their common weal
and to lead their civic militia to fight whether
in general battle or in private feud reinforcing
them with his own feudal retainers this protection
was not always gratuitous the provosts
sometimes availed themselves their situation
to an unjustifiable degree and obtained grants
 lands and tenements belonging to the common
good or public property the burgh and
thus made the citizens pay dear for the countenance
which they afforded others were satisfied
to receive the powerful aid the townsmen
in their own feudal quarrels with such
other marks respect and benevolence as the
burgh over which they presided were willing to
gratify them with in order to secure their active
services in case necessity the baron who
was the regular protector a royal burgh accepted
such freewill offerings without scruple
and repaid them by defending the rights the
town by arguments in the council and by bold
deeds in the field
the citizens the town or as they loved
better to call it the fair city perth had for
several generations found a protector and provost
 this kind in the knightly family charters
lords kinfauns in the neighbourhood
 the burgh it was scarce a century in the
time robert iii since the first this distinguished
family had settled in the strong castle
which now belonged to them with the picturesque
and fertile scenes adjoining to it but
the history the first settler chivalrous and
romantic in itself was calculated to facilitate
the settlement an alien in the land in which
his lot was cast we relate it as it is given by
an ancient and uniform tradition which carries
in it great indications truth and is warrant
enough perhaps for its insertion in graver histories
than the present
during the brief career the celebrated patriot
sir william wallace and when his arms
had for a time expelled the english invaders
from his native country he is said to have
undertaken a voyage to france with a small
band trusty friends to try what his presence

for he was respected through all countries for
his prowess might do to induce the french
monarch to send to scotland a body auxiliary
forces or other assistance to aid the scots
in regaining their independence
the scottish champion was on board a small
vessel and steering for the port dieppe
when a sail appeared in the distance which the
mariners regarded with doubt and apprehension
and at last with confusion and dismay wallace
demanded to know what was the cause their
alarm the captain the ship informed him
that the tall vessel which was bearing down
with the purpose boarding that which he
commanded was the ship a celebrated rover
equally famed for his courage strength body
and successful piracies it was commanded by
a gentleman named thomas de longueville a
frenchman by birth but by practice one 
those pirates who called themselves friends to
the sea and enemies to all who sailed upon that
element he attacked and plundered vessels 
all nations like one the ancient norse speaking
as they were termed whose dominion weapon
the mountain waves the master added
that no vessel could escape the rover hy flight
so speedy was the bark he commanded and that
no crew however hardy could hope to resist
him when as was his usual mode combat he
threw himself on board at the head his followers

wallace smiled sternly while the master 
the ship with alarm in his countenance and
tears in his eyes described to him the certainty
 their being captured by the red rover
a name given to de longueville because he
usually displayed the bloodred flag which he
had now hoisted
i will clear the narrow seas this rover
said wallace
then calling together some ten or twelve 
his own followers boyd kerlie seton and
others to whom the dust the most desperate
battle was like the breath life he commanded
them to arm themselves and lie flat upon
the deck so as to be out sight he ordered
the mariners below excepting such as were absolutely
necessary to manage the vessel and he
gave the master instructions upon pain death
so to steer as that while the vessel had an
appearance attempting to fly he should in
fact permit the red rover to come up with
them and do his worst wallace himself then
lay down on the deck that nothing might be
seen which could intimate any purpose resistance
in a quarter an hour de montreville's
vessel ran on board that the champion
and the red rover casting out grappling
irons to make sure his prize jumped
on the deck in complete armour followed
by his men who gave a terrible shout as if
victory had been already secured but the
armed scots started up at once and the rover
found himself unexpectedly engaged with
men accustomed to consider victory as secure
when they were only opposed as one to two or
three wallace himself rushed on the pirate
captain and a dreadful strife began betwixt
them with such fury that the others suspended
their own battle to look on and seemed by
common consent to refer the issue the strife
to the fate the combat between the two
chiefs the pirate fought as well as man could
do but wallace's strength was beyond that
 ordinary mortals he dashed the sword from
the rover's hand and placed him in such peril
that to avoid being cut down he was fain to
close with the scottish champion in hopes
 overpowering him in the grapple in this
also he was foiled they fell on the deck locked
in each other's arms but the frenchman fell undermost
 and wallace fixing his grasp upon his
gorget compressed it so closely notwithstanding
it was made the finest steel that the blood
gushed from his eyes nose and mouth and he
was only able to ask for quarter by signs his
men threw down their weapons and begged for
mercy when they saw their leader thus severely
handled the victor granted them all their
lives but took possession their vessel and
detained them prisoners
when he came in sight the french harbour
wallace alarmed the place by displaying
the rover's colours as if de longueville was
coming to pillage the town the bells were rung
backward horns were blown and the citizens
were hurrying to arms when the scene changed
the scottish lion on his shield gold was
raised above the piratical flag and announced
that the champion scotland was approaching
like a falcon with his prey in his clutch he
landed with his prisoner and carried him to the
court france where at wallace's request the
robberies which the pirate had committed were
forgiven and the king even conferred the honour
 knighthood on sir thomas de longueville
and offered to take him into his service but
the rover had contracted such a friendship for
his generous victor that he insisted on uniting
his fortunes with those wallace with whom
he returned to scotland and fought by his side
in many a bloody battle where the prowess 
sir thomas de longueville was remarked as
inferior to that none save his heroic conqueror
his fate also was more fortunate than
that his patron being distinguished by the
beauty as well as strength his person he
rendered himself so acceptable to a young lady
heiress the ancient family charteris that
she choose him lor her husband bestowing on
him with her hand the fair baronial castle 
kinfauns and the domains annexed to it their
descendants took the name charteris as connecting
themselves with their maternal ancestors
the ancient proprietors the property
though the name thomas de longueville was
equally honoured amongst them and the large
twohanded sword with which he mowed the
ranks war was and is still preserved among
the family muniments another account is
that the family name de longueville himself
was charteris the estate afterwards passed
to a family blairs and is now the property
 lord gray
these barons kinfauns from father to son
held for several generations the office provost
 perth the vicinity the castle and
town rendering it a very convenient arrangement
for mutual support the sir patrick 
this history had more than once led out the men
 perth to battles and skirmishes with the restless
highland depredators and with other enemies
foreign and domestic true it is he used
sometimes to be weary the slight and frivolous
complaints unnecessarily brought before
him and in which he was requested to interest
himself hence he had sometimes incurred the
charge being too proud as a nobleman or
too indolent as a man wealth and one who
was too much addicted to the pleasures the
field and the exercise feudal hospitality to
bestir himself upon all and every occasion when
the fair town would have desired his active interference
but notwithstanding that this occasioned
some slight murmuring the citizens
upon any serious cause alarm were wont to
rally around their provost and were warmly
supported by him both in council and action
chapter vii
the character and quality sir patrick
charteris the provost perth being such as
we have sketched in the last chapter let us now
return to the deputation which was in the act
 rendezvousing at the east port in order to
wait upon that dignitary with their complaints
at kinfauns
and first appeared simon glover on a pacing
palfrey which had sometimes enjoyed the
honour bearing the fairer person as well as the
lighter weight his beautiful daughter his
cloak was muffled round the lower part his
face as a sign to his friends not to interrupt him
by any questions while he passed through the
streets and partly perhaps on account the
coldness the weather the deepest anxiety
was seated on this brow as if the more he meditated
on the matter he was engaged in the
more difficult and perilous it appeared he
only greeted by silent gestures his friends as
they came to the rendezvous
a strong black horse the old galloway
breed an under size not exceeding fourteen
hands but high shouldered stronglimbed wellcoupled
and roundbarrelled bore to the east
port the gallant smith a judge the animal
might see in his eye a spark that vicious
temper which is frequently the accompaniment
 the form that is most vigorous and enduring 
but the weight the hand and the seat the
rider added to the late regular exercise a
long journey had subdued its stubbornness for
the present he was accompanied by the honest
bonnetmaker who being as the reader is
aware a little round man had planted himself
like a red pincushion for he was wrapped ina
scarlet cloak over which he had slung a hawking
pouch on the top a great saddle which
he might be said rather to be perched upon than
to bestride the saddle and the man were girthed
on the ridgebone a great trampling flemish
mare with a nose turned up in the air
like a camel a huge fleece hair at each foot
and every hoof full as large in circumference asa
fryingpan the contrast between the beast
and the rider was so extremely extraordinary
that whilst chance passengers contented themselves
with wondering how he got up his friends
were anticipating with sorrow the perils which
must attend his coming down again for the highseated
horseman's feet did not by any means
come beneath the laps the saddle he had
associated himself to the smith whose motions
he had watched for the purpose joining him 
for it was oliver proudfute's opinion that men
 action showed to most advantage when beside
each other and he was delighted when
some wag the lower class had gravity enough
to cry out without laughing outright there
goes the pride perth there go the slashing
craftsmen the jolly smith the wynd and
the bold bonnetmaker 
it is true the fellow who gave this allhail
thrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraces
like himself but as the bonnetmaker
did not see this byplay he generously threw
him a silver penny to encourage his respect for
martialists this munificence occasioned their
being followed by a crowd boys laughing
and hallooing until henry smith turning back
threatened to switch the foremost them a
resolution which they did not wait to see put
in execution
here are we the witnesses said the little
man on the large horse as they joined simon
glover at the east port but where are they
that should back us ah brother henry 
authority is a load for an ass rather than a spirited
horse it would but clog the motions 
such young fellows as you and me
i could well wish to see you bear ever so
little that same weight worthy master proudfate
replied henry gow u were it but to keep
you firm in the saddle for you bounce about as
if you were dancing a jig on your seat without
any help from your legs

ay ay i raise myself in my stirrups to

something perilous so jezabel and i part not

smith
ay isabel or jezabel all the same you
know but here comes bailie craigdallie at
last with that poor creeping cowardly creature
the pottingar they have brought two townofficers
with their partizans to guard their fair
persons i suppose if there is one thing i hate
more than another it is such a sneaking varlet
as that dwining 
have a care he does not hear you say so
said the smith i tell thee bonnetmaker that
there is more danger in yonder slight wasted
anatomy than in twenty stout fellows like yourself

pshaw bully smith you are but jesting
with me said oliver softening his voice however
and looking towards the pottingar as if
to discover in what limb or lineament his
wasted face and form lay any appearance the
menaced danger and his examination reassuring
him he answered boldly blades and
bucklers man i would stand the feud a
dozen such as dwining what could he do to
any man with blood in his veins 
he could give him a dose physic answered
the smith drily
they had no time for further colloquy for
bailie craigdallie called to them to take the road
to kin fauns and himself showed the example
as they advanced at a leisurely pace the discourse
turned on the reception which they were
to expect from their provost and the interest
which he was likely to take in the aggression
which they complained the glover seemed
particularly desponding and talked more than
once in a manner which implied a wish that
they would yet consent to let the matter rest
he did not speak out very plainly however
fearful perhaps the malignant interpretation
which might be derived from any appearance 
his flinching from the assertion his daughter's
reputation dwining seemed to agree with
him in opinion but spoke more cautiously than
in the morning
after all said the bailie when i think
 all the provinces and good gifts which have
passed from the good town to my lord provost's
i cannot think he will be backward to
show himself more than one lusty boat laden
with bordeaux wine has left the south shore
to discharge its burden under the castle 
kinfauns i have some right to speak that
who was the merchant importer
and said dwining with his squeaking
voice i could speak delicate confections
curious comfits loaves waste bread and
even cakes that rare and delicious condiment
which men call sugar that have gone thitherto
help out a bridal banquet or a listening
feast or such like but alack bailie craigdallied
wine is drunk comfits are eaten and
the gift is forgotten when the flavour is past
away alas neighbour the banquet last
christmas is gone like the last year's snow
but there have been gloves full gold
pieces said the magistrate
i should know that who wrought them

said simon whose professional recollections
still mingled with whatever else might occupy
his mind one was a hawking glove for my
lady i made it something wide her ladyship
found no fault in consideration the intended
lining
well go to said bailie craigdallie the
less i lie and if these are not to the fore it is
the provost's fault and not the town's they
could neither be eat nor drunk in the shape in
which he got them
i could speak a brave armour too
said the smith but cogcm na schie as john
highlands says i think the knight kinfauns
will do his devoir by the burgh in peace
or war and it is needless to be reckoning the
town's good deeds till we see him thankless for
them
so say i cried our friend proudfute from
the top bis mare we fostering blades
never bear so base a mind as to count for wine
and walnuts with a friend like sir patrick charters
nay trust me a good woodsman like
sir patrick will prize the right hunting and
sporting over the lands the burgh as an high
privilege and one which his majesty the king's
grace excepted is neither granted to lord nor
loon save to our provost alone
as the bonnetmaker spoke there was heard
on the left hand the cry so so ivaiv waw
haw being the shout a falconer to his
hawk
methinks yonder is a fellow using the privilege
you mention who from his appearance is
neither king nor provost said the smith
ay marry i see him said the bonnetmaker
who imagined the occasion presented a
prime occasion to win honour thou and i
jolly smith will prick towards him and put
him to the question
have with you then cried the smith 
and his companion spurred his mare and went
off never doubting that gow was at his heels
but craigdallie caught henry's horse by the
reins stand fast by the standard he said 
let us see the luck our light horseman if
he procures himself a broken pate he will be
quieter for the rest the day
from what i already see said the smith
he may easily come by such a boon yonder
fellow who stops so impudently to look at us
as if he were engaged in the most lawful sport
in the world i guess him by his trotting nobler
his rusty headpiece with the cock's feather
and long twohanded sword to be the follower
 some the southland lords men who
live so near the southron that the black jack
is never off their backs and who are as free 
their blows as they are light in their fingers
whilst they were thus speculating on the
issue the rencounter the valiant bonnetmaker
began to pull up jezabel in order that the
smith who he still concluded was close behind
might overtake him and either advance
first or at least abreast himself but when
he saw him at a hundred yards distance standing
composedly with the rest the group
the flesh the champion like that the old
spanish general began to tremble in anticipation
 the dangers into which his own venturous
spirit was about to involve it yet the consciousness
 being countenanced by the neighbourhood
 so many friends the hopes that the
appearance such odds must intimidate the
single intruder and the shame abandoning
an enterprise in which he had volunteered and
when so many persons must witness his disgrace
surmounted the strong inclination which
prompted him to wheel jezabel to the right
about and return to the friends whose protection
he had quitted as fast as her legs could
carry them he accordingly continued his direction
towards the stranger who increased his
alarm considerably by putting his little nag in
motion and riding to meet him at a brisk trot
on observing this apparently offensive movement
our hero looked over his left shoulder
more than once as if reconnoitring the ground
for a retreat and in the meanwhile came to a
decided halt but the philistine was upon him
ere the bonnetmaker could decide whether to
fight or fly and a very ominouslooking philistine
he was his figure was gaunt and lathy
his visage marked by two or three illfavoured
scars and the whole man had much the air
 one accustomed to say stand and deliver
to a true man
this individual began the discourse by exclaiming
in tones as sinister as his looks 
the devil catch you for a cuckoo why do you
ride across the moor to spoil my sport 
worthy stranger said our friend in the
tone pacific remonstrance i am oliver
proudfute a burgess perth and a man 
substance and yonder is the worshipful adam
craigdallie the oldest bailie the burgh with
the fighting smith the wynd and three or
four armed men more who desire to know your
name and how you come to take your pleasure
over these lands belonging to the burgh 
perth although natheless i will answer for
them it is not their wish to quarrel with a
gentleman or stranger for any accidental trespass
 only it is their use and wont not to grant
such leave unless it is duly asked and and
therefore i desire to know your name worthy
sir
the grim and loathly aspect with which the
falconer had regarded oliver proudfute during
his harangue had greatly disconcerted him and
altogether altered the character the inquiry
which with henry gow to back him he would
probably have thought most fitting for the occasion

the stranger replied to it modified as it was
with a most inauspicious grin which the scars
 his visage made appear still more repulsive
you want to know my name my name is
the devil's dick hogarth well known in
annandale for a gentle johnstonee i follow the
stout laird wamphray who rides with his
kinsman the redoubled lord johnstonee who
is banded with the doughty earl douglas 
and the earl and the lord and the laird and i
the esquire fly our hawks where we find our
game and ask no man whose ground we ride
over
m i will do your message sir replied oliver
proudfute meekly enough for he began to be
very desirous to get free the embassy which
he had so rashly undertaken and was in the
act turning his horse's head when the anmandate
man added 
and take you this to boot to keep you in
mind that you met the devil's dick and to teach
you another time to beware how you spoil the
sport any one who wears the flying spur on
his shoulder
with these words he applied two or three
smart blows his ridingrod upon the luckless
bonnetmaker's head and person some them
lighted upon jezabel who turning sharply
round laid her rider upon the moor and galloped
back towards the party citizens
proudfute thus overthrown began to cry for
assistance in no very manly voice and almost in
the same breath to whimper for mercy for his
antagonist dismounting almost as soon as he
fell offered a linger or large wood knife to
his throat while he rifled the pockets the unlucky
citizen and even examined his hawking
bag swearing two or three grisly oaths that he
would have what it contained since the wearer
had interrupted his sport he pulled the belt
rudely off terrifying the prostrate bonnetmaker
still more by the regardless violence which he
used as instead taking the pains to unbuckle
the strap he drew till the fastening gave way
but apparently it contained nothing to his mind
he threw it carelessly from him and at the same
time suffered the dismounted cavalier to rise
while he himself remounted his hobbler and
looked towards the rest oliver's party who
were now advancing
when they had seen their delegate overthrown
there was some laughter so much had
the vaunting humour the bonnetmaker prepared
his friends to rejoice when as henry
smith termed it they saw their oliver meet
with a rowland but when the bonnetmaker's
adversary was seen to bestride him and handle
him in the manner described the armourer could
hold out no longer please you good master
bailie i cannot endure to see our townsman
beaten and rifled and like to be murdered before
us all it reflects upon the fair town and if
it is neighbour proudfute's misfortune it is our
shame i must to his rescue
we will all go to his rescue answered
bailie craigdallie but let no man strike without
order from me we have more feuds on
our hands it is to be feared than we have
strength to bring to good and therefore i
charge you all more especially you henry the
wynd in the name the fair city that you
make no stroke but in selfdefence they all
advanced therefore in a body and the appearance
 such a number drove the plunderer from
his booty he stood at gaze however at some
distance like the wolf which though it retreats
before the dogs cannot be brought to absolute
flight
henry seeing this state things spurred his
horse and advanced far before the rest the
party up towards the scene oliver proudfate's
misfortune his first task was to catch
jezabel by the flowing rein and his next to lead
her to meet her discomfited master who was
crippling towards him his clothes much soiled
with his fall his eyes streaming with tears from
pain as well as mortification and altogether exhibiting
an aspect so unlike the spruce and dapper
importance his ordinary appearance that
the honest smith felt compassion for the little
man and some remorse at having left lii exposed
to such disgrace all men i believe enjoy
an illnatured joke the difference is that
an illnatured person can drink out to very
dregs the amusement which it affords while
the bettermoulded mind soon loses the sense 
the ridiculous in sympathy for the pain the
sufferer
u let me pitch you up to your saddle again
neighbour said the smith dismounting at the
same time and assisting oliver to scramble into
his warsaddle as a monkey might have done
may god forgive you neighbour smith for
not backing me i would not have believed
in it though fifty credible witnesses had sworn
it you
such were the first words spoken in sorrow
more than anger by which the dismayed oliver
vented his feelings
the bailie kept hold my horse by the
bridle and besides henry continued with a
smile which even his compassion could not suppress
 i thought you would have accused me
 diminishing your honour if i brought you
 k
aid against a single man but cheer up the villain
took foul odds you your horse not being
well at command
that is true that is true said oliver
eagerly catching at the apology
and yonder stands the faitour rejoicing at
the mischief he has done and triumphing in
your overthrow like the king in the romance
who played upon the fiddle whilst a city was
burning come thou with me and thou shalt
see how we will handle him nay fear not
that i will desert thee this time
so saying he caught jezabel by the rein
and galloping alongside her without giving
oliver time to express a negative he rushed
toward the devil's dick who had halted on
the top a rising ground at some distance
the gentle johnstonee however either that he
thought the contest unequal or that he had
fought enough for the day snapping his fingers
and throwing his hand out with an air defiance
spurred his horse into a neighbouring
bog through which he seemed to flutter like a
wild duck swinging his lure round his head
and whistling to his hawk all the while though
any other horse and rider must have been instantly
bogged up to the saddlegirths
there goes a thoroughbred mosstrooper
said the smith that fellow will fight or flee
as suits his humour and there is no use to pursue
him any more than to hunt a wild goose
he has got your purse i doulvt me for they
seldom leave off till they are full handed
ye ye yes said proudfute in a melancholy
tone he has got my purse but
there is less matter since he hath left the 

nay the hawkingbag had been an emblem
 personal victory to be sure a trophy
as the minstrels call it
there is more in it than that friend said
oliver significantly
why that is well neighbour i love to
hear you speak in your own scholarly tone
again cheer up you have seen the villain's
back and regained the trophies you had lost
when taken at advantage
ah henry gow henry gow said the
bonnetmaker and stopped short vvitli a deep
sigh nearly amounting to a groan
what is the matter asked his friend
what is it you vex yourself about now 
i have some suspicion my dearest friend
henry smith that the villain fled for fear 
you not me i
do not think so replied the armourer 
he saw two men and fled and who can tell
whether he fled for one or the other besides
he knows by experience your strength and activity
 we all saw how you kicked and struggled
when you were on the ground
did i said poor proudfute i do not
remember it but i know it is my best point 
i am a strong dog in the loins but did they
all see it
all as much as i said the smith smothering
an inclination to laughter
but thou wilt remind them it 
be assured i will answered henry and
 thy desperate rally even now mark what
i say to bailie craigdallie and make the best
 it
vol 
it is not that i require any evidence in my
favour for i am as brave by nature as most
men in perth but only here the man 
valour paused
but only what inquired the stout armourer

but only i am afraid being killed to
leave my pretty wife and my young family you
know would be a sad change smith you will
know this when it is your own case and will
feel abated in courage
it is like that i may said the armourer
musing
then i am so accustomed to the use 
arms and so well breathed that few men can
match me it's all here said the little man
expanding his breast like a trussed fowl and
patting himself with his hands here is room
for all the wind machinery
i dare say you are longbreathed longwinded
 at least your speech betrays 
my speech you are a wag but i have
got the stern post a diamond brought up the
river from dundee
the stern post a drummond exclaimed
the armourer conscience man it will put
you in feud with the whole clan not the least
wrathful in the country as i take it
st andrew man you put me out i
mean a diamond that is a large ship i have
fixed this post in my yard and had it painted
and carved something like a soldan or saracen
and with him i breathe myself and will wield
my twohanded sword against him thrust or
point for an hour together
that must make you familiar with the use
 your weapon said the smith
ay marry does it and sometimes i will
place you a bonnet an old one most likely on
my soldan's head and cleave it with such a
downright blow that in troth the infidel has
but little his skull remaining to hit at
that is unlucky for you will lose your
practice said henry but how say you
bonnetmaker i will put on my headpiece
and corslet one day and you shall hew at me
allowing me my broadsword to parry and pay
back eh what say you 
by no manner means my dear friend
i should do you too much evil besides to tell
you the truth i strike far more freely at a helmet
or bonnet when it is set on my wooden
soldan then i am sure to fetch it down but
when there is a plume feathers in it that nod
and two eyes gleaming fiercely from under the
shadow the visor and when the whole is
dancing about here and there i acknowledge it
puts out my hand fence
so if men would but stand stock still like
your soldan you would play the tyrant with
them master proudfute 
in time and with practice i conclude i
might answered oliver but here we come
up with the rest them bailie craigdallie
looks angry but it is not his kind anger
that frightens me
you are to recollect gentle reader that as
soon as the bailie and those who attended
him saw that the smith had come up to the
forlorn bonnetmaker and that the stranger
had retreated they gave themselves no trouble
about advancing further to his assistance which
they regarded as quite insured by the presence
 the redoubled henry gow they had resumed
their straight road to kinfauns desirous
that nothing should delay the execution their
mission as some time had elapsed ere the 
and the smith rejoined the party
bailie craigdallie asked them and henry smith
in particular what they meant by dallying away
precious time by riding up hill after the falconer
by the mass it was not my fault master
bailie replied the smith if ye will couple
up an ordinary lowcountry greyhound with a
highland wolfdog you must not blame the first
 them for taking the direction in which it
pleases the last to drag him on it was so and
not otherwise with my neighbour oliver proudfate
he no sooner got up from the ground but
he mounted his mare like a flash lightning
and enraged at the unsightly advantage which
yonder rascal had taken his stumbling horse
he flew after him like a dromedary i could not
but follow both to prevent a second stumble and
secure our over bold friend and champion from
the chance some ambush at the top the
bill but the villain who is a follower some
lord the marches and wears a winged spur
for his cognizance fled from our neighbour like
fire from flint
the senior bailie perth listened with surprise
to the legend which it had pleased gow
to circulate for though not much caring for
the matter he had always doubted the bonnetmaker's
romancing account his own exploits
which hereafter he must hold as in some degree
orthodox the shrewd old glover looked closer
into the matter
you will drive the poor bonnetmaker
mad he whispered to henry and set him
aringing his clapper as if he were a townbell
on a rejoicing day when for order and decency
it were better he were silent
o by our lady father replied the smith
i love the poor little braggadocio and could
not think his sitting rueful and silent in
the provost's hall while all the rest them
and in especial that venomous pottingar were
telling their mind
thou art even too goodnatured a fellow
henry answered simon but mark the
difference betwixt these two men the harmless
little bonnetmaker assumes the airs a
dragon to disguise his natural cowardice while
the pottingar wilfully desires to show himself
timid poorspirited and humble to conceal the
danger his temper the adder is not the
less deadly that he creeps under a stone i tell
thee son henry that for all his sneaking looks
and timorous talking this wretched anatomy
loves mischief more than he fears danger 
but here we stand in front the provost's
castle and a lordly place is kinfauns and a
credit to the city it is to have the owner 
such a gallant castle for their chief magistrate
a goodly fortalice indeed said the smith
looking at the broad winding tay s it swept
under the bank on which the castle stood like
its modern successor and seemed the queen 
the valley although on the opposite side the
river the strong walls echo appeared to
dispute the preeminence echo however was
i n that age a peaceful nunnery and the walls
with which it was surrounded were the barriers
 secluded vestal not the bulwarks 
an armed garrison tis a brave castle said
the armourer again looking at the towers 
kinfauns and the breastplate and target 
the bonnie course the tay it were worth
lipping a good blade before wrong were offered
to it
the porter kinfauns who knew from a
distance the persons and characters the party
had already opened the courtyard gate for
their entrance and sent notice to sir patrick
charteris that the eldest bailie perth with
some other good citizens were approaching the
castle the good knight who was getting ready
for a hawking party heard the intimation
with pretty much the same feelings that the
modern representative a burgh hears the
menaced visitation a party his worthy
electors at a time rather unseasonable for their
reception that is he internally devoted the
intruders to mahound and termagant and
outwardly gave orders to receive them with all
lipping e making notches in a sword or knife
decorum and civility commanded the sewers to
bring hot venison steaks and cold baked meats
into the knightly ball with all dispatch and the
butler to broach bis casks and do his duty 
for if the fair city perth sometimes filled his
cellar her citizens were always equally ready
to assist at emptying his flagons
the good burghers were reverently marshalled
into the hall where the knight who
was in a ridinghabit and booted up to the
middle bis thighs received them with a
mixture courtesy and patronizing condescension
 wishing them all the while at the bottom
 the tay on account the interruption
their arrival gave to his proposed amusement
 the morning he met them in the midst 
the ball with bare head and bonnet in hand and
some such salutation as the following u ha
my master eldest bailie and you worthy simon
glover fathers the fair city and you my
learned pottingar and you stout smith 
and my slashing bonnetmaker too who cracks
more skulls than he covers how come i to have
the pleasure seeing so many friends so early 
i was thinking to see my hawks fly and your
company will make the sport more pleasant 
aside i trust in our lady they may break
their necks that is always unless the city
have any commands to lay on me butler gilbert
dispatch thou knave but i hope you
have no more grave errand than to try if the
malvoisie holds its flavour 
the city delegates answered to their provost's
civilities by inclinations and confess
more or less characteristic which the s
bow was the lowest and the smith's
the least ceremonious probably he knew his
own value as a fighting man upon occasion
to the general compliment the elder bailie replied

sir patrick charteris and our noble lord
provost said craigdallie gravely had our
errand been to enjoy the hospitality with which
we have been often regaled here our manners
would have taught us to tarry till your lordship
had invited us as on other occasions and
as to hawking we have had enough on't for
one morning since a wild fellow who was flying
a falcon hard by on the moor unhorsed and
cudgelled our worthy friend oliver bonnetmaker
or proudfute as some men call him
merely because he questioned him in your honour's
name and the town perth's who or
what he was that took so much upon him
and what account gave he himself
said the provost by st john i will teach
him to forestall my sport l
so please your lordship said the bonnetmaker
 he did take me at disadvantage but
i got on horseback again afterwards and
pricked after him gallantly he calls himself
richard the devil
how man he that the rhymes and romances
are made on said the provost i
thought that smack's name had been robert
i trow they be different my lord i only
graced this fellow with the full title for indeed
he called himself the devil's dick and said he
was a johnstonee and a follower the lord 
that name but i put him back into the bog
and recovered my hawking bag which he had
taken when i was at disadvantage
j
sir patrick paused for an instant we
have heard said he the lord johnstonee
and his followers little is to be had by
meddling with them smith tell me did you
endure this 
ay faith did i sir patrick having command
from my betters not to help
well if thou satst down with it said the
provost i see not why we should rise up 
especially as master oliver proudfute though
taken at advantage at first has as he has told us
recovered his reputation and that the burgh
but here comes the wine at length fill round
to my good friends and guests till the wine leap
over the cup prosperity to st johnston and
a merry welcome to you all my honest friends 
and now sit you to eat a morsel for the sun is
high up and it must be long since you thrifty
men have broken your fast
before we eat my lord provost said the
bailie let us tell you the pressing cause 
our coming which as yet we have not touched
upon
nay prithee bailie said the provost
put it off till thou hast eaten some complaint
against the rascally jackie and retainers 
the nobles for playing at football on the streets
 the burgh or some such goodly matter
no my lord said craigdallie stoutly and
firmly it is the jackets masters whom
we complain for playing at football with the
honour our families and using as little ceremony
with our daughters sleeping chambers as
if they were in a border at paris a party 
reiving nightwalkers courtiers and men 
rank as there is but too much reason to believe
attempted to scale the windows simon
glover's house last night they stood in their
defence with drawn weapons when they were
interrupted by henry smith and fought till
they were driven off by the rising the citizens

how said sir patrick setting down the
cup which he was about to raise to his head
cocksbody make that manifest to me and by
the soul thomas louisville i will see
you righted with my best power were it to cost
me life and land who attests this simon
glover you arc held an honest and a cautious

man do you take the truth this charge upon
your conscience 
my lord said simon understand i am
no willing complainer in this weighty matter
no damage has arisen save to the breakers 
the peace themselves i fear only great power
could have encouraged such lawless audacity 
and i were unwilling to put feud between my
native town and some powerful nobleman on
my account but it has been said that if i
hang back in prosecuting this complaint it will
be as much as admitting that my daughter expected
such a visit which is a direct falsehood
therefore my lord i will tell your lordship
what happened so far as i know and leave
further proceeding to your wisdom he then
told from point to point all that he had seen 
the attack
sir patrick charteris listening with much
attention seemed particularly struck with the
escape the man who had been made prisoner
strange he said that you did not secure
him when you had him did you not look at
him so as to know him again 
i had but the light a lantern my lord
provost and as to suffering him to escape i was
alone said the glover and old but yet i
might have kept him had i not heard my
daughter shriek in the upper room and ere i
had returned from her chamber the man had
escaped through the garden
now armourer as a true man and a good
soldier said sir patrick tell me what you
know this matter
henry gow in his own decided style gave
a brief but clear narrative the whole affair
honest proudfute being next called upon
began his statement with an air more importance
 touching this awful and astounding
tumult within the burgh i cannot altogether
it is true say with henry gow that i saw
the very beginning but it will not be denied
that i beheld a great part the latter 
and especially that i procured the evidence most
effectual to convict the knaves
and what is it man said sir patrick
charteris never lose time fumbling and
prating about it what is it 
i have brought your lordship in this pouch
what one the rogues left behind him said
the little man it is a trophy which in good
faith and honest truth i do confess i won not
by the blade but i claim the credit securing
it with that presence mind which few men
possess amidst flashing torches and clashing weapons
i secured it my lord and here it is
so saying he produced from the hawking
pouch already mentioned the stiffened hand
which had been found on the scene the skirmish

nay bonnetmaker said the provost
i'll warrant thee man enough to secure a
rogue's hand after it is cut from the body 
what do you look so busily for in your bag 
there should have been there was a ring
my lord which was on the knave's finger i
fear i have been forgetful and left it at home
for i took it off to show to my wife as she cared
not to look upon the dead hand as women love
not such sights but yet i thought i had put it
on the finger again nevertheless it must i
bethink me be at home i will ride back for it
and henry smith will trot along with me
we will all trot with thee said sir patrick
charteris since i am for perth myself
look you honest burghers and good neighbours
 perth you may have thought me unapt
to be moved by light complaints and trivial
breaches your privileges such as small trespasses
on your game the barons followers playing
football in the street and such like but
by the soul thomas longueville you shall
not find patrick charteris slothful in a matter
 this importance this hand he continued
holding up the severed joint belongs to one
who hath worked no drudgery we will put it
in a way to be known and claimed the owner
if his comrades the revel have but one spark
 honour in them hark you gerard get
me some halfscore good men instantly to
horse and let them take jack and spear meanwhile
neighbours if feud arise out this as is
most likely we must come to each other's support
if my poor house be attacked how many
men will you bring to my support 
the burghers looked at henry gow to whom
vol i p
they instinctively turned when such matters
were discussed i will answer said he for
fifty good fellows to be assembled ere the common
bell has rung ten minutes for a thousand
in the space an hour
it is well answered the gallant provost 
and in the case need i will come to aid the
fair city with such men as i can make and
now good friends let us to horse
chapter vin
it was early in the afternoon st valentine's
day that the prior the dominicans was engaged
in discharge his duties as confessor to
a penitent no small importance this was an
elderly man a goodly presence a florid and
healthful cheek the under part which was
shaded by a venerable white beard which descended
over his bosom the large and clear blue
eyes with the broad expanse brow expressed
dignity but it was a character which seemed
more accustomed to receive honours voluntarily
paid than to enforce them when they were refused
the goodnature the expression was
so great as to approach to defenceless simplicity
or weakness character unfit it might be
inferred to repel intrusion or subdue resistance
amongst the grey locks this personage
was placed a small circlet or coronet gold
upon a blue fillet his beads which were large
and conspicuous were native gold rudelyenough
wrought but ornamented with scottish
pearls rare size and beauty these were
his only ornaments and a long crimson robe 
silk tied by a sash the same colour formed
his attire his shrift being finished he arose
heavily from the embroidered cushion upon
which he kneeled during his confession and by
the assistance a crutchheaded staff ebony
moved lame and ungracefully and with apparent
pain to a chair state which surmounted
by a canopy was placed for his accommodation
by the chimney the lofty and large apartment

this was robert third the name and the
second the illfated family stewart who filled
the throne scotland he had many virtues
and was not without talent but it was his great
misfortune that like others his devoted line
his merits were not a kind suited to the part
which he was called upon to perform in life
the king so fierce a people as the scots then
were ought to have been warlike prompt and
active liberal in rewarding services strict in
punishing crimes one whose conduct should
make him feared as well as beloved the qualities
 robert the third were the reverse 
all these in youth he had indeed seen battles 
but without incurring disgrace he had never
manifested the chivalrous love war and peril
or the eager desire to distinguish himself by dangerous
achievements which in that age was expected
from all who were noble birth and
had claims to authority
besides his military career was very short
amidst the tumult a tournament the young
earl carrick such was then his title received
a kick from the horse sir james douglas
 dalkeith in consequence which he was
lame for the rest his life and absolutely disabled
from taking share either in warfare or in
the military sports and tournaments which were
its image as robert had never testified m such
predilection for violent exertion he did not probably
much regret the incapacities which exempted
him from these active scenes but his
misfortune or rather its consequences lowered
him in the eyes a fierce nobility and warlike
people he was obliged to repose the principal
charge his affairs now in one member now in
another his family sometimes with the actual
rank and always with the power lieutenantgeneral
 the kingdom his paternal affection
would have induced him to use the assistance
 his eldest son a young man spirit and talent
whom in fondness he had created duke 
rothsay in order to give him the present possession
 a dignity next to that the throne
but the young prince's head was too giddy and
his hand too feeble to wield with dignity the
delegated sceptre however fond power
pleasure was the prince's favourite pursuit 
and the court was disturbed and the country
scandalized by the number fugitive amours
and extravagant revels practised by him who
should have set an example order and regularity
to the youth the kingdom
the license and impropriety the duke 
rothsay's conduct was the more reprehensible
in the public view that he was a married person
 although some over whom his youth gaiety
grace and good temper had obtained influence
were opinion that an excuse for his
libertinism might be found in the circumstances
 the marriage itself they reminded each other
that his nuptials were entirely conducted by his
uncle the duke albany by whose counsels
the infirm and timid king was much governed
at the time and who had the character managing
the temper his brother and sovereign
so as might be most injurious to the interests
and prospects the young heir by albany's
machinations the hand the heir apparent was
in a manner put up to sale as it was understood
publicly that the nobleman in scotland
who should give the largest dower to his daughter
might aspire to raise her to the bed the
duke rothsay
in the contest for preference which ensued
george earl dunbar and march who possessed
by himself or his vassals a great part 
the eastern frontier was preferred to other competitors
 and his daughter was with the mutual
good will the young couple actually contracted
to the duke rothsay
but there remained a third party to be consulted
and that was no other than the tremendous
archibald earl douglas terrible alike
from the extent his lands from the offices
and jurisdictions with which he was invested
and from his personal qualities wisdom and
valour mingled with indomitable pride and
more than the feudal love vengeance the
earl was also nearly related to the throne having
married the eldest daughter the reigning
monarch
after the espousals the duke rothsay
with the earl march's daughter douglas as
if he had postponed his share in the negotiation
to show that it could not be concluded with anyone
but himself entered the lists to break off
the contract he made a larger offer with his
daughter marjory than the earl march had
proffered and secured by his own cupidity and
fear the douglas albany exerted his influence
with the timid monarch till he was prevailed
upon to break the contract with the earl 
march and wed his son to marjory douglas a
woman whom he could not love no apology
was offered to the earl march excepting that
the espousals betwixt the prince and elizabeth
 dunbar had not been approved by the states
 parliament and that till such ratification
the contract was liable to be broken off the
earl deeply resented the wrong done to himself
and his daughter and was generally understood
to study revenge which his great influence on
the english frontier was likely to place within
his power
in the meantime the duke rothsay incensed
at the sacrifice his hand and his inclinations
to this stateintrigue took his own mode
 venting his displeasure by neglecting his
wife contemning his formidable and dangerous
fatherinlaw and showing little respect to the
authority the king himself and none whatever
to the remonstrances albany his uncle
whom he looked upon as his confirmed enemy
amid these internal dissensions his family
which extended themselves through his councils
and administration introducing everywhere
a
the baneful effects uncertainty and disunion
the feeble monarch had for some time been
supported by the counsels his queen arabella
a daughter the noble house drummond
gifted with a depth sagacity and firmness
 mind which exercised some restraint
over the levities a son who respected her and
sustained on many occasions the wavering resolution
 her royal husband but after her
death the imbecile sovereign resembled nothing
so much as a vessel drifted from her anchors
and tossed about amidst contending currents
abstractedly considered robert might be said
to doat upon his son to entertain respect and
awe for the character his brother albany so
much more decisive than his own to fear the
douglas with a terror which was almost instinctive
and to suspect the constancy the
bold but fickle earl march but his feelings
towards these various characters were so mixed
and complicated that from time to time they
showed entirely different from what they really
were and according to the interest which
had been last exerted over his flexible mind
the king would change from an indulgent to
a strict and even cruel father from a confiding
to a jealous brother or from a benignant
and bountiful to a grasping and encroaching
sovereign like the cameleon his feeble mind
reflected the colour that firmer character
upon which at the time he reposed for counsel
and assistance and when he disused the
advice one his family and employed the
counsel another it was no unwonted thing
to see a total change measures equally disrespectable
to the character the king and dangerous
to the safety the state
it followed as a matter course that the
clergy the catholic church acquired influence
over a man whose intentions were so excellent
but whose resolutions were so infirm robert
was haunted not only with a due sense the
errors he had really committed but with the
tormenting apprehensions those peccadilloes
which beset a superstitious and timid mind it
is scarcely necessary therefore to add that the
churchmen various descriptions had no small
influence over this easytempered prince though
indeed theirs was at that period an influence
from which few or none escaped however resolute
and firm purpose in affairs a temporal
character we now return from this long digression
without which what we have to relate
could not perhaps have been well understood

the king had moved with ungraceful difficulty
to the cushioned chair which under a
state or canopy stood prepared for his accommodation
and upon which he sank down with enjoyment
like an indolent man who had been
for some time confined to a constrained position
when seated the gentle and venerable
looks the good old man showed benevolence
the prior who now remained standing opposite
to the royal seat with an air deep deference
which cloaked the natural haughtiness
 his carriage was a man betwixt forty and
fifty years age but every one whose hairs
still retained their natural dark colour acute
features and a penetrating look attested the
talents by which the venerable father had acquired
his high station in the community over
which he presided and we may add in the
councils the kingdom in whose service they
were often exercised the chief objects which
his education and habits taught him to keep in
view were the extension the dominion and
the wealth the church and the suppression
 heresy both which he endeavoured to accomplish
by all the means which his situation
afforded him but he honoured his religion by
the sincerity his own belief and by the morality
which guided his conduct in all ordinary
situations the faults the prior anselm
though they led him into grievous error and
even cruelty were perhaps rather those his
age and profession his virtues were his own
these things done said the king and
the lands i have mentioned secured by my
gift to this monastery you are opinion father
that i stand as much in the good graces
 our holy mother church as to term myself
her dutiful son 
surely my liege said the prior would
to god that all her children brought to the efficacious
sacrament confession as deep a
sense their errors and as much will to make
amends for them but i speak these comforting
words my liege not to robert king 
scotland but only to my humble and devout
penitent robert stewart carrick
you surprise me father answered the
king i have little check on my conscience
for aught that i have done in my kingly office
seeing that i use therein less mine own opinion
than the advice the most wise counsellors

even therein lieth the danger my liege
replied the prior the holy father recognises
in your grace in every thought word
and action an obedient vassal the holy
church but there are perverse counsellors
who obey the instinct their wicked hearts
while they abuse the goodnature and ductility
 their monarch and under colour serving
his temporal interests take steps which are prejudicial
to those that last to eternity
king robert raised himself upright in his
chair and assumed an air authority which
though it well became him he did not usually
display
prior anselm he said if you have discovered
anything in my conduct whether as a
king or a private individual which may call
down such censures as your words intimate it
is your duty to speak plainly and i command
you to do so
my liege you shall be obeyed answered
the prior with an inclination the body
then raising himself up and assuming the
dignity his rank in the church he said
hear from me the words our holy father
the pope the successor st peter to whom
have descended the keys both to bind and to
unloose wherefore o robert scotland
hast thou not received into the see st andrews
robert wardle whom the pontiff
hath recommended to fill that see why dost
thou make profession with thy lips dutiful
service to the church when thy actions proclaim
the depravity and disobedience thy
inward soul obedience is better than sacrifices

sir prior said the monarch bearing himself
in a manner not unbecoming his loftyrank
 we may well dispense with answering
you upon this subject being a matter which
concerns us and the estates our kingdom
but does not affect our private conscience
alas said the prior and whose conscience
will it concern at the last day which
 your belted lords or wealthy burgesses will
then step between their king and the penalty
which he has incurred by following their
secular policy in matters ecclesiastical know
mighty king that were all the chivalry thy
realm drawn up to shield thee from the red
levin bolt they would be consumed like scorched
parchment before the blaze a furnace
good father prior said the king on
whose timorous conscience this kind language
seldom failed to make an impression
you surely argue over rigidly in this matter
it was during my last indisposition while the
earl douglas held as lieutenantgeneral
the regal authority in scotland that the obstruction
to the reception the primate unhappily
arose do not therefore tax me with
what happened when i was unable to conduct
the affairs the kingdom and compelled to
delegate my power to another
to your subject sire you have said
enough replied the prior but if the impediment
arose during the lieutenancy the
earl douglas the legate his holiness will
demand wherefore it has not been instantly
removed when the king resumed in his royal
hands the reins authority the black douglas
can do much more perhaps than a subject
should have power to do in the kingdom his
sovereign but he cannot stand betwixt your
grace and your own conscience or release you
from the duties to the holy church which your
situation as a king imposes upon you
father said robert somewhat impatiently
 you are over peremptory in this matter
and ought at least to wait a reasonable season
vol i o
until we have time to consider some remedy
such disputes have happened repeatedly in the
reigns our predecessors and our royal and
blessed ancestor saint david did not resign
his privileges as a monarch without making a
stand in their defence even though he was involved
in arguments with the holy father himself

and therein was that great and good king
neither holy nor saintly said the prior and
therefore was he given to be a rout and a
spoil to his enemies when he raised his sword
against the banners st peter and st paul
and st john beverley in the war as it is
still called the standard well was it for
him that like his namesake the son jesse
his sin was punished upon earth and not entered
against him at the long and dire day 
accounting
well good prior well enough this
for the present the holy see shall god
willing have no reason to complain me i
take our lady to witness i would not for the
crown i wear take the burden wronging
our mother church we have ever feared that
the earl douglas kept his eyes too much
fixed on the fame and the temporalities this
frail and passing life to feel altogether ashe
ought the claims that refer to a future
world
it is but lately said the prior that he
hath taken up forcible quarters in the monastery
 aberbrothock with his retinue a
thousand followers and the abbot is compelled
to furnish him with all he needs for horse
and man which the earl calls exercising the
hospitality which he hath a right to expect from
the foundation to which his ancestors were
contributors certain it were better to return
to the douglas his lands than to submit to such
exaction which more resembles the masterful
license highland tigers and corners than
the demeanour a christian baron
the black douglass said the king with
a sigh are a race which will not be said
nay but father prior i am myself it may
u
be an intruder this kind for my sojourning
hath been long among you and my retinue
though far fewer than the douglas's are nevertheless
enough to cumber you for their daily
maintenance and though our order is to send
out purveyors to lessen your charge as much
as may be yet if there be inconvenience it were
fitting we should remove in time
now our lady forbid said the prior
who if desirous power had nothing meanly
covetous in his temper but was even magnificent
in his generous kindness certainly the dominican
convent can afford to her sovereign the
hospitality which the house offers to every
wanderer whatever condition who will receive
it at the hands the poor servants our
patron no my royal liege come with ten
times your present train they shall neither want
a grain oats a pile straw a morsel 
bread nor an ounce food which our convent
will not supply them it is one thing to employ
the revenues the church which are
so much larger than monks ought to need or
wish for in the suitable and dutiful reception
 your royal majesty and another to have it
wrenched from us by the hands rude and
violent men whose love rapine is only limited
by the extent their power
it is well good prior said the king 
and now to turn our thoughts for an instant
from state affairs can thy reverence inform us
how the good citizens perth have begun
their valentine's day gallantly and merrily
and peacefully i hope
ki for gallantly my liege i know little 
such qualities for peacefully there were three
or four men two cruelly wounded came this
morning before daylight to ask the privilege 
girth and sanctuary pursued by a hue and cry
 citizens in their shirts with clubs bills lochaber
axes and twohanded swords crying kill
and slay each louder than another nay they
were not satisfied when our porter and watch
told them that those they pursued had taken
refuge in the galilee the church but continued
for some minutes clamouring and striking
upon the postern door demanding that the
men who had offended should be delivered upto
them i was afraid their rude noise might
have broken your majesty's rest and raised
some surprise
my rest might have been broken said the
monarch but that sounds violence should
have occasioned surprise alas reverend father
there is in scotland only one place where
the shriek the victim and threats the
oppressor are not heard and that father is 
the grave
the prior stood in respectful silence sympathizing
with the feelings a monarch whose
tenderness heart suited so ill with the condition
and manners his people
and what became the fugitives asked
robert after a minute's pause
surely sire said the prior they were
dismissed as they desired to be before daylight
 and after we had sent out to be assured
that no ambush their enemies watched them
in the vicinity they went their way in peace
you know nothing inquired the king
who the men were or the cause their taking
refuge with you 
the cause said the prior was the riot
with the townsmen hut how arising is not
known to us the custom our house is to afford
twentyfour hours uninterrupted refuge
in the sanctuary st dominic without asking
any question at the poor unfortunates who have
sought relief there if they desire to remain
for a longer space the cause their resorting
to sanctuary must be put upon the register 
the convent and praised be our holy saint
many persons escape the weight the law by
this temporary protection whom did we know
the character their crimes we might have
found ourselves obliged to render up to their
pursuers and persecutors
as the prior spoke a dim idea occurred to
the monarch that the privilege sanctuary
thus peremptorily executed must prove a severe
interruption to the course justice through
his realm but he repelled the feeling as if it
had been a suggestion satan and took care
that not a single word should escape to betray
to the churchman that such a profane thought
had ever occupied his bosom on the contrary
he hasted to change the subject
 the sun he said moves slowly on the
index after the painful information you have
given me i expected the lords my council
ere now to take order with the ravelled affairs 
this unhappy riot evil was the fortune which
gave me rule over a people among whom it
seems to me i am in my own person the only
man who desires rest and tranquillity
the church always desires peace and tranquillity
added the prior not suffering even so
general a proposition to escape the poor king's
oppressed mind without insisting on a saving
clause for the church's honour
we meant nothing else said robert
but father prior you will allow that the
church in quelling strife as is doubtless her
purpose resembles the busy housewife who
puts in motion the dust which she means to
sweep away
to this remark the prior would have made
some reply but the door the apartment was
opened and a gentleman usher announced the
duke albany
i
chapter 
if i know how to manage these affairs
thus thrust disorderly upon my hands
never believe me 
richard 
the duke albany was like his royal brother
named robert the christian name the
latter had been john until he was called to the
throne when the superstition the times observed
that the name had been connected with
misfortune in the lives and reigns john 
england john france and john baliol 
scotland it was therefore agreed that to
elude the bad omen the new king should assume
the name robert rendered dear to
scotland by the recollections robert bruce
we mention this to account for the existence
 two brothers the same christian name in
one family which was not certainly an usual
occurrence more than at the present day
albany also an aged man was not supposed
to be much more disposed for warlike
enterprise than the king himself but if he
had not courage he had wisdom to conceal and
cloak over his want that quality which once
suspected would have ruined all the plans
which his ambition had formed he had also
pride enough to supply in extremity the want
 real valour and command enough over his
nerves to conceal their agitation in other respects
he was experienced in the ways courts
calm cool and crafty fixing upon the points
which he desired to attain while they were yet
far removed and never losing sight them
though the winding paths in which he trode
might occasionally seem to point to a different
direction in his person he resembled the
king for he was noble and majestic both in stature
and countenance but he had the advantage
 his elder brother in being unencumbered
with any infirmity and in every respect lighter
and more active his dress was rich and grave
as became his age and rank and like his royal
brother he wore no arms any kind a case
 small knives supplying at his girdle the place
usually occupied by a dagger in absence a
sword
at the duke's entrance the prior after making
an obeisance respectfully withdrew to a recess
in the apartment at some distance from the
royal seat in order to leave the conversation 
the brothers uncontrolled by the presence a
third person it is necessary to mention that the
recess was formed by a window placed in the
inner front the monastic buildings called the
palace from its being the frequent residence
 the kings scotland but which was unless
on such occasions the residence the prior
or abbot the window was placed over the
principal entrance to the royal apartments and
commanded a view the internal quadrangle
 the convent formed on the right hand by
the length the magnificent church on the
left by a building containing the range cellars
with the refectory chapterhouse and
other conventual apartments rising above them
for such existed altogether independent the
space occupied by king robert and his attendants
 while a fourth row buildings showing
a noble outward front to the rising sun consisted
 a large hospital for the reception
 strangers and pilgrims and many subordinate
offices warehouses and places accommodation
for the ample stores which supplied
the magnificent hospitality the dominican
fathers a lofty vaulted entrance led
through this eastern front into the quadrangle
and was precisely opposite to the window at
which prior anselm stood so that he could see
underneath the dark arch and observe the light
which gleamed beneath it from the eastern and
open portal but owing to the height to which
he was raised and the depth the vaulted
archway his eye could but indistinctly reach
the opposite and external portal it is necessary
to notice these localities we return to the conversation
between the princely relatives
my dear brother said the king raising
the duke albany as he stooped to kiss his
hand my dear dear brother wherefore this
ceremonial are we not both sons the same
stewart scotland and the same elizabeth
more 
i have not forgot that it is so said albany
arising but i must not omit in the
familiarity the brother the respect that is
due to the king
oh true most true robin answered the
king the throne is like a lofty and barren
rock upon which flower or shrub can never
take root all kindly feelings all tender affections
are denied to a monarch a king must
not fold a brother to his heart he dare not
give way to fondness for a son 
such in some respects is the doom 
greatness sire answered albany but heaven
who removed to some distance from your
majesty's sphere the members your own family
has given you a whole people to be your
children
alas robert answered the monarch
your heart is better framed for the duties 
a sovereign than mine i see from the height at
which fate has placed me that multitude whom
you call my children i love them i wish them
well but they are many and they are distant
from me alas even the meanest them has
some beloved being whom he can clasp to his
heart and upon whom he can lavish the fondness
 a father but all that a king can give
to a people is a smile such as the sun bestows
on the snowy peaks the grampian mountains
as distant and as ineffectual alas robin 
our father used to caress us and if he chid us
it was with a tone kindness yet he was a
monarch as well as i and wherefore should not
i be permitted like him to reclaim my poor
prodigal by affection as well as severity 
had affection never been tried my liege
replied albany in the tone one who delivers
sentiments which he grieves to utter means
 gentleness ought assuredly to be first made
use your grace is best judge whether they
have been long enough persevered in and whether
those discouragement and restraint may
not prove a more effectual corrective it is exclusively
in your royal power to take what
measures with the duke rothsay you think
will be most available to his ultimate benefit
and that the kingdom
this is unkind brother said the king 
m you indicate the painful path which you would
have me pursue yet you offer me not your support
in treading it
my support your grace may ever command
replied albany but would it become
me all men on earth to prompt to your
grace severe measures against your son and
heir me on whom in case failure which
heaven forefend your grace's family this
fatal crown might descend would it not bethought
and said by the fiery march and the
haughty douglas that albany had sown dissension
between his royal brother and the heir
to the scottish throne perhaps to clear the way
for the succession his own family no my
liege i can sacrifice my life to your service
but i must not place my honour in danger
you say true robin you say very true
replied the king hastening to put his own interpretation
upon his brother's words wo
s

must not suffer these powerful and dangerous
lords to perceive that there is aught like discord
in the royal family that must be avoided 
all things and therefore we will still try indulgent
measures in hopes correcting the follies
 roth say i behold sparks hope in him
robin from time to time that are well worth
cherishing he is young very young a prince
and in the heyday his blood we will have
patience with him like a good rider with a hottempered
horse let him exhaust this idle humour
and no one will be better pleased with
him than yourself you have censured me in
your kindness for being too gentle too retired
rothsay has no such defects
i will pawn my life he has not replied
albany drily
and he wants not reflection as well as
spirit continued the poor king pleading the
cause his son to his brother i have sent
for him to attend council today and we shall
see how he acquits himself his devoir you
yourself allow robin that the prince wants
vol igl
 audience dressed in the ordinary riding garb
 the time and wearing his poniard he had
left in the anteroom the page honour who
carried his sword the earl was a wellbuilt
handsome man faircomplexioned with a considerable
profusion lightcoloured hair and
bright blue eyes which gleamed like those a
falcon he exhibited in his countenance otherwise
pleasing the marks a hasty and irritable
temper which his situation as a high and
powerful feudal lord had given him but too
many opportunities indulging
i am glad to see you my lord march
said the king with a gracious inclination his
person k you have been long absent from our
councils
m my liege answered march with a deep
reverence to the king and a haughty and formal
inclination to the duke albany if i
have been absent from your grace's councils
it is because my place has been supplied by more
acceptable and i doubt not abler counsellors
and now i come but to say to your highness
that the news from the english frontier make
it necessary that i should return without delay
to my own estates your grace has your wise
and politic brother my lord albany with
whom to consult and the mighty and warlike
earl douglas to carry your councils into effect
i am no use save in my own country 
and thither with your highness's permission
i am purposed instantly to return to attend my
charge as warden the eastern marches 
you will not deal so unkindly with us
cousin replied the gentle monarch here
are evil tidings on the wind these unhappy
highland clans are again breaking into general
commotion and the tranquillity even our
own court requires the best our council to
advise and the bravest our barons to execute
what may be resolved upon the descendant
 thomas randolph will not surely
abandon the grandson robert bruce at such
a period as this 
i leave with him the descendant the farfamed
james douglas answered march
it is his lordship's boast that he never puts
foot in stirrup but a thousand horse mount with
him as his daily lifeguard and i believe the
monks aberbrothock will swear to the fact

surely with all the douglas's chivalry they
are fitter to restrain a disorderly swarm 
highland kerne than i can be to withstand the
archery england and power henry hotspur
 and then here is his grace albany
so jealous in his care your highness's person
that he calls your brandanes to take arms when
a dutiful subject like myself approaches the
court with a poor halfscore horse the retinue
 the meanest the petty barons who own
a tower and a thousand acres barren heath
when such precautions are taken where there
is not the slightest chance peril since i trust
none was to be apprehended from me your
royal person will surely be suitably guarded in
real danger
my lord march said the duke albany
 the meanest the barons whom you
speak put their followers in arms even when
they receive their dearest and nearest friends
within the iron gate their castle and if it
please our lady i will not care less for the
king's person than they do for their own the
brandanes are the king's immediate retainers
and household servants and an hundred them

is but a small guard round his grace when
yourself my lord as well as the earl douglas
often ride with ten times the number
my lord duke replied march when
the service the king requires it i can ride
with ten times as many horse as your grace has
named but i have never done so either traitorously
to entrap the king nor boastfully to
overawe other nobles
brother robert said the king ever anxious
to be a peacemaker you do wrong
even to intimate a suspicion my lord 
march and you cousin march misconstrue
my brother's caution but hark to
divert this angry parley i hear no unpleasing
touch minstrelsy you know the gay
science my lord march and love it well 
step to yonder window beside the holy prior
at whom we make no question touching secular
pleasures and you will tell us if the music and
lay be worth listening to the notes are 
france i think my brother albany's judgment
is not worth a cockleshell in such matters
 so you cousin must report your opinion
whether the poor gleemaiden deserves recompense
our son and the douglas will presently
be here and then when our council is assembled
we will treat graver matters
with something like a smile on his proud
brow march withdrew into the recess the
window and stood there in silence beside the
prior like one who while he obeyed the king's
command saw through and despised the timid
precaution which it implied as an attempt to
prevent the dispute betwixt albany and himself
the tune which was played upon a viol
was gay and sprightly in the commencement
with a touch the wildness the troubadour
music but as it proceeded the faltering
tones the instrument and the female voice
which accompanied it became plaintive and interrupted
a if choked by the painful feelings
 the minstrel
the offended earl whatever might be his
judgment in such matters on which the king
had complimented him paid it may be supposed
little attention to the music the female
minstrel his proud heart was struggling between
the allegiance he owed his sovereign as
well as the love he still found lurking in his
bosom for the person his wellnatured king
and a desire vengeance arising out his
disappointed ambition and the disgrace done
to him by the substitution marjory douglas
to be bride the heirapparent instead his
betrothed daughter march had the vices and
virtues a hasty and uncertain character and
even now when he came to bid the king adieu
with the purpose renouncing his allegiance as
soon as he reached his own feudal territories he
felt unwilling and almost unable to resolve
upon a step so criminal and so full peril it
was with such dangerous cogitations that he
was occupied during the beginning the gleemaiden's
lay but objects which called his attention
powerfully as the songstress proceeded
affected the current his thoughts and riveted
them on what was passing in the courtyard
 the monastery the song was in the provencal
dialect well understood as the language 
poetry in all the courts europe and particularly
in scotland it was more simply turned
however than was the general caste the
sirventes and rather resembled the lai a
norman minstrel it may be translated thus 
fie ta good loufee
ah poor louise the livelong day
she roams from cot to castle gay 
and still her voice and viol say
ah maids beware the woodland way
think on louise 
ah poor louise the sun was high
it smirch'd her cheek it dimm'd her eye
the woodland walk was cool and nigh
where birds with chiming streamlets vie
to cheer louise
ah poor louise the savage bear
made ne'er that lovely grove his lair 
the wolves molest not paths so fair 
but better far had such been there
for poor louise
ah poor louise in woody wold
she met a huntsman fair and bold 
his aldrich was silk and gold
and many a witching tale he told
to poor louise
ah poor louise small cause to pine
hadst thou for treasures the mine 
for peace mind that gift divine
and spotless innocence were thine
ah poor louise 
ah poor louise thy treasure's reft 
i know not if by force or theft
or part by violence part by gift 
but misery is all that's left
to poor louise
let poor louise some succour have 
she will not long your bounty crave
or tire the gay with warning stave 
for heaven has grace and earth a grave
for poor louise
the song was no sooner finished than anxious
lest the dispute should be revived betwixt
his brother and the earl march king
robert called to the latter what think you
 the minstrelsy my lord methinks as i
heard it even at this distance it was a wild and
pleasing lay
my judgment is not deep my lord but
the singer may dispense with my approbation
since she seems to have received that his
grace rothsay the first judge in scotland

how said the king in alarm is my
son below 
he is sitting on horseback by the glec
maiden said march with a malicious smile
on his cheek ft apparently as much interested
by her conversation as her music
how is this father prior said the king
but the prior drew back from the lattice
i have no will to see my lord things
which it would pain me to repeat
how is all this said the king who coloured
deeply and seemed about to rise from his
chair but changed his mind as if unwilling
perhaps to look upon some unbecoming prank
 the wild young prince which he might not
have had heart to punish with necessary severity
the earl march seemed to have a pleasure
in informing him that which doubtless
he desired to remain ignorant
 my liege he cried this is better and
better the gleemaiden has not only engaged
the ear the prince scotland as well as 
every groom and trooper in the courtyard but
she has riveted the attention the black douglas
whom we have not known as a passionate
admirer the gay science but truly i
do not wonder at his astonishment for the prince
j
has honoured the fair professor song and viol
with a kiss approbation
how cried the king is rothsay trifling
with a gleemaiden and his wife's father
in presence go my good father abbot call
the prince here instantly go my dearest brother
 and when they had both left the
room the king continued go good cousin 
march there will be mischief i am assured 
it i pray you go cousin and second my lord
prior's prayers with my commands
you forget my liege said march with
the voice a deeply offended person the father
 elizabeth dunbar were but an unfit
intercessor between the douglas and his royal
soninlaw
i crave your pardon cousin said the gentle
old man i own you have had some wrong
but my rothsay will be murdered i must
go myself
but as he arose precipitately from his chair
the poor king missed a footstep stumbled and
fell heavily to the ground in such a manner
that his head striking the corner the seat
from which he had risen he became for a minute
insensible the sight the accident at
once overcame march's resentment and melted
his heart he ran to the fallen monarch
and replaced him in his seat using in the tenderest
and most respectful manner such means
as seemed most fit to recall animation robert
opened his eyes and gazed around with uncertainty

what has happened are we alone who
is with us 
your dutiful subject march replied the
earl
alone with the earl march repeated
the king his still disturbed intellects receiving
some alarm from the name a powerful chief
whom he had reason to believe he had mortally
offended
yes my gracious liege with poor george
 dunbar whom many have wished your
majesty to think ill though he will be found
truer to your royal person at the last than they
will
indeed cousin you have had too much
wrong and believe me we shall strive to redress
 
if your grace thinks so it may yet be
righted interrupted the earl the prince and
marjory douglas are nearly related the dispensation
from rome was informally granted
their marriage cannot be lawful the pope
who will do much for so godly a prince can set
aside this unchristian union in respect the
precontract bethink you well my liege continued
the earl kindling with a new train 
ambitious thoughts to which the unexpected opportunity
 pleading his cause personally had
given rise bethink you how you choose betwixt
the douglas and me he is powerful and
mighty i grant but george dunbar wears
the keys scotland at his belt and could bring
an english army to the gates edinburgh ere
douglas could leave the skirts charitable to
oppose them your royal son loves my poor deserted
girl and hates the haughty marjory 
douglas your grace may judge the small account
in which he holds her by his toying with
a common gleemaiden even in the presence 
her father
the king had hitherto listened to the earl's
argument with the bewildered feelings a
timid horseman borne away by an impetuous
steed whose course he can neither arrest nor
direct but the last words awakened in his recollection
the sense his son's immediate danger

oh ay most true my son the douglas
oh my dear cousin prevent blood and all
shall be as you will hark there is a tumult 
that was the clash arms
by my coronet by my knightly faith it
is true said the earl looking from the window
upon the inner square the convent now
filled with armed men and brandished weapons
and resounding with the clash armour
the deepvaulted entrance was crowded with
warriors at its farthest extremity and blows
seemed to be in the act being exchanged
betwixt some who were endeavouring to shut
the gate and others who contended to press in
i will go instantly said the earl marchand
soon quell this sudden broil humbly
vol i s
i pray your majesty to think on what i have
had the boldness to propose
i will i will fair cousin said the king
scarce knowing to what he pledged himself 
do but prevent tumult and bloodshed 
chapter x
we must here trace a little more correctly
the events which had been indistinctly seen
from the window the royal apartments and
yet more indistinctly reported by those who
witnessed them the gleemaiden already mentioned
had planted herself where a rise two
large broad steps giving access to the main
gateway the royal apartments gained her
an advantage a foot and a half in height
over those in the court whom she hoped to
form an audience she wore the dress her
calling which was more gaudy than rich and
showed the person more than did the garb 
other females she had laid aside an upper
mantle and a small basket which contained her
slender stock necessaries and a little french
spaniel dog sat beside them as their protector
an azureblue jacket embroidered with silver
and sitting close to the person was open in
front and showed several waistcoats differ en t
coloured silks calculated to set off the symmetry
 the shoulders and bosom and remaining
open at the throat a small silver chain worn
around her neck involved itself amongst these
brilliantcoloured waistcoats and was again
produced from them to display a medal the
same metal which intimated in the name 
some court or guild minstrels the degree
she had taken in the gay or joyous science
a small scrip suspended over her shoulders by
a blue silk ribband hung on her left side
her sunny complexion snowwhite teeth
brilliant black eyes and raven locks marked
her country lying far in the south france
and the arch smile and dimpled chin bore
the same character her luxuriant locks twisted
around a small gold bodkin were kept
in their position by a net silk and gold
short petticoats deeplaced with silver to correspond
with the jacket red stockings which
were visible to near the calf the leg and
buskins spanish leather completed her adjustment
which though far from new had been
saved as an untarnished holiday suit which much
care had kept in good order she seemed about
twentyfive years old but perhaps fatigue and
wandering had anticipated the touch time
in obliterating the freshness early youth
we have said the gleemaiden's manner was
lively and we may add that her smile and repartee
were ready but her gaiety was assumed
as a quality essentially necessary to her
trade which it was one the miseries that
the professors were obliged frequently to cover
an aching heart with a compelled smile this
seemed to be the case with louise who whether
she was actually the heroine her own
song or whatever other cause she might have
for sadness showed at times a strain deep
melancholy thought which interfered with and
controlled the natural flow lively spirits
which the practice the joyous science especially
required she lacked also even in her
gayest sallies the decided boldness and effrontery
 her sisterhood who were seldom at a
loss to retort a saucy jest or turn the laugh
against any who interrupted or interfered with 
them
it may be here remarked that it was impossible
that this class women very numerous
in that age could bear a character generally
respectable they were however protected
by the manners the time and such were the
immunities they possessed by the rights chivalry
that nothing was more rare than to hear
 such errant damsels sustaining injury or
wrong and they passed and repassed safely
where armed travellers would probably have encountered
a bloody opposition but though
licensed and protected in honour their tuneful
art the wandering minstrels male or female
like similar ministers to the public amusement
the itinerant musicians for instance
and strolling comedians our own day led a
life too irregular and precarious to be accounted
a creditable part society indeed among
the stricter catholics the profession was considered
as unlawful
such was the damsel who with viol in
hand and stationed on the slight elevation we
have mentioned stepped forward to the bystanders
and announced herself as a mistress
 the gay science duly qualified by a brief from
a court love and music held at aix in
provence under the countenance the flower
 chivalry the gallant count aimer who now
prayed that the cavaliers merry scotland who
were known over the wide world for bravery and
courtesy would permit a poor stranger to try
whether she could afford them any amusement
by her art the love song was like the love
 fight a common passion the age which
all at least affected whether they actually possessed
it or no therefore the acquiescence in
louise's proposal was universal at the same
time an aged darkbrowed monk who was
among the bysanders thought it necessary to
remind the gleemaiden that since she was tolerated
within these precincts which was an
unusual grace he trusted nothing would be sunjr
or said inconsistent with the holy character 
the place
the gleemaiden bent her head low shook
her sable locks and crossed herself reverentially
as if she disclaimed the possibility such a
transgression and then began the song poor
louise which we gave at length in the last
chapter
just as she commenced she was stopped by
a cry for room room place for the duke
 rothsay 
nay hurry no man on my score said a
gallant young cavalier who entered on a noble
arabian horse which he managed with exquisite
grace though by such slight handling the
reins such imperceptible pressure the limbs
and sway the body that to any eye save that
 an experienced horseman the animal seemed
to be putting forth his paces for his own amusement
and thus gracefully bearing forward a
rider who was too indolent to give himself any
trouble about the matter
the prince's apparel which was very rich
was put on with slovenly carelessness his
form though his stature was low and his
limbs extremely slight was elegant in the extreme
and his features no less handsome but
there was on his brow a haggard paleness which
seemed the effect care or dissipation or
 both these wasting causes combined his
eyes were sunk and dim as from late indulgence
in revelry on the preceding evening while his
cheek was inflamed with unnatural red as if
either the effect the bacchanalian orgies had
not passed away from the constitution or a
morning draught had been resorted to in order
to remove the effects the night's debauchery
such was the duke roth say and heir 
the scottish crown a sight at once interest
and compassion all unbonneted and made
way for him while he kept repeating carelessly
no haste no haste i shall arrive soon enough
at the place i am bound for how's this a
damsel the joyous science ay by st giles 
and a comely wench to boot stand still my
merry men never was minstrelsy marred forme
 a good voice by the mass begin me
that lay again sweetheart
louise did not know the person who addressed
her but the general respect paid by all
around and the easy and indifferent manner in
which it was received showed her she was addressed
by a man the highest quality she
recommenced her lay and sung her best accordingly
 while the young duke seemed thoughtful
and rather affected towards the close the
ditty but it was not his habit to cherish such
melancholy affections this is a plaintive ditty
my nutbrown maid said he chucking the
retreating gleemaiden under the chin and detaining
her by the collar her dress which was
not difficult as he sat on horseback so close to
the steps on which she stood but i warrant
me you have livelier notes at will ma bella tenebraska
 ay and canst sing in bower as well as
wold and by night as well as day
i am no nightingale my lord said louise
endeavouring to escape a species gallantry
which illsuited the place and circumstances a
discrepancy to which he who addressed it to
her seemed contemptuously indifferent
what hast thou there darling he added
removing his hold from her collar to the scrip
which she carried
glad was louise to escape his grasp by slipping
the knot the ribband and leaving the
little bag in the prince's hand as retiring back
beyond his reach she answered nuts my
lord the last season
the prince pulled out a handful nuts accordingly
 nuts child they will break
thine ivory teeth hurt thy pretty voice said
rothsay cracking one with his teeth like a
village schoolboy
they are not the walnuts my own
sunny clime my lord said louise but they
hang low and are within the reach the
poor
you shall have something to give you better
fare poor wandering ape said the duke
in a tone in which feeling predominated more
than in the affected and contemptuous gallantry
 his first address to the glee maiden
at this moment as he turned to ask an attendant
for his purse the prince encountered
the stern and piercing look a tall black man
seated on a powerful irongrey horse who had
entered with attendants while the duke 
rothsay was engaged with louise and now remained
stupefied and almost turned to stone by
his surprise and anger at this unseemly spectacle
even one who had never seen the black
douglas must have known him by his swart
complexion his gigantic frame his buffcoat 
bell'shide and his air courage firmness and
sagacity mixed with the most indomitable pride
the loss an eye in battle though not perceptible
at first sight as the ball the ins used
organ remained similar to the other gave yet
a stern immovable glare to the whole aspect
the meeting the royal soninlaw with his
terrible step father was in circumstances which
arrested the attention all present and the
bysanders waited the issue with silence and
suppressed breath lest they should lose any part
 what was to ensue
when the duke rothsay saw the expression
which occupied the stern features douglas
and remarked that the earl did not make
the least motion towards respectful or even
civil salutation he seemed determined to show
him how little respect he was disposed to pay to
his displeased looks he took his purse from
his chamberlain
here pretty one he said i give thee
one gold piece for the song thou hast sung
me another for the nuts i have stolen from
thee and a third for the kiss thou art about to
give me for know my pretty one that when
fair lips and thine for fault better may be
called so make sweet music for my pleasure
i am sworn to st valentine to press them to
mine
my song is recompensed nobly said louise
shrinking back my nuts are sold to a good
market farther traffic my lord were neither
befitting you nor beseeming me
what you coy it my nymph the highway
said the prince contemptuously know
damsel that one asks you a grace who is unused
to denial
it is the prince scotland the duke
tf
 rothsay said the courtiers around to the
terrified louise pressing forward the trembling
young woman you must not thwart his humour

but i cannot reach your lordship she
said you sit so high on horseback
if i must alight said rothsay there
shall be the heavier penalty what does the
wench tremble for place thy foot on the toe
 my boot give me hold thy hand gallantly
done he kissed her as she stood thus suspended
in the air perched upon his foot and
supported by his hand saying there is thy
kiss and there is my purse to pay it and to
grace thee farther rothsay will wear thy scrip
for the day he suffered the frightened girl to
spring to the ground and turned his looks from
her to bend them contemptuously on the earl
 douglas as if he had said all this i do in
despite you and your daughter's claims
by st bride douglas said the earl
pressing towards the prince this is too much
unmannered boy as void sense as honour 
you know what considerations restrain the hand
 douglas else had you never dared m
can you play at spangcockle my lord
said the prince placing a nut on the second
joint his forefinger and spinning it off by a
smart application the thumb the nut struck
on douglas's broad breast who burst out into
a dreadful exclamation wrath inarticulate
but resembling the growl a lion in depth and
sternness expression i cry your pardon
most mighty lord said the duke rothsay
scornfully while all around trembled i did
not conceive my pellet could have wounded you
seeing you wear a buffcoat surely i trust it
did not hit your eye 
the prior dispatched by the king as we
have seen in the last chapter had by this time
made way through the crowd and laying hold
on douglas's rein in a manner that made it impossible
for him to advance reminded him that
the prince was the son his sovereign and
the husband his daughter
fear not sir prior said douglas i
despise the childish boy too much to raise a
finger against him but i will return insult for
insult here any you who love the douglas
spurn me this quean from the monastery
gates and let her be so scourged that she may
bitterly remember to the last day her life
how she gave means to an respective boy to
affront the douglas 
four or five retainers instantly stepped forth
to execute commands which were seldom uttered
in vain and heavily would louise have
atoned for an offence which she was alike
the innocent unconscious and unwilling instrument
had not the duke rothsay interfered

spurn the poor gleewoman he said in
high indignation scourge her for obeying
my commands spurn thine own oppressed
vassals rude earl scourge thine own faulty
hounds but beware how you touch so much
as a dog that rothsay hath patted on the head
far less a female whose lips he hath kissed 
before douglas could give an answer which
would certainly have been in defiance there
arose that great tumult at the outward gate 
the monastery already noticed and men both
on horseback and on foot began to rush headlong
in not actually fighting with each other
but certainly in no peaceable manner
the contending parties seemingly were partizans
 douglas known by the cognizance
 the bloody heart and citizens the town
 perth it appeared they had been skirmishing
in earnest when without the gates but out 
respect to the sanctified ground they lowered
their weapons when they entered and confined
their strife to a war words and mutual abuse
the tumult had this good effect that it forced
asunder by the weight and press numbers
the prince and douglas at a moment
when the levity the former and the pride 
the latter were urging them to the utmost extremity
but now peacemakers interfered on all
sides the prior and the monks threw themselves
among the multitude and commanded
peace in the name heaven and reverence to
their sacred walls under penalty excommunication
 and their expostulations began to be
listened to albany who was dispatched by his
royal brother at the beginning the fray had
not arrived till now on the scene action he
vol i t
instantly applied himself to douglas and in his
ear conjured him to temper his passion
by st bride douglas i will be avenged 
said the earl no man shall brook life after
he has passed an affront on douglas
why so you may be avenged in fitting
time said albany bullet it not be said
that like a peevish woman the great douglas
could choose neither time nor place for his vengeance
bethink you all that we have laboured
at is like to be upset by an accident george
 dunbar hath had the advantage an audience
with the old man and though it lasted but
five minutes i fear it may endanger the dissolution
 your family match which we brought
about with so much difficulty the authority
from rome has not yet been obtained
a toy answered douglas haughtily 
m they dare not dissolve it
not while douglas is at large and in possession
 his power answered albany but
noble earl come with me and i will show you
at what disadvantage you stand
douglas dismounted and followed his wily
accomplice in silence in a lower hall they saw
l
the ranks the brandanes drawn up wellarmed
in caps steel and shirts mail
their captain making an obeisance to albany
seemed to desire to address him
u what now maclouis said the duke
we are informed the duke rothsay has
been insulted and i can scarce keep the bran
danes within door
u gallant maclouis said albany and
you my trusty brandanes the duke rothsay
my princely nephew is as well as a hopeful
gentleman can be some scuffle there has been
but all is appeased he continued to draw
the earl douglas forward m you see my
lord he said in his ear that if the word arrest
was to be once spoken it would be soon
obeyed and you are aware your attendants are
few for resistance
douglas seemed to acquiesce in the necessity
 patience for the time if my teeth he
said should bite through my lips i will b
silent till it is the hour to speak out
george march in the meanwhile had a
more easy task pacifying the prince mv
lord rothsay be said approaching him
with grave ceremony i need not tell you that
you owe me something for reparation honour
though i blame not you personally for the
breach contract which has destroyed the peace
 my family let me conjure you by what observance
your highness may owe an injured
man to forego for the present this scandalous
dispute
my lord i owe you much replied rothsay
 but this haughty and all controlling lord
has wounded mine honour
my lord i can but add your royal father
is ill hath swooned with terror for your highness's
safety
rl the kind good old man swooned
said you my lord march i am with him
in an instant
the duke rothsay sprung from his saddle
to the ground and was dashing into the palace
like a greyhound when a feeble grasp was laid
on his cloak and the faint voice a kneeling
female exclaimed protection my noble
prince protection for a helpless stranger 
 hands off stroller said the earl march
thrusting the suppliant gleemaiden aside
but the gentler prince paused it is true
he said i have brought the vengeance an
unforgiving devil upon this helpless creature
o heaven what a life is mine so fatal to all
who approach me what to do in the hurry 
she must not go to my apartments and all
my men are such born reprobates ha thou
at mine elbow honest harry smith what
dost thou here 
there has been something a fight my
lord answered our acquaintance the smith
between the townsmen and the southland
loons who ride with the douglas and we have
winged them as far as the abbeygate
lam glad it i am glad it and you
beat the knaves fairly 
fairly does your highness ask said
henry why ay we were stronger in numbers
to be sure but no men ride better armed
than those who follow the bloody heart and
so in a sense we beat them fairly for as your
highness knows it is the smith who makes the
menatarms and men with good weapons area
match for great odds
while they thus talked the earl march
ivho had spoken with some one near the palace
gate returned in anxious haste my lord
duke my lord duke your father is recovered
and if you haste not speedily my lord
 albany and the douglas will have possession
 his royal ear
 and if my royal father is recovered said
the thoughtless prince and is holding or
about to hold council with my gracious uncle
and the earl douglas it befits neither your
lordship nor me to intrude till we are summoned
so there is time for me to speak my
little business with mine honest armourer here
does your highness take it so said the
earl whose sanguine hopes a change favour
at court had been too hastily excited and
were as speedily checked then so let it befor
george dunbar
he glided away with a gloomy and displeased
aspect and thus out the two most powerful
noblemen in scotland at a time when the aristocracy
so closely controlled the throne the reckless
heirapparent had made two enemies the
one by scornful defiance and the other by careless
neglect he heeded not the earl march's
departure however or rather he felt relieved
from his importunity
the prince went on in indolent conversation
with our armourer whose skill in his art
had made him known to many the great lords
about the court
i had something to say to thee smithcanst
thou take up a fallen link in my milan
hauberk 
as well please your highness as my mother
could take up a stitch in the nets she wove
the meaner shall not know my work from
his own
well but that was not what i wished 
thee just now said the prince recollecting
himself this poor glee woman good smith
she must be placed in safety thou art man
enough to be any woman's champion and thou
must conduct her to some place safety
henry smith was as we have seen sufficiently
rash and daring when weapons were in
question but he had also the pride a decent
burgher and was unwilling to place himself in
what might be thought equivocal circumstances
by the sober part his fellowcitizens
may it please your highness he said u i
am but a poor craftsman but though my arm
and sword are at the king's service and your
highness's i am with reverence no squire 
dames your highness will find among your
own retinue knights and lords willing enough
to play sir pandarus troy it is too knightly
a part for poor hal the wynd
humph hah said the prince my
purse edgar his attendant whispered him
true true i gave it to the poor wench i
know enough your craft and craftsmen in
general to be aware that men lure not hawks
with empty hands but i suppose my word
may pass for the price a good armour and
i will pay it thee with thanks to boot for this
slight service
your highness may know other craftsmen
said the smith but with reverence
you know not henry gow he will obey you
in making a weapon or in welding one but he
knows nothing this petticoat service
hark thee thou perthshire mule said
the prince yet smiling while he spoke at the
sturdy punctilio the honest burgher the
wench is as little to me as she is to thee butin
an idle moment as you may learn from those
about thee if thou safest it not thyself i did
her a passing grace which is likely to cost the
poor wretch her life there is no one here whom
i can trust to protect her against the discipline
 belt and bowstring with which the border
brutes who follow douglas will beat her to
death since such is his pleasure
if such be the case my liege she has a
right to every honest man's protection and
since she wears a petticoat though i would it
were longer and a less fanciful fashion i
will answer for her protection as well as a single
man may but where am i to bestow
her 
good faith i cannot tell said the prince
take her to sir john ramorny's lodging
but no no he is ill at ease and besides there
are reasons take her to the devil if thou wilt
but place her in safety and oblige robin 
rothsay
my noble prince said the smith i think
 always with reverence that i would rather
give a defenceless woman to the care the devil
than sir john ramorny but though the
devil be a worker in fire like myself yet i know
not his haunts and with aid holy church
hope to keep him on terms defiance and
moreover how i am to convey her out this
crowd or through the streets in such a mumming
habit may be well made a question
for the leaving the convent said the
prince this good monk seizing upon the
nearest by his cowl father nicholas or boniface

poor brother cyprian at your highness s
command said the father
ay ay brother cyprian continued the
prince yes brother cyprian shall let you
out at some secret passage which he knows 
and i will see him again to pay a prince's
thanks for it
the churchman bowed in acquiescence and
poor louise who during this debate had looked
from the one speaker to the other hastilysaid
 i will not scandalize this good man with
my foolish garb i have a mantle for ordinary
wear
why there smith thou hast a friars hood
and a woman's mantle to shroud thee under i
would all my frailties were as well shrouded 
farewell honest fellow i will thank thee hereafter

then as if afraid farther objection on the
smith's part he hastened into the palace
henry gow remained stupefied at what had
passed and at finding himself involved in a
charge at once inferring much danger and an
equal risk scandal both which joined to a
principal share which he had taken with his
usual forwardness in the fray might he saw
do him no small injury in the suit he pursued
most anxiously at the same time to leave a
defenceless creature to the ill usage the barbarous
collegians and licentious followers 
the douglas was a thought which his manly
heart could not brook for an instant
he was roused from his reverie by the voice
 the monk who sliding out his words with
the indifference which the holy fathers entertained
or affected towards all temporal matters
desired them to follow him the smith put
himself in motion with a sigh much resembling
a groan and without appearing exactly connected
with the monk's motions he followed
him into a cloister and through a postern door
which after looking once behind him the priest
left ajar behind them followed louise who
had hastily assumed her small bundle and calling
her little fourlegged companion had eagerly
followed in the path which opened an escape
from what had shortly before seemed a great
and inevitable danger
chapter xi
the party were now by a secret passage
admitted within the church the outward doors
 which usually left open had been closed
against every one in consequence the recent
tumult when the rioters both parties had
endeavoured to rush into it for other purposes
than those devotion they traversed the
gloomy aisles whose arched roof resounded
to the heavy tread the armourer but was
silent under the standard foot the monk and
the light step poor louise who trembled
excessively as much from fear as cold she
saw that neither her spiritual nor temporal conductor
looked kindly upon her the former
was an austere man whose aspect seemed to
hold the luckless wanderer in some degree 
horror as well as contempt while the latter
though as we have seen one the best natured
men living was at present grave to the
pitch sternness and not a little displeased
with having the part he was playing forced
upon him without as he was constrained to
feel a possibility his declining it
his dislike at his task extended itself to
the innocent object his protection and he
internally said to himself as he surveyed her
scornfully a proper queen beggars to
walk the streets perth with and i a decent
burgher this tawdry minion must have as
ragged a reputation as the rest her sisterhood
and i am finely sped if my chivalry in
her behalf comes to catharine's ears i had
better have slain a man were he the best in
perth and by hammer and nails i would have
done it on provocation rather than convoy this
baggage through the city
perhaps louise suspected the cause her
conductor's anxiety for she said timidly and
with hesitation worthy sir were it not better
i should stop one instant in that chapel
and don my mantle 
humph sweetheart well proposed said
the armourer hut the monk interfered raising
at the same time the finger interdiction
the chapel holy st maddox is no tiring
room for vile jugglers and strollers to shift
their trappings in i will presently show thee
a vestry more suited to thy condition
the poor young woman hung down her
humbled head and turned from the chapel
door which she had approached with the deep
sense selfabasement her little spaniel
seemed to gather from his mistress's looks and
manner that they were unauthorized intruders
on the holy ground which they trode and hung
his ears and swept the pavement with his tail
as he trotted slowly and close to louise's
heels
the monk moved on without a pause they
descended a broad flight steps and proceeded
through a labyrinth subterranean 

sages dimly lighted as they passed a lowarched
door the monk turned and said to
louise with the same stern voice as before 
there daughter folly there is a robingroom
where many before you have deposited
their vestments 
obeying the least signal with ready and timorous
acquiescence she pushed the door open
but instantly recoiled with terror it was a
charnelhouse half filled with dry skulls and
bones
i fear to change my dress there and alone
but if you father command it be it as you
will
m why thou child vanity the remains on
which thou loosest are but the earthly attire 
those who in their day led or followed in the
pursuit worldly pleasure and such shalt
thou be for all thy mincing and ambling thy
piping and thy harping thou and all such ministers
 frivolous and worldly pleasure must
become like these poor bones whom thy idle
nicety fears and loaths to look upon
 say not with idle nicety reverend father
answered the gleemaiden for heaven
knows i covet the repose these poor bleached
relics and if by stretching my body upon
them i could without sin bring my state to
theirs i would choose that charnel heap for my
place rest beyond the fairest and softest
couch in scotland
be patient and come on said the monk ina
milder tone the reaper must not leave the
harvestwork till the sunset gives the signal
they walked forward brother cyprian at
the a long gallery opened the door a
small apartment or perhaps a chapel for it was
decorated with a crucifix before which burned
four lamps all bent and crossed themselves 
and the priest said to the minstrel maiden pointing
to the crucifix what says that emblem 
that he invites the sinner as well as the
righteous to approach
ay if the sinner put from him his sin
said the monk whose tone voice was evidently
milder prepare thyself here for thy
journey
vol i v

louise remained an instant or two in the chapel
and presently reappeared in a mantle 
coarse grey cloth in which she had closely muffled
herself having put such her more gaudy
habiliments as she had time to take off in the
little basket which had before held her ordinary
attire
the monk presently afterwards unlocked a
door which led to the open air they found
themselves in the garden which surrounded the
monastery the dominicans the southern
gate is on the latch and through it you can pass
unnoticed said the monk bless thee my
son and bless thee too unhappy child remembering
where you put off your idle trinkets
may you take care how you again resume them 
alas father said louise if the poor
foreigner could supply the mere wants life
by any more creditable occupation she has
small wish to profess her idle art but 
but the monk had vanished nay the very
door through which she had just passed appeared
to have vanished also so curiously was it
concealed beneath a flying buttress and among
the profuse ornaments gothic architecture
here is a woman let out by this private postern
sure enough was henry's reflection
pray heaven the good fathers never let any
in the place seems convenient for such games
at bopeep but benedicite what is to be done
next i must get rid this quean as fast as 
can and i must see her safe for let her beat
heart what she may she looks too modest
now she is in decent dress to deserve the usage
which the wild scot galloway or the devil's
legion from the liddell are like to afford her
louise stood as if she waited his pleasure
which way to go her little dog relieved by
the exchange the dark subterranean vault for
the open air sprung in wild gambols through
the walks and jumped upon its mistress and
even though more timidly circled close round
the smith's feet to express its satisfaction to
him also and conciliate his favour
down chariot down said the gleemaiden
 you are glad to get into the blessed
sunshine but where shall we rest at night
my poor chariot 
and now mistress said the smith not
churlishly for it was not in his nature but
bluntly as one who is desirous to finish a disagreeable
employment which way lies your
road 
louise looked on the ground and was silent
on being again urged to say which way she desired
to be conducted she again looked down
and said she could not tell
come come said henry i understand
all that i have been agalliarda reveller in my
day but it's best to be plain as matters are
with me now i am an altered man for these
many many months and so my quean you
and i must part sooner than perhaps a light o
love such as you expected to part with a likely
young fellow
louise wept silently with her eyes still cast
on the ground as one who felt an insult which
she had not a right to complain at length
perceiving that her conductor was grown impatient
she faltered out noble sir 
sir is for a knight said the impatient
burgher and noble is for a baron i am harry
 the wynd an honest mechanic and free 
my guild
good craftsman then said the minstrel
woman you judge me harshly but not without
seeming cause i would relieve you immediately
 my company which it may be brings
little credit to good men did i but know which
way to go
to the next wake or fair to be sure said
henry roughly having no doubt that this distress
was affected for the purpose palming
herself upon him and perhaps dreading to
throw himself into the way temptation and
that is the feast st maddox at auchterarder
i warrant thou wilt find the way thither well
enough
after daughter repeated the glee maiden
her southern tongue in vain attempting the
celtic accentuation i am told my poor lays
will not be understood if i go nearer to yon
dreadful range mountains
 will you abide then in perth 
but where to lodge said the wanderer
why where lodged you last night replied
the smith you know where you came from
surely though you seem doubtful where you
are going 
i slept in the hospital the convent
but i was only admitted upon great importunity
and i was commanded not to return
nay they will never take you in with the
brand the douglas upon you that is even
too true but the prince mentioned sir john
ramorny's i can take you to his lodgings
through bystreets though it is short an
honest burgher's office and my time presses
i will go anywhere i know i am a scandal
and incumbrance there was a time when
it was otherwise but this ramorny who is
he 
a courtly knight who lives a jolly bachelor's
life and is master the horse and private
as they say to the young prince
what to the wild scornful young man who
gave occasion to yonder scandal oh take me
not thither good friend is there no christian
woman who would give a poor creature rest in
her cowhouse or barn for one night i will
be gone with early daybreak i will repay her
richly i have gold and i will repay you too
if and
say nothing what you have seen
m who i nay fear mc not pah i scorn
a talebearer
away with you then i hear the clash 
armour
this put life and mettle into the heels the
bonnetmaker who turning his back on the
supposed danger set off at a pace which the
smith never doubted would speedily bring him
to his own house
here is another chattering jay to deal
with thought the smith but i have a hank
over him too the minstrels have a fabliau 
a daw with borrowed feathers why this oliver
is the very bird and by st dunstan if he lets
his chattering tongue run on at my expense i
will so pluck him as never hawk plumed a partridge
and this he knows
as these reflections thronged on his mind
he had nearly reached the his journey
and with the gleemaiden still hanging on his
cloak exhausted partly with fear partly with
fatigue he at length arrived at the middle 
the wynd which was honoured with his own
habitation and from which in the uncertainty
that then attended the application surnames
he derived one his own appellatives
here on ordinary days his furnace was seen
to blaze and four half stripped knaves stunned
the neighbourhood with the clang hammer
and tithy but st valentine's holiday was an
excuse for these men steel having shut the
shop and for the present being absent on their
own errands devotion or pleasure the
house which adjoined to the smithy called henry
its owner and though it was small and
situated in a narrow street yet as there was
a large garden with fruit trees behind it it
constituted upon the whole a pleasant dwelling
the smith instead knocking or calling
which would have drawn neighbours to
doors and windows drew out a passkey his
own fabrication then a great and envied curiosity
and opening the door his house introduced
his companion into his habitation
the apartment which received henry and
the gleemaiden was the kitchen which served
amongst those the smith's station for the family
bittingroom although one or two individuals
like simon glover had an eatingroom
apart from that in which their victuals were
prepared in the corner this apartment
which was arranged with an unusual attention
to cleanliness sat an old woman whose neatness
 attire and the precision with which her
scarlet plaid was drawn over her head so as to
descend to her shoulders on each side might
have indicated a higher rank than that luckier
shoolbred the smith's housekeeper yet such
and no other was her designation and not
having attended mass in the morning she was
quietly reposing herself by the side the fire
her beads half told hanging over her left arm 
her prayers half said loitering upon her tongue 
her eyes half closed resigning themselves to
slumber while she expected the return her
fosterson without being able to guess at what
hour it was likely to happen she started up
at the sound his entrance and bent her eye
upon his companion at first with a look the
utmost surprise which gradually was exchanged
for one expressive great displeasure
now the saints bless mine eyesight henry
smith she exclaimed very devoutly
amen with all my heart get some food
ready presently good nurse for i fear me this
traveller hath dined but lightly
m and again i pray that our lady would
preserve my eyesight from the wicked delusions
 satan 
so be it i tell you good woman but what
is the use all this pattering and praying 
do you not hear me or will you not do as i
bid you 
it must be himself then whatever is it 
but oh it is more like the foul fiend in his
likeness to have such a baggage hanging upon
his cloak o harry smith men called you a
wild lad for less things but who would ever
have thought that harry would have brought a
light leman under the roof that sheltered his
worthy mother and where his own nurse has
dwelt for thirty years 
hold your peace old woman and be 
said the smith this gleewoman
is no leman mine nor tiny other person
that i know but she is going off for dundee
tomorrow by the boats and we must give
her quarters till then
quarters said the old woman you
may give quarters to such cattle if you like it
yourself harry wynd but the came house
shall not quarter that trumpery quean and me
and that you may assure yourself
your mother is angry with me said louise
misconstruing the connexion the parties
i will not remain to give her any offence if
there is a stable or a townhouse an empty stall
will be bed enough for chariot and me
ay ay i am thinking it is the quarters you
arc best used to said dame shoolbred
hark ye nurse shoolbred said the smith
you know i love you for your own sake and
lor my mothers but by st dunstan who was
a saint my own craft i will have the command
 my own house and if you leave me
without any better reason but your own nonsensical
suspicions you must think how you
will have the door open to you when you return
 for you shall have no help mine i promise
you
avveel my bairn and that will never make
me risk the honest name i have kept for sixty
years it was never your mother's custom and
it shall never be mine to take up with ranters
and jugglers and singing women and i am not
so far to seek for a dwelling that the same roof
should cover me and a tramping princess like
that
with this the refractory gouvernante began
in great hurry to adjust her tartan mantle forgoing
abroad by pulling it so far forwards as
to conceal the white linen cap the edges 
which bordered her shrivelled but still fresh
and healthful countenance this done she seized
upon a staff the trusty companion her
journeys and was fairly trudging towards the
door when the smith stepped between her and
the passage
wait at least old woman till we have
cleared scores i owe you for fee and bounties

an that's e'en a dream your own fool's
head what feo or bounties am i to take from
the son your mother that fed clad and
yielded me as if i had been a sister 
and well you repay it nurse leaving her
only child at his utmost need
this seemed to strike the obstinate old woman
with compunction she stopped and looked
at her master and the minstrel alternately then
shook her head and seemed about to resume her
motion towards the door
i only receive this poor wanderer under
my roof urged the smith to save her from
the prison and the scourge
and why should you save her said the
inexorable dame shoolbred i dare say she
has deserved them both as well as ever thief
deserved a hempen collar
u for aught i know she may or she may not
but she cannot deserve to be scourged to death
or imprisoned till she is starved to death and
that is the lot them that the black douglas
bears mal talent against
and you are going to thraw the black
douglas for the sake a glee woman twill
be the worst your feuds yet oh henry
gow there is as much iron in your head as
in your anvil 
i bave sometimes thought this myself mistress
shoolbred but if i do get a cut or two on
this new argument i wonder who is to cure
them if you run away from me like a scared
wildgoose ay and moreover who is to receive
my bonny bride that i hope to bring up the
wynd one these days 
ah harry harry said the old woman
shaking her head this is not the way to prepare
an honest man's house for a young bride
you should be guided by modesty and discretion
and not by chambering and wantonness

i tell you again this poor creature is nothing
to me i wish her only to be safely taken
care and i think the boldest bordering in
perth will respect the bar my door as much
as the gate carlisle castle i am going down
to sim glover's i may stay there all night for
the highland cub is run back to the hills like
a wolf whelp as he is and so there is a bed to
spare and father simon will make me welcome
to the use it you will remain with this
poor creature feed her and protect her during
the night and i will call on her before day and
thou mayst go with her to the boat thyself an
thou wilt and so thou wilt set the last eyes on
her at the same time i shall
there is some reason in that said dame
shoolbred though why you should put your
reputation in risk for a creature that would find
a lodging for a silver twopence and less matter
is a mystery to me
trust me with that old woman and be
kind to the girl
kinder than she deserves i warrant you 
and truly though i little like the company 
such cattle yet i think i am less like to take
harm from her than you unless she be a witch
indeed which may well come to be the case as
the devil is very powerful with all this wayfaring
clanjamfray
no more a witch than i am a warlock
said the honest smith a poor brokenhearted
thing that if she hath done evil has creed a
sore weird for it be kind to her and yon
my musical damsel i will call on you tomor
row morning and carry you to the waterside
this old woman will treat you kindly if you
say nothing to her but what becomes honest
cars
the poor minstrel had listened to this dialogue
without understanding more than its
general tendency for though she spoke english
well she had acquired the language in
england itself and the northern dialect was
then as now a broader and harsher character
she saw however that she was to remain
with the old lady and meekly folding her arms
on her bosom bent her head with humility she
next looked towards the smith with a strong expression
 thankfulness then raising her eyes to
heaven took his passive hand and seemed about
to kiss the sinewy fingers in token deep and
affectionate gratitude but dame shoolbred
did not give license to the stranger's mode 
expressing her feelings she thrust in between
them and pushing poor louise aside said
u no no i'll have none that work go into
the chimney nook mistress and when harry
smith's gone if you must have hands to kiss
you shall kiss mine as long as you like and
you harry away down to sim glover's for if
pretty mistress catharine hears the company
you have brought home she may chance to
like them as little as i do what's the matter
now is the man demented are you going
out without your buckler and the whole town
in misrule 
you are right dame said the armourer 
and throwing the buckler over his broad shoulders
he departed from his house without gilding
farther question
fend votive first

we must now leave the lower parties in ons
historical drama to attend to the incidents
which took place among those a higher rank
and greater importance
we pass from the hut an armourer to the
councilroom a monarch and resume our
story just when the tumult beneath being settled
the angry chieftains were summoned to
the royal presence they entered displeased
with and lowering upon each other each so exclusively
filled with his own fancied injuries as
to be equally unwilling and unable to attend to
reason or argument albany alone calm and
crafty seemed prepared to use their dissatisfaction
for his own purposes and turn each incident
as it should occur to the furtherance his
own indirect ends
the king's irresolution although it amounted
even to timidity did not prevent his assuming
the exterior appearance dignity becoming
his situation it was only when hard
pressed as in the preceding scene that he lost
his apparent composure in general he might
be driven from his purpose but seldom from
his dignity manner he received albany
douglas march and the prior those illassorted
members his motley council with a
mixture courtesy and dignity which reminded
each haughty peer that he stood in the presence
 his sovereign and compelled him todo
the beseeming reverence
hang received their salutations the king
motioned them to be seated and they were
obeying his commands when rothsay entered
he walked gracefully up to his father and
kneeling at his footstool requested his blessing
robert with a look in which fondness and sorrow
were ill disguised made an attempt to assume
a look reproof as he laid his hand on
the youth's head and said with a sigh god
bless thee my thoughtless boy and make thee a
wiser man in thy future years 
amen my dearest father i said rothsay
in a tone feeling such as his happier moments
often evinced he then kissed the royal hand
with the reverence a son and a subject and
instead taking a place at the council board
remained standing behind the king's chair in
such a position that he might when he chose
whisper into his father's ear
the king then made a sign to the prior 
st dominic to take his place at the table on
which there were writing materials which 
all the subjects present albany excepted the
churchman was alone able to use the king
then opened the purpose their meeting by
saying with much dignity
our business my lords respected these
iiuhiippy dissensions in the highlands which we
learn by our latest messengers are about to occasion
the waste and destruction the country
even within a few miles this our own court
but near as this trouble is our ill fate and the
instigation wicked men have raised up one
yet nearer by throwing strife and contention
among the citizens perth and those attendants
who follow your lordships and others our
knights and nobles i must first therefore
apply to yourselves my lords to know why our
court is disturbed by such unseemly contending
and by what means they ought to be repressed
 brother albany do you tell us first
your sentiments on this matter
sir our royal sovereign and brother said
uic duke being in attendance on your person
when the fray began i am not acquainted
with its origin
 and for me said the prince i heard no
worse warcry than a minstrel wench's ballad
and saw no more dangerous bolts flying than
hazel nuts
and i said the earl march could onl v
perceive that the stout citizens perth had iu
chase some knaves who had assumed the bloody
heart on their shoulders they ran too fast to
be actually the men the earl douglas
douglas understood the sneer but only replied
to it by one those withering looks with
which he was accustomed to intimate his mortal
resentment he spoke however with haughty
composure
my liege he said must course know
it is douglas who must answer to this heavy
charge for when was there strife or bloodshed
in scotland but there were foul tongues to asperse
a douglas or a douglas's man as having
given cause to them we have here goodly
witnesses i speak not my lord albany
who has only said that he was as well becomes
him by your grace's side and i say nothing
 my lord rothsay who as befits his rank
years and understanding was cracking nuts
with a strolling musician he smiles here
he may say his pleasure i shall not forget a
tie which he seems to have forgotten but here
is my lord march who saw my followers
flying before the clowns perth i can tell
that earl that the followers the bloody heart
advance or retreat when their chieftain commands
and the good scotland requires
and i can answer exclaimed the equally
proud earl march his blood rushing into
his face when the king interrupted him
 peace angry lords said the king and
remember in whose presence you stand and
you my lord douglas tell us if you can
the cause this mutiny and why your followers
whose general good services we are most
willing to acknowledge were thus active in
private brawl 
i obey my lord said douglas slightly
stooping a head that seldom bent i was
passing from my lodgings in the carthusian
convent through the high street perth
with a few my ordinary retinue when i beheld
some the baser sort crowding around
the cross against which there were nailed this
placard and that which accompanies it
he took from a pocket in the bosom his
buffcoat a human hand and a piece parchment
the king was shocked and agitated
read he said good father prior and
let that ghastly spectacle be removed
the prior read a placard to the following
purpose 
inasmuch as the house a citizen 
perth was assaulted last night being st valentine's
eve by a sort disorderly nightwalkers
belonging to some company the
strangers now resident in the fair city and
whereas this hand was struck from one the
lawless glimmers in the fray that ensued the
provost and magistrates have directed that it
should be nailed to the cross in scorn and
contempt those by whom such brawl was
occasioned and if any one knightly degree
shall say that this our act is wrongfully done
i patrick charteris kinfauns knight will
justify this cartel in knightly weapons within
the barrack or if any one meaner birth
shall deny what is here said he shall be met
with by a citizen the fair city perth according
to his degree and so god and st
john protect the fail city 
you will not wonder my lord resumed
douglas that when my almoner had read tome
the contents so insolent a scroll i caused
one my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgraceful
to the chivalry and nobility scotland
whereupon it seems some these saucy burghers
took license to hoot and insult the hindmost
 my train who wheeled their horses on them
and would soon have settled the feud but for
my positive command that they should follow
me in as much peace as the rascally vulgar
would permit and thus they arrived here in
the guise flying men when with my command
to repel force by force they might have
set fire to the four corners this wretched
borough and stifled the insolent churls like
foxcubs in a burning brake furze
there was a silence when douglas had done
speaking until the duke rothsay answered
addressing his father 
since the earl douglas possesses the
power burning the town where your grace
holds your court so soon as the provost and
he differ about a night riot oi the terms a
cartel am sure we ought all to be thankful
that he has not the will to do so
 the duke rothsay said douglas who
seemed resolved to maintain command his
temper may have reason to thank heaven ina
more serious tone than he now uses that the
douglas is as true as he is powerful this is a
time when the subjects in all countries rise
against the law we have heard the insurgents
 the jacquerie in france and jack
straw and hob miller and parson ball
among the southron and we may be sure there
is fuel enough to catch such a flame were it
spreading to our frontiers when i see peasants
challenging noblemen and nailing the
hands the gentry to their city cross i will
not say i fear mutiny for that would be false
but i foresee and will stand well prepared
for it
and why does my lord douglas say answered
the earl march that this cartel
has been done by churls i see sir patrick
charteris name there and he i ween is no
ehurps blood the douglas himself since he
takes the matter so warmly might lift sir
patrick's gauntlet without soiling his honour

my lord march replied douglas
should speak but what he understands i
do no injustice to the descendant the red
rover when i say he is too slight to be weighed
with the douglas the heir thomas
randolph might have a better claim to be answered

and by ray honour it shall not miss for
want my asking the grace said the earl 
march pulling his glove off
stay my lord said the king do us not
so gross an injury as to bring your feud to
mortal defiance here but rather offer your ungloved
hand in kindness to the noble earl and
embrace in token your mutual fealty to the
crown scotland
not so my liege answered march your
majesty may command me to return my gauntlet
for that and all the armour it belongs to are
at your command while i continue to hold my
earldom the crown scotland but when i
clasp douglas it must be with a mailed baud
farewell my liege my counsels here avail not
and those others are so favourably received
that perhaps farther stay were unwholesome for
my safety may god keep your highness from
open enemies and treacherous friends i am
for my castle dunbar from whence i think
you will soon hear news farewell to you
my lords albany and douglas you are
playing a high game look you play it fairly 
farewell poor thoughtless prince who art
sporting like a fawn within spring a tiger 
farewell all george dunbar sees the evil
he cannot remedy adieu all
the king would have spoken but the accents
died on his tongue as he received from
albany a look cautioning him to forbear the
earl march left the apartment receiving
the mute salutations the members the
council whom he had severally addressed excepting
from douglas alone who returned to
his farewell speech a glance contemptuous
defiance
the recreant goes to betray us to the
southron he said his pride rests on his
possessing that seaworn hold which can admit
the english into lothian nay look not
alarmed my liege i will hold good what i say
nevertheless it is yet time speak bat the
word my liege say but arrest him and
march shall not yet cross the earn on his traitorous
journey
nay gallant earl said albany who wished
rather that the two powerful lords should
counterbalance each other than that one should
obtain a decisive superiority that were too
hasty counsel the earl march came hither
on the king's warrant safeconduct and it
may not consist with my royal brother's honour
to break it yet if your lordship can bring
any detailed proof 
here they were interrupted by a flourish 
trumpets
 his grace albany is unwontedly scrupulous
today said douglas but it skills
not wasting words the time is past these are
march's trumpets and i warrant me he rides
at flight speed so soon as he passes the south
port we shall hear him in time and if it
be as i have conjectured he shall be met with
though all england backed his treachery
nay let us hope better the noble earl
 march said the king no way displeased
that the quarrel betwixt march and douglas
had seemed to obliterate the traces the disagreement
betwixt rothsay and his fatherinlaw
 he hath a fiery but not a sullen temper
in some things he has been i will not say
wronged but disappointed and something is
to be allowed to the resentment high blood
armed with great power but thank heaven all
 us who remain are one sentiment and 
one house so that at least our councils cannot
now be thwarted with disunion father prior
i pray you take your writing materials for you
must as usual be our clerk council and
now to business my lords and our first object
 consideration must be this highland
cumber
between the clan chateau and the clan
quhele or kay said the prior which as
our last advices from our brethren at ducked
inform us is ready to break out into a more formidable
warfare than has yet taken place between
these sons belial who speak noli

thing else than utterly destroying one another
their forces are assembling on each
side and not a man claiming in the tenth degree
 kindred but must repair to the brateach
 his tribe or stand to the punishment
 fire and sword the fiery cross hath fled like
a meteor in every direction and awakened
strange and unknown tribes beyond the distant
murray firth may heaven and st dominic be
our protection but if your lordships cannot
find remedy for evil it will spread broad and
wide and the patrimony the church must
in every direction be exposed to the fury 
these amalekite with whom there is as little
devotion to heaven as there is pity or love to
their neighbours may our lady be our guard 
we hear some them are yet utter heathens
and worship mahound and termagant
 my lords and kinsmen said robert ye 
have heard the urgency this case and may
standard literally cloth the lowland language still
retains the word irate which however is only applicable to a
child's pinafore or a coarse towel to such mean offices nine
words descend
desire to know my sentiments before you deliver
what your own wisdom shall suggest and in
sooth no better remedy occurs to me than to
send two commissioners with full power from
us to settle such debates as be among them 
and at the same time to charge them as they
shall be answerable to the law to lay down their
arms and forbear all practices violence against
each other
i approve your grace's proposal said
rothsay and i trust the good prior will not
refuse the venerable station envoy upon this
peacemaking errand and his reverend brother
the abbot the carthusian convent must
contend for an honour which will certainly add
two most eminent recruits to the large army 
martyrs since the highlanders little regard the
distinction betwixt clerk and layman in the
ambassadors whom you send to them
my royal lord rothsay said the prior
if i am destined to the blessed crown mart
jadom i shall be doubtless directed to the path
y which i am tn attain it meantime if you
vot it r
speak in jest may heaven pardon you and give
you light to perceive that it were better buckle
on your arms to guard the possessions the
church so perilously endangered than to employ
your wit in taunting her ministers and
servants
i taunt no one father prior said the
youth yawning nor have i much objection
to taking arms excepting that they are a somewhat
cumbrous garb and in february a furred
mantle is more suiting the weather than a
steel corslet and it irks me the more to put
on cold harness in this nipping weather that
would but the church send a detachment 
their saints and they have some highland
ones well known in this district and doubtless
used to the climate they might fight their
own battles like merry st george england
but i know not how it is we hear their
miracles when they are propitiated and their
vengeance if any one trespasses on their patrimonies
and these are urged as reasons for extending
their lands by large largesses and yet
if there come down but a band twenty highlanders
bell and candle make no speed
and the belted baron must be fain to maintain
the church in possession the lands which he
has given to her as much as if he himself still
enjoyed the fruits them
son robert said his father jou give
an undue license to your tongue
nay sir i am mute replied the prince
i had no purpose to disturb your highness
or displease the father prior who with so
many miracles at his disposal will not face as
it seems a handful highland catherine
we know said the prior with suppressed
indignation from what source these vile
doctrines are derived which we hear with horror
from the tongue your highness when
princes converse with heretics their minds and
manners are alike corrupted they show themselves
in the streets as the companions masters
and harlots and in the council as the scorners
 the church and holy things
peace good father said the king
 rothsav shall make amends for what he has
idly spoken alas let us take counsel in friendly
fashion rather than resemble a mutinous
crew mariners in a sinking vessel when
each is more intent on quarrelling with his
neighbours than in assisting the exertions 
the forlorn master for the safety the ship 
my lord douglas your house has been seldom
to lack when the crown scotland desired
either wise counsel or manly achievement 
i trust you will help us in this strait 
i can only wonder that the strait should
exist my lord answered the haughty douglas
 when i was intrusted with the lieutenancy
 the kingdom there were some 
these wild clans came down from the grampian
i troubled not the council about the
matter but made the sheriff lord ruthven
get to horse with the forces the carse the
hays the lindsay the oxides and other
gentlemen by st bride when it was steel
coat to frieze mantle the thieves knew what
lances were good for and whether swords had
edges or no there were some three hundred
 their best bonnets besides that their chief
donald cognac left on the moor thorn
and in rochinroy wood j and as many were
gibbeted at ploughman stairs which has still
the name from the hangman work that was don
there this is the way men deal with thieves
in my country and if gentler methods will succeed
better with these parish knaves do not
blame douglas for speaking his mind you
smile my lord rothsay may i ask how i
have a seconc time become your jest before i
have replied to the first which you passed on
me 
nay be not wrathful my good lord 
douglas answered the prince i did but
smile to think how your princely retinue would
dwindle if every thief were dealt with as the
poor highlanders at ploughman stairs
the king again interfered to prevent the earl
from giving an angry reply your lordship
said he to douglas advises wisely that we
should trust to arms when these men come out
against our subjects on the fair and level plain 
 some authorities place this skirmish so late as 
but the difficulty is to put a stop to their disorders
while they continue to lurk within their
mountains i need not tell you that the clan
ciiattan and the clan kay are great confederacies
consisting each various tribes who arc
banded together each to support their own separate
league and who late have had dissensions
which have drawn blood wherever they
have met whether individually or in bands
the whole country is torn to pieces by their
restless feuds
i cannot see the evil this said the
douglas the ruffians will destroy each other
and the deer the highlands will increase as
the men diminish we shall gain as hunters
the exercise we lose as warriors
rather say that the wolves will increase as
the men diminish replied the king
i am content said douglas better
wild wolves than wild highlanders let there
be strong forces maintained along the highland
frontier to separate the quiet from the disturbed
country confine the fire civil war within
the highlands let it spend its uncontrolled
fury and it will be soon burnt out for want 
fuel the survivors will be humbled and will
be more obedient to a whisper your grace's
pleasure than their fathers or the knaves that
now exist have been to your strictest commands

this is wise but ungodly counsel said the
prior shaking his head i cannot take it upon
my conscience to recommend it it is wisdom
but it is the wisdom achitophel crafty at
once and cruel
my heart tells me so said robert laying
his hand on his breast my heart tells me
that it will be asked me at the awful day
robert stewart where are the subjects i have
given thee it tells me that i must account for
them all saxon and gael lowland highland
and border man that i will not be required to
answer for those alone who have wealth and
knowledge but for those also who were robbers
because they were poor and rebels because they
were ignorant
you highness speaks like a christian
king said the prior but you bear the
sword his well as the sceptre and this present
evil is a kind which the sword must cure
 hark ye my lords said the prince
looking up as if a gay thought had suddenly
struck him suppose we teach these savage
mountaineers a strain chivalry it were no
hard matter to bring these two great commanders
the captain the clan chateau and
the chief the no less doughty race the
clan quhele to defy each other to mortal combat
they might fight here in perth we
would lend them horse and armour thus their
fend would be stanched by the death one or
probably both the villains for i think both
avould break their necks in the first charge
my father's godly desire saving blood would
be attained and we should have the pleasure
 seeing such a combat between two salvage
knights for the first time in their lives wearing
breeches and mounted on horses as has
not been heard since the days king 

shame upon yon son robert said the
kiig do you make the distress your butime
country and the perplexity our councils
a subject for buffoonery 
 if you will pardon me royal brother said
albany i think that though my princely
nephew hath started this thought in a jocular
manner there may be something wrought out
 it which might greatly remedy this pressing
evil
good brother replied the king it is
unkind to expose rothsay's folly by pressing
further his illtimed jest we know the highland
clans have not our customs chivalry
nor the habit or mode doing battle which these
require
true royal brother answered albany 
yet i speak not in scorn but in serious earnest
true the mountaineers have not our forms and
mode doing battle in the lists but they have
those which are as effectual to the destruction 
human life and so that the mortal game is played
and the stake won and lost what signifies it
whether these gael fight with sword and lance
as becomes belted knights or with sandbags
like the restless churls england or butcher

each other with knives and skeans in their own
barbarous fashion their habits like our own
refer all disputed rights and claims to the decision
 battle they are as vain too as they
are fierce and the idea that these two clans
would be admitted to combat in presence your
grace and your court will readily induce
them to refer their difference to the fate battle
even were such rough arbitrement less familiar
to their customs and that in any such
numbers as shall be thought most convenient
we must take care that they approach not the
court save in such a fashion and number that
they shall not be able to surprise us and that
point being provided against the more that shall
be admitted to combat upon either side the
greater will be the slaughter among their bravest
and most stirring men and the more the
chance the highlands being quiet for sometime
to come
this were a bloody policy brother said
the king and again i say that i cannot bring
my conscience to countenance the slaughter 
these rude men that are so little better than so
many benighted heathens
 and are their lives more precious asked
albany than those nobles and gentlemen
who by your grace's license are so frequently
admitted to fight in barrack either for the satisfying
 disputes at law or simply to acquire
honour 
the king thus hard pressed had little to say
against a custom so engrafted upon the laws 
the realm and the usages chivalry as the trial
by combat and he only replied god knows
i have never granted such license as you urge
we with unless with the greatest repugnance 
and that i never saw men have strife together
to the effusion blood but i could have wished
to appease it with the shedding my
own
but my gracious lord said the prior it
seems that if we follow not some such policy as
this my lord albany we must have recourse
to that the douglas and at the risk
 the dubious event battle and with the
certainty losing many excellent subjects do
by means the lowland swords that which
these wild mountaineers will otherwise perform
with their owu hand what says my lord 
douglas to the policy his grace albany 
douglas said the haughty lord never
counselled that to be done by policy which
might be attained by open force he remains
by his opinion and is willing to march at the
head his own followers with those the
barons perthshire and the carse and either
bring these highlanders to reason or subjection
or leave the body a douglas among their savage
wildernesses
it is nobly said my lord douglas said
albany and well might the king rely upon
thy undaunted heart and the courage thy
resolute followers but see you not how soon
you may be called elsewhere where your presence
and services are altogether indispensable
to scotland and her monarch marked you
not the gloomy tone in which the fiery earl 
march limited his allegiance and faith to our
sovereign here present to that space for which
he was to remain king robert's vassal and
did not you yourself suspect that he was plotting
a transference his allegiance to england
 other chiefs subordinate power and
inferior fame may do battle with the highlanders
 but if march admit the perches and
their englishmen into our frontiers who will
drive them back if the douglas be elsewhere 
my sword answered douglas is equally
at the service his majesty on the frontier
or in the deepest recesses the highlands
i have seen the backs the proud percy and
george dunbar ere now and i may see them
again and if it is the king's pleasure i should
take measures against this probable conjunction
 stranger and traitor i admit that rather than
trust to an inferior or feebler hand the important
task settling the highlands i would be disposed
to give my opinion in favour the policy
 my lord albany and suffer those savages
to carve each other's limbs without giving
barons and knights the trouble hunting
them down
my lord douglas said the prince
who seemed determined to omit no opportunity
to gall his haughty fatherinlaw does not
choose to leave to us lowlanders even the poor
crumbs honour which might be gathered at
the expense the highland kerne while he
with his border chivalry reaps the full harvest
 victory over the english but percy hath
seen men's backs as well as douglas and i
have known as great wonders as that he who
goes forth to seek such wool should come back
shorn
a phrase said douglas well becoming
a prince who speaks honour with a wandering
harlot's scrip in his bonnet by way favour

excuse it my lord said rothsay men
who have fetched unwittingly become careless
in the choice those whom they love par
amours the chained dog must snatch at the
nearest bone
rothsay my unhappy son exclaimed the
king art thou mad or wouldst thou draw
down on thee the full storm a king and father's
displeasure 
 i am dumb returned the prince at your
grace's command
 well then my lord albany said the
king since such is your advice and since
scottish blood must flow how i pray you are
we to prevail on these fierce men to refer their
quarrel to such a combat as you propose 
that my liege said albany 
your words seem to aim at some one in this
presence father prior said the douglas if
at me they do me foul wrong i am well aware
that the abbot aberbrothick hath made
some illadvised complaints that i suffered not
his beeves to become too many for his pastures
or his stock grain to burst the girls
 the monastery while my followers lacked
beef and their horses corn but bethink you
the pastures and cornfields which produced that
plenty were bestowed by my ancestors on the
house aberbrothick surely not with the purpose
that their descendant should starve in the
midst it and neither will he by st bride 
but for heresy and false doctrine he added
striking his large hand heavily on the counciltable
 who is it that dare tax the douglas i
would not have poor men burned for silly
thoughts but my hand and sword are ever ready
to maintain the christian faith
my lord i doubt it not said the prior so
hath il ever been with your most noble house
m
fot the ablots complaints they may pass to
a second day but what we now desire is a
commission to some noble lord state joined
to others holy church to support by strength
 hand if necessary the inquiries which the
reverend official the bounds and other grave
prelates my unworthy self being one are about
to make into the cause the new doctrines
which are now deluding the simple and depraving
the pure and precious faith approved
by the holy father and his reverend predecessors

 let the earl douglas have a royal commission
to this effect said albany and let
there be no exception whatever from his jurisdiction
saving the royal person for my own
part although conscious that i have neither in
act nor thought received or encouraged a doctrine
which holy church hath not sanctioned
yet i should blush to claim an immunity under
the blood royal scotland lest i should seem
to be seeking refuge against a crime so horrible

i will have nought to do with it said
douglas to march against the english and
the southron traitor march is task enough forme
moreover i am a true scotsman and
will not give way to aught that may put the
church scotland's head farther into the roman
yoke or make the barons coronet stoop to
the mitre and cowl do thou therefore most
noble duke albany place your own name
in the commission and i pray your grace so
to mitigate the zeal the men holy church
who may be associated with you that there be
no over zealous dealings for the smell a
faggot on the tay would bring back the douglas
from the walls york
the duke hastened to give the earl assurance
that the commission should be exercised with
lenity and moderation
ff without a question said king robert
the commission must be ample and did it
consist with the dignity our crown we would
not ourselves decline its jurisdiction but we
trust that while the thunders the church
are directed against the vile authors these
detestable heresies there shall bs measures 
mildness and compassion taken with the unfortunate
victims their delusions riajnoci m
such is ever the course holy church
my lord said the prior st dominic's
 why then let the commission be expedited
with due care in name our brother
albany and such others as shall be deemed convenient
said the king and now once again
let us break up our council and rothsay como
thou with me and lend me thine arm i have
matter for thy private earciooasb ad ybtndm
ho la exclaimed the prince in the tone
in which he would have addressed a managed
horse
om trim iins
wod utuimoq slt
yo more fear than danger i fancy answered
the prince but how can i tell the men who
made this nocturnal disturbance 
there was a follower thine own there
continued the king a man belhal whom
i will have brought to condign punishment
i have no follower to my knowledge capable
 deserving your highnesses displeasure
answered the prince
 i will have no evasions boy where wert
thou on st valentine's eve n x
it is to be hoped that i was serving the
good saint as a man mould might answered
the young man carelessly
 will my royal nephew tell us how his master
 the horse was employed upon that holy
eve said the duke albania 
speak robert i command thee to speak
said the king as ai bodes o
ramorny was employed in my service i
think that answer may satisfy my uncle
 but it will not satisfy wie said the angry
father god knows i never coveted man's
blood but that ramorny's head i will have if
law can give it he has been the encourager
and partaker all thy numerous vices and follies
i will take care he shall be so no more 
call maclouis with a guard 
 do not injure an innocent man interposed
the prince desirous at every sacrifice to preserve
his favourite from the menaced danger 
i pledge my word that ramorny was employed
in business mine therefore could not
be engaged in this brawl
ff false equivocator that thou art said the
king presenting to the prince a ring behold
the signet ramorny lost in the infamous affray
 it fell into the hands a follower the
douglas and was given by the earl to my brother
speak not for ramorny for he dies and
go thou from my presence and repent the flava

nitrous councils which could make thee stand
before me with a falsehood in thy mouth oh
shame robin shame as a son thou hast lied
to thy father as a knight to the head thy
order
the prince stood before his father mute 
and selfconvicted he then gave
way to the honourable feelings which at bottom
he really possessed and threw himself at his
father's feet
the false knight he said deserves degradation
the disloyal subject death but oh 
let the son crave from the father pardon for the
servant who did not lead him into guilt but who
reluctantly plunged himself into it at his command
 let me bear the weight my own folly
but spare those who have been my tools
rather than my accomplices remember ramorn
was preferred to my service by my sainted
mother
name her not robin i charge thee said
the king she is happy that she never saw
the child her love stand before her doubly
dishonoured by guilt and by falsehood
 am indeed unworthy to name ber said
the prince and yet my dear father in her
name i must petition for ramorny's life
 if i might offer my counsel said the duke
 albany who saw that a reconciliation would
soon take place betwixt the father and son i
would advise that ramorny be dismissed from
the prince's household and society with such
further penalty as his imprudence may seem to
merit the public will be contented with his
disgrace and the matter will be easily accommodated
or stifled so that his highness do not
attempt to screen his servant
wilt thou for my sake robin said the
king with a faltering voice and the tear in
his eye dismiss this dangerous man for my
sake who could not refuse thee the heart out
 my bosom 
it shall be done my father done instantly
the prince replied and seizing the pen he
wrote a hasty dismissal ramorny from his
service and put it into albany's hands i
would i could fulfil all your wishes as easily
my royal father he added throwing himself at
n
the king's feet who raised him up and fondly
folded him in his arms
albany scowled but was silent and it was
not till after the space a minute or two that
he said this matter being so happily accommodated
let me ask if your majesty is pleased
to attend the evensong service in the chapel
r
ij
surely said the king have i not
thanks to pay to god who has restored union
to my family you will go with us brother 
so please your grace to give me leave 
absence no said the duke i must concert
with the douglas and others the manner in
which we may bring these highland vultures
to our lure r r r 
albany retired to think over his ambitious
projects while the father and son attended divine
service to thank god for their happy reconciliation

chapter 
a former chapter opened in the royal confessional
 we are now to introduce our readers
to a situation somewhat similar though the
scene and persons were very different instead
 a gothic and darkened apartment in a monastery
one the most beautiful prospects in
scotland lay extended beneath the hill kinsoul
and at the foot a rock which commanded
the view in every direction sat the
fair maid perth listening in an attitude 
devout attention to the instructions a carthusian
monk in his white gown and scapular
who concluded his discourse with prayer
in which his proselyte devoutly joined
when they had finished their devotions the
priest sat for some time with his eyes fixed on
the glorious prospect which even the early
and chilly season could not conceal the beauties
and it was some time ere he addressed his
attentive companion
when i behold he said at length this
rich and varied land with its castles churches
convents stately palaces and fertile fields these
extensive woods and that noble river i know
not my daughter whether most to admire the
bounty god or the ingratitude man he
hath given us the beauty and fertility the
earth and we have made the scene his bounty
a charnelhouse and a battlefield he hath
given us power over the elements and skill to
erect houses for comfort and defence and we
have converted them into dens for robbers and
ruffians
yet surely my father there is room for
comfort replied catharine even in the very
prospect we look upon yonder four goodly
convents with their churches and their towers
which tell the citizens with brazen voice that
they should think on their religious duties 
their inhabitants who have separated themselves
from the world its pursuits and its pleasures
to dedicate themselves to the service 
heaven all bear witness that if scotland bea
bloody and a sinful land she is yet alive and
sensible to the claims which religion demands
 the human race
verily daughter what you say seems truth 
and yet nearly viewed too much the comfort
you describe will be found delusive it is true
there was a period in the christian world when
good men maintaining themselves by the work
 their hands assembled together not that
they might live easily or sleep softly but that
they might strengthen each other in the christian
faith and qualify themselves to be teachers
 the word to the people doubtless there
are still such to be found in the holy edifices on
which we now look but it is to be feared
that the love many has waxed cold our
churchmen have become wealthy as well by
the gifts pious persons as by the bribes
which wicked men have given in their ignorance
imagining that they can purchase that
pardon for endowments to the church which
heaven has only offered to sincere penitents
and thus as the church waxeth rich her doc i
trines have unhappily become dim and obscure
as a light is less seen if placed in a lamp 
chased gold than beheld through a screen 
glass god knows if i see these things and
mark them it is from no wish singularity or
desire to make myself a teacher in israel but
because the fire burns in my bosom and will
not permit me to be silent i obey the rules 
my order and withdraw not myself from its
austerities be they essential to our salvation
or be they mere formalities adopted to supply
the want real penitence and sincere devotion
i have promised nay vowed to observe them 
and they shall be respected by me the more
that otherwise i might be charged with regarding
my bodily ease when heaven is my witness
how lightly i value what i may be called on to
volet d
act or suffer if the purity the church could
be restored or the discipline the priesthood
replaced in its primitive simplicity
but my father said catharine even
for these opinions men term you a lollard and
a wickliffe and say it is your desire to destroy
churches and cloisters and restore the
religion heathenism
even so my daughter am i driven to seek
refuge in hills and rocks and must be presently
contented to take my flight amongst the
rude highlanders who are thus far in a more
gracious state than those i leave behind me
that theirs are crimes ignorance not 
presumption i will not omit to take such
means safety and escape from their cruelty
as heaven may open to me for while such appear
i shall account it a sign that i have still
a service to accomplish but when it is my
master's pleasure he knows how willingly
clement blair will lay down a vilified life upon
earth in humble hope a blessed exchange
hereafter but wherefore dost thou look northward
so anxiously my child thy young eyes
are quicker than mine dost thou see any one
coming 
i look father for the highland youth conachar
who will be thy guide to the hills where
his father can afford thee a safe if a rude retreat
this he has often promised when we
spoke you and your lessons i fear he is
now in company where he will soon forget
them
 the youth hath sparkles grace in him
said father clement although those his
race are usually too much devoted to their own
fierce and savage customs to endure with patience
either the restraints religion or those
 the social law thou hast never told me
daughter how contrary to all the usages either
 the burgh or the mountains this youth
came to reside in thy father's house 
all i know touching that matter said
catharine is that his father is a man consequence
among those hill men and that he desired
as a favour my father who hath had
wwivrsry 

dealings with them in the way his merchandise
to keep this youth for a certain time and
that two days since they parted as he was to
return home to his own mountains
and why has my daughter demanded the
priest maintained such a correspondence with
this highland youth that she should know how
to send for him when she desired to use his
services in my behalf surely this is much
influence for a maiden to possess over such
a wild colt as this youthful mountaineer
catharine blushed and answered with hesitation
 if i have had any influence with concha
heaven be my witness i have only exerted
it to enforce upon his fiery temper compliance
with the rules civil life it is true i have
long expected that you my father would be
obliged to take to flight and i therefore had
agreed with him that he should meet me at this
place as soon as he should receive a message
from me with a token which i yesterday dispatched
the messenger was a lightfooted
boy his own clan whom he used sometimes
to send on errands into the highlands
and am i then to understand daughter
that this youth so fair to the eye was nothing
more dear to you than as you desired to enlighten
his mind and reform his manners 
it is so my father and no otherwise answered
catharine and perhaps i did not do
well to hold intimacy with him even for his
instruction and improvement but my discourse
never led farther
then have i been mistaken my daughter 
for i thought i had seen in thee late some
change purpose and some wishful regards
looking back to this world which you were
at one time resolved to take leave
catharine hung down her head and blushed
more deeply than ever as she said yourself
father were used to remonstrate against
my taking the veil
nor do i now approve it my child said
the priest marriage is an honourable state
appointed by heaven as the regular means 
continuing the race man and i read not in the
scriptures what human inventions have since
affirmed concerning the superior excellence 
a state celibacy but i am jealous thee
my child as a father is his only daughter lest
thou shouldst throw thyself away upon someone
unworthy thee thy parent i know less
nice in thy behalf than i am countenances the
addresses that fierce and riotous reveller
whom they call henry the wynd he is
rich it may be but a haunter idle and debauched
company a common prizefighter
who has shed human blood like water can
such a one be a fit mate for catharine glover
 and yet report says they are soon to be
united
the fair maid perth's complexion changed
from red to pale and from pale to red as she
hastily replied i think not him though
it is true some courtesies have passed betwixt
us late both as he is my father's friend and
as being according to the custom the time
my valentine
your valentine my child said father
clement and can your modesty and prudence
have trifled so much with the delicacy 
your sex as to place yourself in such a relation
to such a man as this artificer think you
that this valentine a godly saint and christian
bishop as he is said to have been ever countenanced
a silly and unseemly custom more likely
to have originated in the heathen worship 
flora or venus when mortals gave the names
 deities to their passions and studied to excite
instead restraining them 
father said catharine in a tone more
displeasure than she had ever before assumed
to the carthusian i know not upon what
ground you tax me thus severely for complying
with a general practice authorized by universal
custom and sanctioned by my father's authority
i cannot feel it kind that you put such
misconstruction upon me
forgive me daughter answered the priest
mildly if i have given you offence but this
henry smith is a forward licentious man to
whom you cannot allow any uncommon degree
 intimacy and encouragement without exposing
yourself to worse misconstruction unless
indeed it be your purpose to wed him and
that very shortly
 say no more it my father said catharine
 you give me more pain than you would
desire to do and i may be provoked to answer
otherwise than as becomes me perhaps i have
already had cause enough to make me repent my
compliance with an idle custom at any rate
believe that henry smith is nothing to me and
that even the idle intercourse arising from st
valentine's day is utterly broken off
 i am rejoiced to hear it my daughter replied
the carthusian and must now prove
you on another subject which renders me most
anxious on your behalf you cannot yourself be
ignorant it although i could wish it were not
necessary to speak a thing so dangerous even
before these surrounding rocks cliffs and
stones but it must be said catharine you
have a lover in the highest rank scotland's
sons honour 
i know it father answered catharine
composedly i would it were not so
so would i also said the priest did i
see in my daughter only the child folly
which most young women are at her age especially
if possessed the fatal gift beauty
but as thy charms to speak the language an
idle world have attached to thee a lover such
high rank so i know that thy virtue and wisdom
will maintain the influence over the prince's
mind which thy beauty hath acquired
father replied catharine the prince is
a licentious gallant whose notice me tends
only to my disgrace and ruin can you who
seemed but now afraid that i acted imprudently
in entering into an ordinary exchange courtesies
with one my own rank speak with patience
 the sort correspondence which the
heir scotland dares to fix upon me know
that it is but two nights since he with a party
 his debauched followers would have carried
me by force from my father's house had i not
been rescued by that same rash spirited henry
smith who if he be too hasty in venturing on
danger on slight occasion is always ready to
venture his life in behalf innocence or in resistance
 oppression it is well my part to do
him that justice
 i should know something that matter
said the monk since it was my voice that sent
him to your assistance i had seen the party as
i passed your door and was hastening to the
civil power in order to raise assistance when i
perceived a man's figure coming slowly towards
me apprehensive it might he one the ambuscade
i stepped behind the buttresses the
chapel st john and seeing from a nearer
view that it was henry smith i guessed
which way he was bound and raised my voice
in an exhortation which made him double his
speed
i am beholden to you father said catharine
 but all this and the duke rothsay's
own language to me only show that the prince
is a profligate young man who will scruple no
extremities which may promise to gratify an idle
passion at whatever expense to its object his
emissary ramorny has even had the insolence
to tell me that my father shall suffer for it if i
dare to prefer being the wife an honest man
to becoming the loose paramour a married
prince so t see no other remedy than to take
the veil or run the risk my own ruin and
my poor father's were there no other reason
the terror these threats from a man so notoriously
capable keeping his word ought as
much to prevent my becoming the bride any
worthy man as it should prohibit me from unlatching
his door to admit murderers oh
good father what a lot is mine and how
fatal am i likely to prove to my affectionate parent
and to any one with whom i might ally
my unhappy fortunes 
be yet good cheer my daughter said
the monk there is comfort for thee even in
this extremity apparent distress ramorny is
a villain and abuses the ear his patron the
prince is unhappily a dissipated and idle youth 
but unless my grey hairs have been strangely
imposed on his character is beginning to alter
he hath been awakened to ramorny's baseness
and deeply regrets having followed his evil
advice i believe nay i am well convinced
that his passion for you has assumed a nobler
and purer character and that the lessons he has
heard from me on the corruptions the church
and the times will if enforced from your
lips sink deeply into his heart and perhaps
produce fruits for the world to wonder as
well as rejoice at old prophecies have said
that rome shall fall by the speech a woman

these are dreams father said catharine
 the visions one whose thoughts are
too much on better things to admit his thinking
justly upon the ordinary affairs earth
when we have looked long at the sun everything
else can only be seen indistinctly
thou art over hasty my daughter said
clement and thou shalt be convinced it
the prospects which i am to open to thee were
unfit to be exposed to one a less firm sense
 virtue or a more ambitious temper perhaps
it is not fit that even to you i should
display them but my confidence is strong in thy
wisdom and thy principles know then that
there is much chance that the church rome
will dissolve the union which she has herself
formed and release the duke rothsay from
his marriage with marjory douglas
here he paused
and if the church hath power and will todo
this replied the maiden what influence
can the divorce the duke from his wife produce
on the fortunes catharine glover 
she looked at the priest anxiously as she
spoke and he had some apparent difficulty in
framing his reply for he looked on the ground
while he answered her
what did beauty do for catharine logic 
unless our fathers told us falsely it raised her
to share the throne david bruce
did she live happy or die regretted good
father asked catharine in the same calm
and steady tone
she formed her alliance from temporal
and perhaps criminal ambition replied father
clement and she found her reward in vanity
and vexation spirit but had she wedded
with the purpose that the believing wife should
convert the unbelieving or confirm the doubting
husband what then had been her reward
love and honour upon earth and an
inheritance in heaven with queen margaret
and those heroines who have been the nursing
mothers the church
hitherto catharine had sat upon a stone beside
the priest's feet and looked up to him as
she spoke or listened but now as if animated
by calm yet settled feelings disapprobation
she rose up and extending her hand towards
the monk as she spoke addressed him with
a countenance and voice which might have become
a cherub pitying and even as much as
possible sparing the feelings the mortal
whose errors he is commissioned to rebuke
and is it even so she said and canso
much the wishes hopes and prejudices 
this vile world affect him who may be called
tomorrow to lay down his life for opposing the
corruptions a wicked age and backsliding
priesthood can it be the severely virtuous
father clement who advises his child to aim
at or even to think the possession a
throne and a bed which cannot become vacant
but by an act crying injustice to the present
possessor can it be the wise reformer the
s
church who wishes to rest a scheme in itself so
unjust upon a foundation so precarious since
when is it good father that the principal
libertine has altered his morals so much to be
likely to court in honourable fashion the daughter
 a perth artizan two days must have
wrought this change for only that space has
passed since he was breaking into my father's
house at midnight with worse mischief in his
mind than that a common robber and think
you that if rothsay's heart could dictate so
mean a match he could achieve such a purpose
without endangering both his succession and
his life assailed by the douglas and march at
the same time for what they must receive as
an act injury and insult to both their houses 
oh father clement where was your principle
where your prudence when they suffered you
to be bewildered by so strange a dream and
placed the meanest your disciples in the
right thus to reproach you 
the old man's eyes filled with tears as catharine
visibly and painfully affected by what
she had said was at length silent

by the mouths babes and sucklings
he said hath he rebuked those who would
seem wise in their generation i thank heaven
that hath taught me better thoughts than
my own vanity suggested through the medium
 so kind a monitress yes catharine i must
not hereafter wonder or exclaim when i see
those whom i have hitherto judged too harshly
struggling for temporal power and holding
all the while the language religious zeal i
thank thee daughter for thy salutary admonition
and i thank heaven that sent it by thy
lips rather than those a sterner reprover
catharine had raised her head to reply and
bid the old man whose humiliation gave her
pain be comforted when her eyes were arrested
by an object close at hand among the crags
and cliffs which surrounded this place seclusion
there were two which stood in such close
contiguity that they seemed to have been portions
 the same rock which rended by lightning
or by an earthquake now exhibited a
chasm about four feet in breadth betwixt

the masses stone into this chasm an oak
tree had thrust itself in one the fantastic
frolics which vegetation often exhibits in such
situations the tree stunted and illfed had
sent its roots along the face the rock in all
directions to seek for supplies and they lay
like military lines communication contorted
twisted and knotted like the immense
snakes the indian archipelago as catharine's
look fell upon the curious complication
 knotty branches and twisted roots she was
suddenly sensible that two large eyes were visible
among them fixed and glaring at her like
those a wild animal in ambush she started
and without speaking pointed out the object
to her companion and looking herself with
more strict attention could at length trace out
the bushy red hair and shaggy beard which
had hitherto been concealed by the drooping
branches and contorted roots the tree
when he saw himself discovered the highlander
for such he proved stepped forth from
his lurkingplace and stalking forward disvol
 e
m
played a colossal person clothed in a purple red
and greenchecked plaid under which he wore
a jacket bull's hide his bow and arrows were
at his back his head was bare and a large quantity
 tangled locks like the gibbs the irish
served to cover the head and supplied all the
purposes a bonnet his belt bore a sword
and dagger and he had in his hand a danish
poleaxe more recently called a lochaber axe
through the same rude portal advanced one
by one four men more similar size and
dressed and armed in the same manner
catharine was too much accustomed to the
appearance the inhabitants the mountains
so near to perth to permit herself to be alarmed
as another lowland maiden might have been
on the same occasion she saw with tolerable
composure these gigantic forms arrange themselves
in a semicircle around and in front the
monk and herself all bending upon them in
silence their large fixed eyes expressing as far
as she could judge a wild admiration her
beauty she inclined her head to them and uttered
imperfectly the usual words a highland
salutation the elder and leader the party
returned the greeting and then again remained
silent and motionless the monk told his beads 
and even catharine began to have strange fears
for her personal safety and anxiety to know whether
they were to consider themselves at personal
freedom she resolved to make the experiment
and moved forward as if to descend the
hill but when she attempted to pass the line 
highlanders they extended their poleaxes betwixt
each other so as effectually to occupy each
opening through which she could have passed
somewhat disconcerted yet not dismayed
for she could not conceive that any evil was intended
she sat down upon one the scattered
fragments rock and bade the monk standing
by her side be good courage
if i fear said father clement it is not
for myself for whether i be brained with the
axes these wild men like an ox when worn
out by labour he is condemned to the slaughter
or whether i am bound with their bowstrings
and delivered over to lliose who will take my
life with more cruel ceremony it can but little
concern me if they suffer thee dearest daughter
to escape uninjured
we have neither us replied the maiden
 perth any cause for apprehending evil 
and here comes conachar to assure us it
yet as she spoke she almost doubted her own
eyes so altered were the manner and attire 
the handsome stately and almost splendidly
dressed youth who springing like a roebuck
from a cliff considerable height lighted justin
front her his dress was the same tartan
worn by those who had first made their appearance
but closed at the throat and elbows with
a necklace and armlets gold the hauberk
which he wore over his person was steel
but so clearly burnished that it shone like silver
his arms were profusely ornamented and
his bonnet besides the eagle's feather marking
the quality chief was ornamented with a
chain gold wrapt several times around it
and secured by a large clasp adorned with
pearls his brooch by which the tartan mantle
or plaid as it is now called was secured on the
shoulder was also gold large and curiously
carved he bore no weapon in his hand excepting
a small sapling stick with a hooked
head his whole appearance and gait which
used formerly to denote a sullen feeling conscious
degradation was now bold forward and
haughty and he stood before catharine with
smiling confidence as if fully conscious his
improved appearance and waiting till she should
recognise him
conachar said catharine desirous to
break this state suspense are these your
father's men 
no fair catharine answered the young
man conachar is no more unless in regard
to the wrongs he has sustained and the vengeance
which they demand i am ian machin
maclan son to the chief the clan quhele
i have mounted my feathers as you see when i
changed my name and for these men they
are not my father's followers but mine you
see only one half them collected they forma
band consisting my foster father and eight
sons who are my bodyguard and the children
 my belt who breathe but to do my will
but conachar he added in a softer tone 
voice lives again so soon as catharine desires
to see him and while he is the young chief 
the clan quhele to all others he is to her as
humble and obedient as when he was simon
glover's apprentice see here is the stick i
had from you when we nutted together in the
sunny braes enoch when autumn was
young in the year that is gone i would not
part with it catharine for the truncheon my
tribe
while euclid thus spoke catharine began
to doubt in her own mind whether she had acted
prudently in requesting the assistance a bold
young man elated doubtless by his sudden
elevation from a state servitude to one which
she was aware gave him extensive authority
over a very lawless body adherents
 you do not fear me fair catharine said
the young chief taking her hand i suffered
my people to appear before me for a few minutes
that i miffht see how you could cnduie their
presence iiud methiiikti you regarded them as
if you were born to be a chieftain's wife
i have no reason to fear wrong from highlanders
said catharine firmly especially as
 thought conachar was with them conachar
has drunk our cup and eaten our bread 
and my father has often had traffic with highlanders
and never was there wrong or quarrel
betwixt him and them
no replied hector for such is the saxon
equivalent for eachin what never when
he took the part the gow chron the 
smith against eachin maclan 
say nothing to excuse it and believe it will
be your own fault if i ever again allude to it
but you had some command to lay upon me 
speak and you shall be obeyed
catharine hastened to reply for there was
something in the young chief's manner and
language which made her desire to shorten
the interview
eachin she said since conachar is no
hunger your name you ought to be sensible
that in claiming as i honestly might a service
from my equal i little thought that was addressing
a person such superior power and
consequence you as well as i have been obliged
to the religious instruction this goodman
he is now in great danger wicked men
have accused him with false charges and he is
desirous to remain in safety and concealment
till the storm shall pass away
aha the good clerk clement ay the
worthy clerk did much for me and more than
my rugged temper was capable to profit by i
will be glad to see any one in the town 
perth persecute one who hath taken hold 
maclan's mantle 
it may not be safe to trust too much to
that said catharine i nothing doubt the
power your tribe but when the black douglas
takes up a feud he is not to be scared by
the shaking a highland plaid
the highlander disguised his displeasure at
this speech with a forced laugh
the sparrow he said that is next the
eye seems larger than the eagle that is perched
on bcngoilc you fear the douglasseses most because
they sit next to you but be it as you
will you will not believe how wide our hills
and vales and forests extend beyond the dusky
barrier yonder mountains and you think
all the world lies on the banks the tay
but this good clerk shall see hills that could
hide him were all the douglasseses on his quest 
ay and he shall see men enough also to make
them glad to get once more southward the
grampian and wherefore should you not
go with the good man i will send a party to
bring him in safety from perth and we will setup
the old trade beyond loch tay only no more
cutting out gloves for me i will find your
father in hides but i will not cut them save
when they are on the createes backs
my father will come one day and see your
housekeeping conachar i mean hector 
but times must be quieter for there is feud between
the town'speople and the followers 
the noblemen and there is speech war about
to break out in the highlands
yes by our lady catharine and were it
not for that same higlihmd war you should
not thus put off your highland visit my pretty
mistress but the race the hills are no
longer to be divided into two nations they
will fight like men for the supremacy and he
who gets it will deal with the king scotland
as an equal not as a superior pray that the
victory may fall to maclan my pious st catharine
for thou shalt pray for one who loves thee
dearly
i will pray for the right said catharine 
 or rather i will pray that there be peace on
all sides farewell kind and excellent father
clement believe i shall never forget thy lessons
 remember me in thy prayers but how
wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome

they shall carry him if need be said
hector if we go far without finding a horse
for him but you catharine it is far from
hence to perth let me attend you thither as
i was wont
if you were as you were wont i would
not refuse your escort but gold brooches
and bracelets are perilous company when the
lauderdale and annandale lancers are riding
as throng upon the highway as the leaves at
hollowness and there is no safe meeting betwixt
highland tartans and steel jackets
she hazarded this remark as she somewhat
suspected that in casting his slough young
eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits
which he had acquired in his humbler state and
that though he might use bold words he would
not be rash enough to brave the odds numbers
to which a descent into the vicinity 
the city would be likely to expose him it appeared
that she judged correctly for after a
farewell in which she compounded for the immunity
 her lips by permitting him to kiss
her hand she returned towards perth and
could obtain at times when she looked back an
occasional glance the highlanders as winding
through the most concealed and impracticable
paths they bent their way towards the
north
she felt in paint relieved from her immediate
anxiety bb the distance increased betwixt her
and these men whose actions were only directed
by the will their chief and whose chief
was a giddy and impetuous boy she apprehended
no insult on her return to perth from
the soldiery any party whom she might meet 
for the rules chivalry were in those days a
surer protection to a maiden decent appearance
than an escort armed men whose cognizance
might not be acknowledged as friendly
by any other party whom they might chance
to encounter but more remote dangers pressed
on her apprehension the pursuit the
licentious prince was rendered formidable by
threats which his unprincipled counsellor ramorn
had not shunned to utter against her
father if she persevered in her coyness these
menaces in such an age and from such a character
were deep grounds for alarm nor could
she consider the pretensions to her favour which
conachar had scarce repressed during his state
 servitude and seemed now to avow boldly
as less fraught with evil since there had been repeated
incursions the highlanders into the
very town perth and citizens had on more
occasions than one been made prisoners and
carried off from their own houses or had fallen
by the claymore in the very streets their city
she feared too her father's importunity on
behalf the smith whose conduct on st
valentine's day unworthy reports had reached
her and whose suit had he stood clear in
her good opinion she dared not listen to while
ramorny's threats revenge upon her father
rung on her ear she thought on these various
dangers with the deepest apprehension and an
earnest desire to escape from them and herself
by taking refuge in the cloister but saw no
possibility obtaining her father's consent to
the only course from which she expected peace
and protection
in the course these reflections we cannot
discover that she very distinctly regretted
that her perils attended her because she was
the fair maid pei'ih this was one point
which marked that she was not yet altogether
an angel and perhaps it was another that
in despite henry smith's real or supposed
delinquencies a sigh escaped from her bosom
when she thought upon st valentine's
dawn
chapter iii
we have shown the secrets the confessional
 those the sick chamber are not hidden
from us in a darkened apartment where
salves and medicines showed that the leech had
been busy in his craft a tall thin form lay on a
bed arrayed in a nightgown belted around him
with pain on his brow and a thousand stormypassions
agitating his bosom everything in
the apartment indicated a man opulence and
 expense henbane d wining the apothecary
who seemed to have the care the patient
stole with a crafty and catlike step from
one corner the room to another busying
himself with mixing medicines and preparing
dressings the sick man groined once or twice
on which the leech advancing to his bedside
asked whether these sounds were a token 
the pain his body or the distress his
mind
 both thou poisoning varlet said sir
john ramorny and being encumbered
with thy accursed company
if that is all i can relieve your knighthood
 one these ills by presently removing
myself elsewhere thanks to the feuds this
boisterous time had i twenty hands instead 
these two poor servants my art displaying
his skinny palms there is enough employment
for them well requited employment too
where thanks and crowns contend which shall
best pay my services while you sir john
wreak upon your chirurgeon the anger you ought
only to bear against the author your wound
 villain it is beneath me to reply to thee
said the patient but every word thy malignant
tongue is a dirk inflicting wounds which
set all the medicines arabia at defiance
sir john i understand you not but if you
give way to these tempestuous fits rage it is
impossible but fever and inflammation must bethe
result
why then dost thou speak in a sense to
chafe my blood why dost thou name the supposition
 thy worthless self having more
hands than nature gave thee while i a knight
and gentleman am mutilated like a cripple 
sir john replied the chirurgeon i am
no divine nor a mainly obstinate believer in
some things which divines tell us yet i may
remind you that you have been kindly dealt
with for if the blow which has done you this
injury had lighted on your neck as it was
aimed it would have swept your head from
your shoulders instead amputating a less considerable
member
i wish it had d wining i wish it had
lighted as it was addressed i should not then
have seen a policy which had spun a web so
fine as mine burst through by the brute force 
a drunken churl i should not have been reserved
to see horses which i must not mount 
lists which i must no longer enter splendours
vol y
which i cannot hope to share or battles which
i must not take part in i should not with a
manes passions for power and for strife be set to
keep place among the women despised by them
too as a miserable impotent cripple unable to
aim at obtaining the favour the sex
supposing all this to be so i will yet pray
 your knighthood to remark replied dining
still busying himself with arranging the
dressings the wounds that your eyes which
you must have lost with your head may being
spared to you present as rich a prospect 
pleasure as either ambition or victory in the
lists or in the field or the love woman itself
could have proposed to you
my sense is too dull to catch thy meaning
koch replied ramorny what is this precious
spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck 
the dearest that mankind knows replied
dwining and then in the accent a lover who
utters the name his beloved mistress and
expresses his passion for her in the very tone 
his voice he added the word revenge 
the patient had raised himself on his couch
to listen with some anxiety for the solution 
the physician's enigma he laid himself down
again as he heard it explained and after a short
pause asked in what christian college learned
you this morality good master d wining 
in no christian college answered his
physician for though it is privately received
in most it is openly and manfully adopted in
none but i have studied among the sages 
granada where the fierysouled moor lifts high
his deadly dagger as it drops with his enemy's
blood and avows the doctrine which the pallid
christian practises though cowardlike he dare
not name it
thou art then a more highsouled villain
than i deemed thee said ramorny
let that pass answered d wining the
waters that are the stillest are also the deepest 
and the foe is most to be dreaded who never
threatens till he strikes you knights and menatarms
go straight to your purpose with sword
in hand we who are clerks win our access
with a noiseless step and an indirect approach
but attain our object not less surely
and i said the knight who have trod
to my revenge with a mailed foot which made
all echo around it must now use such a slipper
as thine ha v
he who lacks strengths said the wily medicine
 must attain his purpose by skill
and tell me sincerely medicine wherefore
thou wouldst read me these devils lessons
why wouldst thou thrust me faster or further
on to my vengeance than i may seem to thee
ready to go my own accord i am old in the
ways the world man and i know that such
as thou do not drop words in vain or thrust
themselves upon the dangerous confidence 
men like me sae with the prospect advancing
some purpose their own what interest
hast thouin the roach whether peaceful or bloody
which i may pursue on these occurrence 
in plain dealing sir knight though it is
 what i seldom use answered the leech my
road to revenge is the same with yours
with mine man said ramorny with a
tone scornful surprise i thought it had
been high beyond thy reach thou aim at the
same revenge with ramorny 
 ay truly replied divining for the
smithy churl under whose blow you have suffered
has often done me despite and injury
he has thwarted me in council and despised
me in action his brutal and unhesitating
bluntness is a living reproach to the subtlety 
my natural disposition i fear him and i hate
him
 and you hope to find an active coadjutor
in me said ramorny in the same supercilious
tone as before but know the artizan fellow
is too low in degree to be to me either
the object hatred or fear yet he shall not
escape we hate not the reptile that has stung
us though we might shake it off the wound
and tread upon it i know the ruffian old asa
stout manatarmsj and a pretender as i have
heard to the favour the scornful puppet
whose beauties forsooth spurred us to our wise
and hopeful attempt fiends that direct this
nether world by what malice have you decided
that the hand which has couched a lance against
the bosom a prince should be struck off like
a saphne by the blow a churl and during
the turmoil a midnight riot well medicine
thus far our courses hold together and i
bid thee well believe that i will crush for thee
this reptile mechanic but do not thou think
to escape me when that part my revenge is
done which will be most easily and speedily accomplished

not it may be altogether so easily accomplished
said the apothecary for if your
knighthood will credit me there will be found
small ease or security in dealing with him he is
the strongest boldest and most skilful swordsman
in perth and all the country around it
fear nothing he shall be met with had he
the strength sampson but then mark me 
hope not thou to escape my vengeance unless
thou become my passive agent in the scene
which is to follow mark me i say once more
i have studied at no moorish college and lack
some thy unbounded appetite for revenge
but yet i will have my share vengeance 
listen to me medicine while i shall thus far
unfold myself but beware treachery for
powerful as ihy fiend is thou hast taken lessons
from a meaner devil than mine hearken
the master whom i have served through vice
and virtue with too much zeal for my own
character perhaps but with unshaken fidelity
to him the very man to soothe whose frantic
folly i have incurred this irreparable loss is
at the prayer his doating father about to
sacrifice me by turning me out his favour
and leaving me at the mercy the hypocritical
relative with whom he seeks a precarious reconciliation
at my expense if he perseveres in
this most ungrateful purpose thy fiercest moors
were their complexion swarthy as the smoke 
hell shall blush to see their revenge outdone 
but i will give him one more chance for honour
and safety before my wrath shall descend on
him in unrelenting and unmitigated fury 
there then thus far thou hast my confidence 
close hands on our bargain close hands did
i say where is the hand that should be the
pledge and representative ramorny's plighted
word is it nailed on the public pillory or
flung as offal to the houseless dogs who arc
even now snarling over it lay thy finger on
s
the mutilated stump then and swear to be a
faithful actor in my revenge as i shall be iii
yours how now sir leech look you pale 
you who say to death stand back or advance
can you tremble to think him or to hear him
named i have not mentioned your fee for one
who loves revenge for itself requires no deeper
bribe yet if broad lands and large sums 
gold can increase thy zeal in a brave cause
believe me these shall not be lacking
they tell for something in my humble
wishes said dwining the poor man in this
bustling world is thrust down like a dwarf in a
crowd and so trodden under foot the rich and
powerful rise like giants above the press and
are at ease while all is turmoil around them
then shalt thou arise above the press medicine
as high as gold can raise thee this
purse is weighty yet it is but an earnest 
thy guerdon
and this smith my noble benefactor 
said tle leech as he pouched the gratuity 
 this henry the wynd or whatever is his
name would not the news that he hath paid
the penalty his action assuage the pain 
thy knighthood's wound better than the barra
 mecca with which i have salved it 
he is beneath the thoughts ramorny 
and i have no more resentment against him
than i have illwill at the senseless weapon which
he swayed but it is just thy hate should be
vented upon him where is he chiefly to be met
with
that also i have considered said dining
 to make the attempt by day in his
own house were too open and dangerous for
he hath five servants who work with him at
the stithy four them strong knaves and all
loving to their master by night were scarce less
desperate for he hath his doors strongly fastened
with bolt oak and bar iron and ere
the fastenings his house could be forced the
neighbourhood would rise to his rescue especially
as they are still alarmed by the practice
on st valentine's even
o ay true medicine said ramorny
for deceit is thy nature even with me thou
knowest my hand and signet as thou saddest
when my hand was found cast out on the street
like the disgusting refuse a shambles wliy
having such knowledge dentist thou with these
jolterheaded citizens to consult that patrick
charteris whose spurs should be hacked off
from his heels for the communion which he
holds with paltry burghers and whom thou
brought st here with the fools to do dishonour
to the lifeless hand which had it held its
wonted place he was not worthy to have touched
in peace or faced in war 
my noble patron as soon as i had reason
to know you had been the sufferer i urged them
with all my powers persuasion to desist from
prosecuting the feud but the swaggering smith
and one or two other hot heads cried out for
vengeance your knighthood must know this
fellow calls himself bachelor to the fair maiden
 perth and stands upon his honour to follow
up her father's quarrel but i have forestalled
his market in that quarter and that is something
in earnest revenge
how mean you by that sir leech said
the patient
your knighthood shall conceive said the
modicinor that this smith doth not live
m
within compass but is an outlier and a galliard
i met him myself on st valentine's
day shortly after the affray between the townsfolk
and the followers douglas yes i met
him sneaking through the lanes and bypassages
with a common minstrel wench with her
messan and her viol on his one arm and her
buxom self hanging upon the other what thinks
your honour is not this a trim squire to cross
a prince's love with the fairest girl in perth
strike off the hand a knight and baron and
become gentlemanusher to a strolling gleewoman
all in the course the same fourandtwenty
hours 
marry i think the better him that he
is so much a gentleman's humour clown
though he be said ramorny i would he
had been a precisian instead a galliard and
i should have had better heart to aid thy revenge
 and such revenge revenge on a smith
in the quarrel a pitiful manufacturer rotten
cheveron and yet it shall be taken in full
thou hast commenced it i warrant me by
thine own manoeuvres
in a small degree only said the apothecary
 i took care that two or three the
most notorious gossips in curfew street who
liked not to hear catharine called the fair
maid perth should be possessed this story
 her faithful valentine they opened on the
scent so keenly that rather than doubt had
fallen on the tale they would have vouched for
it as if their own eyes had seen it the lover
came to her father's within an hour after and
your worship may think what a reception he had
from the angry glover for the damsel herself
would not be looked upon and thus your honour
sees i had a foretaste revenge but i
trust to receive the full draught from the hands
 your lordship with whom i am in a brotherly
league which 
brotherly said the knight contemptuously
 but be it so the priests say we are all
 one common earth i cannot tell there
seems to me some difference but the better
mould shall keep faith with the baser and
thou shalt have thy revenge call thou my
page hither
a young man made his appearance from
the anteroom upon the physician's summons
 eviot said the knight does southron
wait and is he sober
he is as sober as sleep can make him after
a deep drink answered the page
 then fetch him hither and do thou shut
the door
a heavy step presently approached the apartment
and a man entered whose deficiency 
height seemed made up in breadth shoulders
and strength arm
there is a man thou must deal upon bonthrone
said the knight
the man smoothed his rugged features and
grinned a smile satisfaction
that medicine will show thee the party
take such advantage time place and circumstance
as will ensure the result and mind
you come not by the worst for the man is the
fighting smith the wynd
it will be a tough job growled the assassin
 for if i miss my blow i may esteem
myself but a dead man all perth rings with
the smith's skill and strength
take two assistants with thee said the
knight
not i said bonthron if you double
anything let it be the reward
account it doubled said his master but
see thy work be thoroughly executed
trust me for that sir knight seldom
have i failed
use this sage man's directions said the
wounded man pointing to the physician and
hark thee await his coming forth and drink
not till the business be done
i will not answered the dark satellite my
own life depends on my blow being steady and
sure i know whom i have to deal with
vanish then till he summons you and
have axe and dagger in readiness
bonthron nodded and withdrew
 will your knighthood venture to intrust
such an act to a single hand said the medicine
when the assassin had left the room may
i pray you to remember that yonder party did
two nights since baffle six armed men 
question me not sir mcdicincr a manlike
bonthron who knows time and place is
worth a score confused revellers call eviot
thou shalt first exert thy powers healing
and do not doubt that thou shalt in the farther
work be aided by one who will match thee in
the art sudden and unexpected destruction
the page eviot again appeared at the medicine's
summons and at his master's sign assisted
the chirurgeon in removing the dressings
from sir john ramorny's wounded arm
dwining viewed the naked stump with a species
 professional satisfaction enhanced no
doubt by the malignant pleasure which his evil
disposition took in the pain and distress his
fellowcreatures the knight just turned his
eye on the ghastly spectacle and uttered under
the pressure bodily pain or mental agony a
groan which he would fain have repressed
you groan sir said the leech in his soft
insinuating tone voice but with a sneer 
enjoyment mixed with scorn curling upon his
lip which his habitual dissimulation could not
altogether disguise you groan but be comforted
this henry smith knows his business
it
 bis sword is as true to its aim as his hammer
to the anvil had a common swordsman struck
this fatal blow be bad harmed the bone and
damaged the muscles so that even my art might
not have been able to repair them but henry
smith's cut is clean and as sure as that with
which my own scalpel could have made the
amputation in a few days you will be able
with care and attention to the ordinances medicine
to stir abroad
but my hand the loss my hand 
it may be kept secret for a time said
the medicine i have possessed two or three
tattling fools in deep confidence that the baud
which was found was that your knighthood's
groom black quentin and your knighthood
knows that he is parted for fife in such sort
as to make it generally believed
 i know well enough said ramorny that
the rumour may stifle the truth for a short time
but what avails this brief delay 
it may be concealed till your knighthood
retires for a time from the court and then when
new accidents have darkened the recollection
f the pr
iiy we have much that is superfluous about us
man can see with one eye hear with one ear
touch with one hand smell with one nostril 
and why we should have two each unless
to supply an accidental loss or injury i for
one am at a loss to conceive
sir john ramorny turned from the prince
with a low groan
 nay sir john said the duke i am
quite serious you know the truth touching the
legend steelhand carnegie better than i
since he was your own neighbour in his time
that curious engine could only be made in rome 
but i will wager an hundred marks with you
that let the perth armourer have the use it
for a pattern henry the wynd will execute
as complete an imitation as all the smiths in
rome could accomplish with all the cardinals
to bid a blessing on the work
i could venture to accept your wager my
lord answered ramorny bitterly but there
is no time for foolery you have dismissed me
from your service at command your uncle 
at command my father answered the
prince
 
 upon whom your uncle's commands arc
imperative replied ramorny i am a disgraced
man thrown aside as i may now flints
away my right hand glove as a thing useless
yet my head might help you though my hail
he gone is your grace disposed to listen tome
for one word serious import for i am
much exhausted and feel my force sinking under
me
speak your pleasure said the prince 
 thy loss binds me to hear thee thy bloody
stump is a sceptre to control me speak then
but be merciful in thy strength privilege
i will be brief for mine own sake as well
as thine indeed i have but little to say douglas
places himself immediately at the head his
vassals he will assemble in the name king
robert thirty thousand borderers whom he
will shortly after lead into the interior to demand
that the duke roth say receive or either
restore his daughter to the rank and privileges
 his duchess king robert will yield
to any conditions which may secure peace 
what will the duke do
 the duke rothsay loves peace said
the prince haughtily but he never feared
war ere he takes back yonder proud peat to
his table and his bed at the command her
father douglas must be king scotland
 be it so but even this is the less pressing
peril especially as it threatens open violence
for the douglas works not in secret
 what is there which presses and keeps us
awake at this late hour i am a weary man
thou a wounded one and the very tapers are
blinking as if tired our conference
tell me then who is it that rules this
kingdom scotland said ramorny
robert third the name said the prince
raising his bonnet as he spoke and long
may he sway the sceptre 
true and amen answered ramorny 
but who sways king robert and dictates
almost every measure which the good king
pursues
my lord albany you would say replied
the prince yes it is true my father
is guided almost entirely bv tir counsels lii

brother uor can we blame him in our consciences
sir john ramorny for little help hath
he had from his son
let us help him now my lord said ramorn
 i am possessor a dreadful secret
albany hath been trafficking with me to join
him in taking your grace's life he offers full
pardon for the past high favour for the future
how man my life i trust though thou
dost only mean my kingdom it were impious 
he is my father's brother they sat on the knees
 the same father lay in the bosom the
same mother out on thee man what follies
they make thy sickbed believe 
believe indeed said ramorny it is
new to me to be termed credulous but the
man through whom albany communicated his
temptations is one whom all will believe so
soon as he hints at mischief even the medicaments
which are prepared by his hands have a
relish poison
tush such a slave would slander a saint
replied the prince thou art duped for once
ramon shrewd as thou art mv uncle albany
is ambitious aud would secure for himself
and for his house a larger portion power and
wealth than he ought in reason to desire but
to suppose he would dethrone or slay his brother's
son fie ramorny put me not to quote
the old saw that evil doers are evil readers 
it is your suspicion not your knowledge which
speaks
your grace is fatally deluded i will put
it to an issue the duke albany is generally
hated for his greed and covetousness your
highness is it may be more beloved than 
ramorny stopped the prince calmly filled
ap the blank more beloved than i am honoured
it is so i would have it ramorny
at least said ramorny you are more
beloved than you are feared and that is no safe
condition for a prince but give me your honour
and knightly word that you will not resent
what good service i shall do in your behalf
and lend me your signet to engage friends
in your name and the duke albany shall
not assume authority in this court till the
wasted band which ojicc terminated this stump
shall be again united lo the body aud acting in
obedience to the dictates my mind
you would not venture to dip your hands
in royal blood said the prince sternly
fie my lord at no rate blood need not
be shed life may nay will be extinguished 
itself for want trimming it with fresh oil
or screening it from a breath wind the quivering
light will die in the socket to suffer a
man to die is not to kill him
true i had forgot that policy well then
suppose my uncle albany does not continue to
live i think that must be the phrase who
then rules the court scotland 
robert the third with consent advice
and authority the most mighty robert duke
 rothsay lieutenant the kingdom and aller
ego in whose favour indeed the good
king wearied with the fatigues and troubles 
sovereignty will i guess be well disposed to
abdicate so long live our brave young monarch
king robert the fourth 
 ille viaiu fortis
angles ludehit in hostis 
and our father and predecessor said
rothsay will he continue to live to pray for
us as our beadsman by whose favour he holds
the privilege laying his grey hairs in the grave
as soon and no earlier than the course nature
permits or must he also encounter some
 those negligence in consequence which
men cease to continue to live and exchange the
limits a prison or a convent resembling
one for the dark and tranquil cell where the
priests say that the wicked cease from troubling
and the weary are at rest 
you speak in jest my lord replied ramorn
 to harm the good old king were
equally unnatural and impolitic
 why shrink from that man when thy whole
scheme answered the prince in stern displeasure
 is one lesson unnatural guilt mixed
with shortsighted ambition if the king 
scotland can scarcely make head against his
nobles even now when he can hold up before
them an unsullied and honourable banner who
would follow a prince that is blackened with the
death an uncle and the imprisonment a

father why man tby policy were enough to
revolt a heathen divan to say nought the council
 a christian nation thou wert my tutor
ramorny and perhaps i might justly upbraid
thy lessons and example for some the follies
which men chide in me perhaps if it had
not been for thee i had not been standing at
midnight in this fool's guise looking at his
dress to hear an ambitious profligate propose
to me the murder an imcle the dethroning
 the best fathers since it is my fault as
well as thine that has sunk me so deep in the
gulf infamy it were unjust that thou alone
shouldst die for it but dare not to renew this
theme to me on peril thy life i will proclaim
thee to my father to albany to scotland
 throughout its length and breadth as
many market crosses as are in the land shall
have morsels the traitor's carcass who dare
counsel such horrors to the heir scotland 
well hope i indeed that the fever thy wound
and the intoxicating influence the cordials
which act on thy infirm brain have this night operated
on thee rather than any fixed purpose
 suotb my lord said ramon it i
have said anything which could so greatly exasperate
your highness it must have been by
excess zeal mingled with imbecility understanding
surely i all men am least
likely to propose ambitious projects with a prospect
 advantage to myself alas my only
future views must be to exchange lance and
saddle for the breviary and the confessional
the convent minores must receive the maimed
and impoverished knight ramorny who
will there have ample leisure to meditate upon
the text put not thy faith in princes 
it is a goodly purpose said the prince 
and we will not be lacking to promote it
our separation i thought would have been but
for a time it must now be perpetual certainly
after such talk as we have held it were
sleet that we should live asunder but the
convent minores or whatever other house receives
thee shall be richly endowed and highly
favoured by us and now sir john ramorn
sleep sleep and forget this 
conversation in which the fever disease
and wine lias rather i trust held colloquy
than your own proper thoughts light to the
door eviot
a call from eviot summoned the attendants
 the prince who had been sleeping on the
staircase and hall exhausted by the revels 
the evening
js there none amongst you sober said
the duke rothsay disgusted by the appearance
 his attendants
not a man not a man answered the followers
with a drunken shout we are none 
us traitors to the emperor merrymakers
and are all you turned into brutes
then said the prince
 in obedience and imitation your grace
answered one fellow or if we are a little
behind you one pull at the pitcher will 
 peace beast said the duke rothsay
are there none you sober i say 
yes my noble liege was the answer 
here is one false brother watkins the englishman

come liithor then watkins and aid mc

with a torch give me a cloak too and another
bonnet and take away this trumpery throwing
down his coronet feathers i would i
could throw off all my follies as easily english
wat attend me alone and the rest you
 your revelry and doff your mumming habits
the holytide is expended and the fast
has begun
our monarch has abdicated sooner than
usual this night said one the revel rout 
but as the prince gave no encouragement such
as happened for the time to want the virtue 
sobriety endeavoured to assume it as well as
they could and the whole the late rioters began
to adopt the appearance a set decent
persons who having been surprised into intoxication
endeavour to disguise their condition
by assuming a double portion formality 
behaviour in the interim the prince having
made a hasty reform in his dress was lighted
to the door by the only sober man the company
but in his progress thither had wellnigh
stumbled over the sleeping bulk the brute
bonthrou
 how now is that vile beast in our way
once more he said in anger and disgust
here some you toss this caitiff into the
horsetrough that for once in his life he maybe
washed clean
while the train executed his commands availing
themselves a fountain which was in the
outer court and while bonthron underwent a
discipline which he was incapable resisting
otherwise than by some inarticulate groans and
snorts like those a dying boar the prince
proceeded on his way to his apartments in a
mansion called the constable's lodgings from
the house being the property the earls errol
on the way to divert his thoughts from
more un pleasing matters the prince asked his
companion how he came to be sober when the
rest the party had been so much overcome
with liquor
so please your honour's grace replied
english wat i confess it was very familiar in
me to be sober when it was your grace's pleasure
that your train should be mad drunk butin
respect they were all scotchmen but myself
i thought it argued no policy iu getting
drunken in their company seeing that they
only endure me even when we are all sober
and if the wine were uppermost i might tell
them a piece my mind and be paid with as
many stabs as there are scenes in the good company

so it is your purpose never to join any 
the revels our household 
under favour yes unless it be your grace's
pleasure that the residue your train should
remain one day sober to admit will watkins
to get drunk without terror his life
such occasion may arrives where dost
thou serve watkins 
in the stable so please you
let our chamberlain bring thee into the
household as a yeoman the nightwatch i
like thy favour and it is something to have one
sober fellow in the house although he is only
such through the fear death attend therefore
near our person and thou shalt find sobriety
a thriving virtue
meantime a load care and fear added to
the distress sir john ramornys sickchamber
his reflections disordered as they were
by the opiate fell into great confusion when
the prince in whose presence he had suppressed
its effect by strong resistance had left the
apartment his consciousness which he had
possessed perfectly during the interview began
to be very much disturbed he felt a general
sense that he had incurred a great danger
that he had rendered the prince his enemy
and that he had betrayed to him a secret which
might affect his own life in this state mind
and body it was not strange that he should
either dream or else that his diseased organs
should become subject to that species phantasmagoria
which is excited by the use opium
he thought that the shade queen arabella
stood by his bedside and demanded the
youth whoih she had placed under his charge
simple virtuous gay and innocent
thou hast rendered him reckless dissolute
and vicious said the shade pallid majesty
yet i thank thee john ramorny ungrateful
to me false to thy word and treacherous to
u
my hopes thy hate shall counteract the evil
which thy friendship has done to him and
well do i hope that now thou art no longer his
counsellor a bitter penance on earth may purchase
my illfated child pardon and acceptance
in a better world
ramorny stretched out his arms after his benefactress
and endeavoured to express contrition
and excuse but the countenance the
apparition became darker and sterner till it was
no longer that the late queen but presented
the gloomy and haughty countenance the
black douglas then the timid and sorrowful
face king robert who seemed to mourn over
the approaching dissolution his royal house 
and then a group fantastic features partly
hideous partly ludicrous which moped and
chattered and twisted themselves into unnatural
and extravagant forms as if ridiculing his
endeavour to obtain an exact idea their lineaments

chapter vl
the morning ash wednesday arose pale
and bleak as usual at this season in scotland
where the worst and most inclement weather
often occurs in the early spring months it
was a severe day frost and the citizens hai
to sleep away the consequences the preceding
holiday's debauchery the sun had therefore
risen for an hour above the horizon before there
was any general appearance life among the
inhabitants perth so that it was some time
after daybreak when an early citizen going to
mass saw the body the luckless oliver proudfate
lying on his face across the kennel in the
manner in which he had fallen under the blow
as our readers will easily imagine antony
vol ir m
bonthron the boy the belt that is the executioner
 the pleasure john ramorny
this early citizen was allan griffin so termed
because he was master the griffin inn 
and the alarm which he raised soon brought together
first straggling neighbours and by and
by a concourse citizens at first from the
circumstance the wellknown buffcoat and
the crimson feather in the headpiece the noise
arose that it was the stout smith that lay there
slain this false rumour continued for sometime
 for the host the griffin who himself
had been a magistrate would not permit the
body to be touched or stirred till bailie craigdallied
arrived so that the face was not seen
 this concerns the fair city my friends
he said and if it is the stout smith the
wynd who lies here the man lives not in perth
who will not risk land and life to avenge him
look you the villains have struck him down
behind his back for there is not a man within
ten scotch miles perth gentle or semple
highland or lowland that would have met him
face to face with such evil purpose oh brave
men perth the flower your manhood has
been cut down and that by a base and treacherous
hand 
a wild cry fury arose from the people who
were fast assembling
we will take him on our shoulders said
a strong butcher we will carry him to the
king's presence at the dominican convent
 ay ay answered a blacksmith neither
bolt nor bar shall keep us from the king neither
monk nor mass shall break our purpose a better
armourer never laid hammer on anvil 
 to the dominicans to the dominicans 
shouted the assembled people
bethink you burghers said another citizen
 our king is a good king and loves us
like his children it is the douglas and the duke
 albany that will not let good king robert
hear the distresses his people
are we to be slain in our own streets for
the king's softness heart said the butcher
the bruce did otherwise if the king will
not keep us we will keep ourselves ring the
bells backward every bell them that is
made metal cry and spare not st johnston's
hunt is up 
ay cried another citizen and let us to
the holds albany and the douglas and burn
them to the ground let the fires tell far and
near that perth knew how to avenge her stout
henry gow he has fought a score times
for the fair city's right let us show we can
fight once to avenge his wrong hallo ho 
brave citizens st johnstoun's hunt is up 
this cry the wellknown rallying word
amongst the inhabitants perth and seldom
heard but on occasions general uproar was
echoed from voice to voice and one or two
neighbouring steeples which the enraged citizens
possessed themselves either by consent 
the priests or in spite their opposition began
to ring out the ominous alarm notes in which
as the ordinary succession the chimes were
reversed the bells were said to be rung backward

still as the crowd thickened and the roar
waxed more universal and louder allan griftmi
a burly man with a deep voice and well respected
among high and low kept this station
as he bestrode the corpse and called loudly to
the multitude to keep back and wait the arrival
 the magistrates
we must proceed by order in this matter
my masters we must have our magistrates atour
head they are duly chosen and elected
in our townhall good men and true every one 
we will not be called rioters or idle perturbations
 the king's peace stand you still and
make room for yonder comes bailie craigdal
lie ay and honest simon glover to whom the
fair city is so much bounden alas alas my
kind townsmen his beautiful daughter was a
bride yesternight this morning the fair maid
 perth is a widow before she has been a
wife
this new theme sympathy increased the
rage and sorrow the crowd the more as many
women now mingled with them who echoed
back the alarm cry to the men
ay ay st johnstoun's hunt is up for
the fair maid perth and the brave henry
gow up up every one you spare not for
your skincutting to the stables to the stables
 when the horse is gone the manatarms
is useless cut off the grooms and yeomen
lame maim and stab the horses kill the base
squires and pages let these proud knights
meet us on their feet if they dare 
they dare not they dare not answered
the men their strength is in their horses and
armour and yet the haughty and ungrateful
villains have slain a man whose skill as an armourer
was never matched in indian or venice
to arms to arms brave burghers st johnston's
hunt is up 
amid this clamour the magistrates and superior
class inhabitants with difficulty obtained
room to examine the body having with
them the townclerk to take an official protocol
or as it is still called a precognition the
condition in which it was found to these delays
the multitude submitted with a patience
and order which strongly marked the national
character a people whose resentment has always
been the more deeply dangerous that they
will without relaxing their determination 
vengeance submit with patience to all delays
which are necessary to ensure its attainment
the multitude therefore received their magistrates
with a loud cry in which the thirst 
revenge was announced together with the deferential
welcome to the patrons by whose direction
they expected to obtain it in right and
legal fashion
while these accents welcome still rung
above the crowd who now filled the whole adjacent
streets receiving and circulating a thousand
varying reports the fathers the city
caused the body to be raised and more closely
examined when it was instantly perceived and
the truth publicly announced that not the armourer
 the wynd so highly and according
to the esteemed qualities the time so justly
popular among his fellow citizens but a man
 far less general estimation though not without
his own value in society lay murdered before
them the brisk bonnetmaker oliver
proudfute the resentment the people had
so much turned upon the general opinion that
their frank and brave champion henry gow
was the slaughtered person that the contradiction
 the report served to cool the general
fury although if poor oliver had been recognised
at first there is little doubt that the cry
 vengeance would have been as unanimous as
in the case henry wynd the first circulation
 the unexpected intelligence even excited
a smile among the crowd so near are the
confines the ludicrous to those the terrible
the murderers have without doubt taken
him for henry smith said griffin which
must have been a great comfort to him in the
circumstances
but the arrival other persons on the scene
soon restored its deeply tragic character
j
chapter v ir
who that light rings the b diablo ho 
the town will rise
othello
the wild rumours which flew through the
town speedily followed by the tolling the
alarm bells spread general consternation the
nobles and knights with their followers gathered
in different places rendezvous where a
defence could best be maintained and the alarm
reached the royal residence where the young
prince was one the first to appear to assist
if necessary in the defence the old king
the scene the preceding night ran in his recollection
 and remembering the bloodstained
figure bonthron he conceived though indistinctly
that his act had been connected with
this uproar the subsequent and more interesting
discourse with sir john ramorny had
however been such an impressive nature as
to obliterate all traces what he had indistinctly
heard the bloody act the assassin
excepting a confused recollection that some one
or other had been slain it was chiefly on his
father's account that he had assumed arms with
his household train who clad in bright armour
and bearing lances in their hands made now
a figure very different from that the preceding
night when they appeared as intoxicated
bacchanalian the kind old monarch received
this mark filial attachment with tears gratitude
and proudly presented his son to his
brother albany who entered shortly after wards
he took them each by the hand
now are we three robin stewart he said
as inseparable as the holy trefoil and as
they say the wearer that sacred herb mocks
at magical delusion so we while we are true
to each other may set malice and enmity at defiance

the brother and son kissed the kind hand
which pressed theirs while robert iii expressed
his confidence in their affection the kiss 
the youth was for the time sincere that the
brother was the salute the apostate judas
in the meantime the bell saint john's
church alarmed amongst others the inhabitants
 curfew street in the house simon glover
old dorothy glover as she was called for she
also took name from the trade she practised
under her master's auspices was the first to
catch the sound though somewhat deaf upon
ordinary occasions her ear for bad news was as
sharp as a kite's scent for carrion for dorothy
otherwise an industrious faithful and even
affectionate creature had that strong appetite
for collecting and retailing sinister intelligence
which is often to be marked in the lower
classes little accustomed to be listened to
they love the attention which a tragic tale ensures
to the bearer and enjoy perhaps the temporary
equality to which misfortune reduces
those who are ordinarily accounted their superiors
dorothy had no sooner possessed hcrsel f
 a slight packet the rumours which were
flying abroad than she bounced into her mas
tcrs bedroom who had taken the privilege 
age and the holytide to sleep longer than usual
there he lies honest man said dorothy
half in a screeching and half in a wailing tone
 sympathy there he lies his best friend
slain and he knowing as little about it as the
babe new born that kens not life from death
how now said the glover starting up
out his bed what is the matter old woman
 is my daughter well 
old woman said dorothy who hadng
her fish hooked chose to let him play a little
i am not so old said she flouncing out 
the room as to bide in the place till a man
rises from his naked bed 
and presently she was heard at a distance in
the parlour beneath melodiously singing to the
scrubbing her own broom
 dorothy screechowl devil say but
my daughter is well 
e period already noticed
unrestrained by the considerations doubt
and hesitation which influenced others he repaired
to the parlour and having overheard
the bustling dame shoolbred he took the
privilege intimacy to ascend to the bedroom
and with the slight apology i crave your
pardon good neighbour he opened the door
and entered the apartment where a singular and
unexpected sight awaited him at the sound
 his voice may catharine experienced a revival
much speedier than dame shoolbred's restoratives
had been able to produce and the
paleness her complexion changed into a deep
glow the most lovely red she pushed her
lover from her with both her hands which
until this minute her want consciousness
or her affection awakened by the events the
morning had well nigh abandoned to his caresses
henry smith bashful as we know him
stumbled as he rose up and none the party
were without a share confusion excepting
dame shoolbred who was glad to make some
pretext to turn her back to the others in order
that she might enjoy a laugh at their expense
vol o 
which she felt herself utterly unable to restrain
and in which the glover whose surprise though
great was short duration and a joyful character
sincerely joined
now by good st john he said i thought
i had seen a sight this morning that would cure
me laughter at least till lent was over but
this would make me curl my cheek if i were
dying why here stands honest henry smith
who was lamented as dead and toll'd out for
from every steeple in town alive merry and
as it seems from his ruddy complexion as like
to live as any man in perth and here is my
precious daughter that yesterday would speak
 nothing but the wickedness the wights that
haunt profane sports and protect gleemaidens
ay she who set st valentine and st cupid
both at defiance here she is turned a gleemaiden
herself for what i can see truly i am
glad to see that you my good dame shoolbred
who give way to no disorder have been this
loving party
you do me wrong my dearest father said
catharine as if about to weep i came herewith
far different expectations than you suppose
i only came because because 
because you expected to find a dead lover
said her father and you have found a living
one who can receive the tokens your regard
and return them now were it not a sin i
could find in my heart to thank heaven that
thou hast been surprised at last into owning
thyself a woman simon glover is not worthy
to have an absolute saint for his daughter
nay look not so piteously nor expect condolence
from me only i will try not to look
merry if you will be pleased to stop your tears
or confess them to be tears joy
if i were to die for such a confession said
poor catharine i could not tell what to call
them only believe dear father and let henry
believe that i would never have come hither
unless unless 
unless you had thought that henry coukl
not come to you said her father and now
shake hands in peace and concord and agree as
valentines should yesterday was shrovetide
henry we will hold that thou hast confessed
thy follies hast obtained absolution and art
relieved all the guilt thou stoutest charged
with
nay touching that father simon said the
smith now that you are cool enough to hear
me i can swear on the gospels and i can call
my nurse dame shoolbred to witness 
nay nay said the glover but wherefore
rake up differences which should all be
forgotten 
hark ye simon simon glover this
was now echoed from beneath
true son smith said the glover seriously
 we have other work in hand you and
i must to the council instantly catharine
shall remain here with dame shoolbred who
will take charge her till we return and then
as the town is in misrule we two harry will
carry her home and they will be bold men that
cross us
 nay my dear father said catharine with
a smile now you are taking oliver proudfate's
office that doughty burgher is henry's
broth eratarms
her father's countenance grew dark
you have spoke a stinging word daughter 
but you know not what has happened kiss
him catharine in token forgiveness
not so said catharine i have done
him too much grace already when he has seen
the errant damsel safe home it will be time
enough to claim his reward
meantime said henry i will claim as
your host what you will not allow me on other
terms
he folded the fair maiden in his arms and
was permitted to take the salute which she had
refused to bestow
as they descended the stair together the old
man laid his hand on the smith's shoulder and
said henry my dearest wishes are fulfilled 
but it is the pleasure the saints that it should
be in an hour difficulty and terror
true said the smith but thou knowest
father if our riots be frequent at perth at
least they seldom last long
then opening a door which led from the
house into the smithy here comrade he
cried anton cuthbert dingwell and ringan
 let none you stir from the place till i
return be as true as the weapons i have taught
you to forge a french crown and a scottish
merrymaking for you if you obey my command
i leave a mighty treasure in your charge
watch the doors well let little jannekin scout
up and down the wynd and have your arms
ready if any one approaches the house open
the doors to no man till father glover or return
 it concerns my life and happiness
the strong swarthy giants to whom he spoke
answered death to him who attempts it 
my catharine is now as safe said he to
her father as if twenty men garrisoned a royal
castle in her cause we shall pass most quietly
to the councilhouse by walking through the
garden
he led the way through a little orchard accordingly
where the birds which had been sheltered
and fed during the winter by the goodnatured
artizan early in the season as it was
wire saluting the precarious smiles a february
sun with a few faint and interrupted attempts
at melody
hear these minstrels father said the
smith i laughed at them this morning in
the bitterness my heart because the little
wretches sung with so much winter before
them but now methinks i could bear a blithe
chorus for i have my valentine as they have
theirs and whatever ill may lie before me for
tomorrow i am today the happiest man in
perth city or county burgh or landward
yet i must allay your joy said the old
glover though heaven knows i share it 
poor oliver proudfute the inoffensive fool
that you and i knew so well has been found this
morning dead in the streets
only dead drunk i trust said the smith 
 nay a caudle and a dose matrimonial advice
will bring him to life again
no henry no he is slain slain with a
battleaxe or some such weapon
impossible replied the smith he was
lightfooted enough and would not for all
i
perth have trusted to his hands when he could
extricate himself by his heels
no choice was allowed him the blow was
dealt in the very back his head he who
struck must have been a shorter man than himself
and used a horseman's battleaxe or some
such weapon for a lochaberaxe must have
struck the upper part his head but there
he lies dead brained i may say by a most frightful
wound
this is inconceivable said henry wynd
he was in my house at midnight in a morriver's
habit seemed to have been drinking
though not to excess he told me a tale having
been beset by revellers and being in danger
 but alas you know the man i deemed
it was a swaggering fit as he sometimes took
when he was in liquor and may the merciful
virgin forgive me i let him go without company
in which i did him inhuman wrong holy
st john be my witness i would have gone with
any helpless creature and far more with him
with whom i have so often sat at the same board
and drunken the same cup who the race
 man could have thought harming a creature
 simple and so unoffending excepting by
his idle vaunts 
 henry he wore thy headpiece thy buffcoat
thy target how came he by these 
why he demanded the use them for the
night and i was ill at ease and well pleased
to be rid his company having kept no holiday
and being determined to keep none in respect
 our misunderstanding
it is the opinion bailie craigdallie and
all our sagest councillors that the blow was
intended for yourself and that it becomes you
to prosecute the due vengeance our fellowcitizen
who received the death which was meant
for you
the smith was for some time silent they
had now left the garden and were walking in a
lonely lane by which they meant to approach
the councilhouse the burgh without being
exposed to observation or idle inquiry
you are silent my son yet we two have
much to speak said simon glover bethink
thee that this widowed woman maudlin
if she should see cause to bring a charge against
any one for the wrong done to her and her orphan
children must support it by a champion
according to law and custom for be the murderer
who he may we know enough these
followers the nobles to be assured that the
party suspected will appeal to the combat in
derision perhaps those whom they will call
the cowardly burghers while we are men with
blood in our veins this must not be henry
wynd
i see where you would draw me father
answered henry dejectedly and st john
knows i have heard a summons to battle as
willingly as warhorse ever heard the trumpet
but bethink you father how i have lost
catharine's favour repeatedly and have been
driven well nigh to despair ever regaining
it for being if i may say so even too ready a
man my hands and here are all our quarrels
made up and the hopes that seemed this
morning removed beyond earthly prospect have
become nearer and brighter than ever and
must i with the dear one's kiss forgiveness
on my lips engage in a new scene violence
which you are well aware will give her the
deepest offence 
it is hard for me to advise you henry
said simon but this i must ask you have
you or have you not reason to think that this
poor unfortunate oliver has been mistaken for
you
i fear it too much said henry he was
thought something like me and the poor fool
had studied to ape my gestures and manner 
walking nay the very airs which i have the
trick whistling that he might increase a resemblance
which has cost him dear i have illwillers
enough both in burgh and landward to
owe me a shrewd turn and he i think could
have none such
 well henry i cannot say but my daughter
will be offended she has been much with
father clement and has received notions about
peace and forgiveness which methinks suit ill
with a country where the laws cannot protect
us unless we have spirit to protect ourselves
if you determine for the combat i will do my
best to persuade her to look ou the matter as
the other good womanhood in the burgh will
do and if you resolve to let the matter rest 
the man who has lost his life for yours remaining
unavenged the widow and the orphans
without any reparation for the loss a husband
and father i will then do you the justice to
remember that i at least ought not to think
the worse you for your patience since it was
adopted for love my child but henry we
must in that case remove ourselves from bonny
st johnstoun for here we will be but a disgraced
family
henry groaned deeply and was silent for an
instant then replied i would rather be dead
than dishonoured though i should never see her
again had it been yester evening i would
have met the best blade among these menatarms
as blithely as ever i danced at a maypole
but today when she had first as good as said
henry smith i love thee father glover
it is very hard yet it is all my own fault 
i ought to have allowed him the shelter my
roof lion lie prayed me in his agony fear 
or had i gone with lii i should then have
prevented or shared his fate but i taunted
him ridiculed him loaded him with maledictions
though the saints know they were uttered
in idle peevishness impatience i drove
him out from my doors whom i knew so helpless
to take the fate which was perhaps intended
for me i must avenge him or be dishonoured
for ever see father i have been
called a man hard as the steel i work in does
burnished steel ever drop tears like these 
shame on me that i should shed them 
it is no shame my dearest son said simon 
thou art as kind as brave and i have always
known it there is yet a chance for us no
one may be discovered to whom suspicion attaches
and where none such is found the combat
cannot take place it is a hard thing to
wish that the innocent blood may not be avenged
but if the perpetrator this foul murder
be hidden for the present thou wilt be saved
from the task seeking that vengeance which
heaven doubtless will take at its own proper
time
as they spoke thus they arrived at the point
 the high street where the councilhouse was
situated as they reached the door and made
their way through the multitude who still
thronged the street they found the avenues
guarded by a select party armed burghers
and about fifty spears belonging to the knight
 kinfauns who with his allies the grays
blairs moncrieffs and others had brought to
perth a considerable body horse which
these were a part so soon as the glover and
smith presented themselves they were admitted
to the chamber in which the magistrates
were assembled

chapter viii
the councilroom perth presented a singular
spectacle in a gloomy apartment ill
and inconveniently lighted by two windows
 different form and unequal size were assembled
around a large oaken table a group 
men whom those who occupied the higher
seats were merchants that is guild brethren
or shopkeepers arrayed in decent dresses becoming
their station but most them bearing
like the regent york signs war around
their aged necks gorgets namely and baltricks
which sustained their weapons the
lower places around the table were occupied
by mechanics and artisans the presidents or
deacons as they were termed the working
classes in their ordinary clothes somewhat better
arranged than usual these too wore pieces
 armour various descriptions some had
the black jack or doublet covered with small
plates iron a lozenge shape which secured
through the upper angle hung in rows
above each and which swaying with the motion
 the wearer's person formed a secure defence
to the body others had buffcoats which
as already mentioned could resist the blow 
a sword and even a lance's point unless propelled
with great force at the bottom the
table surrounded as it was with this varied assembly
sat sir louis lundin no military man
but a priest and parson st john's arrayed in
his canonical dress and having his pen and ink
before him he was townclerk the burgh and
like all the priests the period who were called
from that circumstance the pope's knights
received the honourable title dominus contracted
into dom or dan or translated into
sir the title reverence due to the secular
chivalry
on an elevated seat at the head the council
board was placed sir patrick charteris incomplete
armour brightly burnished a singular
contrast to the motley mixture warlike
and peaceful attire exhibited by the burghers
who were only called to arms occasionally
the bearing the provost while it completely
admitted the intimate connexion which mutual
interests had created betwixt himself the burgh
and the magistracy was at the same time calculated
to assert the superiority which in virtue
 gentle blood and chivalrous rank the
opinions the age assigned to him over the
members the assembly in which he presided
two squires stood behind him one them
holding the knight's pennon and another his
shield bearing his armorial distinctions being
a hand holding a dagger or short sword with
the proud motto this is my charter a handsome
page displayed the long sword his master
and another bore his lance all which chivalrous
emblems and appurtenances were the
more scrupulously exhibited that the dignitary
vol p
to whom they belonged was engaged in discharging
the office a burgh magistrate in his own
person the knight kinfauns appeared to affect
something state and stiffness which did
not naturally pertain to his frank and jovial
character
 so you are come at length henry smith
and simon glover said the provost know
that you have kept us waiting for your attendance
should it so chance again while we occupy
this place we will lay such a fine on you
as you will have small pleasure in paying
enough make no excuses they are not asked
now and another time they will not be admitted
know sirs that our reverend clerk hath
taken down in writing and at full length what
i will tell you in brief that you may see what
is to be required you henry smith in particular
our late fellowcitizen oliver proudfate
hath been found dead in the high street
close by the entrance into the wynd it seemeth
he was slain by a heavy blow with a short axe
dealt from behind and at unawares and the act
bv which he fell can only be termed a deed 
foul and forethoiiglit murder so much for the
crime the criminal can only be indicated hy
circumstances it is recorded in the protocol 
the reverend sir louis lundin that divers
wellreputed witnesses saw our deceased citizen
oliver proudfute till a late period accompanying
the entry the morrisdancers whom
he was one as far as the house simon glover
in curfew street where they again played
their pageant it is also manifested that at
this place he separated from the rest the
band after some discourse with simon glover
and made an appointment to meet with the
others his company at the sign the griffin
there to conclude the holiday now simon
i demand you whether this be truly stated
so far as you know and further what was the
purport the defunct oliver proudfute's discourse
with you 
 my lord provost and very worshipful sir
patrick answered simon glover you and
this honourable council shall know that touching
certain reports which had been made ie
conduct henry smith some quarrel lead

arisen between myself and another my family
and the said smith here present now
this our poor fellowcitizen oliver proudfute
having been active in spreading these reports
as indeed his element lay in such gossipred
some words passed betwixt him and me on the
subject and as i think he left me with the
purpose visiting henry smith for he broke
off from the morrisdancers promising as it
seems to meet them as your honour has said
at the sign the griffin in order to conclude
the evening but what he actually did i know
not as i never again saw him in life
it is enough said sir patrick and agrees
with all that we have heard now worthy sirs
we next find our poor fellowcitizen environed
by a set revellers and maskers who had assembled
in the high street by whom he was
shamefully ill treated being compelled to kneel
down in the street and there to quaff huge
quantities liquor against his inclination until
at length he escaped from them by flight this
violence was accomplished with drawn swords
loud shouts and imprecations so as to attract the
attention several persons who alarmed by
the tumult looked out from their windows as
well as one or two passengers who keeping
aloof from the light the torches lest they also
had been maltreated beheld the usage which
our fellowcitizen received in the high street 
the burgh and although these revellers were
disguised and used zads yet their disguises
were well known being a set quaint masking
habits prepared some weeks ago by command
 sir john ramorny master the
horse to his royal highness the duke rothsay
prince royal scotland
a low groan went through the assembly
yes so it is brave burghers continued sir
patrick our inquiries have led us into conclusions
both melancholy and terrible but as
no one can regret the point at which they seem
likely to arrive more than i do so no mau living
can dread its consequences less it is even so
various artisans employed upon the articles
have described the dresses prepared for sir john
jlamornv's mask as beinjr exactly similar to
those oi the men by whom oliver proudtutc was
observed to be maltreated and one mechanic
being whitfield the featherdresser who saw
the revellers when they had our fellowcitizen
within their hands remarked that they wore
the cincture and coronals painted feathers
which he himself had made by the order the
prince's master the horse
after the moment his escape from these
revellers we lose all trace oliver but we
can prove that the maskers went to sir john
ramorny's where they were admitted after
some show delay it is rumoured that thou
henry smith safest our unhappy fellowcitizen
after he had been in the hands these revellers
 what is the truth that matter 
he came to my house in she wynd said
henry about half an hour before midnight 
and i admitted him something unwillingly ashe
had been keeping carnival while i remained
at home and there is ill talk says the proverb
betwixt a full man and a fasting
 and in which plight seemed he when thou
didst admit him said the provost
he seemed answered the smith out 
breath and talked repeatedly having been endangered
by revellers i paid but small regard
for he was ever a timorous chickenspirited
though wellmeaning man and i held that m
was speaking more from fancy than reality but
i shall always account it for foul offence in myself
that i did not give him my company which
he requested and if i live i will found masses
for his soul in expiation my guilt
did he describe those from whom he received
the injury said the provost
revellers in masking habits replied henry
 and did he intimate his fear having todo
with them on his return again demanded
sir patrick
he alluded particularly to his being waylaid
which i treated as visionary having been
able to see no one in the lane
had he then no help from thee any kind
whatsoever said the provost
yes worshipful replied the smith he
exchanged his morris dress for my headpiece
buffcoat and target which i hear were found
iipou his body and have at home his morricc
cap and bells with the jerkin and other things
pertaining he was to return my garb fence
and get back his own masking suit this day had
the saints so permitted
 you saw him not then afterwards 
 never my lord
one word more said the provost have
you any reason to think that the blow which
slew oliver proudfute was meant for another
man 
i have answered the smith but it is
doubtful and may be dangerous to add such a
conjecture which is besides only a supposition
speak it out on your burgher faith and oath
for whom think you was the blow meant 
 if i must speak replied henry i believe
oliver proudfute received the fate which was
designed for myself the rather that in his folly
oliver spoke trying to assume my manner 
walking as well as my dress
 have you feud with any one that you form
such an idea said sir patrick charters
 to my shame and sin be it spoken ha c
loud whli iligliland and lowland english and
scot perth and angus i do not believe poor
oliver had feud with a newhatched chicken 
alas he was the more fully prepared for a sudden
call 
 hark ye smith said the provost answer
me distinctly is there cause feud between
the household sir john ramorny and
yourself
to a certainty my lord there is it is now
generally said that black quentin who went
over tay to fife some days since was the owner
 the hand which was found in couvrefew
street upon the eve st valentine it was i
who struck off that hand with a blow my
broadsword as this black quentin was a
chamberlain sir john and much trusted it
is like there must be feud between me and his
master's dependents
it bears a likely front smith said sir patrick
charteris and now good brothers and
wise magistrates there are two suppositions
each which leads to the same conclusion the
makerswho seized our fellow citizen and misused
liii in a manner which his body retains
some slight marks may have met with their
former prisoner as he returned homewards and
finished their ill usage by taking his life he
himself expressed to henry gow fears that this
would be the case if this be really true one
or more sir john ramorny's attendants
must have been the assassins but i think it
more likely that one or two the revellers may
have remained on the field or returned to it
having changed perhaps their disguise and that
to those men for oliver proudfute in his own
personal appearance would only have been a
subject sport his apparition in the dress and
assuming as he proposed to do the manner
 henry smith was matter deep hatred
and that seeing him alone they had taken as
they thought a certain and safe mode to rid
themselves an enemy so dangerous as all men
know henry wynd is accounted by those that
are his friends the same train reasoning
again rests the guilt with the household sir
john ramorny how think you siis are
we not free to charge the crime upon them 
the magistrates whispered together for several
minutes and then replied by the voice 
bailie craigdallie noble knight and our
worthy provost we agree entirely in what
your wisdom has spoken concerning this dark
and bloody matter nor do we doubt your sagacity
in tracing to the fellowship and the company
 john ramorny that ilk the villainy
which hath been done to our deceased fellowcitizen
whether in his own character and capacity
or as mistaking him for our brave townsman
henry the wynd but sir john in his
own behalf and as the prince's master the
horse maintains an extensive household and
as course the charge will be rebutted by a denial
we would ask how we shall proceed in that
case it is true could we find law for firing
the lodging and putting all within it to the
sword the old proverb short rede good
rede might here apply for a fouler household
 defiers god destroyers men and debauchery
 women are nowhere sheltered than
are in ramorny's band but i doubt that this
summary mode execution would scarce be
burne out by the laws and no tittle evidence
which i have heard will tend to fix the crime
on any single individual or individuals
before the provost could reply the townclerk
arose and stroking his venerable beard
craved permission to speak which was instantly
granted brethren he said as well in
our fathers time as ours hath god on being
rightly appealed to condescended to make manifest
the crimes the guilty and the innocence
 those who may have been rashly accused
let us demand from our sovereign lord king
robert who when the wicked do not interfere
to pervert his good intentions is as just and
clement a prince as our annals can show in
their long line in the name the fair city and
 all the commons in scotland that he give us
after the fashion our ancestors the means 
appealing to heaven for light upon this dark
murder we will demand the proof by hierrights
often granted in the days our sovereign's
ancestors approved by bulls and decretals
and administered by the great emperor
charlemagne in france by king artlinr in
britain and by gregory the great and the
mighty aclriius in this our land scotland
i have heard the bierright sir louis
fjuoth the provost and i know we have it in
our charters the fail city but i am something
illlearned in the ancient laws and would
pray you to inform us more distinctly its nature

 we will demand the king said sir
louis lundin my advice being taken that the
body our murdered fellowcitizen be transported
into the high church st john's and
suitable masses said for the benefit his soul
and for the discovery his foul murder meantime
we shall obtain an order that sir john ramorn
give up a list such his household
as were in perth in the course the night between
fastern's even and this ash wednesday
and become bound to present them on a certain
day and hour to be early named in the high
church st john's there one by one to pass
before the bier our murdered fellow citizen
and in trio form prescribed to call upon god and
his saints to bear witness that he is innocent 
the acting art or part the murder and
credit me as has been indeed proved by numerous
instances that if the murderer shall endeavour
to shroud himself by making such an appeal
the antipathy which subsists between the
dead body and the hand which dealt the fatal
blow that divorced it from the soul will awaken
some imperfect life under the influence which
the veins the dead man will pour forth at the
fatal wounds the blood which has been so long
stagnant in the veins or to speak more certainly
it is the pleasure heaven by some
hidden agency which we cannot comprehend to
leave open this mode discovering the wickedness
 him who has defaced the image his
creator
i have heard this law talked said sir
patrick and it was enforced in the bruce's
time this surely is no unfit period to seek by
such a mystic mode inquiry the truth to
which no ordinary means can give us access
seeing that a general accusation sir john's
household would full surely be met by a general
denial yet i must crave farther sir
louis our reverend townclerk how we shall
prevent the guilty person from escaping in the
interim 
 the burghers will maintain a strict watch
upon the wall drawbridges shall be raised
and portcullises lowered from sunset to sunrise
and strong patrols maintained through the
night this guard the burghers will willingly
maintain to secure against the escape the
murderer their townsman
the rest the councillors acquiesced byword
sign and look in this proposal
again said the provost what if anyone
 the suspected household refuse to submit
to the ordeal bierright 
he may appeal to that combat said
the reverend city scribe with an opponent
 equal rank because the accused person must
have his choice in the appeal to the judgment
 god by what ordeal he will be tried but
if he refuses both he must be held as guilty
and so punished
the sages the council unanimously agreed
with the opinion their provost and townclerk
and resolved in all formality to petition
the king as a matter right that the murder
 their fellowcitizen should be inquired into
according to this ancient form which was held
to manifest the truth and received as matter 
evidence in case murder so late as towards
the the seventeenth century but before
the meeting dissolved bailie craigdallie thought
it meet to inquire who was to be the champion
 maudie or magdalen proudfute and her
two children
 there need be little inquiry about that
said sir patrick charteris we are men and
wear swords which should be broken over the
head any one amongst us who will not draw
it in behalf the widow and orphans our
murdered fellowcitizen and in brave revenge
 his death if sir john ramorny shall personally
resent the inquiry patrick charteris 
kinfauns will do battle with him to the outrance
whilst horse and man may stand or spear
and blade hold together but in case the challenger
be yeomanly degree well wot i that
magdalen proudfute may choose her own champion
among the bravest burghers perth and
shame and dishonour were it to the fair city
for ever could she light upon one who was traitor
and coward enough to say her nay bring
her hither that she may make her election
henry smith heard this with a melancholy
anticipation that the poor woman's choice would
light upon him and that his recent reconciliation
with his mistress would be again dissolved
by his being engaged in a fresh quarrel from
which there lay no honourable means escape
and which in any other circumstances
he would have welcomed as a glorious opportunity
 distinguishing himself both in sight 
the court and the city he was aware that
under the tuition father clement catharine
viewed the ordeal battle rather as an
insult to religion than an appeal to the deity
and did not consider it as reasonable that superior
strength arm or skill weapon
should be resorted to as the proof moral
vol 
guilt or innocence he had therefore much
to fear from her peculiar opinions in this particular
refined as they were beyond those 
the age she lived in
while he thus suffered under these contending
feelings magdalen the widow the slaughtered
man entered the court wrapt in a deep mourning
veil and followed and supported by five or
six women good that is respectability
dressed in the same melancholy attire one 
her attendants held an infant in her arms the
last pledge poor oliver's nuptial affections
another led a little tottering creature two
years or thereabouts which looked with wonder
and fear sometimes on the black dress in
which they had muffled him and sometimes on
the scene around him
the assembly rose to receive the melancholy
group and saluted them with an expression 
the deepest sympathy which magdalen though
the mate poor oliver returned with an air
 dignity which she borrowed perhaps from
the extremity her distress sir patrick charters
then stepped forward and with the courtesy
 a knight to a female and a protector
to an oppressed and injured widow took the poor
woman's hand and explained to her briefly by
what course the city had resolved to follow out
the vengeance due for her husband's slaughter
having with a softness and gentleness which
did not belong to his general manner ascertained
that the unfortunate woman perfectly
understood what was meant he said aloud to the
assembly goodcitizensof perth and freeborn
men guild and craft attend to what is about
to pass foritconcerns your rights and privileges
here stands magdalen proudfute desirous to
follow forth the revenge due for the death 
her husband foully murdered as she sayeth
by sir john ramorny knight that ilk and
which she offers to prove by the evidence 
bierright or by the body a man therefore
i patrick charteris being a belted knight and
freeborn gentleman offer myself to do battle
in her just quarrel whilst man and horse may
endure if any one my degree shall lift my
glove how say you magdalen proudfute
will you accept me for your champion 
the widow answered with difficulty i
can desire none nobler
sir patrick then took her right hand in his
and kissing her forehead for such was the
ceremony said solemnly so may god
and st john prosper me at my need as i will
do my devoir as your champion knightly
truly and manfully go now magdalen and
choose at your will among the burgesses the
fair city present or absent anyone upon whom
you desire to rest your challenge if he against
whom you bring plaint shall prove to be beneath
my degree
all eyes were turned to henry smith whom
the general voice had already pointed out as in
every respect the fittest to act as champion on
the occasion but the widow waited not for the
general prompting their looks as soon as
sir patrick had spoken she crossed the floor to
the place where near the bottom the table
the armourer stood among the men his degree
and took him by the hand 
henry gow or smith she said good
burgher and craftsman my my 
husband she would have said but the word
would not come forth she was obliged to
change the expression
he who is gone loved and prized you overall
men therefore meet it is that thou shouldst
follow out the quarrel his widow and orphans

if there had been a possibility which in that
age there was not henry's rejecting or escaping
from a trust for which all men seemed
to destine him every wish and idea retreat
was cut off when the widow began to address
him and a command from heaven could hardly
have made a stronger impression than did the
appeal the unfortunate magdalen her allusion
to his intimacy with the deceased moved
him to the soul during oliver's life doubtless
there had been a strain absurdity in his
excessive predilection for henry which considering
how very different they were in character
had in it something ludicrous but all this
was now forgotten and henry giving way to
his natural ardour only remembered that oliver
had been his friend and intimate a man
who had loved and honoured him as much as he
was capable entertaining such sentiments for
any one and above all that there was much reason
to suspect that the deceased had fallen victim
to a blow meant for henry himself
it was therefore with an alacrity which the
minute before he could scarce have commanded
and which seemed to express a stern pleasure
that having pressed his lips to the cold
brow the unhappy magdalen the armourer
replied 
i henry the smith dwelling in the wynd
 perth good man and true and freely born
accept the office champion to this widow
magdalen and these orphans and will do battle
in their quarrel to the death with any man
whomsoever my own degree and that so long
as i shall draw breath so help me at my need
god and good st john 
there rose from the audience a half suppressed
cry expressing the interest which the persons
present took in the prosecution the quarrel
and their confidence in the issue
sir patrick charteris then took measures for
repairing to the king's presence and demanding
leave to proceed with inquiry into the murder
 oliver proudfute according to the custom
 bierright and if necessary by combat
he performed this duty after the towncouncil
had dissolved in a private interview between
himself and the king who heard this new
trouble with much vexation and appointed next
morning after mass for sir patrick and the
parties interested to attend his pleasure in
council in the meantime a royal pursuivant
was dispatched to the constable's lodgings to
call over the roll sir john ramorny's attendants
and charge him with his whole retinue
under high penalties to abide within perth
until the king's pleasure should be farther
known
chapter 
in goa'h name see the lists and all things fit 
there let them it god defend the right 
henri part 
in the same councilroom the conventual
palace the dominicans king robert was
seated with his brother albany whose affected
austerity virtue and real art and dissimulation
maintained so high an influence over the
feebleminded monarch it was indeed natural
that one who seldom saw things according to
their real forms and outlines should view them
according to the light in which they were presented
to him by a bold studious man possessing
the claim such near relationship
ever anxious on account his misguided
and unfortunate son the king was now endeavouring
to make albany coincide in opinion
with him in exculpating rothsay from any part
in the death the bonnetmaker the precognition
concerning which had been left by sir
patrick charteris for his majesty's consideration

this is an unhappy matter brother robin
he said a most unhappy occurrence and
goes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt the
nobility and the commons here as they have
been at war together in so many distant lands
i see but one cause comfort in the matter 
and that is that sir john ramorny having received
his dismissal from the duke rothsay's
family it cannot be said that he or any his
people who may have done this bloody deed if
it has truly been done by them have been encouraged
or hounded out upon such an errand
by my poor robin i am sure brother you and
i can bear witness how readily upon my entreaties
he agreed to dismiss ramorny from
his service on account that brawl in curfew
street
i remember his doing so said albany
and well do i hope that the connexion betwixt
the prince and ramorny has not been
renewed since he seemed to comply with your
grace's wishes
seemed to comply the connexion renewed
said the king what mean you by
these expressions brother surely when robin
promised to me that if that unhappy matter
 curfew street were but smothered up
and concealed he would part with ramorny
as he was a counsellor thought capable involving
him in similar fooleries and would acquiesce
in our inflicting on him either exile or
such punishment as it should please us to impose
 surely you cannot doubt that he was sincere
in his professions and would keep his
word remember you not that when you advised
that a heavy fine should be levied upon
his estate in fife in lieu banishment the
prince himself seemed to say that exile would
be better for ramorny and even for himself 
i remember it well my royal brother
nor truly could i have suspected ramorny 
having so much influence over the prince after
having been accessary to placing him in a situation
so perilous had it not been for my royal
kinsman's own confession alluded to by your
grace that if suffered to remain at court he
might still continue to direct his conduct i
then regretted i had advised a fine in place 
exile but that time is passed and now new
mischief has occurred fraught with much peril
to your majesty as well as to your royal heir
and to the whole kingdom
what mean you robin said the weakminded
king by the tomb our parents 
by the soul bruce our immortal ancestor 
i entreat thee my dearest brother to take compassion
on me tell me what evil threatens
my son or my kingdom 
the features the king trembling with
anxiety and his eyes brimful tears were
bent upon his brother who seemed to assume
time for consideration ere he replied
my lord the danger lies here your grace
believes that the prince had no accession to this
second aggression upon the citizens perth 
the slaughter this bonnetmaking fellow
about whose death they clamour as a set 
gulls about tlmjir comrade when one the
noisy brood is struck down by a boy's shaft
their lives said the king are dear to
themselves and their friends robin
truly ay my liege and they make them
dear to us too ere we can settle with the knaves
for the least blood witt but as i said your
majesty thinks the prince had no share in this
last slaughter i will not attempt to shake your
belief in that delicate point but will endeavour
to believe along with you what you think is
rule for me robin albany will never think
otherwise than robin broad scotland
thank you thank you said the king taking
his brother's hand i knew i might rely
that your affection would do justice to poor
heedless rothsay who exposes himself to so
much misconstruction that he scarcely deserves
the sentiments you feel for him
albany had such an immovable constancy
 purpose that he was able to return the fraternal
pressure the king's hand while tearing
up by the very roots the hopes the indulgent
fond old man
 but alas the duke continued with a sigh
this burly intractable knight kinfauns
and his brawling herd burghers will not
view the matter as we do they have the boldness
to say that this dead fellow had been misused
by rothsay and his fellows who were in
the street in mask and revel stopping men and
women compelling them to dance or to drink
huge quantities wine with other follies needless
to recount and they say that the whole
party repaired to sir john ramorny's and
broke their way into the house in order to conclude
their revel there thus affording good
reason to judge that the dismissal sir john
from the prince's service was but a feigned
stratagem to deceive the public and hence
they urge that if ill were done that night by
sir john ramorny or his followers much it is
to be thought that the duke rothsay must
have at least been privy to if he did not authorize
it
albany this is dreadful said the king 
would they make a murderer my boy 
would they pretend my son would soil his hands
ill scottish blood without having either provocation
or purpose no no they will not invent
calumnies so broad as these for they are
flagrant and incredible
pardon my liege answered the duke 
albany they say the cause quarrel which
occasioned the riot in curfew street and the
consequences was more proper to the prince
than to sir john since none suspects far less
believes that that hopeful enterprise was conducted
for the gratification the knight 
ramorny
thou drives me mad robin said the
king
i am dumb answered his brother i
did but speak my poor mind according to your
royal order
thou meanest well i know said the
king but instead tearing me to pieces
with the display inevitable calamities were
it not kinder robin to point me out some mode
to escape from them 
true my liege but as the only road 
extrication is rough and difficult it is necessary
your grace should be first possessed with the
absolute necessity using it ere you hear it
even described the chirurgeon must first convince
his patient the incurable condition 
a shattered member ere he venture to name
amputation though it be the only remedy
robert at these words was roused to a degree
 alarm and indignation greater than his
brother had deemed he could be awakened to
 shattered and mortified member my lord
 albany amputation the only remedy 
these are unintelligible words my lord if
thou applies them to our son roth say thou
must make them good to the letter else mayst
thou have bitter cause to rue the consequence
you construe me too literally my royal
liege said albany i spoke not the prince
in such unbeseeming terms for i call heaven
to witness that he is dearer to me as the son 
a wellbeloved brother than had he been son
 my own but i spoke in regard to separating
him from the follies and vanities life
which holy men say are like to mortified member's
and ought like them to be cut off and
thrown from us as things which interrupt our
progress in better things
i understand thou wouldst have this ramorn
who hath been thought the instrument
 my son's follies exiled from court said the
relieved monarch until these unhappy scandals
are forgotten and our subjects are disposed
to look upon our son with different and
more confiding eyes
that were good counsel my liege but
mine went a little a very little farther i
would have the prince himself removed for
some brief period from court
how albany part with my child my
firstborn the light my eyes and wilful ashe
is the darling my heart oh robin 
i cannot and i will not
nay i did but suggest my lord i am sensible
 the wound such a proceeding must inflict
on a parentis heart for am i not myself a
father and he hung his head as if in hopeless
despondency
i could not survive it albany when i
think that even our own influence over him
which sometimes forgotten in our absence u
ever effectual whilst he is with us is by your
plan to be entirely removed what perils might
he not rush upon i could not sleep in his absence
 i should hear his deathgroan in every
breeze and you albany though you conceal
it better would be nearly as anxious
thus spoke the facile monarch willing to
conciliate his brother and cheat himself by taking
it for granted that an affection which
there were no traces subsisted betwixt the uncle
and nephew
your paternal apprehensions are too easily
alarmed my lord said albany i do not
propose to leave the disposal the prince's motions
to his own wild pleasure i understand
that the prince is to be placed for a short time
under some becoming restraint that he should
be subjected to the charge some grave counsellor
who must be responsible both for this conduct
and his safety as a tutor for his pupil
how a tutor and at rothsay's age
vol r
exclaimed the king he is two years beyond
the space to which our laws limit the term 
nonage
 the wiser romans said albany extended
it for four years after the period we assign
 and in common sense the right control
ought to last till it be no longer necessary
and so the time ought to vary with the disposition
here is young lindsay the earl crawford
who they say gives patronage to ramorny
on this appeal he is a lad fifteen with the
deep passions and fixed purpose a man 
thirty while my royal nephew with much more
amiable and noble qualities both head and
heart sometimes shows at twentythree years
 age the wanton humours a boy towards
whom restraint may be kindness and do not
be discouraged that it is so my liege or angry
with your brother for telling the truth since the
best fruits are those that are slowest in ripening
and the best horses such as give most trouble
to the grooms who train them for the field
or lists
the duke stopped and after suffering king
robert to indulge for two or three minutes in a
reverie wliieli lie did not attempt to interrupt
he added in a more lively tone but cheer
up my noble liege perhaps the feud may be
made up without farther fighting or difficulty
the widow is poor for her husband though he
was much employed had idle and costly habits
the matter may be therefore redeemed for money
and the amount an assythment may be
recovered out ramorny's estate
 nay that we will ourselves discharge
said king robert eagerly catching at the hope
 a pacific termination this unpleasing debate
 ramorny's prospects vill be destroyed
by his being sent from court and deprived 
his charge in rothsay's household and it would
be ungenerous to load a falling man but here
comes our secretary the prior to tell us the
hour council approaches good morrow my
worthy father
benedicite my royal liege answered the
abbot
now good father continued the king
 a mulct in atonement for bloodshed due to the nearest relations
 the deceased
 without waiting for rotlisay whose accession
to our counsels we will ourselves guarantee
proceed we to the business our kingdom
what advices have you from the douglas

he has arrived at his castle pantaloon
my liege and has sent a post to say that though
the earl march remains in sullen seclusion
in his fortress dunbar his friends and followers
are gathering and forming an encampment
near nottingham where it is supposed
they intend to await the arrival a large force
 english which hotspur and sir ralph percy
are assembling on the english frontier
that is cold news said the king and
may god forgive george dunbar the
prince entered as he spoke and he continued 
ha thou art here at length rothsay i saw
thee not at mass
i was an idler this morning said the
prince having spent a restless and feverish
night
ah foolish boy answered the kinghadst
thou not been over restless on eastern's
eve thou last not been feverish on the
night ash wednesday
let me not interrupt your prayers my
liege said the prince lightly your grace
was invoking heaven in behalf some one 
an enemy doubtless for these have the frequent
advantage your orisons
sit down and be at peace foolish youth 
said his father his eye resting at the same time
on the handsome face and graceful figure his
favourite son roth say drew a cushion near to
his father's feet and threw himself carelessly
down upon it while the king resumed
i was regretting that the earl march
having separated warm from my hand with full
assurance that he should receive compensation
for everything which he could complain as
injurious should have been capable caballing
with northumberland against his own country 
is it possible he could doubt our intentions to
make good our word 
i will answer for him no said the prince 
march never doubted your highness's word
aviary he may well have made question whether
your learned councillors would leave your majesty
the power keeping it
robert the third had adopted to a great extent
the timid policy not seeming to hear expressions
which being heard required even in
his own eyes some display displeasure he
passed on therefore in his discourse without
observing his son's speech but in private rothsay's
rashness augmented the displeasure which
his father began to entertain against him
it is well the douglas is on the marches
said the king his breast like those his
ancestors has ever been the best bulwark 
scotland
 then woe betide us if he should turn his
back said the incorrigible rothsay
 dare you impeach the courage douglas
 replied the king extremely chafed
 no man dare question the earl's courage
said rothsay it is certain as his pride but
his luck may be something doubted else have
the annals his house given him the name 
tineman for nothing
t'lnc'vuni i c loseman
 by saint andrew robin exclaimed his
father thou art like a screechowl every word
thou mayest betokens strife and calamity
i am silent father answered the youth
and what news our highland disturbances
continued the king addressing the
prior
i trust they have assumed a favourable
aspect answered the clergyman the fire
which threatened the whole country is likely to
be drenched out by the blood some forty or
fifty kerne for the two great confederacies have
agreed i y solemn indenture arms to decide
their quarrel with such weapons as your highness
may name and in your royal presence in
such place as shall be appointed on the th 
march next to come being palm sunday the
number combatants being limited to thirty on
each side and the fight to be maintained to extremity
since they affectionately make humble
suit and petition to your majesty that you will
parentally condescend to wave for the day your
royal privilege interrupting the combat by
flinging down uf truncheon or crying ho 

until the battle shall be utterly fought to an

 the wild savages exclaimed the king 
would they limit our best and dearest royal
privilege that putting a stop to strife and
crying truce to battle will they remove the
only motive which could bring me to the butcherly
spectacle their combat would they
fight like men or like their own mountain
wolves 
my lord said albany the earl 
crawford and i had presumed without consulting
you to ratify that preliminary for the
adoption which we saw much and pressing
reason
how the earl crawford said the
king me thinks he is a young counsellor on
such grave occurrence
he is replied albany notwithstanding
his early years such esteem among his highland
neighbours that i could have done little
with them but for his aid and influence
hear this young rothsay said the king
reproachfully to his heir
i pity crawford sire replied the prince
he has too early lost a father whose councils
would have better become such a season as
this
the king turned next towards albany with
a look triumph at the filial affection which
his son displayed in his reply
albany proceeded without emotion it is
not the life these highlander but their
death which is to be profitable to this commonwealth
 scotland and truly it seemed to the
earl crawford and myself most desirable
that the combat should be a strife extermination

marry said the prince if such be the
juvenile policy lindsay he will be a merciful
ruler some ten or twelve years hence out
upon a boy that is hard heart before he has
hair upon his lip better he had contented himself
with fighting cocks on pastern's even than
laying schemes for massacring men on palm
sunday as if he were backing a welsh main
where all must fight to death
 robin says right albany said the king
 it were unlike a christian monarch to gie
way in this point i cannot consent to see men
battle until they are all hewn down like cattle
in the shambles it would sicken me to look at
it and the warder would drop from ray hand
for mere lack strength to hold it
it would drop unheeded said albany
 let me entreat your grace to recollect that
you only give up a royal privilege which exercised
would win you no respect since it would
receive no obedience were your majesty to
throw down your warder when the war is high
and these men's blood is hot it would meet no
more regard than if a sparrow should drop
among a herd battling wolves the straw which
he was carrying to his nest nothing will separate
them but the exhaustion slaughter 
and better they sustain it at the hands each
other than from the swords such troops as
might attempt to separate them at your majesty's
commands an attempt to keep the peace
by violence would be construed into an ambush
laid for them both parties would unite to resist
it the slaughter would be the same and the
g
hopedfor results future peace would be utterly
disappointed
there is even too much truth in what you
say brother robin replied the flexible king
to little purpose is it to command what i cannot
enforce and although i have the unhappiness
to do so each day my life it were needless
to give such a public example royal impotency
before the crowds who may assemble to
behold this spectacle let these savage men
therefore work their bloody will to the uttermost
upon each other i will not attempt to forbid
what i cannot prevent them from executing
 heaven help this wretched country i
will to my oratory and pray for her since to
aid her by hand and head is alike denied to me
father prior i pray the support your arms
but brother said albany forgive
me if i remind you that we must hear the matter
between the citizens perth and ramoruy
about the death a townsman 
true true said the monarch reseating
himself more violence more battle oh
scotland scotland if the best blood thy
g
bravest children could enrich thy barren soil
what land on earth would excel thee in fertility
 when is it that a white hair is seen on the
beard a scottish man unless he be some
wretch like thy sovereign protected from murder
by impotence to witness the scenes 
slaughter to which he cannot put a period 
let them come in delay them not they are
in haste to kill and grudge each other each fresh
breath their creator's blessed air the demon
 strife and slaughter hath possessed the
whole land 
as the mild prince threw himself back on
his seat with an air impatience and anger
not very usual with him the door at the lower
 the room was unclosed and advancing
from the gallery into which it led where in perspective
was seen a guard the butemen or
brandanes under arms came in mournful
procession the widow poor oliver led by sir
patrick charteris with as much respect as if
she had been a lady the first rank behind
them came two women good the wives 
magistrates the city both in mourning garments
one bearing the infant and the other
leading the elder child the smith followed in
his best attire and wearing over his buffcoat
a scarf crape bailie craigdallie and a brother
magistrate closed the mournful procession
exhibiting similar marks mourning
the good king's transitory passion was gone
the instant he looked on the pallid countenance
 the sorrowing widow and beheld the unconsciousness
 the innocent orphans who had
sustained so great a loss and when sir patrick
charteris had assisted magdalen proudfute to
kneel down and still holding her hand kneeled
himself on one knee it was with a sympathetic
tone that king robert asked her name
and business she made no answer but muttered
something looking towards her conductor
speak for the poor woman sir patrick
charteris said the king and tell us the
cause her seeking our presence
so please you my liege answered sir
patrick rising up this woman and these unhappy
orphans make plaint to your highness
upon sir john ramorny ramorny knight
that by lii or by some his household lier
iimquhile husband oliver proudfute freeman
and burgess perth was slain upon the streets
 the city on the eve shrove tuesday or
morning ash wednesday
woman replied the king with much
kindness thou art gentle by sex and should'st
be pitiful even by thy affliction for our own
calamity ought to make us nay i think it doth
make us merciful to others thy husband hath
only trodden the path appointed to us all
 in his case said the widow my liege
must remember it has been a brief and a bloody
one
 i agree he hath had foul measure but
since i have been unable to protect him as i
confess was my royal duty i am willing in
atonement to support thee and these orphans
as well or better than you lived in the days 
your husband only do thou pass from this
charge and be not the occasion spilling more
life remember i put before you the choice
betwixt practising mercy and pursuing vengeance
and that betwixt plenty and pcnurv
it is true my liege we arc poor answer 
ed the widow with unshaken firmness but
i and my children will feed with the beasts 
the field ere we live on the price my husband's
blood i demand the combat by my
champion as you are belted knight and crowned
king
i knew it would be so said the king
aside to albany in scotland the first words
stammered by an infant and the last uttered
by a dying greybeard are combat blood 
revenge it skills not arguing further admit
the defendants
sir john ramorny entered the apartment
he was dressed in a long furred robe such as
men quality wore when they were unarmed
concealed by the folds drapery his wounded
arm was supported by a scarf or sling 
crimson silk and with the left arm he leaned
on a youth who scarcely beyond the years 
boyhood bore on his brow the deep impression
 early thought and premature passion this
was that celebrated lindsay earl crawford
who in his after days was known by the epithet
 the tiger earl and who ruled the great and
rich valley stratford with the absolute
power and unrelenting cruelty a feudal tyrant
two or three gentlemen friends the earl or
 his own countenanced sir john ramorny
by their presence on this occasion the charge
was again stated and met by a broad denial on
the part the accused and in reply the challengers
offered to prove their assertion by an
appeal to the ordeal bierright
i am not bound answered sir john ramorn
 to submit to this ordeal since i can
prove by the evidence my late royal master
that i was in my own lodgings lying on my
bed ill at ease while this provost and these
bailies pretend i was committing a crime to
which i had neither will nor temptation i
can therefore be no just object suspicion
i can aver said the prince that i saw
and conversed with sir john ramorny about
some matters concerning my own household on
the very night when this murder was adoing
i therefore know that he was ill at ease and
could not in person commit the deed in question
but i know nothing the employment
 his attendants and will not take it upon me
to say that some one them may not have been
guilty the crime now charged on them
sir john ramorny had during the beginning
 this speech looked round with an air 
defiance which was somewhat disconcerted by
the concluding sentence rothsay's speech
i thank your highness he said with a smile
for your cautious and limited testimony in my
behalf he was wise who wrote put not your
faith in princes 
if you have no other evidence your innocence
sir john ramorny said the king
 we may not in respect to your followers refuse
to the injured widow and orphans the complainers
the grant a proof by ordeal bierright
unless any them should prefer that 
combat for yourself you are by the prince's
evidence freed from the attaint
my liege answered sir john i can take
warrant upon myself for the innocence my
household and followers
wliy so a monk or a woman might speak
roi n s

said sir patrick charters iii knightly language
wilt thou sir holm de ramorny do battle
with me in the behalf thy followers 
 the provost perth had not obtained time
lo name the word combat said ramorny ere
i would have accepted it but i am not at present
fit to hold a lance
 i am glad it under your favour sir
john there will be the less bloodshed said
the king you must therefore produce your
followers according to your steward's household
 in the great church st john's that in
presence all whom it may concern they may
purge themselves this accusation see that
every man them do appear at the time 
high mass otherwise your honour may be sorely
tainted
they shall attend to a man said sir john
ramcrny then bowing low to the king he
directed himself to the young duke rothsay
and making a deep obeisance spoke so as
to be heard by him alone you have used
me generously my lord one word your
lips could have ended this controversy and you
have refused to speak it 

on my life whispered the prince i
spake as far as the extreme verge truth and
conscience would permit i think thou could'st
not expect i should frame lies for thee and after
all john in my broken recollections that
night i do bethink me a butcherlylooking
mute with a curtalaxe much like such a one
as may have done yonder nightjob ha have
i touched you sir knight 
ramorny made no answer but turned away
as precipitately as if some one had pressed suddenly
on his wounded arm and regained his
lodgings with the earl crawford to whom
though disposed for anything rather than revelry
he was obliged to offer a splendid collation
to acknowledge in some degree his sense the
countenance which the young noble had afforded
him
chapter x
when after an entertainment the prolonging
 which was like torture to the wounded
knight the earl crawford at length took
horse to go to his distant quarters in the castle
 dublin where he resided as a guest the
knight ramorny retired into his sleeping
apartment agonized pains body and anxiety
 mind here he found henbane dwining on
whom it was his hard fate to depend for consolation
in both respects the physician with his
affectation extreme humility hoped he saw
his exalted patient merry and happy
merry as a mad dog said ramorny and
happy as the wretch whom the cur hath bitten
and who begins to feel the approach 
the ravening madness that ruthless boy saw
my agony and spared not a single carouse i
must do him justice forsooth if i had done
justice to him and to the world i had thrown
him out window and cut short a career which
if he grow upas he has begun will prove a source
 misery to all scotland but especially to tayside
 take heed as thou undoes the ligatures
chirurgeon the touch a fly's wing on that
raw glowing stump were like a dagger to me
 fear not my noble patron said the leech
with a chuckling laugh enjoyment which he
vainly endeavoured to disguise under a tone 
affected sensibility we will apply some fresh
balsam and he he he relieve your knightly
honour the irritation which you sustain so
firmly
firmly man said ramorny grinning
with pain i sustain it as i would the scorching
flames purgatory the bone seems made
 redhot iron thy greasy ointment will hiss
as it drops upon the wound and yet it is december's
ice compared to the feverfit my
mind 
i
we will first use our emollients upon the
body my noble patron said dwining and
then with your knighthood's permission your
servant will try his art on the troubled mind
though i fain hope even the mental pain also
may in some degree depend on the irritation 
the wound and that abated as i trust the corporeal
pangs will soon be perhaps the stormy
feelings the mind may subside themselves

henbane dwining said the patient as he
felt the pain his wound assuaged thou art
a precious and invaluable leech but some things
are beyond thy power thou canst stupid my
bodily sense this raging agony but thou
canst not teach me to bear the scorn the boy
whom i have brought up whom i loved dining
 for i did love him dearly love him 
the worst my ill deeds have been done to
flatter his vices and he grudged me a word 
his mouth when a word would have allayed this
cumber he smiled too i saw him smile when
yon paltry provost the companion and patron
 wretched burghers defied me whom this
heartless prince knew to be unable to bear arms
ere i forget or forgive it thou thyself shalt
preach up the pardoning injuries and
then the care for tomorrow tbink'st thou
henbane d wining that in very reality the
wounds the slaughtered corpse will gape and
shed tears fresh blood at the murderer's approach

i cannot tell my lord save by report
said dwining which avouches the fiict
the brute bonthron said ramorny is
startled at the apprehension such a thing and
speaks being rather willing to stand the
combat what think'st thou he is a fellow
 steel
it is the armourer's trade to deal with
steel replied dwining
 were bonthron to fall it would little grieve
me said ramorny though i should miss
an useful hand
i well believe your lordship will not sorrow
as for that you lost last excuse my pleasantry
 he he he but what are the useful
properties this fellow bonthron 
 those a bulldog answered the knight 
he worries without barking
 you have no fear his coiitessiug said
the physician
who can tell what the dread approaching
death may do replied the patient he
has already shown a timorousness entirely alien
from his ordinary sullenness nature he that
would scarce wash his hands after he had slain a
man is now afraid to see a dead body bleed
 well said the leech i must do somewhat
for him if i can since it was to further my
revenge that he struck yonder downright blow
though by ill luck it lighted not where it was
intended
and whose fault was that timid villain
said ramorny save thine own who marked
a rascal deer for a buck the first head 
benedicite noble sir replied the medicine
 would you have me who know little
save chamber practice be as skilful woodcraft
as your noble self or tell hart from hind
doe from roe in a glade at midnight i misdoubted
me little when i saw the figure run
past us to the smith's habitation in the wynd
habited like a morrisdancer and yet my mind
partly misgave me whether it was our man for
methought he seemed less stature but when
he came out again after so much time as to
change his dress and swaggered onwards with
buffcoat and steelcap whistling after the armourer's
wonted fashion i do own i was mistaken
and loosed your knighthood's hulldog
upon him who did his devoir most duly though
he pulled down the wrong deer therefore unless
the accursed smith kills our poor friend
stonedead on the spot i am determined if art
may do it that the bandog bonthron shall not
miscarry
it will put thine art to the test man 
medicine said ramorny for know that having
the worst the combat if our champion
be not killed stonedead in the lists he will be
drawn forth them by the heels and without
further ceremony knitted up to the gallows as
convicted the murder and when he hath
swung there like a loose tassel for an hour or so
i think thou wilt hardly take it in hand to cure
his broken neck
i am a different opinion may it please
your knighthood answered d wining gently
i will carry him off from the civ foot the
swallows
into the land faery like king arthur
or sir huon bordeaux or utero the
dane or will if i please suffer lii to dangle
on the gibbet for a certain number minutes
or hours and then whisk him away from
the sight all with as much ease as the wind
wafts away the withered leaf
this is idle boasting sir leech replied
ramorny the whole mob perth will attend
him to the gallows each more eager than
another to see the retainer a nobleman die for
the slaughter a cuckold citizen there will
be a thousand them round the gibbet's foot
and were there ten thousand said dining
 shall i who am a high clerk and have
studied in spain and araby itself not be able
to deceive the eyes this hoggish herd 
citizens when the pettiest juggler that ever
dealt in legerdemain can gull even the sharp observation
 your most intelligent knighthood 
i tell you i will put the change on them as if i
were in possession eddie's ring
if thou speaks truth answered the
knight and i think thou dearest not palter
with mo on such a theme thou must have tin
said
 satan and i will have nought to do with
him i disown and defy him
dwining indulged in his internal chuckling
laugh when he heard his patron testify his defiance
 the foul fiend and saw him second
it by crossing himself he composed himself
however upon observing ramorny's aspect become
very stern and said with tolerable gravity
though a little interrupted by the effort
necessary to suppress his mirthful mood 
confederacy most devout sir confederacy
is the soul jugglery but he he he i have
not the honour to be he he an ally the
gentleman whom you speak in whose existence
i am he he no very profound believer
though your knightship doubtless hath better
opportunities acquaintance
proceed rascal and without that sneer
which thou mayest otherwise dearly pay for
i will most undaunted replied dwining
know that i have my confederate too else
my skill were little worth
and who may that be pray you 
stephen smotherwcll if it like your boll

your hickman this fair city i marvel
your knighthood knows him not
 and i marvel thy knaveship knows him not
on professional acquaintance replied ramon
 but i see thy nose is unslit thy ears yet
cropped and if thy shoulders are scared or
branded thou art wise for using a highcollared
jerkin
he he your honour is pleasant said the
medicine it is not by personal circumstances
that i have acquired the intimacy 
stephen smotherwell but on account a certain
traffic betwixt us in which ant please you
i exchange certain sums silver for the bodies
heads and limbs those who die by aid 
friend stephen
wretch exclaimed the knight with horror
is it to compose charms and forward
works witchcraft that you trade for these
miserable relics mortality 
he he he no an it please your knightexecutioner
so called because one his dues consisted
in taking a small ladle full scottish lock meal out every
bashful exposed in the market
j
hood answered the medicine much amused
with the ignorance his patron but we who
are knights the scalpel are accustomed to
practise careful carving the limbs defunct

nay i do not recommend it to your knighthood

growling out some species confession different
from what we would recommend 
marry that can his medicine said d wining
 let me wait on him and lay but a
finger on his wound and trust me he shall betray
no confidence
a why there's a willing fiend that needs neither
pushing nor prompting said ramorny
as i trust i shall need neither in your
knighthood's service
we will go indoctrinate our agent continued
the knight we shall find him pliant 
for hound as he is he knows those who feed from
those who browbeat him and he holds a late
royal master mine in deep hate for some injurious
treatment and base terms which he received
at his hand i must also farther concert
with thee the particulars thy practice for
saving the bandog from the hands the herd
 citizens
we leave this worthy pair friends to their
secret practices which we shall afterwards seethe
results they were although different
s
qualities as well matched for device and execution
 criminal projects as the greyhound
is to destroy the game which the slowhound
raises or the slowhound to track the prey which
the gazehound discovers by the eye pride and
selfishness were the characteristics both but
from the difference rank education and talents
they had assumed the most different appearance
in the two individuals
nothing could less resemble the highblown
ambition the favourite courtier the successful
gallant and the bold warrior than the
submissive unassuming medicine who seemed
even to court and delight in insult whilst in
his secret soul he felt himself possessed a
superiority knowledge a power both 
science and mind which placed the rude
nobles the day infinitely beneath him so
conscious was henbane d wining this elevation
that like a keeper wild beasts he sometimes
adventured for his own amusement to
rouse the stormy passions such men as ramorn
trusting with his humble manner to
elude the turmoil he had excited as an italian
boy will launch his light canoe secure from
its very fragility upon a broken surf in wliicli
the boat an argosy would be assuredly dashed
to pieces that the feudal baron should despise
the humble practitioner in medicine was
a matter course but ramorny felt not the
less the influence which dwining exercised over
him and was in the encounter their wits often
mastered by him as the most eccentric efforts
 a fiery horse are overcome by a boy 
twelve years old if he has been bred to the arts
 the manege but the contempt dwining for
ramorny was far less qualified he regarded the
knight in comparison with himself as scarcely
rising above the brute creation capable indeed
 working destruction as the bull with his
horns or the wolf with his fangs but mastered
by mean prejudices and a slave to priestcraft
in which phrase dwining included religion
 every kind on the whole he considered
ramorny as one whom nature had assigned to
him as a serf to mine for the gold which he worshipped
and the avaricious love which was
his greatest failing though by no means his
worst vice he vindicated this sordid tenders
 t
cy in bis own eyes by persuading himself but
it had its source in the love power
henbane dwining he said as he gazed
in delight upon the hoards which he had secretly
amassed and which he visited from time to
time is no silly miser that doats on those
pieces for their golden lustre it is the power
with which they endow the possessor which
makes him thus adore them what is there that
these put not within your command do you
love beauty and are mean deformed infirm
and old here is a lure the fairest hawk 
them all will stoop to are you feeble weak
subject to the oppression the powerful here
is that will arm in your defence those more
mighty than the petty tyrant whom you fear
are you splendid in your ashes and desire the
outward show opulence this dark chest
contains many a wide range hill and dale
many a fair forest full game the allegiance
 a thousand vassals wish you for favour in
courts temporal or spiritual the smiles 
kings the pardon popes and priests for old
crimes and the indulgence which encourages
priestridden fools to venture on new ones 
all these holy incentives to vice may be purchased
for gold revenge itself which the
gods are said to reserve to themselves doubtless
because they envy humanity so sweet a
morsel revenge itself is to be bought by it
but it is also to be won by superior skill and
that is the nobler mode reaching it i will
spare then my treasure for other uses and accomplish
my revenge gratis or rather i will add
the luxury augmented wealth to the triumph
 requited wrongs
thus thought dwining as returned from
his visit to sir john ramorny he added the
gold he had received for his various services to
the mass his treasure and having gloated
over the whole for a minute or two turned the
key on his concealed treasurehouse and walked
forth on his visits to his patients yielding
the wall to every man whom he met and bowing
and doffing his bonnet to the poorest burgher
that owned a petty booth nay to the artificers
who gained their precarious bread by the labour
 their walked hands
caitiffs was the thought his heart
while he did such obeisance base soddeii
witted mechanics did you know what this key
could disclose what foul weather from heaven
would prevent your unbonneting what putrid
kennel in your wretched hamlet would
be disgusting enough to make you scruple to
fall down and worship the owner such wealth
but i will make you feel my power though
it suits my humour to hide it i will be an incubus
to your city since you have rejected meas
a magistrate like the nightmare i will
hagride ye yet remain invisible myself this
miserable ramorny too he who in losing his
hand has like a poor artizan lost the only valuable
part his frame he heaps insulting language
on me as if anything which he can salad
powder to chafe a constant mind like mine yet
awhile hexjalls me rogue villain and slave he
acts as wisely as if he should amuse himself by
pulling hairs out my head while my hand
had hold this heartstrings every insult i
ran pay back instantly by a pang bodily
pain or mental agonysand he he i run
no long accounts with his knighthood that mast
be allowed
while the medicine was thus indulging his
diabolical musing and passing in his creeping
manner along the street the cry females was
heard behind him
ay there he is our lady be praised 
there is the most helpful man in perth said
one voice
they may speak knights and kings for
redressing wrongs as they call it but give me
worthy master dwining the potter carrier summers
replied another
at the same moment the leech was surrounded
and taken hold by the speakers good women
 the fair city 
how now what's the matter said dining
 whose cow has calved 
 there is no calving in the case said one 
the women but a poor fatherless wean dying 
so come wa wi you for our trust is constant
in you as bruce said to donald the isles
opiferque per orbem dicor said henbane
dwining what is the child dvin 
the croup the croup screamed one 
the gossips the innocent is rousing like a
corbie
cynanche trachealis that disease makes
brief work show me the house instantly
continued the medicine who was in the habit
 exercising his profession liberally notwithstanding
his natural avarice and humanely in
spite his natural malignity as we can suspect
him no better principle his motive was
probably vanity and the love his art
he would nevertheless have declined giving his
attendance in the present case had he known
whither the kind gossips were conducting him
in time sufficient to frame an apology but ere
he guessed whither he was going the leech was
hurried into the house the late oliver proudfate
from which he heard the chant the
women as they swathed and dressed the corpse
 the umquhile bonnetmaker for the ceremony
 next morning which chant the
following verses may be received as a modern
imitation

viewless essence thin and bare
well nigh melted into air 
still with fondness hovering near
the earthly form thou once didst wear 

pause upon thy pinion's flight
be thy course to left or right 
be thou doom'd to soar or sink
pause upon the awful brink

to avenge the deed expelling
thee untimely from thy dwelling
mystic force thou shalt retain
o'er the blood and o'er the brain

when the form thou shalt espy
that darken'd on thy closing eye 
when the footstep thou shalt hear
that thrill'd upon thy dying ear 

tien strange sympathies shall wake
the flesh shall thrill the nerves shall quake
the wounds renew their clotted flood
and every drop cry blood for blood 
hardened as he was the physician felt re 
luctancc to pass the threshold the man to j
whose death he had been so directly though
so far as the indmdual was concerned mistakingly
accessory
let me pass on women he said my
art can only help the living the dead are pastour
power
nay but your patient is up stain's the
youngest orphan 
dwining was compelled to go into the house
but he was surprised when the instant he
stepped over the threshold the gossips who
were busied with the dead body stinted suddenly
in their song while one said to the others 
in god's name who entered that was a
large gout blood 
not so said another voice it is a drop
 the liquid balm
nay summer it was blood again i say
who entered the house even now 
one looked out from the apartment into the
little entrance where dwining under pretence
 not distinctly seeing the trapladder by which
he was to ascend into the upper part this
house lamentation was delaying his progress
purposely disconcerted with what had reached
him the conversation
nay it is only worthy master henbane
dwining answered one the sibyls
only master dwining replied the one
who had first spoken in a tone acquiescence 
 our best helper in need then it must have
been balm sure enough
nay said the other it may have been
blood nevertheless for the leech look you
when the body was found was commanded by
the magistrates to probe the wound with his instruments
and how could the poor dead corpse
know that that was done with good purpose 
ay truly summer and as poor gossip
oliver often mistook friends for enemies while
he was in life his judgment cannot be thought
to have mended now
dwining heard no more being now forced
up stairs into a species garret where magdalen
sat on her widowed bed clasping to
her bosom her infant which already black in
the face and uttering the gasping crowing
sound which gives the popular name to the
complaint seemed on the point rendering up
its brief existence a dominican monk sat near
the bed holding the other child in his arms and
seeming from time to time to speak a word or
two spiritual consolation or intermingle
some observation on the child's disorder
the medicine cast upon the good father a
single glance filled with that ineffable disdain
which men science entertain against interlopers
his own aid was instant and efficacious 
he snatched the child from the despairing mother
stripped its throat and opened a vein
which as it bled freely relieved the little patient
instantaneously in a brief space every
dangerous symptom disappeared and dwining
having bound up the wound replaced the infant
in the arms the half distracted mother
the poor woman's distress for her husband's
loss which had been suspended during the extremity
 the child's danger now returned on
magdalen with the force an augmented torrent
which has borne down the dam dike that
for a while interrupted its waves
oh learned sir she said you see a poor
woman her that you once knew a richer 
but the hands that restored this bairn to my
arms must not leave this house empty generous
kind master dining accept his beads
they are made ebony and silver he aye
liked to have his things as handsome as any gentleman
 and liker he was in all his ways to a
gentleman than any one us and even so came
 it
with these words in a mute passion grief
she pressed to her breast and to her lips the
chaplet her deceased husband and proceeded
to thrust it into dwining's hands
take it she said for the love one
who loved you well ah he used ever to say
if ever man could be brought back from the
brink the grave it must be by master dining's
guidance and his ain bairn is brought
back this blessed day and he is lying there stark
and stiff and kens nothing its health and
sickness o woe is me and walk wa but
take the beads and think on his pair soul as
you put them through your fingers he will be
fineed from purgatory the sooner that good people
pray to assoilzie him
take back your beads summer i know
ho legerdemain can do no conjuring tricks
said the medicine who more moved than perhaps
his rugged nature had anticipated endeavoured
to avoid receiving the illomened gift
but his last words gave offence to the churchman
whose presence he had not recollected
when he uttered them
how now sir leech said the dominican 
do you call prayers for the dead juggling
tricks i know that chaucer the english
maker says you medicines that your study
is but little on the bible our mother the
church hath nodded late but her eyes are
now opened to discern friends from foes and
be well assured 
nay reverend father said d wining you
take me at too great advantage i said i could
do no miracles and was about to add that as
the church certainly could work such conclusions
those rich beads should be deposited in
your hands to be applied as they may best benefit
the soul the deceased
he dropped the beads into the dominican's
hand and escaped from the house mourn 
ing
this was a strangely timed visit he
said to himself when he got safe out doors
i hold such things cheap as any can yet
though it is but a silly fancy i am glad i saved
the squalling child's life but i must to my
friend smotherwell whom i have no doubt to
bring to my purpose in the matter bonthron 
and thus i shall save two lives and have destroyed
only one
chapter xi
the high church st john's in perth
being that the patron saint the burgh
had been selected by the magistrates as that in
which the community was likely to have most
fair play for the display the ordeal the
churches and convents the dominicans carthusian
and others the regular clergy had
been highly endowed by the king and nobles
and therefore it was the universal cry the
citycouncil that their ain goodauld st john
 whose good graces they thought themselves
sure ought to be fully confided in and preferred
to the new patrons for whom the dominicans
carthusian carmelite and others
had founded newer seats around the fair city
the disputes between the regular and secular
clergy added to the jealousy which dictated this
choice the spot in which heaven was to display
a species miracle upon a direct appeal
to the divine decision in a case doubtful guilt 
and the townclerk was as anxious that the
church st john should be preferred as if
there had been a faction in the body saints for
and against the interests that beautiful town
many therefore were the petty intrigues entered
into and disconcerted for the purpose 
fixing on the church but the magistrates considering
it as a matter touching in a close degree
the honour the city determined with judicious
confidence in the justice and impartiality
 their patron to confide the issue to the influence
 st john
it was therefore after high mass had been
performed with the greatest solemnity which
circumstances rendered the ceremony capable
and after the most repeated and fervent prayers
had been offered to heaven by the crowded assembly
that preparations were made for appealing
to the direct judgment heaven on the
mysterious murder the unfortunate bonnetmaker

the scene presented that effect imposing
solemnity which the rites the catholic church
are so well qualified to produce the eastern
window richly and variously painted streamed
down a torrent chequered light upon the
high altar on the bier placed before it were
stretched the mortal remains the murdered
man his arms folded on his breast and his
palms joined together with the fingers pointed
upwards as if the senseless clay was itself appealing
to heaven for vengeance against those
who had violently divorced the immortal spirit
from its mangled tenement
close to the bier was placed the throne which
supported robert scotland and this brother
albany the prince sat upon a lower stool
beside his father an arrangement which occasioned
some observation as albany's seat being
little distinguished from that the king the
heirapparent though full age seemed to be
degraded beneath his uncle in the sight the
assembled people perth the bier was so
placed as to leave the view the body it sustained
open to the greater part the multitude
assembled in the church
at the head the bier stood the knight kinfauns
the challenger and at the foot the young
earl crawford as representing the defendant
the evidence the duke rothsay in expurgation
as it was termed sir john ramorny
had exempted him from the necessity attendance
as a party subjected to the ordeal and
his illness served as a reason for his remaining
at home his household including those who
though immediately in waiting upon sir john
were accounted the prince's domestics and had
not yet received their dismissal amounted to
eight or ten persons most them esteemed men
 profligate habits and who might therefore
be deemed capable in the riot a festival
vol u

evening committing the slaughter the
bonnetmaker they were drawn up in a row
on the left side the church and wore a species
 white cassock resembling the dress a
penitentiary all eyes being bent on them several
 this band seemed so much disconcerted
as to excite among the spectators strong
prepossessions their guilt the real murderer
had a countenance incapable betraying him
a sullen dark look which neither the feast
nor winecup could enliven and which the peril
 discovery and death could not render dejected
we have already noticed the posture the
dead body the face was bare as were the breast
and arms the rest the corpse was shrouded
in a windingsheet the finest linen so that
if blood should flow from any place which was
covered it could not fail to be instantly manifest
high mass having been performed followed
by a solemn invocation to the deity that he
would be pleased to protect the innocent and
make known the guilty eviot sir john ramorn's
page was summoned to undergo the
ordeal he advanced with an illassured step
perhaps ho thought his internal consciousness
tho
that bonthron must have been the assassin
might be sufficient to implicate him in the murder
though he was not directly accessary to it
he paused before the bier and his voice faltered
as he swore by all that was created in
seven days and seven nights by heaven by
hell by his part paradise and by the god
and author all that he was free and sackless
 the bloody deed done upon the corpse
before which he stood and on whose breast he
made the sign the cross in evidence the appeal
no consequences ensued the body remained
stiff as before the curdled wounds gave
no sign blood
the citizens looked on each other with faces
 blank disappointment they had persuaded
themselves eviot's guilt and their suspicions
had been confirmed by his irresolute manner
their surprise at his escape was therefore
extreme the other followers ramorny took
heart and advanced to take the oath with a
boldness which increased as one by one they
performed the ordeal and were declared by the
voice the judges free and innocent every
suspicion attaching to them on account the
death oliver proudfute
but there was one individual who did not
partake that increasing confidence the name
 bonthron bonthron sounded three times
through the aisles the church but he who
owned it acknowledged the call no otherwise
than by a sort shuffling motion with his feet
as if he had been suddenly affected with a fit 
the palsy
speak dog whispered eviot or prepare
for a dog's death 
but the murderer's brain was so much disturbed
by the sight before him that the judges
beholding his deportment doubted whether to
ordain him to be dragged before the bier or to
pronounce judgment in default and it was not
until he was asked for the last time whether
he would submit to the ordeal that he answered
with his usual brevity 
i will not what do i know what juggling
tricks may be practised to take a poor man's
life i offer the combat to any man who says i
harmed that dead body
and according to usual form he threw his
glove upon the floor the church
henry smith stepped forward amidst the murmured
applause his fellowcitizens which
even the august presence could not entirely suppress
 and lifting the ruffian's glove which he
placed in his bonnet laid down his own in the
usual form as a gage battle but bonthron
raised it not
he is no match for me growled the savage
 nor fit to lift my glove i follow the
prince scotland in attending on his master
 horse this fellow is a wretched mechanic
here the prince interrupted him thou follow
me caitiff i discharge thee from my service
on the spot take him in hand smith and
beat himas thou didst never thump anvil the
villain is both guilty and recreant it sickens
me even to look at him and if my royal father
will be ruled by me he will give the parties
two handsome scottish axes and we will see

which them turns out the best fellow before
the day is half an hour older
this was readily assented to by the earl 
crawford and sir patrick charteris the godfathers
 the parties who as the combatants
were men inferior rank agreed that they
should fight in steel caps buff jackets and with
axes and that as soon as they could be prepared
for the combat
the lists were appointed in the skinners
yards a neighbouring space ground occupied
by the corporation from which it had the
name and who quickly cleared a space about
thirty feet by twentyfive for the combatants
thither thronged the nobles priests and commons
 all excepting the old king who detesting
such scenes blood retired to his residence and
devolved the charge the field upon the earl
 errol lord high constable to whose office
it more particularly belonged the duke albany
watched the whole proceeding vith a close
and wary eye his nephew gave the scene the
heedless degree notice which corresponded
vith his character
rill
when the combatants appeared in the lists
nothing could be more striking than the contrast
betwixt the manly cheerful countenance
 the smith whose sparkling bright eye seemed
already beaming with the victory he hoped
for and the sullen downcast aspect the brutal
bonthron who looked as if he were some
obscene bird driven into sunshine out the
shelter its darksome haunts they made
hath severally each to the truth his quarrel 
a ceremony which henry gow performed with
serene and manly confidence bonthron with a
dogged resolution which induced the duke 
rothsay to say to the high constable didst
thou ever my dear errol behold such a mixture
 malignity cruelty and i think fear as in that
fellow's countenance 
 he is not comely said the earl but n
powerful knave as i have seen
i'll gage a hogshead wine with you my
good lord that he loses the day henry the
armourer is as strong as he and much more
active and then look at his bold bearing 
there is something in that other fellow that ih
loathsome to look upon let them yoke presently
my dear constable for i am sick beholding
him
the highconstable then addressed the widow
who in her deep weeds and having her
children still beside her occupied a chair within
the lists woman do you willingly accept
 this man henry the smith to do battle
as your champion in this cause 
i do i do most willingly answered magdalen
proudfute and may the blessing god
and st john give him strength and fortune
since he strikes for the orphan and fatherless 
then i pronounce this a fenced field battle
said the constable aloud let no one
dare upon peril his life to interrupt this
combat by word speech or look sound trumpets
and fight combatants 
the trumpets flourished and the combatants
advancing from the opposite the lists
with a steady and even pace looked at each
other attentively well skilled in judging from
the motion the eye the direction in which
a blow was meditated they halted opposite
to and within reach each other and in turn
made more than one feint to strike in order to
ascertain the activity and vigilance the opponent
at length whether weary these manoeuvres
or fearing lest in a contest so conducted
his unwieldy strength would be foiled by the
activity the smith bonthron heaved up his
axe for a downright blow adding the whole
strength his sturdy arms to the weight the
weapon in its descent the smith however
avoided the stroke by stepping aside for it was
too forcible to be controlled by any guard which
he could have interposed ere bonthron recovered
guard henry struck him a sideling blow
on the steel headpiece which prostrated him
on the ground
 confess or die said the victor placing his
foot on the body the vanquished and holding
to his throat the point the axe which terminated
in a spike or poniard
i will confess said the villain glaring
wildly upward on the sky let me rise
 not till you have yielded said harry
smith
i do yield again murmured southron
and henry proclaimed aloud that his antagonist
was defeated
the dukes rothsay and albany the high
constable and the dominican prior now entered
the lists and addressing bonthron demanded
if he acknowledged himself vanquished
i do answered the miscreant
 and guilty the murder oliver proudfate

i am but i mistook him for another
 and whom didst thou intend to slay 
said the prior confess my son and merit
thy pardon in another world for with this thou
hast little more to do
i took the slain man answered the discomfited
combatant for him whose hand has
struck me down whose foot now presses me
 blessed be the saints said the prior 
 now all those who doubt the virtue the
holy ordeal may have their eyes opened to their
error lo he is trapped in the snare which he
laid for the guiltless
s
 i scarce ever saw the man before said
the smith i never did wrong to him or his
ask him an it please your reverence why
he should have thought slaying me treacherously

it is a fitting question answered the
prior give glory where it is due my son
even though it is manifested by thy shame for
what reason would'st thou have waylaid this
armourer who says he never wronged thee 
 he had wronged him whom i served answered
bonthron and i meditated the deed
by his command
by whose command asked the prior
bonthron was silent for an instant then
growled out he is too mighty for me to
name
 hearken my son said the churchman 
tarry but a brief hour and the mighty and the
mean this earth shall to thee alike be empty
sounds the sledge is even now preparing to
drag thee to the place execution therefore
son once more i charge thee to consult thy
soups weal by glorifying heaven and speaking
the truth was it thy master sir john 
that stirred thee to so foul a deed 
no answered the prostrate villain it
was a gieater than he and at the same time
he pointed with his finger to the prince
wretch said the astonished duke 
rothsay do you dare to hint that was your
instigator 
you yourself my lord answered the unblushing
ruffian
 die in thy falsehood accursed slave 
said the prince and drawing his sword he
would have pierced his calumniator had not
the lord high constable interposed with word
and action
your grace must forgive my discharging
mine office this caitiff must be delivered into
the hands the executioner he is unfit to
be dealt with by any other much less by your
highness
what noble earl said albany aloud and
with much real or affected emotion would
you let the dog pass alive from hence to poison
the people's ears with false accusations
against the prince scotland i say cut him
to hammocks upon the spot 
your highness will pardon me said the
earl errol i must protect him till his
doom is executed
then let him he gagged instantly said
albany and you my royal nephew why
stand you there fixed in astonishment call
your resolution up speak to the prisoner 
swear protest by all that is sacred that you
knew not this felon deed see how the people
look on each other and whisper apart my
life on't that this lie spreads faster than any
gospel truth speak to them royal kinsman
no matter what you say so you be constant in
denial
what sir said rothsay starting from his
pause surprise and mortification and turning
haughtily towards his uncle would you
have me gage my royal word against that an
abject recreant let those who can believe the
son their sovereign the descendant bruce
capable laying ambush for the life a poor
mechanic enjoy the pleasure thinking the
villains tale true
that will not i for one said the smith
bluntly i never did aught but what was in
honour toward his royal grace the duke 
roth say and never received unkindness from
him in word look or deed and i cannot think
he would have given aim to such base practice
was it in honour that you threw his highness
from the ladder in curfew street upon
fastens even said bonthron or think you
the favour was received kindly or unkindly
this was so boldly said and seemed so plausible
that it shook the smith's opinion the
prince's innocence
alas my lord said he looking sorrowfully
towards rothsay could your highness
seek an innocent fellow's life for doing his duty
by a helpless maiden i would rather have
died in these lists than live to hear it said the
bruce's heir 
thou art a good fellow smith said the
prince but i cannot expect thee to judge
more wisely than others away with that convict
to the gallows and gibbet him alive an you
will that he may speak falsehood and spread
scandal on us to the last prolonged moment 
his existence 
so sang the prince turned away from the
lists disdaining to notice the gloomy looks
cast towards him as the crowd made slow and
reluctant way for him to pass and expressing
neither suiprise nor displeasure at a deep hollow
murmur or groan which accompanied
his retreat only a few his own immediate
followers attended him from the field
though various persons distinction had come
there in his train even the lower class 
citizens ceased to follow the unhappy prince
whose former indifferent reputation had exposed
him to so many charges impropriety and
levity and around whom there seemed now
darkening suspicions the most atrocious nature

he took his slow and thoughtful way to the
church the dominicans but the ill news
which fly proverbially fast had reached his father's
place retirement before he himself appeared
on entering the palace and inquiring for
the king the duke rothsay was surprised to
be informed that he was in deep consultation
with the duke albany who mounting on
horseback as the prince left the lists had reached
the convent before him he was about to
use the privilege his rank and birth to enter
the royal apartment when maclewis the commander
 the guard brandanes gave him to
understand in the most respectful terms that
he had special instructions which forbade his
admittance
go at least maclewis and let them know
that i wait their pleasure said the prince
if my uncle desires to have the credit shutting
the father's apartment against the son it
will gratify him to know that i am attending
in the outer hall like a lackey
may it please you said maclewis with
hesitation if your highness would consent
to retire just now and to wait a while in patience
i will send to acquaint you when the
duke albany goes and i doubt not that his
majesty will then admit your grace to his prc
sn
sence at present your highness must forgive
me it is impossible you can have access
i understand you maclewis but go nevertheless
and obey my commands
the officer rent accordingly and returned
with a message that the king was indisposed
and on the point retiring to his private chamber
 but that the duke albany would presently
wait upon the prince scotland
it was however a full half hour ere the
duke albany appeared a period time
which rothsay spent partly in moody silence
and partly in idle talk with maclewis and the
brandanes as the levity or irritability his
temper obtained the ascendant
at length the duke came and with him the
lord high constable whose countenance expressed
much sorrow and embarrassment
fair kinsman said the duke albany
i grieve to say that it is my royal brother's
opinion that it will be best for the honour 
the royal family that your royal highness do
restrict yourself for a time to the seclusion 
the high constable's lodgings and accept 
vol x
the noble earl here present for your principal
if not sole companion until the scandals which
have been this day spread abroad shall be refuted
or forgotten
 how is this my lord errol said the
prince in astonishment is your house to be
my jail and is your lordship to be my jailor

 the saints forbid my lord said the earl
 errol but it is my unhappy duty to obey
the commands your father by considering
your royal highness for some time as being
under my ward
 the prince the heir scotland under the
ward the high constable what reason can
be given for this is the blighting speech a
convicted recreant strength sufficient to tarnish
my royal escutcheon 
while such accusations are not refuted and
denied my kinsman said the duke albany
they will contaminate that a monarch
denied my lord exclaimed the prince 
by whom are they asserted save by a wretch
too infamous even by his own confession to be
credited for a moment though a beggar's character
not a prince's were impeached fetch
him hither let the rack be shown to him you
will soon hear him retract the calumny which
he dared to assert
the gibbet has done its work too surely to
leave bonthron sensible to the rack said the
duke albany he has been executed an
hour since
and why such haste my lord said the
prince know you it looks as if there were
practice in it to bring a stain on my name 
 the custom is universal the defeated combatant
in the ordeal battle is instantly transferred
from the lists to the gallows and yet
fair kinsman continued the duke albany
if you had boldly and strongly denied the imputation
i would have judged right to keep the
wretch alive for further investigation but as
your highness was silent i deemed it best to
stifle the scandal in the breath him that uttered
it
saint mary my lord but this is too insulting
 do yon my uncle and kinsman suppose
me guilty prompting such an useless and
unworthy action as that which the slave confessed

it is not for me to bandy questions with your
highness otherwise i would ask whether you
also mean to deny the scarce less unworthy
though less bloody attack upon the house in
couvrefew street be not angry with me
kinsman but indeed your sequestering yourself
for some brief space from the court were
it only during the king's residence in this city
where so much offence has been given is imperiously
demanded
rothsay paused when he heard this exhortation
 and looking at the duke in a very marked
manner replied 
uncle you are a good huntsman you
have pitched your toils with much skill but you
would have been foiled notwithstanding had
not the stag rushed among the nets free will
god speed you and may you have the profit
by this matter which your measures deserve
say to my father i obey his arrest my lord
high constable wait only your pleasure to
attend you to your lodgings since i am to lie
in ward i could not have desired a kinder or
more courteous warden
the interview between the uncle and nephew
being thus concluded the prince retired
with the earl errol to his lodgings the
citizens whom they met in the streets passing
to the further side when they observed the
duke rothsay to escape the necessity saluting
one whom they had been taught to consider
as a ferocious as well as unprincipled libertine
the constable's lodgings received the
owner and his princely guest both glad to leave
the streets yet neither feeling easy in the situation
which they occupied with regard to each
other within doors
we must return to the lists after the combat
had ceased and when the nobles had withdrawn
the crowds were now separated into
two distinct bodies that which made the smallest
in number was at the same time the most
distinguished for respectability consisting 
the better class inhabitants perth who
were gi'atulating the successful champion and
each other upon the triumphant conclusion
to which they had brought their feud with the
courtiers the magistrates were so much elated
on the occasion that they entreated sir patrick
characterises acceptance a collation in the
townhall to this henry the hero the day
was course invited or he was rather commanded
to attend he listened to the summons
with great embarrassment for it may be readily
believed his heart was with catharine glover
but the advice simon glover decided him
that veteran citizen had a natural and becoming
deference for the magistracy the fair city
and a high estimation all honours which
flowed from such a source
thou must not think to absent thyself from
such a solemn occasion son henry was his
advice sir patrick charteris is to be there
himself and i think it will be a rare occasion
for thee to gain his goodwill it is like he
may order thee a new suit harness and i
myself heard worthy bailie craigdallie say
there was a talk furbishing up the city's armory
 thou must not neglect the good trade
now that thou takes on thee an expensive family

tush father glover answered the embarrassed
victor i lack no custom and thou
knowest there is catharine who may wonder at
my absence and have her ear abused once more
by tales gleemaidens and i wot not what
fear not for that said the glover but
go like an obedient burgess where thy betters
desire to have thee i do not deny that it will cost
some trouble to make thy peace with catharine
about this duel for she thinks herself wiser in
such matters than king and council kirk and
canons provost and bailies but i will take
up the quarrel with her myself and will so
work for thee that though she may receive
thee tomorrow with somewhat a chiding
it shall melt into tears and smiles like an april
morning that begins with a mild shower
away with thee then my son and be constant
tomorrow after morning mass
the smith though reluctantly was obliged
to defer to the reasoning his proposed fatherinlaw
 and once determined to accept the 

your destined for him by the fathers the city
he extricated himself from the crowd and hastened
home to put on his best apparel in which
he presently afterwards repaired to the councillors
where the ponderous oak table seemed
to bend under the massy dishes choice
tay salmon and delicious sea fish from dundee
being the dainties which the fasting season
permitted whilst neither wine ale nor
metheglin were wanting to wash them down
the waits or minstrels the burgh played
during the repast and in the intervals the
music one them recited with great emphasis
a ions poetical account the battle 
fought by sir william wallace and
his redoubled captain and friend thomas 
montreville against the english general seward
 a theme perfectly familiar to all the
guests who nevertheless more tolerant that
their descendants listened as if it had all the
zest novelty it was complimentary to the
ancestor the knight kinfauns doubtless
and to other derbyshire families in passages
which the audience applauded vociferously
whilst they pledged each other in mighty
draughts to the memory the heroes who had
fought hy the side the champion scotland
the health henry wynd was quaffed with
repeated shouts and the provost announced
publicly that the magistrates were consulting
how they might best invest him with some distinguished
privilege or honorary reward to
show how highly his fellowcitizens valued his
courageous exertions
nay take it not thus an it like your worships
said the smith vixh his usual blunt
manner lest men say that valour must be rare
in perth when they reward a man for fighting
for the right a forlorn widow i am sure
there are many scores stout burghers in
perth would have done this day's argue as
well or better than i for in good sooth i
ought to have cracked yonder headpiece like
an earthen pipkin ay and would have done it
too if it had not been one which i myself tempered
for sir john ramorny but an the fair
city think rav service any worth i will
conceive it i'ar more than acquitted by any
aid which you may afford from the common
good to the support the widow magdalen
and her poor orphans
that may well be done said sir patrick
charteris and yet leave the fair city rich
enough to pay her debts to henry wynd 
which every man us is a better judge than
himself who is blinded with an unavailing nicety
which men call modesty and if the burgh
be too poor for this the provost will bear his
share the rover's golden angels have not all
taken flight yet
the beakers were now circulated under the
name a cup comfort to the widow and
anon flowed around once more to the happy
memory the murdered oliver now so bravely
avenged in short it was a feast so jovial
that all agreed nothing was wanting to render
it perfect but the presence the bonnetmate
public proper the burgh
ker himself whose calamity had occasioned the
meeting and who had usually furnished the
standing jest at such festive assemblies had
his attendance been possible it was drily observed
by bailie craigdallie he would certainly
have claimed the success the day and vouched
himself the avenger his own murder
at the sound the vesper bell the company
broke up some the graver sort going to evening
prayers where with halfshut eyes and shining
countenances they made a most orthodox
and edifying portion a lenten congregation 
others to their own homes to tell over the occurrences
 the fight and feast for the information
 the family circle and some doubtless
to the licensed freedoms some tavern the
door which lent did not keep so close shut
as the forms the church required henry
returned to the wynd warm with the good wine
and the applause his fellowcitizens and fell
asleep to dream perfect happiness and catharine
glover
we have said that when the combat was decided
the spectators were divided into two bodies
 these when the more respectable portion
attended the victor in joyous procession
much the greater number or what might be
termed the rabble waited upon the subdued
and sentenced bonthron who was travelling ina
different direction and for a very opposite
purpose whatever may be thought the comparative
attractions the house mourning
and feasting under other circumstances there
can be little doubt which will draw most visitors
when the question is whether we would
witness miseries which we are not to share or
festivities which we are not to partake accordingly
the tumbril in which the criminal
was conveyed to execution was attended by far
the greater proportion the inhabitants 
perth
a friar was seated in the same car with the
murderer to whom he did not hesitate to communicate
under the seal confession the
same false asseveration which he had made upon
the place combat which charged the duke
 rothsay with being director the ambuscade
by which the unfortunate bonnetmaker
bad suffered the same falsehood he disseminated
among the crowd averring with unblushing
effrontery to those who were nighest
to the car that he owed his death to his having
been willing to execute the duke rothsay's
pleasure for a time he repeated these words
sullenly and doggedly in the manner one
reciting a task or a liar who endeavours by reiteration
to obtain a credit for his words which
he is internally sensible they do not deserve
but when he lifted up his eyes and beheld in
the distance the black outline a gallows at
least forty feet high with its ladder and its
fatal cord rising against the horizon he became
suddenly silent and the friar could observe that
he trembled very much
be comforted my son said the good
priest you have confessed the truth and received
absolution your penitence will be accepted
according to your sincerity and though
you have been a man bloody hands and cruel
heart yet by the church's prayers you shall
be in due time assailed from the penal fires
 purgatory
these assurances were calculated rather to
augment than to diminish the terrors the culprit
who was agitated by doubts whether the
mode suggested for his preservation from death
would to a certainty be effectual and some suspicion
whether there was really any purpose 
employing them in his favour for he knew his
master well enough to be aware the indifference
with which he would sacrifice one who
might on some future occasion be a dangerous
evidence against him
his doom however was sealed and there
was no escaping from it they slowly approached
the fatal tree which was erected on a
bank by the river's side about half a mile from
the walls the city a site chosen that the body
 the wretch which was to remain food for the
carrion crows might be seen from a distance in
every direction here the priest delivered bonthrone
to the executioner by whom he was assisted
up the ladder and to all appearance dispatched
according to the usual forms the law he
seemed to struggle for life for a minute but soon
fi
after hung still and inanimate the executioner
after remaining upon duty for more than
half an hour as if to permit the last spark 
life to be extinguished announced to the admirers
 such spectacles that the irons for the
permanent suspension the carcass not having
been got ready the concluding ceremony disembowelling
the dead body and attaching it
finally to the gibbet would be deferred till the
next morning at sunrise
notwithstanding the early hour which he had
named master smotherwell had a reasonable
attendance rabble at the place execution
to see the final proceedings justice with its
victim but great was the astonishment and
resentment these amateurs to find that the
dead body had been removed from the gibbet
they were not however long at a loss to guess
the cause its disappearance bonthron had
been the follower a baron whose estates lay in
fife and was himself a native that province
what was more natural than that some the
fife men whose boats were frequently plying
s
on the river should have clandestinely removed
the body their countryman from the place 
public shame the crowd vented their rage
against smotherwell for not completing his job
on the preceding evening and had not he and
his assistant betaken themselves to a boat and
escaped across the tay they would have run
some risk being pelted to death the event
however was too much in the spirit the times
to be much wondered at its real cause we shall

the incidents a narrative this kind
must be adapted to each other as the wards 
a key must tally accurately with those the
lock to which it belongs the reader however
gentle will not hold himself obliged to rest satisfied
with the mere fact that such and such
occurrences took place which is generally
speaking all that in ordinary life he can know
 what is passing around him but lie is desirous
while reading for amusement knowing
the interior movements occasioning the course
 events this is a legitimate and reasonable
curiosity for every man hath a right to open
and examine the mechanism his own watch
put together for his proper use although he is
not permitted to pry into the interior the timepiece
which for general information is displayed
on the townsteeple
it would be therefore uncourteous to leave
my readers under any doubt concerning the
agency which removed the assassin southron
from the gallows an event which some the
perth citizens ascribed to the foul fiend himself
while others were content to lay it upon
the natural dislike bonthron's countrymen
 fife to see him hanging on the river side
as a spectacle dishonourable to their province
about midnight after the day when the execution
had taken place when the inhabitants
 perth were deeply buried in slumber three
men mused in their cloaks and bearing a
dark lantern descended the alleys a garden
wtdcb led from the house occupied by sir john
ramorny to the banks the tay where a small
boat lay moored to a landingplace or little
projecting pier the wind howled in a low and
melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs
and bushes and a pale moon leaded as it is
termed in scotland amongst drifted clouds
which seemed to threaten rain the three individuals
entered the boat with great precaution
to escape observation one them was
a tall powerful man another short and bent
downwards the third middlesized and apparently
younger than his companions and light
and active thus much the imperfect light
could discover they seated themselves in the
boat and unmoored it from the pier
we must let her drift with the current till
we pass the bridge where the burghers still
keep guard and you know the proverb a
perth arrow hath a perfect flight said the
most youthful the party who assumed the
office helmsman and pushed the boat off
from the pier whilst the others took the oars
which were muffled and rowed with all precaution
till they attained the middle the
river they then ceased their efforts lay upon
their oars and trusted to the steersman for keeping
her in midchannel
in this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded
beneath the stately gothic arches 
the old bridge erected by the magnificent patronage
 robert bruce in and carried
away by an inundation in although they
heard the voices a civic watch which since
these disturbances commenced had been nightly
maintained in that important pass no challenge
was given and when they were so far
down the stream as to be out hearing 
those guardians the night they began to
row but still with precaution and to converse
though in a low tone
you have found a new trade comrade since
i left you said one the rowers to the
other i left you engaged in tending a sick
knight and i find you employed in purloining a
dead body from the gallows
 a living body so please your squirehood
master buncle or else my craft hath failed 
its purpose
so i am told master pottercarrier but
saving your clerkship unless you tell me your
trick i will take leave to doubt its success
a simple toy master buncle not likely to
please a genius so acute as that your variance
marry thus it is this suspension 
the human body which the vulgar call hanging
operates death by apoplexy that is the blood
being unable to return to the heart by the compression
 the veins it rushes to the brain
and the man dies also and as an additional
cause dissolution the lungs no longer receive
the needful supply the vital air owing
to the ligature the cord around the thorax 
and hence the patient perishes
i understand that well enough but how
is it to be prevented sir medicine said the
third person who was no other than ramorny's
page eliot
 marry then replied dwining hang me
the patient up in such fashion thai the carotid
arteries shall not be compressed and the
blood will not determine to the brain and apoplexy
will not take place and again if there
be no ligature around the thorax the lungs
will be supplied with air whether the man be
hanging in the middle heaven or standing on
the firm earth
 all this i conceive said eviot but how
these precautions can be reconciled with the
execution the sentence hanging is what
my dull brain cannot comprehend
ah good youth thy variance hath spoiled
a fair wit hadst thou studied with me
thou should'st have learned things more difficult
than these but here is my trick i get
me certain bandages made the same substance
with your young variance's horsegirths
having especial care that they are a kind
which will not shrink on being strained since
that would spoil my experiment one loop
 this substance is drawn under each foot and
returns up either side the leg to a cincture
with vvbich it is united these cincture are
connected by divers straps down the breast and
back in order to divide the weight and there
arc sundry other conveniences for easing the
patient but the chief is this the straps or
ligatures are attached to a broad steel collar
curving outwards and having a hook or two
for the better security the halter which the
friendly executioner passes around that part 
the machine instead applying it to the bare
throat the patient thus when thrown off
from the ladder the sufferer will find himself
suspended not by his neck if it please you but
by a steel circle which supports the loops in
which his feet are placed and on which his
weight really rests diminished a little by similar
supports under each arm thus neither
vein nor windpipe being compressed the man
will breathe as free and his blood saving from
fright and novelty situation will flow as
temperately as your variance's when you stand
up in your stirrups to view a field battle
 by my faith a quaint and rare device 
quoth bunch
is it not pursued the leech and well
worth being known to such mounting spirits as
your vacancies since there is no knowing to
what height sir john ramorny's pupils may
arrive and if these be such that it is necessary
to descend from them by a rope you may find
my mode management more convenient than
the common practice marry but you must be
provided with a highcollared doublet to conceal
the ring steel and above all such
a bonus socius as smother well to adjust the
noose
base poisonvender said eviot men 
our calling die on the field battle 
i will save the lesson however replied
buncle in case some pinching occasion
but what a night the hangdog bloody bonthrone
must have had it dancing a pavise in
mid air to the music his own shackles as the
night wind swings him that way and this 
it were an alms deed to leave him there
said eviot for his descent from the gibbet
will but encourage him to new murders he
knows but two elements drunkenness and
bloodshed
perhaps sir john ramorny might have
been your opinion said dwining but it
would first have been necessary to cut out the
rogue's tongue lest he had told strange tales
from his airy height and there are other
reasons that it concerns not your vacancies to
know in truth i myself have been generous
in serving him for the fellow is built as strong
as edinburgh castle and his anatomy would
have matched any that is in the chirurgical hall
 padua but tell me master buncle what
news bring you from the doughty douglas 
they may tell that know said buncle
i am the dull ass that bears the message and
kens nought its purport the safer for myself
perhaps i carried letters from the duke
 albany and from sir john ramorny to the
douglas and he looked black as a northern
tempest when he opened them i brought them
answers from the earl at which they smiled
like the sun when the harvest storm is closing
over lira go to your ephemerides leech and
conjure the meaning out that
me thinks i can do so without much cost
 wit said the chirurgeon hut yonder i
see in the pale moon our deadalive should
he have screamed out to any chance passenger
it were a curious interruption to a nightjourney
to be hailed from the top such a gallows
as that hark methinks i do hear his groans
amid the whistling the wind and the creaking
 the chains so fair and softly make
fast the boat with the grappling and get out
the casket with my matters we would be better
for a little fire but the light might bring observation
on us come on my men valour
march warily for we are bound for the gallows
foot follow with the lantern i trust the ladder
has been left
as they advanced to the gibbet they could
plainly hear groans though uttered in a low
tone d wining ventured to give a low cough
once or twice by way signal but receiving
no answer we had best make haste said he
to ills companions for our friend must be in
extremes as he gives no answer to the signal
which announces the arrival help come
let us to the gear i will go up the ladder
first and cut the rope do you two follow one
after another and take fast hold the body so
that he fall not when the halter is unloosed
keep sure gripe for which the bandages will afford
you convenience bethink you that though
he plays an owes part tonight he hath no wings
and to fall out a halter may be as dangerous
as to fall into one
while he spoke thus he ascended the ladder
and having ascertained that the menatarms
who followed him had the body in their hold
he cut the rope and then gave his aid to support
the almost lifeless form the criminal
by a skilful exertion strength and address
the body bonthron was placed safely on the
ground and the faint yet certain existence 
life having been ascertained it was thence transported
to the river side where shrouded by
the bank the party might be best concealed
from observation while the leech employed himself
in the necessary means recalling animation
with which he had taken care to provide
himself
for this purpose he first freed the recovered
person from his shackles which the executioner
had left unlocked on purpose and at the
same time disengaged the complicated envelopes
and bandages by which he had been suspended
it was some time ere dwining's efforts succeeded
 for in despite the skill with which his
machine had been constructed the straps designed
to support the body had stretched so
considerably as to occasion the sense suffocation
becoming extremely overpowering but
the address the surgeon triumphed over all
obstacles and after sneezing and stretching
himself with one or two brief convulsions bonthrone
gave decided proofs animation by
arresting the hand the operator as it was in
the act dropping strong waters on his breast
and throat and directing the bottle which contained
them to his lips he took almost perforce
a considerable gulp the contents
it is spiritual essence double distilled said
the astonished operator and would blister
the throat and burn the stomach any other
man but this extraordinary beast is so unlike
all other human creatures that i should
not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession his faculties
bonthron sat up stared around and indicated
some consciousness existence
wine wine were the first words which
he articulated
the leech gave him a draught medicated
wine mixed with water he rejected it under
the dishonourable epithet kennelwashings
and again uttered the words wine 
wine
nay take it to thee i the devil's name
said the leech since none but he can judge
 thy constitution
a draught long and deep enough to have
discomposed the intellects any other person
was found effectual in recalling those bonthrone
to a more perfect states though he betrayed
no recollection where he was or what
ig
iiaj befallen him and in this brief and sullen
manner asked why he was broglie to the riverside
at this time night
another frolic the wild prince for
drenching me as he did before nails and
blood but i would 
hold thy peace interrupted eviot and
be thankful i pray you if you have any thankfulness
in you that thy body is not crows meat
and thy soul in a place where water is too
scarce to duck thee
i begin to bethink me said the ruffian 
and raising the flask to his mouth which he saluted
with a long and hearty kiss he set the
empty bottle on the earth dropped his head on
his bosom and seemed to muse for the purpose
 arranging his confused recollections
 we can abide the issue his meditations
no longer said dwining he will be better
after he has slept up sir you have been
riding the air these some hours try if the water
be not an easier mode conveyance your
valours must lend me a hand i can no more
lift this mass than i could raise in my arms a
slaughtered bull
stand upright on thine own feet bonthrone
now we have placed thee upon them
said eviot
i cannot answered the patient every
drop blood tingles in my veins as if it had
pinpoints and my knees refuse to bear their
burden what can be the meaning all this 
this is some practice thine thou dog leech
ay ay so it is honest bonthron said
d wining a practice thou shalt thank me for
when thou comest to learn it in the meanwhile
stretch down in the stern that boat
and let me wrap this cloak about thee assisted
into the boat accordingly bonthron was
deposited there as conveniently as things admitted
 he answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt a
boar who has got some food particularly agreeable
to him
rand now buncle said the chirurgeon
 your valiant squireship knows your charge
vol hi b
ib
you are to carry this lively cargo by the river
to newburgli where you are to dispose him
as you wot meantime here are his shackles
and bandages the marks his confinement
and liberation bind them up together and
fling them into the deepest pool you pass over 
for found in your possession they might tell tales
against us all this low light breath wind
from the west will permit you to use a sail as
soon as the light comes in and you are tired
 rowing your other valiancy master page
eviot must be content to return to perth with
me afoot for here severs our fair company 
take with thee the lantern buncle for thou
wilt require it more than we and see thou send
me back my flasket
as the pedestrians returned to perth eviot
expressed his belief that bonthron's understanding
would never recover the shock which
terror had inflicted upon it and which appeared
to him to have disturbed all the faculties 
this mind and in particular his memory
it is not so an it please your pagehood
said the leech bonthrons intellect such as
it is hath a solid character it will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath
been put in motion and then will rest in its
proper point gravity our memory is all
our powers mind that which is peculiarly
liable to be suspended deep intoxication or
sound sleep alike destroy it and yet it returns
when the drunkard becomes sober or the sleeper
is awakened terror sometimes produces the
same effects i knew at paris a criminal condemned
to die by the halter who suffered the
sentence accordingly showing no particular
degree timidity upon the scaffold and behaving
and expressing himself as men in the
same condition are wont to do accident did
for him what a little ingenious practice hath
done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted he was cut down and given to his
friends before life was extinct and i had the
good fortune to recover him but though he
recovered in other particulars he remembered
but little his trial and sentence his confession
on the morning his execution he 
he he in his usual chuckling manner he
remembered him not a word neither leaving
the prison nor his passage to the grave
where he suffered nor the devout speeches
with which he he he edified he he he so
many good christians nor ascending the fatal
tree nor taking the fatal leap had my revenant
the slightest recollection but here we
reach the point where we must separate for it
were unfit should we meet any the watch
that we be found together and it were also
prudent that we enter the city by different
gates my profession forms an excuse for my
going and coming at all times your valiant
pagehood will make such explanation as may
seem sufficing
i shall make my will a sufficient excuse if i
am interrogated said the haughty young man
yet i will avoid interruption if possible the
moon is quite obscured and the road as black
as a wolds mouth
tut said the physician let not your
valour care for that we shall tread darker paths
ere it be long
without inquiring into the meaning these
evilboding sentences and indeed hardly listening
to them in the pride and recklessness his
nature the page ramorny parted from his
ingenious and dangerous companion and each
took his own way
i
chapter 
the come true love never did run smooth
the ominous anxiety our armourer had
not played bim false when the good glover
parted with his intended soninlaw after the
judicial combat had been decided he found what
he indeed had expected that his fair daughter
was in no favourable disposition to her lover but
although he perceived that catharine was cold
restrained collected had cast away the appearance
 mortal passion and listened with a reserve
implying contempt to the most splendid
description he could give her the combat in
the skinners yards he was determined not to
take the least notice her altered manner but
to speak her marriage with his son henry asa
thing which must course take place at
length when she began as on a former occasion
to intimate that her attachment to the armourer
did not exceed the bounds friendship that
she was resolved never to marry that the pretended
judicial combat was a mockery the
divine will and human laws the glover not
unnaturally grew angry
i cannot read thy thoughts wench nor
can i pretend to guess under what wicked delusion
it is that you kiss a declared lover suffer
him to kiss you run to his house when a report
is spread his death and fling yourself into
his arms when you find him alone all this
shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her
parents in a match sanctioned by her father 
but such tokens intimacy bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem and is
determined not to marry are untimely and unmaidenly
you have already been more bounteous
 your favours to henry smith than your
mother whom god assoilzie ever was to me
before i married her tell thee catharine
this trifling with the love an honest man is
what i neither can will nor ought to endure i
have given my consent to the match and i insist
it shall take place without delay and that
you receive henry wynd tomorrow as a man
whose bride you are to be with all dispatch
a power more potent than yours father
will say no replied catharine
i will risk it my power is a lawful one
that a father over a child and an erring
child answered her father god and man
allow my influence
then may heaven help us said catharine
 for if you are obstinate in your purpose
we are all lost
 we can expect no help from heaven said
the glover when we act with indiscretion
 am clerk enough myself to know that and
that your causeless resistance to my will is sinful
every priest will inform you ay and more
than that you have spoken degradingly the
blessed appeal to god in the combat ordeal
take heed for the holy church is awakened to
watch her sheepfold and to extirpate heresy by
fire and steel so much i warn thee 
catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation 
and with difficulty compelling herself to assume
an appearance composure promised her
father that if he would spare her any farther
discussion the subject till tomorrow morning
she would then meet him determined to
make a full discovery heirs sentiments
with this promise simon glover was obliged
to remain contented though extremely anxious
for the postponed explanation it could not be
levity or fickleness character which induced
his daughter to act with so much apparent inconsistency
towards the man his choice
and whom she had so lately unequivocally owned
to be also the man her own what external
force there could exist a kind powerful
enough to change the resolutions she had so
decidedly expressed within twentyfour hours
was a matter complete mystery
but i will be as obstinate as she can bethought
the glover and she shall either marry
henry smith without farther delay or old
simon glover will know an excellent reason to
the contrary
the subject was not renewed during the
evening but early on the next morning just
at surprising catharine knelt before the bed
in which her parent still slumbered her heart
sobbed as if it would burst and her tears fell
thick upon her father's face the good old man
awoke looked up crossed his child's forehead
and kissed her affectionately
i understand thee kate he said thou
art come to confession and i trust art deft

serous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere

catharine was silent for an instant
i need not ask my father if you remember
the carthusian monk clement and his
preaching and lessons at which indeed you
assisted so often that you cannot be ignorant
men called you one his converts and with
greater j justice termed me so likewise 
i am aware both said the old man
raising himself on his elbow but i defy foul
fame to show that i ever owned him in anv

heretical proposition though i loved to hear
him talk the corruptions the church the
misgovernment the nobles and the wild ignorance
 the poor proving as it seemed to me
that the sole virtue our commonweal its
strength and its estimation lay among the
burgher craft the better class which i received
as comfortable doctrine and creditable
to the town and if he preached other than
right doctrine wherefore did his superiors in
the carthusian convent permit it if the shepherds
turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the
flock they should not blame the sheep for being
worried
they endured his preaching nay they encouraged
it said catharine while the vices
 the laity the contentions the nobles and
the oppression the poor were the subject 
his censure and they rejoiced in the crowds
who attracted to the carthusian church forsook
those the other convents but the hypocrites
 for such they are joined with the
other fraternities in accusing their preacher clement
when passing from censuring the crimes
 the state he began to display the pride ignorance
and luxury the churchmen themselves 
their thirst power their usurpation overrun's
consciences and their desire to augment their
worldly wealth
for god's sake catharine said her father
 speak within doors your voice rises intone
and your speech in bitterness your eyes
sparkle it is owing to this zeal in what concerns
you no more than others that malicious
persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous
name a heretic
you know i speak no more than what is
truth said catharine and which you yourself
have avouched often
by needle and buckskin no answered
the glover hastily would'st thou have me
avouch what might cost me life and limb laud
and goods for a full commission hath been
granted for taking and trying heretics upon
whom is laid the cause all late tumults and
miscarriages wherefore few words are best
wench i am ever mind with the old maker

een perverted and yon
are in dittay as a gross railer against church and
churchmen and for holding discourse against
them with loose and profligate persons such as
the deceased oliver proudfute the smith
henry the wynd and others set forth as
commending the doctrines father clement
whom they charge with seven rank heresies and
seek for with staff and spear to try him to the
death but that said catharine kneeling and
looking upwards with the aspect one those
beauteous saints whom the catholics have given
to the fine arts that they shall never do
he hath escaped from the net the fowler 
and i thank heaven it was by my means
thy means girl art thou mad said the
amazed glover
i will not deny what i glory in answered
catharine it was by my means that concha
was led to come hither with a party men and
carry off the old man who is now far beyond
the highland line
o my rash my unlucky child said the
glover hast thou dared to aid the escape 
one accused heresy and to invite highlanders
in arms to interfere with the administration
 justice within burgh alas thou hast offended
both against the laws the church and
those the realm what what would become
 us were this known 
it is known my dear father said the maiden
firmly known even to those who will
be the most willing avengers the deed
this must be some idle notion catharine
or some trick those cogging priests and nuns 
it accords not with thy late cheerful willingness
to wed henry smith
alas dearest father remember the dismal
surprise occasioned by his reported death and
the joyful amazement at finding him alive and
deem it not wonder if i permitted myself under
your protection to say more than my reflection
justified but then i knew not the worst
and thought the danger exaggerated alas i
was yesterday fearfully undeceived when the
abbess herself came hither and with her the
dominican they showed me the commission
under the broad seal scotland for inquiring
into and punishing heresy they showed me
ig
your name and my own in a list suspected
persons and it was with tears real tears that
the abbess conjured me to avert a dreadful
fate by a speedy retreat into the cloister and
that the monk pledged his word that you should
not be molested if i complied
the foul fiend take them both for crocodiles
 said the glover
alas replied catharine complaint oranger
will little help us but you see i have had
real cause for this present alarm
alarm call it utter ruin alas my reckless
child where was your prudence when you
ran headlong into such a snare 
hear me father said catharine there
is still one mode safety held out it is one
which i have often proposed and for which i
have in vain supplicated your permission
i understand you the convent said her
father but catharine what abbess or prioress
would dare 
that i will explain to you father and it
will also show the circumstances which have
made me seem unsteady resolution to a demo

gree which has brought censure upon me from
yourself and others our confessor old father
francis whom i chose from the dominican convent
at your command 
ay truly interrupted the glover and i
so counselled and commanded thee in order to
take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction father clement
well this father francis has at different
times urged and provoked me to converse on
such matters as he judged i was likely to learn
something from the carthusian preacher
heaven forgive me my blindness i fell into the
snare spoke freely and as he argued gently as
one who would fain be convinced i even argued
warmly in defence what i believed devoutly
the confessor assumed not his real aspect and
betrayed not his secret purpose until he had
learned all that i had to tell him it was then
that he threatened me with temporal punishment
and with eternal condemnation had his
threats reached mc alone i could have stood
firm for their cruelty on earth i could have
vol iii c
s
endured and their power beyond this life i have
no belief in
for heaven's sake said the glover vrbo
was wellnigh beside himself at perceiving at
every new word the increasing extremity his
daughter's danger beware blaspheming the
holy church whose arms are as prompt to
strike as her ears are sharp to hear
to me said the maid perth again
looking up the terrors the threatened denunciations
would have been little avail 
but when they spoke involving thee my father
in the charge against me i own i trembled
and desired to compromise the abbess
martha elcho nunnery being my mother's
kinswoman i told her my distresses and
obtained her promise that she would receive me
if renouncing worldly love and thoughts wedlock
i would take the veil in her sisterhood
she had conversation on the topic i doubt not
with the dominican francis and both joined
in singing the same song remain in the
world said they and thy father and thou
shall be brought to trial as heretics assume the
veil and the errors both shall be forgiven and
cancelled they spoke not even recantation
 errors doctrine all should be peace if i
would but enter the convent
i doubt not i doubt not said simon 
the old glover is thought rich and his wealth
would follow his daughter to the convent 
elcho unless what the dominicans might claim
as their own share so this was thy call to the
veil these thy objections to henry wynd 
indeed father the course was urged on
all hands nor did my own mind recoil from it
sir john ramorny threatened me with the
powerful vengeance the young prince if i
continued to repel his wicked suit and as for
poor henry it is but late that i have discovered
to my own surprise that that i love
his virtues more than i dislike his faults alas 
the discovery has only been made to make my
quitting the world more difficult than when 
thought i had thee only to regret
she rested her head on her hand and wept
bitterly
 all this is folly said the glover never
was there an extremity so pinching but
what a wise man might find counsel if he was
daring enough to act upon it this has never
been the land or the people over whom priests
could rule in the name rome without their
usurpation being controlled if they are to punish
each honest burgher who says the monks
love gold and that the lives some them
cry shame upon the doctrines they teach why
truly stephen smothered will not lack employment
 and if all foolish maidens are to be
secluded from the world because they follow
the erring doctrines a popular preaching friar
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive
their inmates on slighter composition our
privileges have been often defended against the
pope himself by our good monarchs yore
and when he pretended to interfere with the
temporal government the kingdom there
wanted not a scottish parliament who told him
his duty in a letter that should have been written
in letters gold i have seen the epistle
myself and though i could not read it the very
sight the seals the right reverend prelates
and noble and true barons which hung at it
made my heart leap for joy thou should'st not
have kept this secret my child but it is no time
to tax thee with thy fault go down get me
some food i will mount instantly and go to our
lord provost and have his advice and as i
trust his protection and that other truehearted
scottish nobles who will not see a true
man trodden down for an idle word
 alas my father said catharine it was
even this impetuosity which i dreaded i knew
if i made my plaint to you there would soon be
fire and feud as if religion though sent to us by
the father peace were fit only to be the mother
 discord and hence i could now even
now give up the world and retire with my
sorrow among the sisters elcho would you
but let me be the sacrifice only father comfort
poor henry when we are parted for ever 
and do not do not let him think me too
harshly say catharine will never vex him
more by her remonstrances but that she will
never forget him in her prayers
 the girl bath a tongue that would make a
saracen weep said her father his own eyes
sympathizing with those his daughter but
i will not yield way to this combination between
the nun and the priest to rob me 
my only child away with you girl and let
me don my clothes and prepare yourself to
obey me in what i may have to recommend for
your safety get a few clothes together and
what valuables thou hast also take the keys
 my iron box which poor henry smith gave
me and divide what gold you find into two portions
 put the one into a purse for thyself and
the other into the quilted girdle which i made
on purpose to wear on journeys thus both shall
be provided in case fate should sunder us in
which event god send the whirlwind may take
the withered leaf and spare the green one let
them make ready my horse instantly and the
white jennet that i bought for thee but a day since
hoping to see thee ride to st john's kirk with
maids and matrons as blithe a bride as ever
crossed the holy threshold but it skills not talking
 away and remember that the saints help
those who are willing to help themselves not
word in answer begone i say no wilfulness
now the pilot in calm weather will let a
seaboy trifle with the rudder but by my soul
when winds howl and waves arise he stands
by the helm himself away no reply
catharine left the room to execute as well
as she might the commands her father who
gentle in disposition and devotedly attached
to his child suffered her often as it seemed to
guide and rule both herself and him yet who
as she knew was wont to claim filial obedience
and exercise parental authority with sufficient
strictness when the occasion seemed to require
an enforcement domestic discipline
while the fair catharine was engaged in
executing her father's behests and the good
old glover was hastily attiring himself as one
who was about to take a journey a horse's
tramp was heard in the narrow street the
horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak having
the cape it drawn up as if to hide the
under part his face while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows and a broad plume ohscared
bis upper features he sprung from the
saddle and dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom
ere the stranger had ascended the stair and entered
the sleeping apartment simon astonished
and alarmed and disposed to see in this
early visitant an apparitor or sumner come to
attach him and his daughter was much relieved
when as the stranger doffed the bonnet
and threw the skirt the mantle from his face
he recognised the knightly provost the fair
city a visit from whom at any time was a favour
 no ordinary degree but being made at
such an hour had something marvellous and
connected with the circumstances the times
even alarming
sir patrick charteris said the glover
 this high honour done to your poor beadsman
 
hush said the knight there is no time
for idle civilities i came hither because a
man is in trying occasions his own safest page
and i can remain no longer than to bid thee
fly good glover since warrants are to be
granted this day in council for the arrest thy
daughter and thee under charge heresy
and delay will cost you both your liberty for
certain and perhaps your lives
i have heard something such a matter
said the glover and was this instant setting
forth to kinfauns to plead my innocence 
this scandalous charge to ask your lordship's
counsel and to implore your protection
thy innocence friend simon will avail
thee but little before prejudiced judges my
advice is in one word to fly and wait for happier
times as for my protection we must tarry till
the tide turns ere it will in any sort avail thee
but if thou canst lie concealed for a few days
or weeks i have little doubt that the churchmen
who by siding with the duke albany
in court intrigue and by alleging the decay 
the purity catholic doctrine as the sole cause
 the present national misfortunes have at least
for the present hour an irresistible authority
over the king wil receive a check in the meanwhile
however know that king robert hath
not only given way to this general warrant for
inquisition after heresy but hath confirmed
the pope's nomination robert wardle to
be archbishop st andrews and primate 
scotland thus yielding to rome those freedoms
and immunities the scottish church which
his ancestors from the time malcolm canmore
have so boldly defended his brave fathers
would have rather subscribed a covenant
with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions rome
alas and what remedy 
none old man save in some sudden court
change said sir patrick the king is but like
a mirror which having no light itself reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed
near to it for the time now although the douglas
is banded with albany yet the earl is unfavourable
to the high claims those domineering
priests having quarrelled with them about the
exactions which his retinue hath raised on the
abbot arbroath he will come back again
with a high hand for report says the earl 
march hath fled before him when he returns
we shall have a changed world for his presence
will control albany especially as many nobles
and i myself as i tell you in confidence are
resolved to league with him to defend the general
right thy exile therefore will with his
return to our court thou hast but to seek thee
some temporary hiding place
for that my lord said the glover i
can be at no loss since i have just title to the
protection the high highland chief gilchrist
maclan chief the clan quhele
nay if thou canst take hold his mantle
thou needs no help any one else neither lowland
churchman nor layman finds a free course
 justice beyond the highland frontier
but then my child noble sir my catharine
 said the glover
let her go with thee man the grattan
cake will keep her white teeth in order the
goat's whey will make the blood spring to her
cheek again which these alarms have banished 
and even the fair maiden perth may sleep
soft enough on a bed highland grecian
it is not from such idle respects my lord
that i hesitate said the glover catharine
is the daughter a plain burgher and knows
not nicety food or lodging but the son 
maclan hath been for many years a guest in
my house and i am obliged to say that i have
observed him looking at my daughter who is
as good as a betrothed bride in a manner that
though i cared not for it in this lodging in curfew
street would give me some fear consequences
in a highland glen where i have no
friend and conachar many
the knightly provost replied by along whistle
 whew whew nay in that case i advise
thee to send her to the nunnery at elcho where
the abbess if i forget not is some relation 
yours indeed she said so herself adding that
she loved her kinswoman well together with all
that belongs to thee simon
truly my lord i do believe that the abbess
hath so much regard for me that she would
willingly receive the trust my daughter and
my whole goods and gear into her sisterhood 
marry her affection is something a tenacious
character and would be loath to unloose its
hold either upon the wench or her tocher

whew whew again whistled the knightly
provost by the thane's cross man
but this is an illfavoured pirn to wind yet
it shall never be said the fairest maid in the
fair city was cooped up in a convent like a
kainhen in a cave and she about to be married
to the bold burgess henry wynd that
tale shall not be told while i wear belt and
spurs and am called provost perth
but what remedy my lord asked the
glover
we must all take our share the risk
come get you and your daughter presently to
horse you shall ride with me and we'll see
who dare gloom at you the summons is not
yet served on thee and if they send an apparitor
to kinfauns without a warrant under the king's
own hand i make mine avow by the red rover's
soul that he shall eat his writ both
wax and wetherskin to horse to horse and
addressing catharine as she entered at the moment
 you too my pretty maid
to horse and fear not for your quarters 
they thrive in law that trust in charters
in a minute or two the father and daughter
were on horseback both keeping an arrow's
flight before the provost by his direction that
they might not seem to be the same company
they passed the eastern gate in some haste
and rode forward roundly until they were out
 sight sir patrick followed leisurely but
when he was lost to the view the warders
he sparred his mettled horse and soon came
up with the glover and catharine when a conversation
ensued which throws light upon some
previous passages this history
chapter iii
i have been devising a mode said the
wellmeaning provost by which i may make
you both secure for a week or two from the
malice your enemies when i have little doubt
i may see a changed world at court but that
i may the better judge what is to be done tell
me frankly simon the nature your connexion
with gilchrist maclan which leads you to
repose such implicit confidence in him you
are a close observer the rules the city and
are aware the severe penalties which they denounce
against such burghers as have covenant
alliance with the highland clans
true my lord but it is also known to
you that our craft working in skins cattle
stags and every other description hides have
a privilege and are allowed to transact with those
highlanders as with the men who can most
readily supply us with the means conducting
our trade to the great profit the burgh
thus it hath chanced me to have great dealings
with these men and i can take it on my
salvation that you nowhere find more just and
honourable trafficked or by whom a man may
more easily make an honest penny i have made
in my day several distant journeys into the far
highlands upon the faith their chiefs nor
did i ever meet with a people more true to their
word when you can once prevail upon them to
plight it in your behalf and as for the highland
chief gilchrist maclan saving that he is hasty
in homicide and fireraising towards those with
whom he hath deadly feud i have nowhere seen
a man who walketh a more just and upright
path
it is more than ever i heard before said
sir patrick charteris yet i have known
something the highland run agates too
they sliovv another favour and a very different
one to their friends than to their enemies
as your lordship shall understand said the
glover however be that as it may it chanced
me to serve gilchrist maclan in a high
matter it is now about eighteen years since
that it chanced the clan quhele and clan
chattan being at feud as indeed they are seldom
at peace the former sustained such a defeat
as wellnigh extirpated the family their
chief maclan seven his sons were slain in
battle and after it himself put to flight and his
castle taken and given to the flames his wife
then near the time giving birth to an infant
fled into the forest attended by one faithful servant
and his daughter here in sorrow and care
enough she gave birth to a boy and as the misery
 the mother's condition rendered her little
able to suckle the infant he was nursed with the
milk a doe which the forester who attended
her contrived to take alive in a snare it
was not many months afterwards that in a second
encounter these fierce clans maclan
defeated his enemies in his turn and regained
vol iii d
possession the district which he had lost it
was with unexpected rapture that he found his
wife and child were in existence having never
expected to see more them than the bleached
bones from which the wolves and wildcats had
eaten the flesh
but a strong and prevailing prejudice such
as is often entertained by these wild people
prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained
his only son in safety an ancient prophecy
was current among them that the power 
the tribe should fall by means a boy born under
a bush holly and suckled by a white doe
the circumstance unfortunately for the chief
tallied exactly with the birth the only child
which remained to him and it was demanded
 him by the elders the clan that the boy
should be either put to death or at least removed
from the dominions the tribe and brought
up in obscurity gilchrist mac ian was obliged to
consent and having made choice the latter
proposal the child under the name conachar
was brought up in my family with the purpose
as was at first intended concealing from him
all knowledge who or what he was or his
pretensions to authority over a numerous and
warlike people but as years rolled on the elders
 the tribe who had exerted so much authority
were removed by death ter rendered incapable
 interfering in the public affairs by age 
while on the other hand the influence gilchrist
maclan was increased by his successful
struggles against the clan chattan in which he
restored the equality betwixt the two contending
confederacies which had existed before the
calamitous defeat which i told your honour
feeling himself thus firmly seated he naturally
became desirous to bring home his only son
to his bosom and family and for that purpose
caused me to send the young conachar
as he was called more than once to the highlands
he was a youth expressly made by his
form and gallantry bearing to gain a father's
heart at length i suppose the lad either
guessed the secret his birth or something
 it was communicated to him and the disgust
which the haughty hieland varlet had always
shown for my honest trade became more 

fest so that i dared not so much as lay my
staff over bis costard for fear receiving a
stab with a dirk as an answer in gaelic to a
saxon remark it was then i wished to be well
rid him the rather that he showed so much
devotion to catharine who forsooth set herself
up to wash the ethiopian and teach a
wild husbandman mercy and morals she knows
herself how it ended
nay my father said catharine it was
surely but a point charity to snatch the brand
from the burning
but a small point wisdom said her father
 to risk the burning your own fingers
for such an what says my lord to the
matter 
my lord would not offend the fair maid 
perth said sir patrick and he knows well
the purity and truth her mind and yet i must
needs say that had this nursling the doe
been shrivelled haggard crossmade and repaired
like some highlanders i have known i
question if the fair maiden perth would
have bestowed so much zeal upon his converts

sioii and if catharine had been as aged wrinkled
and bent by years as the old woman that
opened the door to me this morning i would
wager my gold spurs against a pair highland
brogues that this wild roebuck would
never have listened to a second lecture you
laugh glover and catharine blushes a blush
 anger let it pass it is the way the
world
the way in which the men the world
esteem their neighbours my lord answered
catharine with some spirit
nay fair saint forgive a jest said the
knight and thou simon tell us how this
tale ended with conachar's escape to the
highlands i suppose 
 with his return thither said the glover
there was for some two or three years a fellow
about perth a sort messenger who came
and went under divers pretences but was in
fact the means communication between gilchrist
maclan and his son young conachar
or as he is now called hector from this gillie
i learned in general that the banishment
 the dault an neigh deil or foster child 
the white doe was again brought under consideration
 the tribe his foster father torquit
 the oak the old forester appeared with
eight sons the finest men the clan and demanded
that the doom banishment should be
revoked he spoke with the greater authority
as he was himself taishatar or a seer and
supposed to have communication with the invisible
world he affirmed that he had performed
a magical ceremony termed tinegan
by which he evoked a fiend from whom he extorted
a confession that conachar now called
eachin or hector maclan was the only man
in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without
blood or blemish hence torquil the oak
argued that the presence the fated person
was necessary to insure the victory so much
i am possessed this said the forester that
unless eachin fight in his place in the ranks 
the clan quhele neither i his fosterfather
nor any my eight sons will lift a weapon in
the quarrel
this speech was received with much alarm
for the defection nine men the stoutest their
tribe would be a serious blow more especially
if the combat as begins to be rumoured should be
decided by a small number from each side the
ancient superstition concerning the foster son 
the white doe was counterbalanced by a new
and later prejudice and the father took the opportunity
 presenting to the clan his longhidden
son whose youthful but handsome and
animated countenance haughty carriage and
active limbs excited the admiration the clansmen
who joyfully received him as the heir and
descendant their chief notwithstanding the
ominous presage attending his birth and nurture

from this tale my lord continued simon
glover your lordship may easily conceive
why i myself should be secure a good reception
among the clan quhele i and you may also
have reason to judge that it would be very rash
in me to carry catharine thither and this
noble lord is the heaviest my troubles
we shall lighten the load then said sir
patrick aod good glover i will take risk
for thee and this damsel my alliance with the
douglas gives me some interest with marjory
duchess rothsay his daughter the neglected
wife our wilful prince rely on it good
glover that in her retinue thy daughter will
be as secure as in a fenced castle the duchess
keeps house now at falkland a castle which
the duke albany to whom it belongs has
lent to her for her accommodation i cannot
promise you pleasure fair maiden for the
duchess marjory rothsay is unfortunate
and therefore splenetic haughty and overbearing
 conscious the want attractive qualities
therefore jealous those women who possess
them but she is firm in faith and noble
in spirit and would fling pope or prelate into
the ditch her castle who should come to arrest
any one under her protection you will
therefore have absolute safety though you may
lack comfort
i have no title to more said catharine and
deeply do i feel the kindness that is willing to
secure me such honourable protection if she
be haughty i will remember she is a douglas
and hath right to entertain as much pride as may
become a mortal if she be fretful i will recollect
that she is unfortunate and if she be unreasonably
captious i will not forget that she is
my protectress heed no longer for me my lord
when you have placed me under the noble lady's
charge but my poor father to be exposed
amongst these wild and dangerous people 
vhich was
regarded by the clan as a species palladium
only produced and used on the most solemn occasions
such as the present
the booshalloch somewhat discontented
muttered to simon as he took his place these
are changed days friend his father rest his
soul would have spoken to us both but these
are bad manners which he has learned among
you sassenachs in the low country
to this remark the glover did not think it
necessary to reply instead which he adverted
to the evergreens and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior 
the bower was decorated the most remarkable
part these ornaments was a number highland
shirts mail with steel bonnets battleaxes
and twohanded swords to match which
hung around the upper part the room together
with targets highly and richly embossed
each mail shirt was hung over a welldressed
stag's hide which at once displayed the armour
to advantage and saved it from suffering by
damp
these whispered the booshalloch are
the arms the chosen champions the clan
quhele they are twentynine in number as
you see eachin himself being the thirtieth who
wears his armour today else had there been
thirty and he has not got such a good hauberk
after all as he should wear on palm sunday
these nine suits harness such large
size are for the leichtach from whom so much
is expected
 and these goodly deerhides said simon
the spirit his profession awakening at the
sight the goods in which he traded think
you the chief will be disposed to chaffer for
them they are in demand for the doublets
which knights wear under their armour
did i not pray you said niel booshalloch
to say nothing on that subject
it is the mail shirts i speak said simon
 may i ask if any them were made
by our celebrated perth armourer called henry
 the wynd 
thou art more unlucky than before said
niel that man's name is to eachin's temper
like a whirlwind upon the lake yet no man
knows for what cause
i can guess thought our glover but gave
no utterance to the thought and having twice
lighted on unpleasant subjects conversation
he prepared to apply himself like those around
him to his food without starling another topic
we have said as much the preparations as
may lead the reader to conclude that the festival
in respect the quality the food was 
the most rude description consisting chiefly 
huge joints meat which were consumed with
little respect to the fasting season although
several the friars the island convent graced
and hallowed the board by their presence the
platters were wood and so were the hooped
rogues or cups out which the guests
quaffed their liquor as also the broth or juice
 the meat which was held a delicacy there
were also various preparations milk which
were highly esteemed and were eaten out 
similar vessels bread was the scarcest article
at the banquet but the glover and his patron
niel were served with two small loaves expressly
for their own use in eating as indeed was
then the case all over britain the guests used
their knives called scenes or the large poniards
named dirks without troubling themselves by
the reflection that they might occasionally have
served different or more fatal purposes
at the upper the table stood a vacant
seat elevated a step or two above the floor it
was covered with a canopy holly boughs and
ivy and there rested against it a sheathed sword
and a folded banner this had been the seat 
the deceased chieftain and was left vacant in
honour him eachin occupied a lower chair
on the right hand the place honour
the reader would be greatly mistaken who
should follow out this description by supposing
that the guests behaved like a herd hungry
wolves rushing upon a feast rarely offered to
them on the contrary the clan quhele conducted
themselves with that species courteous
reserve and attention to the wants others
which is often found in primitive nations especially
such as are always in arms because a
general observance the rules courtesy is
necessary to prevent quarrels bloodshed and
death the guests took the places assigned
them by torquil the oak who acting as
marischal taeh i e sewer the mess touched
with a white wand without speaking a
word the place where each was to sit thus
placed in order the company patiently waited
for the portion assigned them which was distributed
among them by the leichtach the bravest
men or more distinguished warriors the
tribe being accommodated with a double mess
emphatically called hieyfir or the portion 
a man when the sewers themselves had seen
every one served they resumed their places
at the festival and were each served with one
 these larger messes food water was placed
within each man's reach and a handful
 soft moss served the purposes a tablenapkin
so that as at an eastern banquet the hands
were washed as often as the mess was changed
for amusement the bard recited the praises
 the deceased chief and expressed the clan's
confidence in the blossoming virtues his
successor the seanachie recited the genealogy
 the tribe which they traced to the race
the dalriads the harpers played within while
the warpipes cheered the multitude without
the conversation among the guests was grave
subdued and civil no jest was attempted beyond
the bounds a very gentle pleasantry
calculated only to excite a passing smile there
were no raised voices no contentious arguments
and simon glover had heard a hundred times
more noise at a guildfeast than was made on
this occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers

even the liquor itself did not seem to raise
the festive party above the same tone decorous
gravity it was various kinds wine
appeared in very small quantities and was served
out only to the principal guests among
which honoured number simon glover was
again included the wine and the two wheaten
loaves were indeed the only marks notice
which he received during the feast but niel
booshalloch jealous his master's reputation
for hospitality failed not to enlarge on them as
proofs high distinction distilled liquors
since so generally used in the highlands were
then comparatively unknown the usquebaugh
ill
was circulated in small quantities and was
highly flavoured with a decoction saffron and
other hers so as to resemble a medicinal potion
rather than a festive cordial cider and
mead were seen at the entertainment but ale
brewed in great quantities for the purpose and
flowing round without restriction was the liquor
generally used and that was drunk with a
moderation much less known among the more
modern highlanders a cup to the memory 
the deceased chieftain was the first pledge solemnly
proclaimed after the banquet was finished
 and a low murmur benedictions was
heard from the company while the monks
alone uplifting their united voices sung requiem
eternal dona an unusual silence followed
as if something extraordinary was expected
when eachin arose with a bold and manly yet
modest grace and ascended the vacant seat or
throne saying with dignity and firmness 
this seat and my father's inheritance i
claim as my right so prosper me god and st
barr 
how will you rule your father's children 
said an old man the uncle the deceased
i will defend them with my father's sword
and distribute justice to them under my father's
banner
the old man with a trembling hand unsheathed
the ponderous weapon and holding
it by the blade offered the hilt to the young
chieftain's grasp at the same time torquil 
the oak unfurled the pennon the tribe and
swung it repeatedly over eachin's head who
with singular grace and dexterity brandished
the huge claymore as in its defence the guests
raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance
 the patriarchal chief who claimed their
allegiance nor was there any who in the graceful
and agile youth before them was disposed
to recollect the subject sinister vaticinations
as he stood in glittering mail resting on the
long sword and acknowledging by gracious
gestures the acclamations which rent the air
within without and around simon glover
was tempted to doubt whether this majestic
figure was that the same lad whom he had
often treated with little ceremony and began
to have some apprehension the consequences
 having done so a general burst minstrelsy
succeeded to the acclamations and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes as lately to
shout and yell woe
it would be tedious to pursue the progress 
the inaugural feast or detail the pledges that
were quaffed to former heroes the clan and
above all to the twentynine brave gallowglas
ses who were to fight in the approaching conflict
under the eye and leading their young
chief the bards assuming in old times the
prophetic character combined with their own
ventured to assure them the most distinguished
victory and to predict the fury with
which the blue falcon the emblem the clan
quhele should rend to pieces the mountaincat
the wellknown badge the clan chattan
it was approaching sunset when a bowl called
the gracecup made oak hooped with
silver was handed round the table as the signal
 dispersion although it was left free to
any who chose a longer carouse to retreat to
vol iii h
any the outer bothies as for simon glover
the booshalloch conducted him to a small hut
contrived it would seem for the use a single
individual where a bed heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit
and an ample supply such delicacies as the
late feast afforded showed that all care had
been taken for the inhabitant's accommodation

do not leave this hut said the booshal
loch taking leave his friend and protege
this is your place rest but apartments are
lost on such a night confusion and if the badger
leaves his hole the tod will creep into it
to simon glover this arrangement was by
no means disagreeable he had been wearied
by the noise the day and felt desirous repose
after eating therefore a morsel which
his appetite scarce required and drinking a cup
 wine to expel the cold he muttered his
evening prayer wrapt himself in his cloak and
lay down on a couch which old acquaintance
toil scoitice for fox
had made familiar and easy to him the hum
and murmur and even the occasional shouts 
some the festive multitude who continued
revelling without did not long interrupt his repose
 and in about ten minutes he was as fast
asleep as if he had lain in his own bed in curfew
street
chapter 
colonies still harping on my daughter
hamlet
two hours before the blackcock crew simon
glover was wakened by a wellknown
voice which called him by name
what conachar he replied as he started
from sleep is the morning so far advanced
and raising his eyes the person whom
he was dreaming stood before him and at the
same moment the events yesterday rushing
on his recollection he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned
it and it was not the mailclad highland chief
with claymore in hand as he had seen him the
preceding night but conachar curfew street
in his humble apprentice's garb holding in his
hand a switch oak an apparition would not
more have surprised our perth burgher ashe
gazed with wonder the youth turned upon
him a piece lighted bogwood which he carried
in a lantern and to his waking exclamation
replied 
essen so father simon it is conachar
come to renew our old acquaintance when our
intercourse will attract least notice
so saying he sat down on a tressel which
answered the purpose a chair and placing
the lantern beside him proceeded in the most
friendly tone
i have tasted thy good cheer many a
day father simon i trust thou hast found no
lack in my family 
none whatever eacbin maclan answered
the glover for the simplicity the celtic
language and manners rejects all honorary
titles it was even too good for this fasting
season and much too good for me since i must
be ashamed to think how hard you fared in
curfew street
even too good to use your own word
said conachar for the deserts an idle apprentice
and for the wants a young highlander
but yesterday if there was as i trust
enough food found you not good glover
some lack courteous welcome excuse it not
i know you did so but i am young in authority
with my people and i must not too early
draw their attention to the period my residence
in the lowlands which however i can
never forget
i understand the cause entirely said simon
 and therefore it is unwillingly and as
it were by force that i have made so early
a visit hither
hush father hush it is well you are
come to see some my highland splendour
while it yet sparkles return after palm sunday
and who knows whom or what you may
find in the territories we now possess the
wildcat may have made his lodge where the
banquetting bower mac ian now stands
the young chief was silent and pressed the
top the rod to his lips as if to guard against
uttering more
there is no fear that eachin said simon
in that vague way in which lukewarm
comforters endeavour to turn the reflection 
their friends from the consideration inevitable
danger
there is fear and there is peril utter
ruin answered eachin and there is positive
certainty great loss i marvel my father
consented to this wily proposal albany i
would mac gillie chattachan would take with
me and then instead wasting our best blood
against each other we would go down together
to stratford and kill and take possession i
would rule at perth and he at dundee and all
the great strath should be our own to the
banks the faith tay such is the policy
i have caught from your old grey head father
simon when holding a trencher at thy back
and listening to thy evening talk with bailie
craigdallie
the tongue is well called an unruly member
thought the glover here have i been
holding a candle to the devil to show him the
way to mischief
but he only said aloud these plans come
too late
too late indeed answered eachin the
indentures battle are signed by our marks
and seals the burning hate the clan quhele
and clan chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable
flame by mutual insults and boasts
yes the time is passed by but to thine own
affairs father glover it is religion that has
brought thee hither as i learn from niel booshallow
surely my experience thy prudence
did not lead me to suspect thee any quarrel
with mother church as for my old acquaintance
father clement he is one those who
hunt after the crown martyrdom and think
a stake surrounded with blazing faggots better
worth embracing than a willing bride he is a
very knighterrant in defence his religious
notions and does battle wherever he comes he
hath already a quarrel with the monks sibyl's
isle yonder about some point doctrine
hast seen him 
i have answered simon but we spoke
little together the time being pressing
 he may have said that there is a third person
 one more likely i think to be a true fugitive
for religion than either you a shrewd citizen
or he a wrangling preacher who would
be right heartily welcome to share our protection
 thou art dull man and wilt not guess
my meaning thy daughter catharine 
these last words the young chief spoke in
english and he continued the conversation in
that language as if apprehensive being overheard
 and indeed as if under the sense some
involuntary hesitation
my daughter catharine said the glover
remembering what the carthusian had told him
is well and safe
but where or with whom said the young
chief and wherefore came she not with
you think you the clan quhele have no
callimachus as active as old dorothy whose hand
has warmed my habits before now to wait upon
the daughter their chieftains master 
again i thank you said the glover and
doubt neither your power nor your will to protect
my daughter as well as myself but an
honourable lady the friend sir patrick charters
hath offered her a safe place refuge
without the risk a toilsome journey through
a desolate and distracted country
oh ay sir patrick charteris said eachin
in a more reserved and distant tone he
must be preferred to all men without doubt he
is your friend i think 
simon glover longed to punish this affectation
 a boy who had been scolded four times
aday for running into the street to see sir patrick
charteris ride past but he checked his
spirit repartee and simply said 
 sir patrick charteris has been provost 
perth for seven years and it is likely is so
still since the magistrates are elected not in
lent but at st martinmas
ah father glover said the youth in his
kinder and more familiar mode address
 you are so used to see the sumptuous shows
and pageants perth that you would but little
relish our barbarous festival in comparison
what didst thou think our ceremonial yesterday

it was noble and touching said the glover
 and to me who knew your father most
especially so when you rested on the sword
and looked around you methought i saw mine
old friend gilchrist mac ian arisen from the
dead and renewed in years and in strength
i played my part there boldly i trust and
showed little that paltry apprentice boy
whom you used to use just as he deserved
eachin resembles conachar said the glover
 no more than a salmon resembles a par
though men say they are the same fish in a
different state or than a butterfly resembles
a grub
thickest thou that while i was taking upon
me the power which all women love i would
have been myself an object for a maiden's eye
to rest upon to speak plain what would catharine
have thought me in the ceremonial 
we approach the shallows now thought simon
glover and without nice pilotage we
drive right on shore
most women like show eachin but i
think my daughter catharine be an exception
she would rejoice in the good fortune her
household friend and playmate but she would
not value the splendid maclan captain clan
quhele more than the orphan conachar
she is ever generous and disinterested
replied the young chief but yourself father
have seen the world for many more years
than she has done and can better form a judgment
what power and wealth do for those who
enjoy them think and speak sincerely what
would be your own thoughts if you saw your
catharine standing under yonder canopy with
the command over an hundred hills and the
devoted obedience ten thousand vassals and
as the price these advantages her hand in
that the man who loves her the best in the
world
meaning in your own conachar said
simon
ay conachar call me i love the name
since it was by that i have been known to catharine

sincerely then said the glover endeavouring
to give the least offensive turn to his
reply my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that catharine and i were safe in
our humble booth in curfew street with dorothy
for our only vassal
and with poor conachar also i trust 
you would not leave him to pine away in solitary
grandeur 
i would not answered the glover wish
so ill to the clan quhele mine ancient friends
as to deprive them at a moment emergency
 a brave young chief and that chief the
fame which he is about to acquire at their head
in the approaching conflict
eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated
feelings as he replied words words 
empty words father simon you fear the
clan quhele more than you love them and
you suppose their indignation would be formidable
should their chief marry the daughter
 a burgess perth
and if i do fear such an issue hector
maclan have i not reason how have illassorted
marriages had issue in the house macaw
in that the powerful maclean nay
 the lords the isles themselves what
has ever come them but divorce and exhortation
 sometimes worse fate to the ambitious
intruder you could not marry my child
before a priest and you could only wed her with
your left hand and i he checked the strain
 impetuosity which the subject inspired and
concluded and i am an honest though
humble burgher perth who would rather
my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse
 a citizen in my own rank than the licensed
concubine a monarch
i will wed catharine before the priest and
before the world before the altar and before
the black stones long said the impetuous
young man she is the love my youth and
there is not a tie in religion or honour but i
will bind myself by them i have sounded my
people if we do but win this combatant with
the hope gaining catharine we shall win it
my heart tells me so i shall be so much lord
over their affections that were i to take a bride
from the almshouse so it was my pleasure
they would hail her as if she were a daughter
 maccallanmore but you reject my suit 
said eachin sternly
you put words offence in my mouth
said the old man and may next punish me
for them since i am wholly in your power but
with my consent my daughter shall never wed
save in her own degree her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes 
bloodshed which connect themselves with your
lot if you really love her and recollect her
dread strife and combat you would not wish
her to be subjected to the train military horrors
in which you like your father must needs
be inevitably and eternally engaged choose a
bride amongst the daughters the mountain
chiefs my son or fiery lowland nobles you
are fair young rich highborn and powerful
and will not woo in vain you will readily find
one who will rejoice in your conquests and
cheer you under defeat to catharine the one
would be as frightful as the other a warrior
must wear a steel gauntlet a glove kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour
a dark cloud passed over the face the
young chief lately animated with so much
fire
farewell he said the only hope which
could have lighted me to fame or victory 
he remained for a space silent and intensely
thoughtful with downcast eyes a lowering
brow and folded arms at length he raised
his hands and said father for such you
have been to me i am about to tell you a secret
reason and pride both advise me to be
silent but fate urges me and must be obeyed
i am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man
but beware this conference how it will
beware how you ever breathe a syllable 
what i am now to trust to you for know
that were you to do so in the most remote corner
 scotland i have ears to hear it even
there and a hand and poniard to reach a traitor's
bosom i am but the word will not out 
do not speak it then said the prudent
glover a secret is no longer safe when it
crosses the lips him who owiis it and i desire
not a confidence so dangerous as you menace
me with
ay but i must speak and you must hear
said the youth in this age battle father
you have yourself been a combatant 
once only replied simon when the
southron assaulted the fair city i was summoned
to take my part in the defence as my
tenure required like that other craftsmen
who are bound to keep watch and ward
and how felt you upon that matter inquired
the young chief
what can that import to the present business
 said simon in some surprise
much else had i not asked the question
answered eachin in the tone haughtiness
which from time to time he assumed
 an old man is easily brought to speak 
olden times said simon not unwilling on an
vol iii i
instant's reflection to lead the conversation
away from the subject his daughter and
i must needs confess my feelings were much
short the high cheerful confidence nay the
pleasure with which i have seen other men goto
battle my life and profession were peaceful
and though i have not wanted the spirit 
a man when the time demanded it yet i have
seldom slept worse than the night before that
onslaught my ideas were harrowed by the
tales we were told nothing short the truth
about the saxon archers how they drew shafts
 a clothyard length and used bows a third
longer than ours when i fell into a broken
slumber if but a straw in the mattress pricked
my side i started and waked thinking an
english arrow was quivering in my body in
the morning as i began for very weariness to
sink into some repose i was waked by the tolling
 the common bell which called us burghers
to the walls i never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since
go on what further chanced demanded
eachin
i did on my harness said simon such as
it was took my mothers blessing a highspirited
woman who spoke my father's actions
for the honour the fair town this heartened
me and i felt still bolder tvhen i found myself
ranked among the other crafts all bowmen
for thou knowest the perth citizens have good
skill in archery we were dispersed on the walls
several knights and squires in armour proof
being mingled amongst us who kept a bold
countenance confident perhaps in their harness
and informed us for our encouragement that
they would cut down with their swords and
axes any those who should attempt to quit
their post i was kindly assured this myself
by the old kempe kinfauns as he was called
this good sir patrick's father then our provost
he was a grandson the red rover
tom montreville and a likely man to keep
his word which he addressed to me in especial
because a night much discomfort may have
made me look paler than usual and besides i
was but a lad
and did his exhortation add to your fear
or your resolution said eachin who seemed
very attentive
to my resolution answered simon for
i think nothing can make a man so bold to face
one danger at some distance in his front as
the knowledge another close behind him
to push him forward well i mounted the
walls in tolerable heart and was placed with
others on the spey tower being accounted a
good bowman but a very cold fit seized me as
i saw the english in great order with their
archers in front and their menatarms behind
marching forward to the attack in strong columns
three in number they came on steadily
and some us would fain have shot at
them but it was strictly forbidden and we were
obliged to remain motionless sheltering ourselves
behind the battlement as we best might
as the southron formed their long ranks into
lines each man occupying his place as by magic
and preparing to cover themselves by large
shields called passes which they planted before
them i again felt a strange breathlessness
and some desire to go home for a glass distilled
waters but as i looked aside i saw the
worthy kempe kinfauns bending a large crossbow
and i thought it pity he should waste the
bolt on a truehearted scotsman when so many
english were in presence so i e'en staid where
i was being in a comfortable angle formed by
two battlements the english then strode forward
and drew their bowstrings not to the
breast as your highland kerne do but to the
ear and sent off their volleys swallowtails
before we could call on st andrew i winked
when i saw them haul up their tackle and i
believe i started as the shafts began to rattle
against the parapet but looking round me and
seeing none hurt but john squalls the towncrier
whose jaws were pierced through with
a clothyard shaft i took heart grace and
shot in my turn with good will and good aim
a little man i shot at who had just popped out
from behind his target dropt with a shaft
through his shoulder the provost cried 
well stitched simon glover saint john
for his own town my fellow craftsmen 
shouted i though i was then but an apparent
the honour our guild and if you
will believe me in the rest the skirmish which
was ended by the foes drawing off i drew bowstring
and loosed shaft as calmly as if i had
been shooting at butts instead men's breasts
i gained some credit and i have ever afterwards
thought that in case necessity for with me
it had never been matter choice i should not
have lost it again and this is all i can tell 
warlike experience in battle other dangers i
have had which i have endeavoured to avoid
like a wise man or when they were inevitable
i have faced them like a true one upon other
terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
scotland
i understand your tale said eachin but
i shall find it difficult to make you credit mine
knowing the race which i am descended and
especially him whom we have this day laid in
the tomb well that he lies where he will never
learn what you are now to hear look my father
 the light which i bear grows short and
pale a few minutes will extinguish it but before
it expires the hideous tale will be told 
father i am a coward it h said at last
and the secret my disgrace is in keeping 
another 
the young man sunk back in a species syncope
produced by the agony his mind as he
made the fatal communication the glover
moved as well by fear as by compassion applied
himself to recall him to life and succeeded in
doing so but not in restoring him to composure
he hid his face with his hands and his tears
flowed plentifully and bitterly
for our lady's sake be composed said
the old man and recall the vile word i know
you better than yourself you are no coward
but only too young and inexperienced ay and
somewhat too quick fancy to have the steady
valour a bearded man i would hear no
other man say that you conachar without
gidng him the lie you are no coward i have
seen high sparks spirit fly from you even on
slight enough provocation
high sparks pride and passion said the
unfortunate youth but when saw you them
supported by the resolution that should have
backed them the sparks you speak fell on
my dastardly heart as on a piece ice which
could catch fire from nothing if ray offended
pride urged me to strike my weakness mind
prompted me the next moment to fly
want habit said simon it is by
clambering over walls that youths learn to scale
precipices begin with slight feuds exercise
daily the arms your country in tourney with
your followers
and what leisure is there for this exclaimed
the young chief starting as if something
horrid had occurred to his imagination
how many days are there betwixt this hour
and palm sunday and what is to chance then 
a list inclosed from which no man can stir
more than the poor bear who is chained to his
stake sixty living men the best and fiercest
one alone excepted which albyn can send
down from her mountains all athirst for each
other's blood while a king and his nobles and
shouting thousands besides attend as at a theatre
to encourage their demoniac fury blows
clang and blood flows thicker faster redder 
they rush on each other like madmen they tear
each other like wild hearts the wounded are
trodden to death amid the feet their companions
 blood ebbs arms become weak but
there must be no parley no truce no interruption
while any the maimed wretches remain
alive here is no crouching behind battlements
no fighting with missile weapons all is hand
to hand till hands can no longer be raised to
maintain the ghastly conflict if such a field
is so horrible in idea what think you it will be
in reality 
the glover remained silent
i say again what think you 
i can only pity you conachar said simon
 it is hard to be the descendant a lofty
line the son a noble father the leader by
birth a gallant array and yet to want or
think you want for still i trust the fault lies
much in a quick fancy that overestimates danger
to want that dogged quality which is possessed
by every gamecock that is worth a handful
 corn every hound that is worth a mess
 offal but how chanced it that with such a
consciousness inability to fight in this battle
you proffered even now to share your chief dom
with my daughter your power must depend on
your fighting this combat and in that catharine
cannot help you
you mistake old man replied eachin 
were catharine to look kindly on the earnest
love i bear her it would carry me against the
front the enemies with the mettle a warhorse
overwhelming as my sense weakness
is the feeling that catharine looked on would
give me strength say yet oh say yet she
shall be mine if we gain the combat and not
the gow chrom himself whose heart is a
piece with his anvil ever went to battle so light
as i shall do one strong passion is conquered
by another
this is folly conachar cannot the recollections
 your interest your honour your
kindled do as much to stii your courage as
the thoughts a brent browed lass fie upon
you man 
you tell me but what i have told myself 
but it is in vain replied eachin with a sigh
it is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous
be it from constitution be it as our highland
callimachus will say front the milk the
white doe be it from my peaceful education
and the experience your strict restraint be
it as you think from an overheated fancy
which paints danger yet more dangerous and
ghastly than it is in reality i cannot tell but
i know my failing and yes it must be said 
so sorely dread that i cannot conquer it that
could i have your consent to my wishes on such
terms i would caen here make a pause renounce
the rank i have assumed and retire into
humble life
what turn glover at last conachar said
simon this beats the legend st crispin
nay nay your hand was not framed for that 
you shall spoil me no more doeskins
jest not said eachin i am serious
if i cannot labour i will bring wealth enough
to live without it they will proclaim me recreant
with horn and warpipe let them do
so catharine will love me the better that i
have preferred the paths peace to those 
bloodshed and father clement shall teach us
to pity and forgive the world which will load
us with reproaches that wound not i shall
be the happiest men catharine will enjoy
all that unbounded affection can confer upon
her and will be freed from apprehension 
the sights and sounds horror which your
illassorted match would have prepared for her 
and you father glover shall occupy your
chimneycorner the happiest and most honoured
man that ever 
hold eachin i pr'ythee hold said the
glover the fir light with which this discourse
must terminate burns very low and i
would speak a word in my turn and plain dealing
is best though it may vex or perhaps enrage
you let me these visions by saying at
once catharine can never be yours a glove
is the emblem faith and a man my craft
should therefore less than any other break his
own catharine's hand is promised promised
to a man whom you may hate but whom you
must honour to henry the armourer the
match is fitting by degree agreeable to their
mutual wishes and i have given my promise
it is best to be plain at once resent my refusal
as you will i am wholly in your power but
nothing shall make me break my word
the glover spoke thus decidedly because he
was aware from experience that the very irritable
disposition his former apprentice yielded
in most cases to stern and decided resolution
yet recollecting where he was it was
with some feelings fear that he saw the dying
flame leap up and spread a flash light
on the visage eachin which seemed pale
as the grave while his eye rolled like that 
a maniac in his fever fit the light instantly
sunk down and died and simon felt a momentary
terror lest he should have to dispute
for his life with the youth whom he knew to
be capable violent actions when highly excited
however short a period his nature could
support the measures which his passion commenced
he was relieved by the voice eachin
who muttered in a hoarse and altered
tone 
let what we have spoken this night rest
in silence for ever if thou hring'st it to light
thou wert better dig thine own grave
thus speaking the door the hut opened
admitting a gleam moonshine the form 
the retiring chief crossed it for an instant the
hurdle door was then closed and the hut left
in darkness
simon glover felt relieved when a conversation
fraught with offence and danger was
thus peaceably terminated but he remained
deeply affected by the condition hector marian
whom he had himself bred up
the poor child said he to be called upto
a place eminence only to be hurled from
it with contempt what he told me i partly
knew having often remarked that conachar
was more prone to quarrel than to fight but
this overpowering faintheartiness which neither
shame nor necessity can overcome i
though no sir william wallace cannot conceive
and to propose himself for a husband to
my daughter as if a bride were to find courage
for herself and the bridegroom no no catharine
must wed a man to whom she may say
 husband spare your enejny not one in
whose behalf she must cry generous enemy
spare my husband 
tired out with these reflections the old man
at length fell asleep in the morning he was
awakened by his friend the booshalloch who
with something a blank visage proposed to
him to return to his abode on the meadow at
the ballough that is the discharge the lake
into the river he apologized that the chief
could not see simon glover that morning being
busied with things about the expected combat
 and that eachin maclan thought the residence
at the ballough would be safest for simon
glover's health and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection
and accommodation
niel booshalloch dilated on these circumstances
to gloss over the neglect implied in the
chief's dismissing bis visitor without a particular
audience
his father knew better said the herdsman
 but where should he have learned
manners poor thing and bred up among your
perth burghers who excepting yourself neighbour
glover who speak gaelic as well as i do
are a race incapable civility 
simon glover it may be well believed felt
none the want respect which his friend
resented on his account on the contrary he
greatly preferred the quiet residence the
good herdsman to the tumultuous hospitality
 the daily festival the chief even if there
had not just passed an interview with eachin
upon a subject which it would be most painful
to revive
to the ballough therefore he quietly retreated
where could he have been secure catharine's
safety his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough his amusement was sailing on the
lake in a little skiff which a highland boy managed
while the old man angled he frequently

ly landed on the little island where be mused
over the tomb his old friend gilchrist marian
and made friends with the monks presenting
the prior with gloves martin's fur and
the superior officers with each them a pair
made from the skin the wildcat the cutting
and stitching these little presents served
to beguile the time after sunset while the
family the herdsman crowded around admiring
his address and listening to the tales
and songs vith which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening
it must be confessed that the cautious glover
avoided the conversation father clement
whom he erroneously considered as rather the
author his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer
 them i will not he thought to please his
fancies lose the good will these kind monks
which may be one day useful to me i have
suffered enough by his preachments already i
trow little the wiser and much the poorer
have they made me no no catharine and
clement may think as they will but i will take
the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated
vol iii k
hound at the call his master submit to a
plentiful course haircloth and whipcord
disburse a lusty mulct and become whole with
the church again
more than a fortnight had passed since the
glover had arrived at ballough and he began
to wonder that he had not heard news catharine
or henry wynd to whom he concluded
the provost had communicated the plan
and place his retreat he knew the stout
smith dared not come up into the clan quhele
country on account various feuds with the
inhabitants and with each in himself while
bearing the name conachar but yet the
glover thought henry might have found means
to send him a message or a token by some one
 the various couriers who passed and repassed
between the court and the headquarters the
clan quhele in order to concert the terms 
the impending combat the march the parties
to perth and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment it was now the middle 
march and the fatal palm sunday was fast approaching

whilst time was thus creeping on the exiled
glover had not even once set eyes upon his
former apprentice the care that was taken
to attend to his wants and convenience in every
respect showed that he was not forgotten but
yet when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing
through the woods he usually made it a point
to choose his walk in a different direction one
morning however he found himself unexpectedly
in eachin's close neighbourhood with
scarce leisure to avoid him and thus it happened

as simon strolled pensively through a little
sylvan glade surrounded on either side with
tall forest trees mixed with underwood a white
doe broke from the thicket closely pursued by
two deer greyhounds one which griped her
haunch the other her throat and pulled her
down within half a furlong the glover who
was something startled at the suddenness the
incident the near and piercing blast a
horn and the baying a slowhound made
simon aware that the hunters were close behind
and on the trace the deer hallooing
and the sound men running through the copse
were heard close at hand a moment's recollection
would have satisfied simon that his best
way was to stand fast or retire slowly and
leave it to eachin to acknowledge his presence
or not as he should see cause but his desire
 shunning the young man had grown into a
kind instinct and in the alarm finding
him so near simon hid himself in a bush 
hazels mixed with holly which altogether concealed
him he had hardly done so ere eachin
rosy with exercise dashed from the thicket into
the open glade accompanied by his fosterfather
torquil the oak the latter with equal
strength and address turned the struggling
hind on her back and holding her fore feet in
his right hand while he knelt on her body offered
his skene with the left to the young
chief that he might cut the animal's throat
it may not be torquil do thine office and
take the assay thyself i must not kill the
likeness my fostermother
this was spoken with a melancholy smile
while a tear at the same time stood in the
speaker's eye torquil stared at his young
chief for an instant then drew his sharp woodknife
across the creature's throat with a cut
so swift and steady that the weapon reached
the back bone then rising on his feet and
again fixing a long piercing look on his chief
he said as much as i have done to that
hind would i do to any living man whose ears
could have heard my fault fosterson so much
as name a white doe and couple the word with
hector's name 
if simon had no reason before to keep himself
concealed this speech torquil furnished
him with a pressing one
it cannot be concealed father torquil
said eachin it will all out to the broad day
what will out what will to broad day 
asked torquil in surprise
it is the fatal secret thought simon and
now if this huge privy councillor cannot keep
silence i shall be made answerable i suppose
for eachin's disgrace having been blown
abroad
thinking thus anxiously he availed himself
at the same time his position to see as much
as he could what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confident impelled by that
spirit curiosity which prompts us in the most
momentous as well as the most trivial occasions
 life and which is sometimes found to
subsist in company with great personal fear
as torquil listened to what eachin communicated
the young man sank into his arms and
supporting himself on his shoulder concluded
his confession by a whisper into his ear torquit
seemed to listen with such amazement as
to make him incapable crediting his ears
as if to be certain that it was eachin who
spoke he gradually roused the youth from his
reclining posture and holding him up in some
measure by a grasp on bis shoulder fixed on
him an eye that seemed enlarged and at the
same time turned to stone by the marvels he
listened to and so wild waxed the old man's
visage after he had heard the murmured communication
that simon glover apprehended he
would cast the youth from him as a dishonoured
thug ill which case he might have lighted
on the very copse in which he lay concealed
and occasioned his discovery in a manner equally
painful and dangerous but the passions 
torquil who entertained for his fosterchild
even a double portion that passionate fondness
which always attends that connexion in
the highlands took a different turn
i believe it not he exclaimed it is
false thy father's child false thy mother's
son falsest my fault i offer my gage to
heaven and hell and will maintain the combat
with him that shall call it true thou hast been
spellbound by an evil eye my darling and
the fainting which you call cowardice is the
work magic i remember the bat that struck
the torch out on the hour that thou wert born
that hour grief and joy cheer up my
beloved thou shalt with me to zona and the
good st columbus with the whole choir 
blessed saints and angels who ever favoured
thy race shall take from thee the heart the
white doe and return that which they have
stolen from thee
eachin listened with a look as if he would
fain have believed the words the comforter
but torquil he said supposing this
might avail us the fatal day approaches and
if i go to the lists i dread me we shall be
shamed
it cannot be it shall not said torquil
hell shall not prevail so far we will steep
thy sword in holy water place vervain st
john'swort and rowantree in thy crest we
will surround thee i and thy eight brethren 
thou shalt be safe as in a castle
again the youth helplessly muttered something
which from the dejected tone in which
it was spoken simon could not understand
while torquil's deep tones in reply fell full and
distinct upon his ear
yes there may be a chance withdrawing
thee from the conflict thou art the youngest
who is to draw blade now hear me and
thou shalt know what it is to have a fosterfather's
love and how far it exceeds the love even
 kind the youngest on the indenture the
clan chattan is ferquhard day his father
slew mine and the red blood is seething hot
between us i looked to palm sunday as the
term that should cool it but mark thou
would'st have thought that the blood in the
veins this ferquhard day and in mine would
not have mingled had they been put into the
same vessel yet hath he cast the eyes his love
upon my only daughter eva the fairest our
maidens think with what feelings i heard the
news it was as if a wolf from the skirts 
arragon had said give me thy child in wedlock
torquil my child thought not thus she
loves ferquhard and weeps away her colour
and strength in dread the approaching battle
let her give him but a sign favour and well
i know he will forget kith and kin forsake the
field and fly with her to the desert
he the youngest the champions clan
chattan being absent i the youngest the
clan quhele may be excused from combat
said eachiu blushing at the mean chance 
safety thus opened to him
see now my chief said torquil and
judge my thoughts towards thee others might
give thee their own lives and that their sons
i sacrifice to thee the honour my house
my friend my father repeated the chief
folding torquil to his bosom what a base
wretch am i that have a spirit dastardly enough
to avail myself your sacrifice 
t speak not that green woods have ears
let us back to the camp and send our gillies
for the venison back dogs and follow at
heel
the slowhound or lymedog luckily for simon
had drenched his nose in the blood the
deer else he might have found the glover's lair
in the thicket but its more acute properties 
scent being lost it followed tranquilly with the
gazehounds
when the hunters were out sight and hearing
the glover arose greatly relieved by their
departure and began to move off in the opposite
direction as fast as his age permitted his
first reflection was on the fidelity the fosterfather

the wild mountain heart is faithful and
true yonder man is more like the giants in
romaunt than a man mould like ourselves
and yet christians might take an example from
him for his lealt a simple contrivance this
though to finger a man off their enemies chequer
as if there would not be twenty the
wildcats ready to supply his place
thus thought the glover not aware that the
strictest proclamations were issued prohibiting
any the two contending clans their friends
allies and dependents from coming within fifty
miles perth during a week before and a
week after the combat which regulation was to
be enforced by armed men
so soon as our friend simon arrived at the
habitation the herdsman he found other news
awaiting him they were brought by father
clement who came in a pilgrim's cloak or
dalmatic ready to commence his return to the
southwards and desirous to take leave his
companion in exue or to accept him as a travelling
companion
but what said the citizen has so suddenly
induced you to return within the reach
 danger 
have you not heard said father clement
that march and his english allies having retired
into england before the earl douglas
the good earl has applied himself to redress the
evils the commonwealth and hath written to
the court letters desiring that the warrant for
the high court commission against heresy be
withdrawn as a trouble to men's consciences 
that the nomination robert de wardle to be
prelate st andrews be referred to the parliament
with sundry other things pleasing to
the commons now most the nobles that
are with the king at perth and with them sir
patrick charteris your worthy provost have
declared for the proposals the douglas the
duke albany hath agreed to them whether
from goodwill or policy i know not the good
king is easily persuaded to mild and gentle
courses and thus are the jawteeth the oppressors
dashed to pieces in their sockets and
the prey snatched from their ravening talons
will you with me to the lowlands or do you
abide here a little space 
niel booshalloch saved bis friend the trouble
 reply
he bad the cheers authority he said
for saying that simon glover should abide
until the champions went down to the battle
in this answer the citizen saw something not
quite consistent with his own perfect freedom 
volition but he cared little for it at the time
as it furnished a good apology for not travelling
along with the clergyman
an exemplary man he said to his friend
niel booshalloch as soon as father clement
had taken leave a great scholar and a great
saint it is a pity almost he is not in danger
to be burned as his sermon at the stake would
convert thousands o niel booshalloch father
clement's pile would be a sweet savouring
sacrifice and a beacon to all devout christians
but what would the burning a barrel ignorant
burgess like me serve men offer not up
old glove leather for incense nor are beacons
fed with undressed hides i trow sooth to
speak i have too little learning and too much
fear to get credit by the affair and therefore
i should in our homely phrase have both the
scathe and the scorn
true for you answered the herdsman
chapter vii
we must return to the characters our dramatic
narrative whom we left at perth when
we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
to kinfauns and from that hospitable mansion
traced the course simon to loch tay 
and the prince as the highest personage claims
our immediate attention this rash and inconsiderate
young man endured with some impatience
his sequestered residence with the lord
high constable with whose company otherwise
in every respect satisfactory he became
dissatisfied from no other reason than that he
held in some degree the character his warvigo

der incensed against his uncle and displeased
with his father he longed not unnaturally for
the society sir john ramorny on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself
for amusement and though he would have resented
the imputation as an insult for guidance
and direction he therefore sent him a summons
to attend him providing his health permitted
and directed him to come by water to
a little pavilion in the high constable's garden
which like that sir john's own lodgings
ran down to the tay in renewing an intimacy
so dangerous rothsay only remembered
that he had been sir john ramorny's munificent
friend while sir john on receiving the
imitation only recollected on his part the
capricious insults he had sustained from his patron
the loss his hand and the lightness
with which he had treated the subject and the
readiness with which rothsay had abandoned
his cause in the matter the bonnetmaker's
slaughter he laughed bitterly when he read
the prince's billet
eviot he said mau a stout boat with
six trusty men trusty men mark me lose
not a moment and bid d wining instantly come
hither heaven smiles on us my trusty friend
he said to the medicine i was but beating
my brains how to get access to this fickle boy
and here he sends to invite me
hem i see the matter very clearly said
d wining heaven smiles on some untoward
consequences he he he 
no matter the trap is ready and it is baited
too my friend with what would lure the boy
from a sanctuary though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard yet is
it scarce necessary his own weariness himself
would have done the job get thy matters
ready thou goes with us write to him as
i cannot that we come instantly to attend his
commands and do it clerkly he reads welland
that he owes to me
he will be your valiancy's debtor for more
knowledge before he dies he he he but
is your bargain sure with the duke albany 
vol iii l
 enough to gratify my ambition thy avarice
and the revenge both aboard aboard
and speedily let eviot throw in a few flasks 
the choicest wine and some cold baked meats
but your arm my lord sir john does
it not pain you 
 the throbbing my heart silences the
pain my wound it beats as it would burst
ray bosom
heaven forbid said dwining adding
in a low voice it would be a strange sight if
it should i should like to dissect it save that
its stony case would spoil my best instruments

in a few minutes they were in the boat
while a speedy messenger carried the note to
the prince
rothsay was seated with the constable after
their noontide repast he was sullen and silent
and the earl had just asked whether it
was his pleasure that the table should be cleared
when a note delivered to the prince changed
at once his aspect
 as you will he said i go to the pavilion
in the garden always with permission
 my lord constable to receive my late master
 the horse
 my lord said lord errol
 ay my lord must i ask permission twice 
 no surely my lord answered the constable
 but has your royal highness recollected
that sir john ramorny 
has not the plague i hope replied the
duke rothsay come errol you would
play the surly turnkey but it is not in your
nature farewell for half an hour
a new folly said errol as the prince
flinging open a lattice the groundparlour in
which they sate stept out into the garden a
new folly to call back that villain to his councils
but he is infatuated
the prince in the meantime looked back
and said hastily 
your lordship's good housekeeping will afford
us a flask or two and a slight collation in
the pavilion i love the al fresco the river
the constable bowed and gave the necessary
orders so that sir john found the materials
 good cheer ready displayed when landing
from his barge he entered the pavilion
it grieves my heart to see your highness
under restraint said ramorny with a wellexecuted
appearance sympathy
 that grief thine will grieve mine said
the prince i am sure here has errol and
a right truehearted lord he is so tired me with
grave looks and something like grave lessons
that he has driven me back to thee thou reprobate
from whom as i expect nothing good i
may perhaps obtain something entertaining
yet ere we say more it was foul work that
upon the eastern's even ramorny i well hope
thou gayest not aim to it
on my honour my lord a simple mistake
 the brute bonthron i did but hint to him
that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by
whom i had lost a hand and lo you my knave
makes a double mistake he takes one man for
another and instead the barton he uses the
axe
it is well that it went no farther small matter
for the bonnetmaker but i had never forts

given you had the armourer fallen there is not
his match in britain but i hope they hanged
the villain high enough 
if thirty feet might serve replied ramorn

pah no more him said rothsay his
wretched name makes the good wine taste 
blood and what are the news in perth ramorn
 how stands it with the bona robes
and the galliard 
little halliards stirring my lord answered
the knight all eyes are turned to the
motions the black douglas who comes with
five thousand chosen men to put us all to rights
as if he were bound for another otterburn it
is said he is to be lieutenant again it is certain
many have declared for his faction
it is time then my feet were free said
rothsay otherwise i may find a worse warder
than errol
ah my lord were you once away from
this place you might make as bold a head as
douglas
ramorny said the prince gravely i
have but a confused remembrance your once
having proposed something horrible to me beware
 such counsel i would be free i would
have my person at my own disposal but i will
never levy arms against my father nor those it
pleases him to trust
 it was only for your royal highnesses personal
freedom that i was presuming to speak
answered ramorny were i in your grace's
place i would get me into that good boat which
hovers on the tay and drop quietly down to
fife where you have many friends and make
free to take possession falkland it is a royal
castle and though the king has bestowed it in
gift on your uncle yet surely even if the grant
were not subject to challenge your grace might
make free with the residence so near a relative

he hath made free with mine said the
duke as the stewartry renfrew can telli
but stay ramorny hold did i not hear errol
say that the lady marjory douglas whom
they call duchess rothsay is at falkland i
would neither dwell with that lady nor insult
her by dislodging her
the lady was there my lord replied ramorn
 but i have sure advice that she is
gone to meet her father
ha to animate the douglas against me 
or perhaps to beg him to spare me providing i
come on my knees to her bed as pilgrims say
the emirs and admirals upon whom a saracen
soldan bestows a daughter in marriage are
bound to do ramorny i will act by the douglas's
own saying it is better to hear the lark
sing than the mouse squeak i will keep both
foot and hand from fetters
no place fitter than falkland replied ramorn
 i have enough good yeomen to
keep the place and should your highness wish
to leave it a brief ride reaches the sea in three
directions
you speak well but we shall die gloom
yonder neither mirth music nor maidens
 said the heedless prince
pardon me noble duke but though the
lady marjory douglas be departed like an errant
dame in romance to implore succour 
her doughty sire there is i may say a lovelier
i am sure a younger maiden cither presently
at falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither your highness has not forgotten the
fair maid perth 
 forget the prettiest wench in scotland 
no any more than thou hast forgotten the hand
that thou hadst in the curfew street onslaught
on st valentine's eve
the hand that i had your highness
would say the hand that i lost as certain
as i shall never regain it catharine glover is
or will soon be at falkland i will not flatter
your highness by saying she expects to meet
you in truth she proposes to place herself under
the protection the lady marjory
the little traitress said the prince she
too to turn against me she deserves punishment
ramorny
i trust your grace will make her penance
a gentle one replied the knight
faith i would have been her father confessor
long ago but i have ever found her coy
opportunity was lacking my lord replied
ramorny and time presses even now
nay i am but too apt for a frolic but my
father 
he is personally safe said ramorny
and as much at freedom as ever he can be 
while your highness 
must brook fetters conjugal or literal i
know it yonder comes douglas with his
daughter in his hand as haughty and as harshfeatured
as himself bating touches age
and at falkland sits in solitude the fairest
wench in scotland said ramorny here
is penance and restraint yonder is joy and freedom

thou hast prevailed most sage counsellor
replied rothsay but mark you it shall bethe
last my frolics
i trust so replied ramorny for when
at liberty you may make a good accommodation
with your royal father
i will write to him ramorny get the writ
 no i cannot put my thoughts
in words do thou write
your royal highness forgets said ramorn
pointing to his mutilated arm
ah that cursed hand yours what
can we do 
 so please your highness answered his
counsellor if you would use the hand the
medicine dwining he writes like a clerk
hath he a hint the circumstances is he
possessed them 
fully said ramorny and stepping to
the window he called dwining from the boat
he entered the presence the prince scotland
creeping as if he trode upon eggs with
downcast eyes and a frame that seemed shrunk
up by a sense awe produced by the occasion
there fellow are writingmaterials i will
make trial you thou know'st the case 
place my conduct to my father in a fair light
dwining sat down and in a few minutes
wrote a letter which he handed to sir john
ramorny
why the devil has aided thee dwining
said the knight listen my dear lord 
respected father and liege sovereign know
that important considerations induce me to take
my departure from this your court purposing
to make my abode at falkland both as the seat
 my dearest uncle albany with whom i know
your majesty would desire me to use all familiarity
and as the residence one from whom
i have been too long estranged and with whom
i haste to exchange vows the closest affection
from henceforward
the duke rothsay and ramorny laughed
aloud and the physician who had listened
to his own scroll as if it were a sentence 
death encouraged by their applause raised his
eyes uttered faintly his chuckling note he 
he and was again grave and silent as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds reverent respect

admirable said the prince admirable
 the old man will apply all this to the
duchess as they call her rothsay d wining
thou should'st be a secrets to his holiness the
pope who sometimes it is said wants a scribe
that can make one word record two meanings
i will subscribe it and have the praise the
device
and now my lord said ramorny sealing
the letter and leaving it behind will you
not to boat 
not till my chamberlain attends vail some
clothes and necessaries and you may call my
sewer also
my lord said ramorny time presses
and preparation will but excite suspicion your
officers will follow with the mails tomorrow
for tonight i trust my poor service may suffice
to wait on you at table and chamber
nay this time it is thou who forgets said
the prince touching the wounded arm with his
walkingrod recollect man thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point a goodly
sewer or valet the mouth 
ramorny grinned with rage and pain for his
wound though in a way healing was still
highly sensitive and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble
will your highness now be pleased to take
boat
not till i take leave the lord constable
rothsay must not slip away like a thief from
a prison from the house errol summon
him hither
my lord duke said ramorny it maybe
dangerous to our plan
to the devil with danger thy plan and
thyself i must and will act to errol as becomes
us both
the earl entered agreeable to the prince's
summons
i gave you this troublemy lord said
rothsay with the dignified courtesy which he
knew so well how to assume to thank you for
your hospitality and your good company i can
enjoy them no longer as pressing affairs call me
to falkland
 my lord said the lord high constable
i trust your grace remembers that you are
under ward
how under ward if i am a prisoner
speak plainly if not i will take my freedom
to depart
 i would my lord your highness would
request his majesty's permission for this journey
there will be much displeasure
mean you displeasure against yourself my
lord or against me 
i have already said your highness lies inward
here but if you determine to break it i
have no warrant god forbid to put force on
your inclinations i can but entreat your
highness for your own sake 
 my own interests i am the best judge 
good evening to you my lord
the wilful prince stepped into the boat with
dwining and ramorny and waiting for no
other attendance eviot pushed off the vessel
which descended the tay rapidly by the assistance
 sail and oar and the ebbtide
for some space the duke rothsay appeared
silent and moody nor did his companions interrupt
his reflections he raised his head at
length and said my father loves a jest and
when all is over he will take this frolic at no
more serious rate than it deserves a fit 
youth with which he will deal as he has with
others yonder my masters shows the old
hold kinfauns frowning above the tay
now tell me john ramorny how thou hast
dealt to get the fair maid perth out the
hands yonder bullheaded provost for errol
told me it was rumoured that she was under his
protection
truly she was my lord with the purpose
 being transferred to the patronage the
duchess i mean the lady marjory 
douglas now this beetleheaded provost who
is after all but a piece blundering valiancy
has like most such a retainer some slyness
and cunning whom he uses in all his dealings
and whose suggestions he generally considers as
his own ideas whenever i would possess myself
 a landward baron i address myself to
such a confident who in the present case is
called kitt henshaw an old skipper upon the
tay and who having in his time sailed as far
as ampere holds with sir patrick charteris
the respect due to one who has seen foreign
countries this his agent i have made my own
and by his means have insinuated various apologies
in order to postpone the departure 
catharine for falkland
but to what good purpose 
i know not if it is wise to tell your highness
lest you should disapprove my views 
i meant the officers the commission for inquiry
into heretical opinions should have found
the fair maid at kinfauns for our beauty is a
peevish selfwilled swerve from the church 
and certes i designed that the knight should
have come in for his share the fines and confiscations
that were about to he inflicted the
monks were eager enough to be at him seeing
he hath had frequent disputes with them about
the salmon ty the
but wherefore wouldst thou have ruined
the knight's fortunes and brought the beautiful
young woman to the stake perchance 
pshaw my lord duke monks never
burn pretty maidens an old woman might
have been in some danger and as for my lord
provost as they call him if they had clipped off
some his fat acres it would have been some
atonement for the brave he put on me in saint
john's church
methinks john it was but a base revenge
said rothsay
rest ye contented my lord he that cannot
right himself by the hand must use his
head well that chance was over by the tenderhearted
douglas's declaring in favour 
tender conscience and then my lord old hens


shaw found no further objections to carrying
the fair maid perth to falkland not to
share the dulness the lady marjory's society
as sir patrick charteris and she herself doth
opine but to keep your highness from tiring
when we return from hunting in the park
there was again a long pause in which the
prince seemed to muse deeply at length he
spoke ramorny i have a scruple in this
matter but if i name it to thee the devil sophistry
with which thou art possessed will argue
it out me as it has done many others this
girl is the most beautiful one excepted whom
i ever saw or knew and i like her the more
that she bears some features elizabeth 
dunbar but she i mean catharine glover is
contracted and presently to be wedded to henry
the armourer a craftsman unequalled for skill
and a manatarms yet unmatched in the barrace
to follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong
your highness will not expect me to be
very solicitous henry smith's interest said
ramorny looking at his wounded arm
vol iii m

by saint andrew with his shored cross
this disaster thine is too much harped upon
john ramorny others are content with putting
a finger into every man's pie but thou
must thrust in thy whole gory hand it is
done and cannot be undone let it be forgotten

nay my lord you allude to it more frequently
than i answered the knight in derision
it is true while i but i can be silent
on the subject if i cannot forget it
well then i tell thee that i have scruple
about this intrigue dost thou remember when
we went in a frolic to hear father clement
preach or rather to see this fair heretic that he
spoke as touchingly as a minstrel about the rich
man taking away thepoor man's onlyewe lamb
a great matter indeed answered sir
john that this churl's wife's eldest son
should be fathered by the prince scotland 
how many earls would covet the like fate for
their fair countesses and how many that have
had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse
for it
 and if i might presume to speak said the
medicine the ancient laws scotland assigned
such a privilege to every feudal lord over
his female vassals though lack spirit and love
 money hath made many exchange it for gold
i require no argument to urge me to be
kind to a pretty woman but this catharine has
been ever cold to me said the prince
nay my lord said ramorny if young
handsome and a prince you know not how to
make yourself acceptable to a fine woman it is
not for me to say more
and if it were not far too great audacity
in me to speak again i would say quoth the
leech that all perth knows that the goto
chrom never was the maiden's choice but fairly
forced upon her by her father i know for
certain that she refused him repeatedly
nay if thou canst assure us that the
case is much altered said rothsay vulcan
was a smith as well as harry wynd he would
needs wed venus and our chronicles tell us
what came it
 then long may lady venus live and he
worshipped said sir john ramorny and
success to the gallant knight mars who goes
awooing to her goddessship 
the discourse took a gay and idle turn for a
few minutes but the duke roth say soon
dropped it i have left he said yonder
air the prisonhouse behind me and yet my
spirits scarce revive i feel that drowsy not
unpleasing yet melancholy mood that comes
over us when exhausted by exercise or satiated
with pleasure some music now stealing on
the ear yet not loud enough to make us lift the
eye were a treat for the gods
your grace has but to speak your wishes
and the nymphs the tay are as favourable as
the fair ones upon the shore hark it is a
lute
a lute said the duke rothsay listening
 it is and rarely touched i should remember
that dying fall steer towards the boat
from whence the music comes
it is old henshaw said ramorny working
up the stream how skipper 
the boatmen answered the hail and drew up
alongside the prince's barge
ol ho my old friend said the prince
recognising the figure as well as the appointments
 the french glee woman louise i
think i owe thee something for being the means
 thy having a fright at least upon st valentine's
day into this boat with thee lute
puppy dog scrip and all i will prefer thee to
a lady's service who shall feed thy very cur on
capons and canary
i trust your highness will consider said
ramorny
i will consider nothing but my pleasure
john pray do thou be so complying as to
consider it also
is it indeed to a lady's service yoa would
promote me said the gleemaiden and
where does she dwell 
at falkland answered the prince
oh i have heard that great lady said
louise and will you indeed prefer me to
your right royal consort's service 
i will by my honour whenever i receive
her as such mark that reservation john said
he aside to ramorny
the persons who were in the boat caught up
the tidings and concluding a reconciliation was
about to take place betwixt the royal couple
exhorted louise to profit by her good fortune
and add herself to the duchess rothsay's
train several offered her some acknowledgment
for the exercise her talents
during this moment delay ramorny whispered
to d wining make in knave with some
objection this addition is one too many rouse
thy wits while i speak a word with henshaw
if i might presume to speak said dining
 as one who have made my studies both
in spain and arabia i would say my lord that
the sickness has appeared in edinburgh and
that there may be risk in admitting this young
wanderer into your highness's vicinity
ah and what is it to thee said rothsay
whether i choose to be poisoned by the pestilence
or the pothecary must thou too needs
thwart my humour 
while the prince thus silenced the remonstrances
 dwining sir john ramorny had
snatched a moment to learn from henshaw that
i
the removal the duchess rothsay from
falkland was still kept profoundly secret and
that catharine glover would arrive there that
evening or the next morning in expectation 
being taken under the noble lady's protection
the duke rothsay deeply plunged in
thought received this intimation so coldly that
ramorny took the liberty remonstrating
this my lord he said is playing the spoiled
child fortune you wish for liberty it
comes you wish for beauty it awaits you with
j must so much delay as to render the boon more precious
even your slightest desires seem a law to
the fates for you desire music when it seems
most distant and the lute and song are at your
hand these things so sent should be enjoyed
else we are but like petted children who break
and throw from them tle toys they have wept
themselves sick for
 to enjoy pleasure ramorny said the
prince a man should have suffered pain as
it requires fasting to gain a good appetite we
who can have all for a wish little enjoy that
all when we have possessed it seest thou yonder
thick cloud which is about to burst to rain 
it seems to stifle me the waters look dark
and lurid the shores have lost their beautiful
form 
my lord forgive your servant said ramorn
 you indulge a powerful imagination
as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to
rear until he falls back on his master and crushes
him i pray you shake off this lethargy shall
the gleemaiden make some music 
let her but it must be melancholy all
mirth would at this moment jar on my ear
the maiden sung a melancholy dirge in norman
french the words which the following
is an imitation were united to a tune as
doleful as they are themselves

yes thou may'st sigh
and look once more at all around
at stream and bank and sky and ground
thy life its final course has found
and thou must die
yes lay thee down
and while thy struggling pulses flutter
bid the gray monk his soulmass mutter
and the deep bell its deathtone utter
thy life is gone

be not afraid
tis but a pang and then a thrill
a fever tit and then a chill 
and then an human ill
for thou art dead
the prince made no observation on the music
 and the maiden at ramorny's beck went
on from time to time with her minstrel craft
until the evening sunk down into rain first
soft and gentle at length in great quantities
and accompanied by a cold wind there was
neither cloak nor covering for the prince and
he sullenly rejected that which ramorny offered

it is not for rothsay to wear your cast
garments sir john this melted snow which i
feel pierce me to the very marrow i am now
encountering by your fault why did you presume
to put off the boat without my servants
and apparel 
ramorny did not attempt an exculpation for
he knew the prince was in one those humours
when to enlarge upon a grievance was
more pleasing to him than to have his mouth
stopped by any reasonable apology in sullen silence
or ainid unsuppressed chiding the boat arrived
at the fishing village newbury the
party landed and found horses in readiness
which indeed ramorny had long since provided
for the occasion their quality underwent the
prince's bitter sarcasm expressed to ramorny
sometimes by direct words oftener by bitter
gibes at length they were mounted and rode
on through the closing night and the falling
rain the prince leading the way with reckless
haste the glee maiden mounted by his express
order attended them and well for her
that accustomed to severe weather and exercise
both on foot and horseback she supported
as firmly as the men the fatigues the nocturnal
ride ramorny was compelled to keep at the
prince's rein being under no small anxiety lest
in his wayward fit he might ride off from him
entirely and taking refuge in the house 
some loyal baron escape the snare which was
spread for him he therefore suffered inexpressibly
during the ride both in mind and in
body
at length the forest falkland received
them and a glimpse the moon showed the
dark and huge tower an appendage royalty
itself though granted for a season to the duke
 albany on a signal given the drawbridge
fell torches glared in the courtyard menials
attended and the prince assisted from horseback
was ushered into an apartment where ramorn
waited on him together with dwining
and entreated him to take the leech's advice
the duke rothsay repulsed the proposal
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared and
having stood for some time shivering in his
dank garments beside a large blazing fire he
retired to his apartment without taking leave
 any one
you see the peevish humour this childish
boy now said ramorny to dwining eek europe wide from sea to sea
bat bonny bluecap still for me i
i've seen amain's proud champions prance
have seen the gallant knights france
unrivall'd with the sword and lance 
have seen the sons england true
wield the brown bill and bend the yew
search france the fair and england free
but bonny bluecap still for me 
in short though louise's disreputable occupation
would have been in other circumstances an
objection to catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company yet forced together as they now
were she found her a humble and accommodating
associate
they lived in this manner for four or five
days and in order to avoid as much as possible
the gaze and perhaps the incivility the menials
in the offices they prepared their food in
their own apartment in the absolutely necessary
intercourse with domestics louise more
accustomed to expedients bolder by habit and
desirous to please catharine willingly took on
herself the trouble getting from the panther
the materials their slender meal and arranging
it with the dexterity her country
the gleewoman had been abroad for this
purpose upon the sixth day a little before noon 
and the desire fresh air or the hope to find
some sallad or potherbs or at least an early
flower or two with which to deck their board
had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle she reentered her apartment
in the tower with a countenance pale as ashes
and a frame which trembled like an aspenleaf
her terror instantly extended itself to catharine
who could hardly find words to ask what new
misfortune had occurred
is the duke rothsay dead 
 worse they are starving him alive
madness woman 
no no no no said louise speaking under
her breath and huddling her words so thick
upon each other that catharine could hardly
catch the sense i was seeking for flowers to
dress your potage because you said you loved
them yesterday my poor little dog thrusting
himself into a thicket yew and holly bushes
that grow out some old ruins close to the
castlewall came back whining and howling 
i crept forward to see what might be the cause
and oh i heard a groaning as one in extreme
pain but so faint that it seemed to arise
t
out the very depth the earth at length
i found it proceeded from a small rent in the
wall covered with ivy and when i laid my ear
close to the opening i could hear the prince's
voice distinctly say it cannot now last long
and then it sunk away in something like a
prayer
gracious heaven did you speak to him
i said is it you my lord and the answer
was who mocks me with that name 
i asked him if i could help him and he answered
with a voice i shall never forget food 
food i die famine so i came hither to
tell you what is to be done shall we alarm
the house 
alas that were more likely to destroy than
to aid him said catharine
and what then shall we do said louise
i know not yet said catharine prompt
and bold on occasions moment though yielding
to her companion in ingenuity resource
on ordinary occasions i know not yet but
something we will do the blood bruce shall
not die unaided
so saying she seized the small cruise which
contained their soup and the meat which
it was made wrapped some thin cakes which
she had hated into the fold her plaid and
beckoning her companion to follow with a vessel
 milk also part their provisions she
hastened towards the garden
so oar fair vestal is stirring abroad said
the only man she met who was one the menials
 but catharine passed on without notice
or reply and gained the little garden without
farther interruption
louise indicated to her a heap ruins which
covered with underwood was close to the castlewall
it had probably been originally a projection
from the building and the small fissure
which communicated with the dungeon contrived
for air had terminated within it but the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay
and admitted a dim ray light to its recesses
although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torches
here is dead silence said catharine after
she had listened attentively for a moment 
 heaven and earth he is gone 
 we must risk something said her compact
ilion and ran her fingers over the strings her
guitar
a sigh was the only answer from the depth
 the dungeon catharine then ventured to
speak i am here my lord i am here with
food and drink
ha ramorny the jest comes too late
i am dying was the answer
his brain is turned and no wonder thought
catharine but whilst there is life there maybe
hope
it is i my lord catharine glover i have
food if i could pass it safely to you
 heaven bless thee i thought the pain was
over but it glows again within me at the name
 food
the food is here but how ah how can i
pass it to you the chink is so narrow the wallis
so thick yet there is a remedy i have it
quick louise cut me a willow bough the tallest
you can find
the gleemaiden obeyed and by means a
cleft in the top the wand catharine transmitted
several morsels the soft cakes soaked
in broth which served at once for food and fop
drink
the unfortunate young man ate little and
with difficulty but prayed for a thousand blessings
on the head his comforter i had destined
thee to be the slave my vices he said
and yet thou priest to become the preserver
 my life but away and save thyself
i will return with food as i shall see opportunity
said catharine just as the gleemaiden
plucked her sleeve and desired her to
be silent and stand close
both couched among the ruins and they
heard the voices ramorny and the physician
in close conversation
he is stronger than i thought said the former
in a low croaking tone how long held
out dalwolsey when the knight lauderdale
prisoned him in his castle hermitage 
for a fortnight answered dwining but
he was a strong man and had some assistance
by grain which fell from a granary above his
prisonhouse
were it not better the matter more
speedily the black douglas comes this way
t
he is not in albany's secret he will demand
to see the prince and all must be over ere he
comes
they passed on in their dark and fatal conversation

now gain we the tower said catharine to
her companion when she saw they had left the
garden i had a plan escape for myself 
i will turn it into one rescue for the prince
the deywoman enters the castle about vesper
time and usually leaves her cloak in the passage
as she goes into the panther's office with the
milk take thou the cloak muffle thyself close
and pass the warder boldly he is usually drunken
at that hour and thou wilt go as the deywoman
unchallenged through gate and along
bridge if thou bear thyself with confidence
then away to meet the black douglas he is
our nearest and only aid
but said louise is he not that terrible
lord who threatened me with shame and punishment

 believe it said catharine such as thou
or i never dwelt an hour in the douglas's memory
either for good or evil tell him that
his soninlaw the prince scotland dies 
treacherously famished in falkland castle
and thou wilt merit not pardon only but reward

i care not for reward said louise the
deed will reward itself but methinks to stay is
more dangerous than to go let me stay then
and nourish the unhappy prince and do you
depart to bring help if they kill me before you
return i leave you my poor lute and pray you
to be kind to my poor chariot
no louise replied catharine you are a
more privileged and experienced wanderer than
i do you go and if you find me dead on your
return as may well chance give my poor father
this ring and a lock my hair and say catharine
died in endeavouring to save the blood
 bruce and give this other lock to henry 
say catharine thought him to the last and
that if he has judged her too scrupulous touching
the blood others he will then know it
was not because she valued her own
they sobbed in each other's arms and the

intervening hours till evening were spent in endeavouring
to devise some better mode supplying
the captive with nourishment and in the
construction a tube composed hollow reeds
slipping into each other by which liquids might
be conveyed to him the bell the village
church falkland tolled to vespers the dey
or farmwoman entered with her pitchers to
deliver the milk for the family and to hear and
tell the news stirring she had scarcely entered
the kitchen when the female minstrel again
throwing herself in catharine's arms and assuring
her her unalterable fidelity crept in
silence down stairs the little dog under her
arm a moment after she was seen by the
breathless catharine wrapt in the dey woman's
cloak and walking composedly across the drawbridge

so said the warder you return early
tonight may bridget small mirth towards
in the hall ha wench sick times are sad
times 
hence perhaps dairywoman and dairy
i have forgotten my tallies said the readmitted
frenchwoman and will return in
the skimming a bowie
she went onward avoiding the village 
falkland and took a footpath which led through
the park catharine breathed freely and blessed
god when she saw her lost in the distance it
was another anxious hour for catharine which
occurred before the escape the fugitive was
discovered this happened so soon as the deygirl
having taken an hour to perform a task
which ten minutes might have accomplished
was about to return and discovered that someone
had taken away her grey frieze cloak a
strict search was set on foot at length the women
 the house remembered the gleemaiden
and ventured to suggest her as one not unlikely
to exchange an old cloak for a new one
the warder strictly questioned averred he saw
the deywoman depart immediately after vespers
 and on this being contradicted by the party
herself he could suggest as the only alternative
that it must needs have been the devil
as however the gleewoman could not be
vol iii p

found the real circumstances the case were
easily guessed at and the steward went to inform
sir john ramorny and dwining who
were now scarcely ever separate the escape 
one their female captives everything awakens
the suspicions the guilty they looked
on each other with faces dismay and then
went together to the humble apartment catharine
that they might take her as much as
possible by surprise while they inquired into
the facts attending louise's disappearance 
 where is your companion young woman
 said ramorny in a tone austere grar
city m
i have no companion here answered catharine

 trifle not replied the knight i mean
the gleemaiden who lately dwelt in this chamber
with you
 she is gone they tell me said catharine
gone about an hour since
and whither said dwining s
how answered catharine should i
know which way a professed wanderer may
choose to travel she was tired no doubt a
solitary life so different from the scenes 
feasting and dancing which her trade leads her
to frequent she is gone and the only wonder
is that she should have stayed so long
this then is all you have to tell us
all that i have to tell you sir john answered
catharine firmly and if the prince
himself inquire i can tell him no more
 there is little danger his again doing
you the honour to speak to you in person said
ramorny even if scotland should escape
being rendered miserable by the sad event 
his decease
 is the duke rothsay so very ill asked
catharine
 no help save in heaven answered ramorn
looking upward
then may there yet be help there said
catharine if human aid prove unavailing 
amen said ramorny with the most determined
gravity while dwining adopted a face
fit to echo the feeling though it seemed to cost
him a painful struggle to suppress his sneering
yet soft laugh triumph which was peculiarlyexcited
by anything having a religious tendency
and it bis men earthly men and not incarnate
devils who thus appeal to heaven while
they are devouring by inches the lifeblood 
their hapless master muttered catharine asher
two baffled inquisitors left the apartment 
why sleeps the thunder but it wih roll erelong
and oh may it be to preserve as well as
to punish 
the hour dinner alone afforded a space
when all in the castle being occupied with that
meal catharine thought she had the best opportunity
 venturing to the breach in the wall
with the least chance being observed in
waiting for the hour she observed some stir in
the castle which had been silent as the grave
ever since the seclusion the duke rothsay
the portcullis was lowered and raised and the
creaking the machinery was intermingled
with the tramp horse as menatarms went
out and returned with steeds hard ridden and
covered with foam she observed too that such
domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms all this made her heart throb
high for it augured the approach rescue and
besides the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever at length the hour noon
arrived she had taken care to provide under
pretence her own wishes which the panther
seemed disposed to indulge such articles 
food as could be the most easily conveyed to the
unhappy captive she whispered to intimate
her presence there was no answer she spoke
louder still there was silence
he sleeps she muttered these words half
aloud and with a shuddering which was succeeded
by a start and a scream when a voice
replied behind her 
yes he sleeps but it is for ever
she looked round sir john ramorny stood
behind her in complete armour but the visor
 his helmet was up and displayed a countenance
more resembling one about to die than
to fight he spoke with a grave tone something
between that a calm observer an interesting
event and one who is an agent and
partaker in it
catharine he said all is true which i
s
tell you he is dead you have done your best
for him you can do no more
i will not i cannot believe it said catharine
 heaven be merciful to me it would
make one doubt providence to think so great
a crime has been accomplished
 doubt not providence catharine though
it has suffered the profligate to fall by his own
devices follow me i have that to say which
concerns you i say follow for she hesitated
unless you prefer being left to the mercies 
the brute bonthron and the medicine henbane
dwining
i will follow you said catharine you
cannot do more to me than you are permitted
he led the way into the tower and mounted
staircase after staircase and ladder after ladder
catharine's resolution failed her i will
follow no farther she said whither would
you lead me if to my death i can die here
only to the battlements the castle fool
said ramorny throwing wide a barred door
which opened upon the vaulted roof the castle
where men were bending mangonels as they
called them military engines that is for throwing
arrows or stones getting ready crossbows
and piling stones together but the defenders
did not exceed twenty in number and catharine
thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them
catharine said ramorny i must not
quit this station which is necessary for my defence
 but i can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere
say on answered catharine i am prepared
to hear you
you have thrust yourself catharine into
a bloody secret have you the firmness to
keep it 
i do not understand you sir john answered
the maiden
look you i have slain murdered if you
will my late master the duke rothsay
the spark life which your kindness would
have fed was easily smothered his last words
called on his father you are faint bear up 
you have more to hear you know the crime
but you know not the provocation sec this
gauntlet is empty i lost my right hand in his
cause and when i was no longer fit to serve
him i was cast off like a wornout hound my
loss ridiculed and a cloister recommended instead
 the halls and palaces in which i had
my natural sphere think on this pity and
assist me
in what manner can you require my assistance
 said the trembling maiden i can neither
repair your loss nor cancel your crime
thou canst be silent catharine on what
thou hast seen and heard in yonder thicket it
is but a brief oblivion i ask you whose word
will i know be listened to whether you say
such things were or were not that your
mountebank companion the foreigner none will
hold to be a pinpoint's value if you grant
me this i will take your promise for my security
and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it if you will not promise silence i
defend this castle till every one perishes and i
fling you headlong from these battlements ay
look at them it is not a leap to be rashly braved
seven courses stairs brought you up
hither with fatigue and shortened breath but
you shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer
time than you can breathe a sigh speak the
word fair maid for you speak to one unwilling
to harm you but determined in his purpose
catharine stood terrified and without power
 answering a man who seemed so desperate 
but she was saved the necessity reply by the
approach d wining he spoke with the same
humble cones which at all times distinguished
his manner and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer which gave that manner the lie
i do you wrong noble sir to intrude on
your valiancy when engaged with a fair damsel
but i come to ask a trifling question
speak tormentor said ramorny ill
news are sport to thee even when they affect
thyself so that they concern others also
hem he he i only desired to know if
your knighthood proposed the chivalrous task
 defending the castle with your single hand
i crave pardon i meant your single arm
the question is worth asking for i am good for
little to aid the defence unless you could prevail

oil the besiegers to take physic he he he 
and bonthron is as drunk as ale and strong
waters can make him and you he and i makeup
the whole garrison who are disposed for resistance

 how will the other dogs not fight
said ramorny
never saw men who showed less stomach
to the work answered dwining never but
here come a brace them venit extrema dies
he he he f
eviot and his companion b uncle now approached
with sullen resolution in their faces
like men who had made their minds up to deny
that authority which they had so long obeyed
how now said ramorny stepping forward
to meet them wherefore from your
posts why have you left the barbican eliot
 and you other fellow did i not charge
you to look to the mangonels 
we have something to tell you sir john
ramorny answered eviot we will not fight
in this quarrel
how my own squires control me said
ramorny
we were your squires and pages my lord
while you were master the duke rothsay's
household it is bruited about the duke
no longer lives we desire to know the truth
what traitor dares spread such falsehoods
said ramorny
all who have gone out to skirt the forest
my lord and i myself among others bring back
the same news the minstrel woman who left
the castle yesterday has spread the report everywhere
that the duke rothsay is murdered
or at death's door the douglas comes on us
with a strong force 
and you cowards take advantage an idle
report to forsake your master said ramorny
indignantly
 my lord said eviot let buncle and
myself see the duke rothsay and receive
his personal orders and if we do not fight to
the death in defence the castle i will consent
to be hanged on its highest turret but if hebe
gone by natural disease we will yield up the
castle to the earl douglas who is they say
the king's lieutenant or if which heaven
forefend the noble prince has had foul play
we will not involve ourselves in the guilt 
using arms in defence the murderers be they
who they will i
 eviot said ramorny raising his mutilated
arm had not that glove been empty thou
hadst not lived to utter two words this insolence

it is as it is answered eviot and we
do but our duty i have followed you long my
lord but here i draw bridle ot
farewell then and a curse light on all 
you exclaimed the incensed baron let my
horse be brought forth 
our valiancy is about to run away said
the medicine who had crept close to catharine's
side before she was aware catharine
thou art a superstitious fool like most women 
nevertheless thou hast some mind and i speak
to thee as one more understanding than the
buffaloes which are herding about us these
haughty barons who overstrained the world what
are they in the day adversity chaff before
the wind let their sledgehammer hands or
their column resembling legs have injury and
bah the menatarms are gone heart and
courage is nothing to them lithe and limb everything
 give them animal strength what are they
better than furious bulls take that away and
your hero chivalry lies grovelling like the
brute when he is hamstrung not so the sage 
while a grain sense remains in a crushed or
mutilated frame his mind shall be strong as
ever catharine this morning i was practising
your death but methinks i now rejoice that
you may survive to tell how the poor medicine
the pillgilder the mortarpounder the poisonvender
met his fate in company with the gallant
knight ramorny baron in possession and
earl lindores in expectation god save his
lordship 
old man said catharine if thou be indeed
so near the day thy deserved doom
other thoughts were far wholesome than the
vainglorious ravings a vain philosophy 
ask to see a holy man 
yes said dwining scornfully refer myself
to a greasy monk who does not he he 
ibs
he understand the barbarous latin he repeats
by rote such would be a fitting counsellor to one
who has studied both in spain and arabia no
catharine i will choose a confessor that is pleasant
to look upon and you shall be honoured
with the office now look yonder at his valiancy
 his eyebrow drops with moisture his
lip trembles with agony for his valiancy he 
he he is pleading for his life with his late
domestics and has not eloquence enough to
persuade them to let him slip see how the
fibres his face work as he implores the ungrateful
brutes whom he has heaped with obligations
to permit him to get such a start for his
life as the hare has from the greyhounds when
men course her fairly look also at the sullen
downcast dogged faces with which fluctuating
between fear and shame the domestic traitors
deny their lord this poor chance for his life these
things thought themselves the superior a manlike
me and you foolish wench think so meanly
 your deity as to suppose wretches like
them are the work omnipotence 
 no man evil no said catharine
warmly the god i worship created these men
with the attributes to know and adore him to
guard and defend their fellowcreatures to practise
holiness and virtue their own vices and
the temptations their one have made them
such as they now are oh take the lesson home
to thine own heart adamant heaven made
thee wiser than thy fellows gave thee eyes to
look into the secrets nature a sagacious heart
and a skilful hand but thy pride has poisoned
all these fair gifts and made an ungodly atheist
 one who might have been a christian sage 
atheist say'st thou answered dwining
perhaps i have doubts on that matter but
they will be soon solved yonder comes one
who will send me as he has done thousands to
the place where all mysteries shall be cleared
catharine followed the medicine's eye up one
 the forest glades and beheld it occupied by a
body horsemen advancing at full gallop in
the midst was a pennon displayed which though
its bearings were not visible to catharine was
by a murmur around acknowledged as that 
the black douglas they halted within arrowshot
 the castle and a herald with two trumpets
advanced up to the main portal whereafter
a loud flourish he demanded admittance
for the high and dreaded archibald earl 
douglas lord lieutenant the king and acting
for the time with the plenary authority 
his majesty commanding at the same time
that the inmates the castle should lay down
their arms all under penalty high treason
you hear said eviot to ramorny who
stood sullen and undecided will you give
orders to render the castle or must i 
no villain interrupted the knight to
the last i will command you open the gates
drop the bridge and render the castle to the
douglas
now that's what may be called a gallant
exertion free will said d wining just
as if the pieces brass that were screaming a
minute since should pretend to call those notes
their own which are breathed through them by
a frowsy trumpeter
wretched man said catharine either
be silent or turn thy thoughts to the eternity
on the brink which thou art standing
and what is that to thee answered dining
 thou canst not wench help hearing
what i say to thee and thou wilt tell it again
for thy sex cannot help that either perth and
all scotland shall know what a man they have
lost in henbane dwining 
the clash armour now announced that the
new comers had dismounted and entered the
castle and were in the act disarming the
small garrison earl douglas himself appeared
on the battlements with a few his followers
and signed to them to take ramorny and dining
into custody others dragged from some
nook the stupefied bonthron
it was to these three that the custody 
the prince was solely committed during his
alleged illness said the douglas prosecuting
an inquiry which he had commenced in the
hall the castle
no other saw him said eviot though
i offered my services
conduct us to the duke's apartment and
bring the prisoners with us also there should
be a female in the castle if she hath not been
vol iii j
murdered or spirited away the companion 
the gleemaiden who brought the first alarm
she is here my lord said eviot bringing
catharine forward
her beauty and her agitation made some impression
even upon the impassible earl
 fear nothing maiden he said thou
hast deserved both praise and reward tell tome
as thou would'st confess to heaven the
things thou hast witnessed in this castle
few words served catharine to unfold the
dreadful story
it agrees said the douglas with the
tale the gleemaiden from point to point 
now show us the prince's apartment
they passed to the room which the unhappy
duke rothsay had been supposed to inhabit 
but the key was not to be found and the earl
could only obtain entrance by forcing the door
on entering the wasted and squalid remains 
the unhappy prince were discovered flung on
the bed as if in haste the intention the
murderers had apparently been to arrange the
dead body so as to resemble a timely parted
corpse but they had been disconcerted by the
alarm occasioned by the escape louise douglas
looked on the body the misguided youth
whose wild passions and caprice's had brought
him to this fatal and premature catastrophe
i had wrongs to be redressed he said 
but to see such a sight as this banishes all
remembrance injury 
he he it should have been arranged
said d wining more to your omnipotence's
pleasure but you came suddenly on us and
hasty masters make slovenly service
douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner
said so closely did he examine the wan and
wasted features and stiffened limbs the
dead body before him catharine overcome
by sickness and fainting at length obtained
permission to retire from the dreadful scene
and through confusion every description
found her way to her former apartment where
she was locked in the arms louise who had
returned in the interval
the investigations douglas proceededthe
dying hand the prince was found to be
clenched upon a lock hair resembling in coil

lour and texture the coalblack bristles bonthrone
thus though famine had begun the
work it would seem that rothsay's death had
been finally accomplished by violence the
private stair to the dungeon the keys which
were found at the subaltern assassin's belt the
situation the vault its communication with
the external air by the fissure in the walls and
the wretched lair straw with the fetters
which remained there fully confirmed the
story catharine and the glee woman
we will not hesitate an instant said the
douglas to his near kinsman the lordbalveny
as soon as they returned from the dungeon
away with the murderers hang them over
the battlements
but my lord some trial may be fitting
answered balcony
to what purpose answered douglas i
have taken them redhand my authority will
stretch to instant execution yet stay have
we not some redwood men in our troop 
plenty turnbulls rutherford aisles
and so forth said balcony
call me an inquest these together they
are all good men and true saving a little shifting
for their living do thou see to the execution
 these felons while i hold a court in the
great hall and we'll try whether the jury or the
provostmarshal do their work first we will
have jed wood justice hang in haste and try
at leisure
yet stay my lord said ramorny you
may rue your haste will you grant me a word
out earshot 
not for worlds said douglas speak
out what thou hast to say before all that are
here present
know all then said ramorny aloud that
this noble earl had letters from the duke 
albany and myself sent him by the hand 
yon cowardly deserter buncle let him deny
it if he dare counselling the removal the
duke for a space from court and his seclusion
in this castle falkland
but not a word replied douglas sternly
smiling his being flung into a dungeon 
famished strangled away with the wretches
balveny they pollute god's air too long 
the prisoners were dragged off to the battlements
but while the means execution were
in the act being prepared the apothecary
expressed so ardent a desire to see catharine
once more and as he said for the good his
soul that the maiden in hopes his obduracy
might have undergone some change even at
the last hour consented again to go to the
battlements and face a scene which her heart
recoiled from a single glance showed her
bonthron sunk in total and drunken insensibility
ramorny stripped his armour endeavouring
in vain to conceal fear while he
spoke with a priest whose good offices he had
solicited and dwining the same humble 
crouching individual she had
always known him he held in his hand a little
silver pen with which he had been writing on
a scrap parchment
catharine he said he he he j wish
to speak to thee on the nature my religious
faith
if such be thy intention why lose time
with me speak with this good father
the good father said dvviuiug is he
he already a worshipper the deity whom
i have served i therefore prefer to give the
altar mine idol a new worshipper in thee catharine
this scrap parchment will tell thee
how to make your way into my chapel where
i have worshipped so often in safety i leave
the images which it contains to thee as a legacy
simply because i hate and contemn thee something
less than any the absurd wretches
whom i have hitherto been obliged to call fellowcreatures
and now away or remain and
see if the the quacksalver belies his life
our lady forbid said catharine
nay said the medicine i have but a
single word to say and yonder nobleman's valiancy
may hear it if he will
lord balveny approached with some curiosity
for the undaunted resolution a man who
never wielded sword or bore armour and was
in person a poor dwindled dwarf had to him an
air something resembling sorcery
you see this trifling implement said the
criminal showing the silver pen by means
 this i can escape the power even the black
douglas aiiiii mm
give him no ink nor paper said balveny
hastily he will draw a spell
not so please your wisdom and valiancy
he he he said dwining with his usual
chuckle as he unscrewed the top the pen
within which was a piece sponge or some such
substance no bigger than a pea now mark
this said the prisoner and drew it between
his lips the effect was instantaneous he lay
a dead corpse before them the contemptuous
sneer still on his countenance
catharine shrieked and fled seeking by a
hasty descent an escape from a sight so appalling
lord balveny was for a moment stupefied
and then exclaimed this may be glamour
 hang him over the battlements quick or
dead if his foul spirit hath only withdrawn
for a space it shall return to a body with a
dislocated neck
his commands were obeyed ramorny and
bonthron were then ordered for execution the
last was hanged before he seemed quite to come

pretend what was designed to be done with
him ramorny pale as death yet with the
same spirit pride which had occasioned his
ruin pled his knighthood and demanded the
privilege dying by the sword and not by the
noose ad d sad
 the douglas never alters his doom said
balveny but thou shalt have all thy rights 
send the cook hither with a cleaver the menial
whom he called appeared at his summons
what shakes thou for fellow said balcony
 here strike me this man's gilt spurs from
his heels with thy cleaver and now john
ramorny thou art no longer a knight but a
knave to the halter with him provostmarshal
 hang him betwixt his companions and
higher than them if it may be
in a quarter an hour afterwards balveny
descended to tell the douglas that the criminals
were executed
then there is no further use in the trial
said the earl how say you good men 
inquest were these men guilty high treason 
ay or no 
guilty exclaimed the obsequious inquest
with edifying unanimity we need no farther
evidence
sound trumpets and to horse then with
our own train only and let each man keep silence
on what has chanced here until the proceedings
shall be laid before the king which
cannot conveniently be till the battle palm
sunday shall be fought and ended select our
attendants and tell each man who either goes
with us or remains behind that he who prates
dies
in a few minutes the douglas was on horseback
with the followers selected to attend his
person expresses were sent to his daughter
the widowed duchess rothsay directing her
to take her course to perth by the shores 
lochleven without approaching falkland and
committing to her charge catharine glover and
the gleewoman as persons whose safety he
tendered
as they rode through the forest they looked
back and beheld the three bodies hanging like
specks darkening the walls the old castle
the band is punished said douglas but
who shall arraign the head by whose direction
the act was done 
you mean the duke albany said balvery

i do kinsman and were i to listen to the
dictates my heart i would charge him with
the deed which i am certain he has authorized
but there is no proof it beyond strong suspicion
and albany has attached to himself the
numerous friends the house stewart to
whom indeed the imbecility the king and
the ill regulated habits rothsay left no other
choice a leader were i therefore to break
the band which i have so lately formed with albany
the consequence must be civil war an
event ruinous to poor scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity the percy
backed by the treachery march no balveny
the punishment albany must rest with
heaven which in its own good time will execute
judgment on him and on his house
chapter x
we are now to recall to our reader's recollection
that simon glover and his fair daughter
had been hurried from their residence without
having time to announce to henry smith
either their departure or the alarming cause 
it when therefore the lover appeared in curfew
street on the morning their flight instead
 the hearty welcome the honest burgher
and the april reception half joy half censure
which he had been promised on the part
 his lovely daughter he received only the astounding
intelligence that her father and she
had set off early on the summons a stranger
who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation to this dorothy whose talents for
forestalling evil and communicating her views
 it are known to the reader chose to add that
she had no doubt her master and young mistress
were bound for the highlands to avoid a
visit which had been made since their departure
by two or three apparitors who in the name 
a commission appointed by the king had
searched the house put seals upon such places
as were supposed to contain papers and left
citations for father and daughter to appear before
the court commission on a day certain under
pain outlawry all these alarming particulars
dorothy took care to state in the gloomiest
colours and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was that her master
had charged her to tell him to reside quietly at
perth and that he should soon hear news 
them this checked the smith's first resolve
which was to follow them instantly to the
highlands and partake the fate which they
might encounter
but when he recollected his repeated feuds
with divers the clan quhele and particularly
his personal quarrel with conachar who was
now raised to he a high chief he could not but
think on reflection that his intrusion on their
place retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy
there than be any service to them he was
well acquainted with simon's habitual intimacy
with the chief the clan quhele and justly
augured that the glover would obtain protection
which his own arrival might be likely
to disturb while his personal prowess could
little avail him in a quarrel with a whole tribe
 vindictive mountaineers at the same time
his heart throbbed with indignation when he
thought catharine being within the absolute
power young conachar whose rivalry
he could not doubt and who had now so many
means urging his suit what if the young
chief should make the safety the father depend
on the favour the daughter he distrusted
not catharine's affections but then
leer mode thinking was so disinterested and
her affection to her father so tender that if the
love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security or perhaps his life it was matter 
deep and awful doubt whether it might not be
found light in the balance tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell he resolved
nevertheless to remain at home stifle his
anxiety as he might and await the promised intelligence
from the old man it came but it
did not relieve his concern
sir patrick charteris had not forgotten his
promise to communicate to the smith the plans
 the fugitives but amid the bustle occasioned
by the movement troops he could
not himself convey the intelligence he therefore
intrusted to his agent kitt henshaw the
task making it known but this worthy
person as the reader knows was in the interest
 raraorny whose business it was to conceal
from every one but especially from a lover
so active and daring as henry the real place
 catharine's residence henshaw therefore announced
to the anxious smith that his friend the
glover was secure in the highlands and though
he affected to be more reserved on the subject
 catharine he said little to contradict the belief
that she as well as simon shared the protection
 the clan quhele but he reiterated
in the name sir patrick assurances that
father and daughter were both well and that
henry would best consult his own interest and
their safety by remaining quiet and waiting
the course events
with an agonized heart therefore henry
gow determined to remain quiet till he had
more certain intelligence and employed himself
in finishing a shirt mail which he intended
should be the best tempered and the most finely
polished that his skilful hands had ever executed
this exercise his craft pleased him better
than any other occupation which he could have
adopted and served as an apology for secluding
himself in his workshop and shunning society
where the idle reports which were daily circulated
served only to perplex and disturb him
he resolved to trust in the warm regard simon
the faith his daughter and the friends
hip the provost who having so highly commended
his valour in the combat with bonthrow
would never he thought desert him at
this extremity his fortunes time however
passed on day by day and it was not till
palm sunday was near approaching that sir
patrick charteris having entered the city to
make some arrangements for the ensuing combat
bethought himself making a visit to the
smith the wynd
he entered his workshop with an air sympathy
unusual to him and which made henry
instantly augur that he brought bad news
the smith caught the alarm and the uplifted
hammer was arrested in its descent upon the
heated iron while the agitated arm that wielded
it strong before as that a giant became
so powerless that it was with difficulty henry
was able to place the weapon on the ground
instead dropping it from his hand
my poor henry said sir patrick i
bring you but cold news they are uncertain
however and if true they are such as a brave
man like you should not take too deeply to
heart
vol iii r
in god's name my lord said henry i
trust you bring no evil news simon glover
or his daughter 
touching themselves said sir patrick
no they are safe and well but as to thee
henry my tidings are more cold kitt henshaw
has i think apprised thee that i had endeavoured
to provide catharine glover with a
safe protection in the house an honourable
lady the duchess rothsay but she hath
declined the charge and catharine hath been
sent to her father in the highlands what is
worst is to come thou mayest have heard that
gilchrist maclan is dead and that his son
eachin who was known in perth as the apprentice
 old simon by the name conachar
is now the chief clan quhelp and i heard
from one my domestics that there is a strong
rumour among the maclean that the young
chief seeks the hand catharine in marriage
my domestic learned this as a secret however
while in the breadalbane country on some arrangements
touching the ensuing combat the
thing is uncertain but henry it wears a face
 likelihood
 did your lordship's servant see simon
glover and his daughter said henry struggling
for breath and coughing to conceal from
the provost the excess his agitation
he did not said sir patrick the highlanders
seemed jealous and refused to permit
him to speak to the old man and he feared to
alarm them by asking to see catharine besides
he talks no gaelic nor had his informer much
english so there may be some mistake in the
matter nevertheless there is such a report and
i thought it best to tell it you but you maybe
well assured that the wedding cannot goon
till the affair palm sunday be over and
i advise you to take no step till we learn the
circumstances the matter for certainty is
most desirable even when it is a painful one
go you to the councilhouses he added after
a pause to speak about the preparations for
the lists in the north inch you will be welcome
there
no my good lord
well smith i judge by your brief answer
that you are discomposed with this matter
but after all women are weathercocks
that is the truth on't solomon and others have
proved it before you
and so sir patrick charteris retired fully
convinced he had discharged the office a comforter
in the most satisfactory manner
 with very different impressions did the unfortunate
lover regard the tidings and listen to
the consoling commentary
the provost he said bitterly to himself
 is an excellent man marry he holds his
knighthood so high that if he speaks nonsense
a poor man must hold it sense as he must praise
dead ale if it be handed to him in his lordship's
silver flaggon how would all this sound in
another situation suppose i were rolling down
the steep descent the corrichie diu and before
i came to the edge the rock comes my
lord provost and cries henry there is a deep
precipice and i grieve to say you are in the fairway
 rolling over it but be not downcast
for heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop
your progress however i thought it would be
comfort to you to know the worst which you

will be presently aware i do not know how
many hundred feet deep the precipice descends
but you may form a judgment when you are at
the bottom for certainty is certainty and harkye
when come you to take a game at bowls 
and this gossip is to serve instead any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck when
i think this i could go mad seize my hammer
and break and destroy all around me but
i will be calm and if this highland kite who
calls himself a falcon should stoop at my turtledove
he shall know whether a burgess perth
can draw a bow or not
it was now the thursday before the fated
palm sunday and the champions on either side
were expected to arrive the next day that they
might have the interval saturday to rest refresh
themselves and prepare for the combat
two or three each the contending parties
were detached to receive directions about the
encampment their little band and such other
instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering the field henry was not therefore
surprised at seeing a tall and powerful
i
highlander peering anxiously about the wynd
in which he lived in the manner in which the
natives a wild country examine the curiosities
 one that is more civilized the smith's
heart rose against the man on account his
country to which our perth burgher bore a natural
prejudice and more especially as he observed
the individual wear the plaid peculiar to
the clan quhele the sprig oakleaves worked
in silk intimated also that the individual
was one those personal guards young
eachin upon whose exertions in the future
battle so much reliance was placed
having observed so much henry withdrew
into his smithy for the sight the man raised
his passion and knowing that the highlander
came plighted to a solemn combat and could
not be the subject any inferior quarrel he
was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him in a few minutes however
the door the smithy flew open and fluttering
in his tartans which greatly magnified his
actual size the gael entered with the haughty
step a man conscious a personal dignity
superior to anything which he is likely to meet
with he stood looking around him and seemed
to expect to he received with courtesy and
regarded with wonder but henry had no sort
 inclination to indulge his vanity and kept
hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware 
his visitor's presence
you are the gow chrom f the bandjleg
get smith said the highlander 
those that wish to be crookbacked call me
so answered henry
no offence meant said the highlander 
but her own self comes to buy an armour
her own self's bare shanks may trot hence
with her answered henry i have none to
sell
if it was not within two days palm sunday
herself would make you sing another songs
retorted the gael
 and being the day it is said henry with
the same contemptuous indifference i pray
you to stand out my light
you are an uncivil person but her own
self is jr nan ord too and she knows the smith
is fiery when the iron is hot
 if her iiaiusell be hammermau herself
her nainsell may make her nain harness replied
henry
and so her nainsell would and never fash
you for the matter hut it is said gow chron
that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords
and varnishes that you work that have power
to make the blades cut steellinks as if they
were paper and the plate and mail turn back
steellances as if they were toddleprins 
they tell your ignorance any nonsense that
christian men refuse to believe said henry
i whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost
like an honest craftsman and commonly
it is the highlandman's och hone for 
 my hammer goes naturally to that
tune
friend it is but idle to spur a horse when
his legs are unshackled said the highlander
haughtily her own self cannot fight even
now and there is little gallantry in taunting her
thus
by nails and hammer you are right there
said the smith altering his tone but speak

oat at once friend what is it thou would'st have
 me i am in no humour for dallying
a hauberk for her chief eachin mac ian
said the highlander
you are a hamnierman you say are you
a judge this said our smith producing from
a chest the mail shirt on which he had been
lately employed
the gael handled it with a degree admiration
which had something envy in it he
looked curiously at every part its texture and
at length declared it the very best piece armour
that he had seen
a hundred cows and bullocks and a good
drift sheep would be e'en over cheap an offer
said the highlandman by way tentative
 but her nainsell will never bid thee less
come by them how she can
it is a fair proffer replied henry but
gold nor gear will never buy that harness i
want to try my own sword on my own armour 
and i will not give that mailcoat to any one
but who will face me for the best three blows
and a thrust in the fair field and it is your
chief's upon these terms

hut prut man take a drink and go to
bed said the highlander in great scorn are
ye mad think ye the captain the clan
quhele will be brawling and battling with a bit
perth burgess body like you whisht man
and hearken her nainsell will do ye mair credit
than ever belonged to your kin she will fight
you for the fair harness herself
she must first show that she is my match
said henry with a grim smile
how i one eachin's leichtach and
not your match 
you may try me if you will you say you
are a fir nan ord do you know how to cast a
sledgehammer 
ay truly ask the eagle if he can fly over
arragon
but before you strive with me you must
first try a cast with one mi leichtach here
dunter stand forth for the honour perth 
and now highlandman there stands a row 
hammers choose which you will and let us to
the garden
the highlander whose name was norman
nan ord or norman the hammer showed
his title to the epithet by selecting the largest
hammer the set at which henry smiled hunter
the stout journeyman the smith made
what was called a prodigious cast hut the highlander
making a desperate effort threw beyond
it by two or three feet and looked with an air
 triumph to henry who again smiled in reply
will you mend that said the gael offering
our smith the hammer
not with that child's toy said henry
which has scarce weight to fly against the
wind janniken fetch me sampson or one
 you help the boy for sampson is somewhat
ponderous
the hammer now produced was half as heavy
again as that which the highlander had selected
as one unusual weight norman stood astonished
 but he was still more so when henry
taking his position swung the ponderous implement
far behind his right haunch joint and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown
from a warlike engine the air groaned and
whistled as the mass flew through it down at
length it came and the iron head sunk a foot
into the earth a full yard beyond the cast 
norman
the highlander defeated and mortified went
to the spot where the weapon lay lifted it poised
it in his hand with great wonder and examined
it closely as if he expected to discover
more in it than a common hammer he at
length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile shrugging his shoulders and shaking
his head as the smith asked him whether
he would not mend his cast
 norman has lost too much at the sport already
he replied she has lost her own
name the hammered but does her oneself
the gow chron work at the anvil with that
horse's load iron 
you shall see brother said henry leading
the way to the smithy dunter he said
rax me that bar from the furnace and uplifting
sampson as he called the monstrous
hammer he plied the metal with a hundred
strokes from right to left now with the right
hand now with the left now with both with
so much strength at once and dexterity that he
worked off a small but beautifully proportioned
horseslide in half the time that an ordinary
smith would have taken for the same purpose
with a more manageable implement
 high high said the highlander and
what for would you be fighting with our young
chief who is far above your standard though
you were the best smith ever wrought with wind
and fire 
hark you said henry you seem a
good fellow and i'll tell you the truth your
master has wronged me and i give him this
harness freely for the chance fighting him
myself
nay if he hath wronged you he must meet
you said the lifeguardsman to do a man
wrong takes the eagle's feather out the chiefs
bonnet and were he the first in the highlands
and to be sure so is eachin he must fight the
man he has wronged or else a rose falls from
his chaplet
will you move him to this said henry
after the fight on sunday 
oh her nainsellwill do her best if the hawks
have not got her bones to pick for you must
know brother that clan chattan's claws pierce
rather deep
 the armour is your chief's on that condition
said henry but i will disgrace him
before king and court if he does not pay me
the price
deil a fear deil a fear i will bring him into
the barrack myself said norman assuredly

 you will do me a pleasure replied henry
and that you may remember your promise i
will bestow on you this dirk look if you hold
it truly and can strike between the mailhood
and the collar your enemy the surgeon will
be needless
the highlander was lavish in his expressions
 gratitude and took his leave
i have given him the best mail harness i
ever wrought said the smith to himself rather
repenting his liberality for the poor
chance that he will bring his chief into a fairfield
with me and then let catharine be his
who can win her fairly but much i dread the
youth will find some evasion unless he have
such luck on palm sunday as may induce him
to try another combat that is some hope however
 for i have often ere now seen a raw
young fellow shoot up after his first fight from
a dwarf into a giantqueller
thus with little hope but with the most determined
resolution henry smith awaited the
time that should decide his fate what made
him augur the worst was the silence both the
glover and his daughter they are ashamed
he said to confess the truth to me and therefore
they are silent
upon the friday at noon the two bands representing
the contending clans arrived at the
several points where they were to halt for refreshments

the clan quhele was entertained hospitably
at the rich abbey scone while the provost
regaled their rivals at his castle kinfauns 
the utmost care being taken to treat both parties
with the most punctilious attention and to
afford neither an opportunity complaining
 partiality all points etiquette were in
the meanwhile discussed and settled by the
lord high constable errol and the young
earl crawford the former acting on the
part the clan chattan and the latter patronising
the clan quhele messengers were passing
continually from the one earl to the other
and they held more than six meetings within
thirty hours before the ceremonial the field
could be exactly arranged
meanwhile in case revival ancient quarrel
many seeds which existed betwixt the
burghers and their mountain neighbours a proclamation
commanded the citizens not to approach
within half a mile the place where
the highlanders were quartered while on their
part the intended combatants were prohibited
from approaching perth without special license
troops were stationed to enforce this order
who did their charge so scrupulously as to prevent
simon glover himself burgess and citizen
 perth from approaching the town because
he owned having come thither at the same time
with the champions eachin maclan and wore
a plaid around him their check or pattern
this interruption prevented simon from seeking
out henry wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge all that had happened since
their separation which intercourse had it taken
place must have materially altered the catastrophe
 our narrative
on saturday afternoon another arrival took
place which interested the city almost as much
as the preparations for the expected combat
this was the approach the earl douglas who
rode through the town with a troop only thirty
horse but all whom were knights and gentlemen
 the first consequence men's eyes followed
this dreaded peer as they pursue the flight
 an eagle through the clouds unable to ken the
course the bird jove yet silent attentive
and as earnest in observing him as if they could
guess the object for which he sweeps through
the firmament he rode slowly through the
city and passed out at the northern gate he
next alighted at the dominican convent and
desired to see the duke albany the earl
was introduced instantly and received by the
duke with a manner which was meant to be
graceful and conciliatory but which could not
conceal both art and inquietude when the
first greetings were over the earl said with
great gravity i bring you melancholy news
vol iii s
your grace's royal nephew the duke rothsay
is no more and i fear hath perished by some
foul practices
 practices said the duke in confusion
 what practice who dared practise on the
heir the scottish throne 
 tis not for me to state how these doubts
arise said douglas but men say the eagle
was killed with an arrow fledged from his own
wing and the oak trunk rent by a wedge the
same wood fiiioactib
earl douglas said the duke albany
i am no reader riddles
nor am i a propounder them said douglas
haughtily your grace will find particulars
in these papers worthy perusal i
will go for half an hour to the cloister garden
and then rejoin you
you go not to the king my lord said
albany
no answered douglas i trust your
grace will agree with me that we should conceal
this great family misfortune from our sovereign
till the business tomorrow be decided
iiiifo
i willingly agree said albany if the
king heard this loss he could not witness
the combat and if he appear not in person
these men are likely to refuse to fight and the
whole work is cast loose but i pray you sit
down my lord while i read these melancholy
papers respecting poor rothsay
he passed the papers through his hands turning
some over with a hasty glance and dwelling
on others as if their contents had been the last
importance when he had spent nearly a quarter
 an hour in this manner he raised his eyes
and said very gravely my lord in these most
melancholy documents it is yet a comfort to see
nothing which can renew the divisions in the
king's councils which were settled by the last
solemn agreement between your lordship and
myself my unhappy nephew was by that agreement
to be set aside until time should send him
a graver judgment he is now removed by
fate and our purpose in that matter is anticipated
and rendered unnecessary
if your grace replied the earl sees nothing
to disturb the good understanding which
the tranquillity and safety scotland require
should exist between us i am not so ill a friend
 my country as to look closely for such
y a special friend and adviser met in the midst
 the lists having to assist them in determining
what was to be done the earl marshal the
lord high constable the earl crawford
and sir patrick charteris the chief the
clan chattan declared himself willing and desirous
 fighting upon the spot without regard
to the disparity numbers
that said torquil the oak clan
quhele will never consent to you can never
win honour from us with the sword and you
seek but a subterfuge that you may say when
you are defeated as you know you will be that
it was for want the number your band
fully counted out but i make a proposal 
vol iii t
ferqnhard day was the youngest your band
eachin maclan is the youngest ours we
will set him aside in place the man who has
fled from the combat
a most unjust and unequal proposal exclaimed
toshach beg the second as he might
be termed macgillie chattanaeh the life
 the chief is to the clan the breath our
nostrils nor will we ever consent that our chief
shall be exposed to dangers which the captain
 clan quliele does not share
torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan
was about to fail when the objection was made
to hector's being withdrawn from the battle 
and he was meditating how to support his proposal
when eachin himself interfered his
timidity it must be observed was not that
sordid and selfish nature which induces those
who are infected by it calmly to submit to dishonour
rather than risk clanger on the contrary
he was morally brave though constitutionally
timid and the shame avoiding the
combat became at the moment more powerful
than the fear facing it
i will not hear he said a scheme
which will leave my sword sheathed during
this day's glorious combat if i am yoking in
arms there are enough brave men around
me whom i may imitate if i cannot equal
he spoke these words in a spirit which imposed
on torqui and perhaps on the young
chief himself
now god bless his noble heart said the
fosterfather to himself i was sure the foul
spell would be broken through and that the
tardy spirit which besieged him would fly at
the sound the pipe and the first flutter 
the attach 
hear me lord marshal said the constable
 the hour combat may not be much
longer postponed for the day approaches to high
noon let the chief clan chattan take the
half hour which remains to find if he can a
substitute for this deserter if he cannot let
them fight as they stand
content i am said the marshal though
as none his own clan are nearer than fifty
miles i see not how macgillie cbattanach is to
find an auxiliary
that is his business said the high constable
 but if he offers a high reward there
are enough stout yeomen surrounding the
lists who will be glad enough to stretch their
limbs in such a game as is expected i myself
did my quality and charge permit would blithely
take a turn work amongst these wild fellows
and think it fame won
they communicated their decision to the
highlanders and the chief the clan chateau
replied you have judged impartially
and nobly my lords and i deem myself obliged
to follow your direction so make proclamation
heralds that if any one will take his
share with clan batten the honours and
chances this day he shall have present payment
 a gold crown and liberty to fight to
the death in nfy ranks
you are something chary your treasure
chief said the earl marshal a gold crown
is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you
 if there be any man willing to fight for
honour replied macgillie chattanach the
price will be enough and i want not the service
 a fellow who draws his sword for gold alone
the heralds had made their progress moving
half way round the lists stopping from time to
time to make proclamation as they had been
directed without the least apparent disposition
on the part any one to accept the proffered
enlistment some sneered at the poverty
 the highlanders who set so mean a price
upon such a desperate service others affected
resentment that they should esteem the bltod
 citizens so lightly none showed the slightest
intention to undertake the task proposed until
the sound the proclamation reached henry
 the wynd as he stood without the barrier
speaking from time to time with bailie craigdal
lie or rather listening vaguely to what the magistrate
was saying to him
 ha what proclaim they he cried out
a liberal offer on the part macgillie
chattanach said the host the griffin who
proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn
wild cat for the day and be killed a little in his
service that's all
how exclaimed the smith eagerly do
they make proclamation for a man to fight
against the clan quhele 
ay marry do they said griffin but i
think they will find no such fools in perth
he had hardly said th'te word when he beheld
the smith clear the barriers at a single bound
and alight in the lists saying here am i sir
herald henry the wynd willing to do battle
with the clan quhele
a cry admiration ran through the multitude
while the grave burghers not being able
to conceive the slightest reason for henry's behaviour
concluded that his head must be absolutely
turned with the love fighting the
provost was especially shocked
 thou art mad he said henry thou
hast neither twohanded sword nor shirt 
mail
truly no said henry for i parted with
a mailshirt which i had made for myself to
yonder gay chief the clan quhele who will
soon find on bis shoulders with what sort 
blows i clink my rivets as for twohanded
sword why this boy's brand will serve my turn
till i can master a heavier one
this must not be said errol hark
thee armourer by saint diary thou shalt have
my milan hauberk and good spanish sword
i thank your noble hardship sir gilbert
hay but the yoke with which your brave ancestor
turned the battle at loncarty would
serve my turn well enough i am little used to
sword or harness that i have not wrought myself
because i do not well know what blows
the one will bear out without being cracked
or the other lay on without snapping
the cry had in the meanwhile run through
the multitude and passed into the town that
the dauntless smith was about to fight without
armour when just as the fated hour was approaching
the shrill voice a female was heard
screaming for passage through the crowd the
multitude gave place to her importunity and
she advanced breathless with haste under the
burden a mail hauberk and a large twohanded
sword the widow oliver proudfate
was soon recognised and the arms which
bhe bore were those the smith himself which
occupied by her husband on the fatal evening
when he was murdered had been naturally
conveyed to his house with the dead body and
were now by the exertions his grateful widow
brought to the lists at a moment when
such proved weapons were the last consequence
to their owner henry joyfully received
the wellknown arms and the widow with trembling
haste assisted in putting them on and
then took leave him saying god for the
orphans champion and ill luck to all who
come before him 
confident at feeling himself in his wellproved
armour henry shook himself as if to settle
the steel shirt around him and unsheathing the
twohanded sword made it flourish over his
head cutting the air through which it whistled
in the form the figure eight with an ease
and sleight hand that proved how powerfully
and skilfully he could wield the ponderous
weapon the champions were now ordered to
march in their turns around the lists crossing
eo as to avoid meeting each other and making
obeisance as they passed the golden arbour
where the king was seated
while this course was performing most 
the spectators were again curiously comparing
the stature limbs and sinews the two parties
and endeavouring to form a conjecture as to
the probable issue the combat the feud 
a hundred years with all its acts aggression
and retaliation was concentrated in the bosom
 each combatant their countenances seemed
fiercely writhen into the wildest expression 
pride hate and a desperate purpose fighting
to the very last
the spectators murmured a joyful applause
in highwrought expectation the bloody game
wagers were offered and accepted both on the
general issue the conflict and on the feats 
particular champions the clear frank and elated
look henry smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators and odds to
use the modern expression were taken that he
would kill three his opponents before he himself
fell scarcely was the smith equipped for the
combat when the commands the chiefs ordered
the champions into their places and at the
same moment henry heard the voice simon
glover issuing from the crowd who were now
silent with expectation and calling on him
harry smith harry smith what madness
hath possessed thee 
ay he wishes to save his hopeful soninlaw
that is or is to be from the smith's handling
was henry's first thought his second
was to turn and speak with him and his third
that he could on no pretext desert the band
which he had joined or even seem desirous to
delay the fight consistently with honour
he turned himself therefore to the business
 the hour both parties were disposed by
the respective chiefs in three lines each containing
ten men they were arranged with such
intervals between each individual as offered him
scope to wield his sword the blade which was
five feet long not including the handle the second
and third lines were to come up as reserves
in case the first experienced disaster on the
right the array clan quhele the chief
eachin maclan placed himself in the second
line betwixt two his fosterbrothers four
 them occupied the right the first line
whilst the father and two others protected the
rear the beloved chieftain torquil in particular
kept close behind for the purpose covering
him thus eachin stood in the centre 
nine the strongest men his band having
four especial defenders in front one on each
hand and three in his rear
the line the clan chattan was arranged
in precisely the same order only that the chief
occupied the centre the middle rank instead
 being on the extreme right this induced
henry smith who saw in the opposing bands
only one enemy and that was the unhappy ea
chin to propose placing himself on the left 
the front rank the clan chattan but the
leader disapproved this arrangement and
having reminded henry that he owed him obedience
as having taken wages at his hand he
commanded him to occupy the space in the third
line immediately behind himself a post honour
cciuiiiily which henry could not decline
though he accepted it with reluctance
when the clans were thus drawn up opposed
to each other they intimated their feudal animosity
and their eagerness to engage by a wild
scream which uttered by the clan quhele was
answered and echoed back by the clan chattan
the whole at the same time shaking their swords
and menacing each other as if they meant to
conquer the imagination their opponents ere
they mingled in the actual strife
at this trying moment torquil who had
never feared for himself was agitated with
alarm on the part his dault yet consoled by
observing that he kept a determined posture 
and that the few words which he spoke to his
clan were delivered boldly and well calculated
to animate them to combat as expressing
his resolution to partake their fate in death or
victory but there was no time for further observation
the trumpets the king sounded a
charge the bagpipes blew up their screaming
and maddening notes and the combatants starting
forward in regular order and increasing

their pace till they came to a smart run met together
in the centre the ground as a furious
torrent encounters an advancing tide
for an instant or two the front lines hewing
at each other with their long swords seemed
engaged in a succession single combats 
but the second and third ranks soon came upon
either side actuated alike by the eagerness
 hatred and the thirst honour pressed
through the intervals and rendered the
scene a tumultuous chaos over which the huge
swords rose and sunk some still glittering
others streaming with blood appearing from
the wild rapidity with which they were swayed
rather to be put in motion by some complicated
machinery than to be wielded by human hands
some the combatants too much crowded
together to use those long weapons had already
betaken themselves to their poniards and endeavoured
to get within the swordsweep 
those opposed to them in the meantime blood
flowed fast and the groans those who fell began
to mingle with the cries those who fought 
for according to the manner the highlanders
at all times they could hardly be said to shout
but to yell those the spectators whose eyes
were best accustomed to such scenes blood
and confusion could nevertheless discover no
advantage yet acquired by either party the
conflict swayed indeed at different intervals
forwards or backwards butit was only in momentary
superiority which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding
exertion on the other side the wild notes
 the pipers were still heard above the tumult
and stimulated to farther exertions the fury 
the combatants
at once however and as if by mutual agreement
the instruments sounded a retreat it was
expressed in wailing notes which seemed to imply
a dirge for the fallen the two parties disengaged
themselves from each other to take
breath for a few minutes the eyes the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array 
the combatants as they drew off from the contest
but found it still impossible to decide which
had sustained the greater loss it seemed as if
the clan chattan had lost rather fewer men
than their antagonists but in compensation
the bloody plaids and shirts their party for
several on both sides had thrown their mantles
away showed more wounded men than the
clan qahele about twenty both sides lay
on the field dead or dying and arras and legs
lopped off heads cleft to the chine slashes deep
through the shoulder into the breast showed
at once the fury the combat the ghastly character
 the weapons used and the fatal strength
 the arms which wielded them the chief
 the clan chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage and was slightly
wounded eachin also had fought with spirit
surrounded by his bodyguard his sword
was bloody his bearing bold and warlike and
he smiled when old torquil folding him in his
arms loaded him with praises and with blessings

the two chiefs after allowing their followers
to breathe for the space about ten minutes
again drew up in their files diminished by nearly
one third llieir original number they
now chose their ground nearer to the river than
that on which they had formerly encountered
which was encumbered with the wounded
and the slain some the former were observed
from time to time to raise themselves to
gain a glimpse the field and sink back most
 them to die from the effusion blood which
poured from terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore

harry smith was easily distinguished by his
lowland habit as well as his remaining on the
spot where they had first encountered where he
stood leaning on his sword beside a corpse
whose bonneted head carried to ten yards distance
from the body by the force the blow
which had swept it off exhibited the oak leaf
the appropriate ornament the bodyguard 
eachin maclan since he slew this man henry
had not struck a blow but had contented
himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself and some which were aimed at the
chief macgillie chattanach became alarmed
when having given the signal that his men
should again draw together he observed that
his powerful recruit remained at a distance from
the ranks and showed little disposition to join
them
 what ails thee man said the chief
can so strong a body have a mean and cowardly
spirit come and make in to the combat

you as good as called me hireling but now
replied henry if i am such pointing to
the headless corpse i have done enough for
my day's wage
 he that serves me without counting his
hours replied the chief i reward him without
reckoning wages
 then said the smith i fight as a volunteer
and in the post which best likes me
 all that is at your own discretion replied
macgillie chattanach who saw the prudence
 humouring an auxiliary such promise
it is enough said henry and shouldering
his heavy weapon he joined the rest the
combatants with alacrity and placed himself
opposite to the chief the clan quhele
vol in u
it was then for the first time that eachin
showed some uncertainty he had long looked
up to henry as the best combatant which perth
and its neighbourhood could bring into the lists
his hatred to him as a rival was mingled with
recollection the ease with which he had once
though unarmed foiled his own sudden and
desperate attack and when he beheld him with
his eyes fixed in his direction the dripping
sword in his hand and obviously meditating
an attack on him individually his courage fell
and he gave symptoms wavering which did
not escape his fosterfather
it was lucky for eachin that torquil was
incapable from the formation his own temper
and that those with whom he had lived
to conceive the idea one his own tribe much
less his chief and fosterson being deficient
in animal courage could he have imagined
this his grief and rage might have driven him
to the fierce extremity taking eachin's life
to save him from staining his honour but
his mind rejected the idea that hisdault was a
personal coward as something which was monstrous
and unnatural that he was under the
influence enchantment was a solution which
superstition had suggested and he now anxiously
but in a whisper demanded hector does
the spell now darken thy spirit eachin 
yes wretch that i am answered the ua
happy youth and yonder stands the fell enchanter

 what exclaimed torquil and you
wear harness his making norman miserable
boy why brought you that accursed
mail 
if my arrow has flown astray i can but
shoot my life after it answered 
 stand firm you shall see me break
the spell
yes stand firm said torquil he maybe
a fell enchanter but my own ear has heard
and my own tongue has told that eachin shall
leave the battle whole free and un wounded 
let us see the saxon wizard who can gainsay
that he may be a strong man but the fair
forest the oak shall fall stock and bough
ere he lay a finger on my dault ring around
him mv sons bas air son eachin 
sos
the sons torquil shouted back the words
which signify death for hector 
encouraged by their devotion eachin renewed
his spirit and called boldly to the minstrels
 his clan said snas that is strike up
the wild pibroch again sounded the onset 
but the two parties approached each other more
slowly than at first as men who knew and respected
each other's valour henry wynd in
bis impatience to begin the contest advanced
before the clan chattan and signed to eachin
to come on norman however sprang forward
to cover his fosterbrother and there was
a general though momentary pause as if both
parties were willing to obtain an omen the
fate the day from the event this duel
the highlander advanced with his large sword
uplifted as in act to strike but just as he
came within sword's length he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon leapt lightly over the
smith's sword as he fetched a cut at him drev
his dagger and being thus within henry's guard
struck him with the weapon his own gift on
the side the throat directing the blow downwards
into the chest and calling aloud at the
same time you taught me the stab 
but henry wynd wore his own good hauberk
doubly defended with a lining tempered
steel had he been less surely armed his combats
had been ended for ever even as it was
he was slightly wounded
fool he replied striking norman a blow
with the pommel his long sword which
made him stagger backwards you were
taught the thrust but not the parry and fetching
a blow at his antagonist which cleft his
skull through the steelcap he strode over the
lifeless body to engage the young chief who
now stood open before him
but the sonorous voice torquil thundered
out far veil air son eachin another for
hector and the two brethren vho flanked
their chief on each side thrust forward upon
henry and striking both at once compelled
him to keep the defensive
 ff forward race the tiger cat cried
macgillie chattanach save the brave saxon 
let these kites feel your talons 
already much wounded the chief dragged
himself up to the smith's assistance and cut
down one the leichtachy by whom he was assailed
henry's own good sword rid him 
the other
rest air son eachin again for hector
shouted the faithful fosterfather
bas air soi eachin p death for hector
answered two more his devoted sons and
opposed themselves to the fury the smith
and those who had come to his aid while eachin
moving towards the left wing the battle
sought less formidable adversaries and again
by some show valour revived the sinking
hopes his followers the two children the
oak who had covered this movement shared
the fate their brethren for the cry the clan
chattan chief had drawn to that part the field
some his bravest warriors the sons torquit
did not fall unavenged but left dreadful
marks their swords on the persons the
dead and living but the necessity keeping
their most distinguished soldiers around the person
 their chief told to disadvantage on the
w
ieoeial event the combat ami so few were
uow the number who remained lighting that it
was easy to see that the clan chattan hard fifteen
 their number left though most them
wounded and that the clan quhele only
about ten remained whom there were four 
the chiefs bodyguard including torquil himself

they fought and struggled on however and
as their strength decayed their fury seemed to
increase henry wynd now wounded in many
places was still bent on breaking through or
exterminating the band bold hearts who continued
to fight around the object his animosity
but still the father's shout another
for hector was cheerfully answered by the
fatal countersign death for hector and
though the clan quhele were now outnumbered
the combat seemed still dubious it was
bodily lassitude alone that again compelled
them to another pause
the clan chattan were then observed to be
twelve in number but two or three were scarce
able tp stand without leaning on their swords
n
five were left the clan quhele torquil and
his youngest son were the number both slightly
wounded eachin alone had from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against
his person escaped without injury the rage
 both parties had sunk through exhaustion
into sullen desperation they walked staggering
as if in their sleep through the carcasses
 the slain and gazed on them as if again to
animate their hatred towards their sursaving
enemies by viewing the friends they had lost
the multitude soon after beheld the survivors
 the desperate conflict drawing together to
renew the exterminating feud on the banks 
the river as the spot least slippery with blood
and less encumbered with the bodies the
slain
for god's sake for the sake the mercy
which we daily pray for said the kindhearted
old king to the duke albany let this be
ended wherefore should these wretched rags
and remnants humanity be suffered to complete
their butchery surely they will now be
ruled and accept peace on moderate terms 
compose yourself my liege said his brother
 these men are the pest the lowlands
both chiefs are still living if they go
back unharmed the whole day's work is castaway
remember your promise to the council
that you would not cry hold
iyou compel me to a great crime albany
both as a king who should protect his subjects
and as a christian man who respects the brother
 his faith
 you judge wrong my lord said the duke 
these are not loving subjects but disobedient
rebels as my lord crawford can bear witness
 and they are still less christian men for
the prior the dominicans will vouch for me
that they are more than half heathen
the king sighed deeply you must work
your pleasure and are too wise for me to contend
with i can but turn away and shut my eyes
from the sights and sounds a carnage which
makes me sicken but well i know that god
will punish me even for witnessing this waste
 human life

i would to heaven my royal brother said
albany with a voice half choked that the
bloody field we have seen were the worst we had
to see or hear this day i should waste little
sorrow on the wild kerne who lie piled on it
like carrion but he paused
 how exclaimed the king in terror 
what new evil rothsay it must be it is
rothsay speak out what new folly has
been done what fresh mischance 
my lord my liege folly and mischance
are now ended with my hapless nephew
 he is dead he is dead screamed the
agonized parent albany as thy brother i
conjure thee but no i am thy brother no
longer as thy king dark and subtle man i
charge thee to tell the worst 
albany faltered out the details are but
imperfectly known to me but the certainty is
that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his
apartment last night from sudden illness as i
have heard 
o rothsay o my beloved robert 
would to god i had died for thee my son my
son
so spoke in the emphatic words scripture
the helpless and bereft father tearing his greybeard
and hoary hair while albany speechless
and consciencestruck did not venture to interrupt
the tempest his grief but the agony 
the king's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fmyj a mood so contrary to the gentleness and
timidity his nature that the remorse albany
was drowned in his fear
and this is the said the king 
thy moral saws irreligious punishments but
the besotted father who gave the son into thy
hands who gave the innocent lamb to the
butcher is a king and thou shalt know it to
thy cost shall the murderer stand in presence
 his brother stained with the blood that
brother's son no what ho without there 
maclouis brandanes treachery 
murder take arms if you love the stewart 
maclouis with several the guards rushed
into the apartment
murder and treason exclaimed the miserable
king brandanes your noble prince 
here his grief and agitation interrupted for a
moment the fatal information it was his object
to convey at length he resumed his broken
speech an axe and a block instantly into the
courtyard arrest the word choked his
utterance
arrest whom my noble liege said maclouis
who observing the king influenced by
a tide passion so different from the gentleness
 his ordinary demeanour almost conjectured
that his brain had been disturbed by
the unusual horrors the combat he had witnessed
 whom shall i arrest my liege he
replied here is none but your grace's royal
brother albany 
most true said the king his brief fit 
vindictive passion soon dying away most
true none but albany none but my parents
child none but my brother o god enable me
to quell the sinful passion which glows in this
bosom sancta marian ora pro nobis 
maclouis cast a look wonder towards the
duke albany who endeavoured to hide his
confusion under an affectation deep sympathy
and muttered to the officer 
the great misfortune has been too much
for his understanding
what misfortune please your grace replied
maclouis i have heard none
how not heard the death my nephew
rothsay 
the duke rothsay dead my lord 
albany exclaimed the faithful braudauewith
the utmost horror and astonishment when
how and where fnq floi iio ho sfuog
two days since the manner as yet unknown
 at falkland
maclouis gazed at the duke for an instant 
then with a kindling eye and determined look
said to the king who seemed deeply engaged in
his mental devotion my liege a minute or
two since you left a word one word unspoken
let it pass yyir lips and your pleasure
is law to your brandanes 
 i was praying against temptation maclouis
said the heartbroken king and you
bring it to me would you arm a madman with
a drawn weapon but oh albany my friend
my brother my bosom counsellor how how
comest thou by the heart to do this 
albany seeing that the king's mood was
softening replied with more firmness than before
 my castle is no barrier against the
power death i have n and why unfortunate i pray you exclaimed
the youth if i am coward and villain have
not villainy and cowardice command over the
elements have i not braved the water without
its choking me and trod the firm earth without
its opening to devour me and shall a
mortal oppose my purpose 
 he raves alas said catharine haste
to call some help he will not harm me but
i fear he will do evil to himself see how he
stares down on the roaring waterfall i
the gleewoman hastened to do as she was
ordered and conachar's halffrenzied spirit
seemed relieved by her absence catharine
he said now she is gone i will say i know
thee i know thy love peace and hatred 
war but hearken i have rather than strike
a blow at my enemy given up all that a man
s
calls dearest i have lost honour fame and
friends and such friends he placed his hands
before this face oh their love surpassed the
love woman why should i hide my tears 
all know my shame all should see my sorrow
yes all might see but who would pity
it catharine as i ran like a madman down
the strath man and woman called shame on
me the beggar to whom i flung an alms that
i might purchase one blessing threw it back in
disgust and with a curse upon the coward 
each bell that tolled rung out shame on the recreant
caitiff the brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating the wild winds in their rustling
and howling the hoarse waters in their dash
and roar cried out upon the dastard the
faithful nine are still pursuing me they cry
with feeble voice strike but one blow in our
revenge we all died for you 
while the unhappy youth thus raved a rustling
was heard in the bushes there is but one
way he exclaimed springing upon the parapet
but with a terrified glance towards the thicket
through which one or two attendants were stealing
with the purpose surprising him but
the instant he saw a human form emerge from
the cover the thicket he waved his hands
wildly over his head and shrieking out bas
air eachin plunged down the precipice into
the raging cataract beneath
it is needless to say that aught save thistledown
must have been dashed to pieces in such
a fall but the river was swelled and the remains
 the unhappy youth were never seen
a varying tradition has assigned more than one
supplement to the history it is said by one
account that the young captain clan quhele
swam safe to shore far below the linnsof carats
 and that wandering disconsolately in the
deserts ranch he met with father clement
who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit on the principle the old
culdees he converted it is said the heartbroken
and penitent conachar who lived with
him in his cell sharing his devotion and privations
till death removed them in succession
another wilder legend supposes that he was
snatched from death by the daioneshieyoviiayy
folk aud that he continues to wander throws
wood and wild arrived like an ancient highlander
but carrying his sword in his left hand the
phantom appears always in deep grief sometimes
he seems about to attack the traveller
but when resisted with courage always flies
these legends are founded on two peculiar
points in his story his evincing timidity and
his committing suicide both them circumstances
unexampled in the history a mountain
chief
when simon glover having seen his friend
henry duly taken care in his own house in
curfew street arrived that evening at the
place campsieie he found his daughter extremely
ill a fever in consequence the
scenes to which she had lately been a witness
and particularly the catastrophe her late playmate
the affection the gleemaiden rendered
her so attentive and careful a nurse that
the glover said it should not be his fault if she
ever touched lute again save for her own amusement

it was some time ere simon ventured to tell
hi daughter henrys late exploits and his
severe wounds and he took care to make the
most the encouraging circumstance that her
faithful lover had refused both honour and
wealth rather than become a professed soldier
and follow the douglas catharine sighed
deeply and shook her head at the history 
bloody palm sunday on the north inch but
apparently she had reflected that men rarely
advance in civilization or refinement beyond
the ideas their own age and that a headlong
and exuberant courage like that henry
smith was in the iron days in which they lived
preferable to the deficiency which had led to
conachar's catastrophe if she had any doubts
on the subject they were removed in due time
by henry's protestations so soon as restored
health enabled him to plead his own cause
i should blush to say catharine that i
am even sick the thoughts doing battle
yonder last field showed carnage enough to
glut a tiger i am therefore resolved to hang
up my broad sword never to be drawn more
unless against the enemies scotland
 and should scotland call for it said catharine
 i will buckle it round you
and catharine said the joyful glover
we will pay largely for soul masses for those
who have fallen by henry's sword and that
will not only cure spiritual flaws but make us
friends with the church again
for that purpose father said catharine
the hoards the wretched d wining may be
applied he bequeathed them to me but i think
you would not mix his base bloodmoney with
your honest gains 
i would bring the plague into ray house as
soon said the resolute glover
the treasures the wicked apothecary were
distributed accordingly among the four monasteries
 nor was there ever after a breath suspicion
concerning the orthodoxy old simon
or his daughter
henry and catharine were married within
four months after the battle the north inch
and never did the corporations the glovers
and hammered trip their sworddance so featly
as at the wedding the boldest burgess and
brightest maiden in perth ten months after
il
a gallant infant filled the wellspread cradle
and was rocked by louise to the tune 
bold and true
in bonnet blue
the names the boy's sponsors are recorded
as ane hie and mighty lord archibald
erl douglas ane honorable and gudeknicht
schir patrick charteris kinfauns and ane
gracious princess marjory dowaire this serene
highness robert umquhile duke rothsay
under such patronage a family rises
fast and several the most respected houses
in scotland but especially in perthshire and
many individuals distinguished both in arte and
arms record with pride their descent from the
gow chrom and the fair maid perth

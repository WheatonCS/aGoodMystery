it was in the second week their visit at
digby castle that one morning as harry
 and lucy were left alone in the workshop
harry whirring happily at the lathe he
 felt lucy suddenly touch his arm and
 saw her looking up in his face as if eager
to say something rather reluctantly he
slackened the whirring motion and held
back the tool
well what do you want my dear
 want you to come with me i have
made a discovery follow me harry
harry laid down his tool and followed
the workshop was a large irregular
room surrounded by shelves and drawers

and racks for tools with various benches for
carpenters and carvers and for braziers and
smiths three lathes were placed obliquely
to the windows in the middle the room
stood a circular saw machine a lapidary's
wheel and a treadle blowpipe and there
were two flagged recesses partly screened
off and contrived for a camp forge and a
small casting furnace there was another
recess elevated two or three steps above
the floor which contained some tall models
and behind these lucy had discovered
a door which being unlatched she
had pushed a little more open and now
throwing it quite back she said look
harry at what is in that room he
looked in and his eyes sparkled with joy
an electrical machine a great battery
 
but with his foot on the threshold he
stopped and laying his hand on her arm
said do not go in i do not know whether
we may i hope you have not been in
there 
 oh no said lucy m would not
without asking you
and i must not without asking sir
rupert but lucy when you first saw
this what did you think it was 
oh i knew directly that it was an
electrical machine said lucy
you never saw one before that i know
 said harry i saw my uncle's but
you did not it has been packed up ever
since you came home from aunt pierrepoint's

very true but i have seen a print 
one with electrical machine written underneath
 and i knew it directly from that 
but i do not understand any thing about it
as you saw my uncle's real machine you
can explain this to me we need not go
in harry but just as we stand here you
might show me the use all the parts first
tell me the use that glass cylinder which
is something like a broad grindstone 
glass with a sort a silk curtain hanging
over it and a long windlass handle and
i see a chain and
yes yes interrupted harry you see
a great deal which i cannot explain to
you the use
why not said lucy
 you had better ask my father or sir
rupert said harry
so i will then said lucy for i am
exceedingly curious about electricity i
want to know all about the electrical kite
and the leyden phial and conductors and
nonconductors and electrics and nonelectric
and electrics per se
my dear lucy cried harry how
comes it that you know all these names
which you rattle off so finely 
i thought i should surprise you said
lucy laughing
i do not remember my father ever
having talked them to you said any
and i am sure i never did
no you never did but i heard them
at aunt pierrepoinfs and i will tell you
how it happened it all began from a bit
 wit one day when there were a great
many visitors they were talking a lady
who was very delicate very nervous
aunt pierrepoint advised her to try electricity
and a gentleman said he would
answer for it that the ley den phial would
do her more good than any other phial in
the world my aunt smiled and everybody
smiled and said he was witty
when the company had gone away i
asked my aunt what he meant she said
only a jeu de mot child a pun i
asked what the leyden phial was she
said it was rather a glass jar than a phial
and that electrical people with their machines
contrived to fill or charge these
jars with electricity i asked what electricity
was but she had not time to tell
me any more then she was in a great
hurry dressing
a few days afterwards some the same
people came again and i heard that the
nervous lady had received two or three
shocks and was wonderfully better was
quite set up again and that electricity
had cured some old duke a palsy in his
arm he had lost the use it but after
one shock he could carry his glass to his
mouth then every body said electricity
was a wonderfully charming thing but the
week afterwards i heard that it was all a
mistake that the duke's arm had fallen
back again and that the nervous lady was
as low as ever then they talked people
that had been knocked down and a professor
somebody that had been killed formerly
by electricity and an old lady said there
should have been an act parliament
against it from the first then they talked
 an electrical kite and conductors and
lightning i asked aunt pierrepoint again
afterwards what was meant by an electrical
kite and conductors she told me that
they were talking the great dr franklin's
kite that he was a wonderful man
and had a wonderful kite which brought
lightning down from the clouds and that
he was the inventor conductors for
houses and churches and people in thunder
storms but she said she could not
explain more to me without being a professor
 electricity which she did not
pretend to be now harry as you say
that you saw my uncle's electrical machine
when i was away you can explain it all
to me
 i am afraid not said harry my
uncle showed me several entertaining
experiments and i found in the closet
within my room a most entertaining 
on electricity which i once sat up reading
at night till my candle was burned
out there was an account otto garrick's
making and whirling a sulphur globe
and seeing for the first time sparks and
flashes light come from it in the dark
then i got to the leyden jar and the first
electrical shock and franklin's sending
up his kite in the thunder storm i was
exceedingly happy that night but i believe
my head was as much puzzled as
yours was at aunt pierrepoint's in the
morning when my mother found i had
been up half the night she was not
pleased and she made me promise not to
do so again and i never did i only got
up as early as possible in the morning and
at every spare minute i was at the in
the closet it was a great thick quarto
my father however stopped me before i
had got half through it he said it was
not fit for me and it is true i did not
understand half a quarter it the but
i think i could iioic and i wish i could
see it aoam
j
 but harry why did you never tell me
all this before asked lucy and why
did you never mention to me the electrical
machine or leyden jar or even electricity

i had my own reasons said harry
one was that you had not come up to
electricity before we began our journey 
and indeed i was afraid puzzling you
because i had been puzzled myself i
thought too that my father could tell you
better whenever he pleased besides i
was not clear that he would like my goingback
to electricity then but i dare say 
i mean i hope he will have no objection to

st
it now and that sir rupert will show us
some experiments with this machine i
will go and ask my father what he thinks
about its concluded any
let us go directly then said lucy 
 and while you are asking papa i will ask
sir rupert if he will at least give me an
electric shock
no no first let us be sure my fathers
said harry
 i am sure he can have no objection
said lucy but when they asked him about
it lucy observed that though he seemed
unwilling to refuse their request yet he
looked somewhat sorry that it had been
made she did not know why however
as to the essential point he made no
objection to her having a shock and seeing
the electric spark he approved their
seeing some the experiments mentioned
in scientific dialogues such as thatof the
pith balls and the poker and that for
which harry specially pleaded as he was
sure it would divert lucy the experiment
 the dancing paper figures in 
short their father said that he could not
object to their seeing any electrical experiments
which their friend sir rupert
might think proper to show them he
could trust safely to his judgment in this
and in every thing that concerned harry
to him they next went
they found him in the library settled
in his armchair reading and looking so
comfortable that they did not like to disturb
him he was indeed very happy
looking over a new pamphlet that interested
him particularly an account the
late m guinand and the improvements
made by him in the manufacture flintglass
for large telescopes harry and lucy
hesitating went up to his chair one to
each elbow and stood still looking behind
him at each other they had a mind to
retreat without making known their request
but he looked up and smiling
kindly asked what they wanted they
told him and when he found that notwithstanding
their great desire to see the
electrical machine they had not been farther
than the threshold the room he
half rose from his chair but sitting down
again said i must finish this passage
first you may read it over my shoulder
if you will cannot leave the story in
this note half told
while making this glass m guinand
never permitted any persons to be present
except his wife and son who assisted him
on these occasions they were generally
secluded for many days and nights in his
little laboratory but when he had completed
the operation if the result was
favourable his friends and neighbours were
admitted and partook some refreshment
while offering their congratulations
a year or two before his death m
guinand tried an experiment on a larger
scale than he had previously attempted
after much exertion he had succeeded in
producing a perfect objectglass eighteen
inches diameter this glass had been put
into the oven for the last time in order to
be gradually cooled and the operation
being now considered as completed the
friends were as usual admitted in the
midst their congratulations on this unprecedented
success after an unusually
long seclusion the fire by some accident
caught the roof the building on this
alarming occasion all present exerted themselves
 and after some trouble the flames
were extinguished but not before some
water had found its way into the oven and
destroyed its precious contents 
 ah poor m guinand cried lucy
i hope he was more successful the
next time said harry
he was nearly eighty years old
harry said sir rupert and the discouragement
caused by this misfortune and
the great expense those experiments
prevented his attempting any more on a
similar scale before he died i should
have told you that he was a poor watchmaker
in a country village in switzerland
and that neither artists nor philosophers
have ever succeeded in making glass equal
to his
sir rupert laid down the with the
air a man who makes but is willing to
make some sacrifice and he attended his
young friends to the electrical machines
as lucy called it she watched
every thiner that was done harry went
to the handle the slabs cylinder and
was going to turn it but sir rupert stopped
him as he said that he had something to
show lucy first he took up a glass tube
and rubbed it with his silk handkerchief
then holdings it to harry's head lucy saw
the hair rise up and bend towards it and
a feather on the table jumped up and
hung to it as sir rupert held the olass
tube near it
 just like what i have seen harry do
with the glass stopper the decanter after
dinner said lucy and i have seen
the same with a stick sealingwax after
it has been rubbed on a coat sleeve and
i remember long ago when we were
little children that we used to play with
an amber eoor mamma's and that
little bits paper and feathers stuck to it
just so
true said sir rupert this property
 attracting light bodies was observed
in amber hundreds years ago
by the ancients the latin name for
amber which is derived from the greek
is electrum thence our word electric and
electricity all that was originally known
about it to the ancients was this power 
attracting light bodies remember i say
attracting lucy did you observe anything
more when you amused yourself with
your amber qggj and the bits paper and
feathers 
yes said lucy we saw that after a
time they would jump no more they stood
quite still or they jumped back i recollect
do not you harry that they jumped
forward and backward alternately
 that is said sir rupert that they
were alternately attracted and repdltd i
am glad that you observed and have remembered
that you will now understand
what i mean by the repellent as well as
the attractive power amber but this
repellent power was never observed by the
ancients nor known to the modes till
about a hundred and fifty years ago when
it was thought a great discovery
lucy expressed some surprise that this
had never been observed till so lately
sir rupert smiled and said there is more
to be seen and known about amber with
which perhaps you are not yet yourself
acquainted did you ever see sparks ora
flash light come from amber after it
has been rubbed or did you ever hear a
little crackling noise from it
never sir said lucy
nor was it likely that you should
said sir rupert because your amber
egg probably was not a sufficiently large
piece that substance to produce the
effect but sparks have been seen from
a large smooth piece amber and this
observation created much surprise when
first it was made which was about the
same time when its repellent power was
as i told you discovered then the
same properties were observed in jet sulphur
resin and glass and still the same
word the same name electricity was used
to express the supposed cause all these
properties in whatever substance they were
found to those substances in which
after using friction these properties appeared
people gave the name electrics
and to those from which they could not
be obtained by any degree rubbing they
gave the name o nonelectrics amber
sealingwax and glass for instance are
called electrics this table and the poker
for example which you might rub with
your hand for ever without making them
attract light bodies and without obtaining
from them any sparks are called nonelectric
but take care lucy that this
name nonelectrics does not mislead
you into taking it for granted that in nonelectric
there is no electricity when we
come to your brother's favourite experiments
i shall show you that the electric
spark can be obtained from the poker by
other means experiments tried by various
people at different times in afferent countries
within the last sixty years have
ascertained that not only in the poker and
in the table but in every substance in
nature with which we are acquainted
solid or fluid vegetable animal or mineral
in earth air and water electricity is
to be found though in various proportions 
and to be obtained or made apparent to
our senses by different means remember
then that electrics is only the name
given to those bodies from which electricity
cannot be had by friction and
when i use the word electricity i mean
the supposed cause the electrical properties
 bodies i must however observe
that as yet we are imperfectly acquainted
with this science and what is
known i know but a small part and 
that i can explain very little to you however
some the principal facts i can tell
you and some the principal phenomena
or appearances i can show you in the
first place before i say any more we weill
show you some electric sparks and you
shall have an electric shock which you
are so curious to feel turn the handle 
the glass cylinder harry
as he worked it sir rupert showed
lucy that the glass cylinder as it revolved
rubbed against a cushion which was fixed
so as to press hard against it this cushion
he told her is called the rubber instead
 rubbing with the silk handkerchief
as you saw me rub the glass tube friction
is in this manner more conveniently produced

when this had been done sufficiently
harry held his knuckles to a brass knob at
the a tin cylinder belonging to the
machine and which sir rupert told them
was a conductor immediately lucy heard
a slight crackling noise and saw sparks
come either from the brass to harry's
knuckles or from harry's knuckles to the
brass she did not know which they passed
so quickly she followed his example 
and holding her knuckles to the brass knob
felt with some surprise the tingling sensation
produced by the electric spark sir
rupert now told her to stand upon a little
wooden stool with thick glass legs which
he set on the floor near the machine he
desired her to hold a chain the other 
 which was fastened to the conductor
after the handle the glass cylinder had
been again turned sufficiently he told
lucy to give her hand to harry she
exclaimed that she felt the same tingling
sensation she had perceived before on
touching the knob from the conductor
yes said sir rupert you acted
the part a conductor and harry received
an electric spark from you
he now told her to get off the stool 
and said that he would give her an electric
shock if she pleased but warned her that
perhaps she might not like it
then give me only a little shock sir
if you please a very little shock my dear
sir pray 
sir rupert promised that it should be
very slight he desired her to hold in her
lefthand a chain that touched the outside
 a glass jar which sir rupert told her
was a leyden phial he put into her
righthand a bit brass wire with
which he told her to touch the brass
knob fixed on the top the jar she did
so and at that instant she felt a shock
slight as it was it made lucy start violently
at first she thought harry had
given her a blow on the elbow then
holding her elbow fast she said that her
curiosity was satisfied and that if this
was the famous electrical shock she never
desired to feel it aoain
harry could not help laughing a little
at her start and surprise which seemed to
him so much greater than the occasion
deserved recovering lucy began to
look a little ashamed sir rupert observed
for her comfort that great philosophers
had been not a little frightened when
first they felt the electric shock
philosophers sir said harry how
did they show that they were frightened
by the strangely exaggerated accounts
they gave their sensations one gentleman
after his first shock wrote to a friend
that he felt himself so struck in his arms
breast and shoulders that he lost his
breath that he was two days before he
recovered from the effects the blow and
the terror and that he would not take a
second shock for the kingdom france
another after trying the shock from the
leyden phial said his whole body had
been affected with convulsions and that
he felt as if a heavy stone lay upon his
head
lucy hoped it would be remembered
that her little start and first fright had all
been over in a minute or less instead 
lasting two days harry but i suppose
added she that their shocks must have
been much greater than mine
sir rupert said that the shocks they
received could not have been much more
violent than what she had felt
harry asked how he could be sure 
that sir rupert answered that as they
had described the apparatus they used an
estimate could be formed the utmost
power the shock which they could possibly
have received they used only a
small glass bowl said he and not
coated as the ley den phial is now they
had no electrical battery nor any means
by which they could give a powerful
shock
lucy observed that harry was perfectly
satisfied by this answer therefore she was
sure that he understood it but for her
part she did not in the least comprehend
what sir rupert meant she was very
desirous to know more but so many questions
occurred to her that she could scarcely
tell which to ask first she wished to
know why she had been made to stand
upon a stool when she gave harry the
electric sparks or why the stool unlike
all others had legs glass she wished
to know what was the cause her receiving
a shock from touching the knob on
the leyden jar with the wire but her
first question was to sir rupert's surprise
 has this electric shock been really 
any use to sick people or to men or women
in palsies 
sir rupert said lie did not know it
had at first been thought to be medical
service and it was said to have restored
persons to the use their limbs but
afterwards this had been doubted and
the apparent or transient advantage was
ascribed to the effect on the imagination
so far lucy had not obtained much more
actual knowledge than she had had before 
but the diffidence with which sir rupert
spoke gave her an idea the gi'eat caution
and modesty real philosophers'speech so
unlike the rash assertions halfinformed
persons or conceited pretenders to
science
in compliance with harry's request sir
rupert next showed lucy some the first
experiments which harry had seen at his
uncle's which need not be detailed here
as an exact description the experiment
o the pith bails and the pokei and 
the dancing paper figures may be found in
scientific dialogues illustrating the nature
 electric attraction and repulsion lucy
was amused with these experiments but
fl
she could not take in all the explanations 
she became a little confused and puzzled
about conductors and nonconductors
which having candidly confessed sir rupert
advised her to stop assuring her that
he would at another time when her mind
should be rested and refreshed return to
the subject and promising that he would
reward her candour by doing his best to
make it clear to her which he added he
did not doubt but he should be able to
accomplish if she would not either despair
or be in a hurry if she would only
have patience with herself and with him
and allow to both sufficient time and
now said he i shall be glad to return
to my pamphlet and you and your brother
will be glad i think to take a good run
or a walk suppose we take the walk
lady digby was talking across the
fields through copsewood and over the
ford to farmer dobson's ah ha you
like that i never knew young people that
did not prefer a difficult to an easy i
will not say a dirty to a clean walk well 
by the time bonnets and hats and walking
shoes are on and papa and mamma and
lady digby and all assembled in the hall
ready for a march i have a notion i shall
have done my pamphlet and be with you
too
this walk was as rambling and as
scrambling with as many hedges and
ditches to get over and as many bad
passes and unstable stepping stones to
cross as hearts youth could desire or
legs age accomplish
farmer dobson the snuggest yeomen
and the best tenants met the party at
his outermost gate with a warm welcome
for his landlord and his landlord's friends
whomsoever they might be his eye
brightened when he saw young folks
 he had a power his own thank god
for them he said as he opened wide the
house door he loved young folks he
added and requested that they would all
vol c
be so agreeable as to come in and rest
themselves after their long walk
after they had sat for some minutes and
after orchard and poultryyard and farmyard
had been all duly visited and that it
was time to think returning home harry's
and lucy's satisfaction was completed by
the farmer's assuring them that if they
had any disliking to go back the same
road they came they might return quite a
new way by passing through sopha
turnstile and higglesham pike down the
fields reddeer manor and so getting
by the short cut straight up the back way
to the castle
harry listened most attentively to these
directions but as he did not know anyone
 the places named it might have
been even dinner time before they reached
digby castle had he persisted in acting as
avantcourier but he gave up the point
at higglesham pike whence under the
straight forward guidance sir rupert's
cane they reached home by the usual
hour for luncheon
sir rupert looked at his watch and
finding that he had ample time sat down
to write some letters telling harry and
lucy that when the clock should strike
next he would be ready for them at the
electrical machine
punctual as the clock harry and lucy
were opposite to the electrical machine 
and sir rupert equally punctual shut the
door after him ere the clock had done
striking
lucy my dear said sir rupert
i hope you have put out your head
whatever it was that puzzled you about
conductors the name conductors is
given to all substances which conduct electricity
from one body to another those
which will not do this we call nonconductors
is this clear to you
quite clear said lucy do not
know what puzzled me before but i believe
it was that nonconductors are also
sometimes called electrics
yes it has been found that all originally
c 
electric substances are also nonconductors
 electrics and conductors lists have been
made and you may look at them at your
leisure it is enough for our present purpose
to tell you that earth and water are
conductors and so are all the metals 
metallic conductors are the best this
brass chain is one so is that iron rod and
so is this tin tube
lucy saw and understood this and now
hoped they might go on to the leyden jar
my dear lucy said sir rupert
your brother tells me you are fond 
french proverbs did you ever hear faut
reculer pour mieux sauter i must therefore
go back if you please to the reign 
charles the second where i left off just
before harry persuaded me to show you
the experiment the poker many 
the members the royal society which
was at that time first established were at
work on electrical experiments among
others was a philosopher with whose name
you are perhaps acquainted boyle
lucy asked harry if this was his boyle
the great vacuumman 
yes answered harry
he was one the first persons who
had a glimpse electric light continued
sir rupert which he first saw from a
diamond
a diamond sir said lucy i
thought you told us it was first seen in
amber
 i said it was seen in amber but i did
not tell you it was first seen in amber
said sir rupert i should not have mentioned
that out its order in point 
time boyle is supposed to have been one
 the first discoverers electric lioht
he noticed it as he was rubbing diamond
in the dark
but was boyle the first person who
made this discovery said harry doubtingly

perhaps said sir rupert smiling
you claim the honour it for the children
in the arabian tale who wakened
their mother by quarrelling for the diamond
that gave light in the dark
harry and lucy both smiled
but seriously sir said harry did
not otto garrick see sparks and flashes
from his whirling globe sulphur
sparks and flashes he certainly saw
from his sulphur globe but whether before
boyle saw the flash from his diamond
is to this hour a disputed point and i
advise our avoiding all disputes
i am glad it said lucy they
hinder one from getting on
but said harry i thought it was
but justice to settle this and to give boyle
the honour the discovery if it was really
his especially as i love otto so much
very right my honourable friend
said sir rupert preserve that spirit 
justice all your life but for the present
consider that if we were to attempt to
settle all the disputes about priority 
discoveries in electricity we might stand
here all daw and be found in the dark at
last now let us go on and keep safe in
the use the impersonal pronoun it it
was discovered i assure you harry 
am willing to give all due honour to your
favourite otto garrick for the ingenuity
 his whirling globe sulphur to excite
friction by means which he made the
great discovery electric repulsion but
harry it is remarkable that he missed
another discovery which was absolutely
under his hand
 under his hand what how sir v
cried harry
 you recollect or you forget perhaps
continued sir rupert how he made hi
globe he melted the sulphur in a hollow
globe glass and then broke the glass to
get out his sulphur ball little imagining
that the glass which he broke and threw
away was a more highly electric substance
and would have answered his purpose
better than that upon which he was
intent
 that is curious but he could not
tell that beforehand said harry
 no but he might have tried he need
not have taken it for granted that glass is
not electric
harry asked if sir isaac newton who
lived at the same time as boyle and was
one the early members the royal
society had made any discovery in electricity

yes said sir rupert he made one
and but one discovery importance ashe
was rubbing a glass lens he observed
that it became electric on the side the
glass opposite to that on which it was
rubbed this circumstance i did not
mention to you because i cannot explain
its consequence without entering into explanations
that would not suit you at present
we will go on where we were
after the flashes light from the sulphur
globe there was darkness on the subject 
electricity for some time public curiosity
which had been suddenly excited as suddenly
grew tired and fell asleep in england
from the reign charles the second
till the reign queen anne when it was
first wakened i think by mr hawksbee
who set to work by whirling a globe 
glass he also provided himself with a
globe sulphur and one sealingwax
inclosing another wood and he had a
fourth made rosin with all these he tried
experiments the chief result which was
the discovery that all known substances
glass is the most electric this proved the
greatest convenience as well as importance
to science as glass can be so easily moulded
and blown into different forms it was best
adapted to the use every experimenter
and from that time became the principal
part every electrical apparatus in the
form tubes globes cylinders and circular
plates
still philosophers were as much puzzled
about conductors and nonconductors as
you were this morning lucy it was
only by experiments that they were enabled
to settle which were which and many
were tried at this period by two friends
mr wheeler and mr gray who in conc

junction with one another laboured to
ascertain how far they could communicate
electricity to what height and to what
distance from balconies they let down
long hollow canes and in great barns they
stretched wooden rods and strings packthread
sometimes supported by others 
silk with considerable difficulty they
conveyed electricity by these lines 
communication about seven hundred feet
but they were as it seemed still much in
doubt which substances served their purposes
and which did not besides their
imperfect knowledge conductors another
difficulty occurred they found that
the electricity which they communicated
to bodies or which existed in electrics
was dissipated after a short time it was
discovered that these bodies parted with
their electricity to other surrounding objects
 to the earth and to the air they
perceived that their labour must be vain
if as fast as they poured the electric fluid
into the substances on which they were
trying experiments it was lost before they
accomplished their object conveying it to
a distance
some new contrivances were required
to counteract and remedy this inconvenience
they separated as well as they
could the substances on which they were
operating from all others and hung them
from lines dry cotton and silk finding
that these were not conductors some
 their experiments were tried upon
living creatures they suspended a child
by silken lines and tried to communicate
electricity to him they electrified iijin
as you were electrified this morning while
standing on the glasslegged stool and
only felt the tingling sensation you described
but the electric shock had never
yet been felt and though sparks had been
communicated to the human body no one
at this time suspected that electricity
existed in it
public attention in england was fixed
upon these experiments by the lectures 
one whose name harry i think you
know a great mechanic dr defaulters
but it was in france that electricity
now became particularly popular
this was in the reign louis the fifteenth
who was contemporary you know
with our george the second the abbe
colet a very ingenious and celebrated
man began by repeating the english experiments
along with his friend m du
fay whose name is less known i cannot
tell why by using wet packthread for
their line communication they succeeded
in conducting electricity along the
walks a garden above a thousand yards
which was then considered wonderful
at a famous experiment however exhibited
at shooter's hill it has since been
conveyed above four miles i should not
have told you this out due order but
for the honour old england harry i
could not resist i beg the abbe nollet's
pardon he succeeded as i told you in
communicating electricity above a thousand
yards by means a line wet
packthread the general observation had
long been made by gray and others that
moisture assisted in the communication 
electricity yet it had never occurred to
them that water was a conductor now it
was ascertained that water is a good conductor

the abbe nollet and his friend m du
fay repeated gray's experiment suspending
living creatures by lines silk
and setting them on cakes rosin or
stools glass as nonconductors for the
purpose preventing the electricity communicated
to them from beings carried down
to the earth this was called insulating
them placing them as it were in an
island m du fay had himself suspended
in lines silk and electrified and delighted
he was but infinitely more so
when to his surprise he saw what no
one had ever before seen a spark electric
fire drawn from the human body
the abbe nollet declared he never could
forget the astonishment he felt when first
he saw a spark electric fire come from
a human creature
this experiment and others upon
electric attraction and repulsion were immediately
repeated before the french academy
 sciences curiosity was raised among
all ranks in paris and crowds people
flocked to see them exhibited as it had
been discovered that electricity could be
conveyed from one person as well as from
one inanimate substance to another people
stood hand in hand in circles to be electrified
and the novelty and surprise the
effect were entertaining to all
did they feel a shock such as i had
this morning asked lucy
 no not a shock said sir rupert 
only that slighter sensation which was
attended by the snapping noise that you
heard when the sparks came from your
hand to the brass knob and from the brass
knob to your hand as to the electric
shock that was not learnt till the discovery
 the ley den phial but the abbe
colet's experiments were sufficiently wonderful
at that time to produce general admiration
franklin was then as well as i
recollect at paris and saw nobles experiments
when he returned to america
his powerful mind set to work on the subject
with all the requisites that could
promise i might almost say humanlyspeaking
ensure success acute observation
indefatigable patience and great caution
in trying experiments with the habits
 close reasoning and active invention
but i must not let enthusiasm for franklin
draw me out my course it is not yet
time to follow him to the country which
he is the glory first justice calls me to
holland now lucy we come to the
leyden jar but for one moment more let
me try your patience it is very difficult to
be patient i know when just in sight 
your object
lucy's eye glanced at the tray full 
jars which she saw near the electrical
machine before her but she forbore to ask
any question she stood an edifying example
 patience and the admiration 
harry
i must say a word or two to you
my patient lucy continued sir rupert
about this electrical machine you do
not imagine that it came into the world as
you now see it ready armed with conductors
and provided with all that could
fit it for the service electrical philosophers
far from it this machine such
as you now see it is the result the combined
observation ingenuity and labour
 a succession philosophers who have
been at work for above one hundred and
fifty years trying experiments on electricity
 and in fact this machine contains
the evidence and register their progress
when the name and the knowledge electricity
was confined to one substance no
apparatus was necessary the man rubbed
his piece amber with his hand or on
the sleeve his coat and his business
was done with this he could see and
show all the wonders which he knew
the existence but when knowledge increased
and when the lists electric
substances and conductors swelled and
lenotenet when experiments were to be
tried with globes glass and conductors
 metal with balls and points and lines
 silk all these things were by degrees
arranged into the form you see a cylinder
 glass is used in this machine instead
 a globe it is found that this
shape is preferable lucy do you now
perceive the use the glass legs to the
stool on which we placed you when you
were electrified and when you gave a spark
to harry 
lucy said she thought that they were to
prevent the electricity from being carried
down to the earth glass being a nonconductor
she supposed that she was put
upon it for the same reason that the manor
boy to be electrified was set upon the
cake rosin
you reward me for my pains said
sir rupert or rather you complete my
pleasure in teaching you lucy for you
show me that you have been attending
and that you have perfectly understood all
that i have been saying
harry looked far prouder than if praised
himself
now i hope the leyden jar will not
disappoint you after all continued sir
rupert it was so called simply because
it was invented at ley den and by
means a phial or small bottle its properties
were discovered by a dutchman 
the name muschenbroek about eighty
years ago and in this manner having
observed like all those who had tried experiments
on the subject that electrified
bodies when exposed to the atmosphere
soon lose their electricity and were capable
 retaining but a small portion he
determined to try whether he could not
prevent this loss and whether he could
accumulate a greater quantity by surrounding
the substance to which electricity
was to be communicated by some nonconductor
instead suspending it in the air
as formerly by silk lines or supporting it
upon rosin or glass the experiment
could be simply tried with water and glass 
he chose water as being a powerful conductor
and glass as it is the most perfect
electric and nonconductor electricity
was to be communicated from a metal
conductor to the water in a glass phial
when the water had received as much
electricity as it was supposed that it could
contain the person who had the phial in
one hand was going with his other hand
to disengage an iron wire which communicated
from the water to the principal
conductor but the moment he touched
that wire he was surprised by a sudden
shock in his arms and breast the first
ever felt from any electric machine and 
which such exaggerated descriptions were
given as i repeated to you this morning
but how did it happen said harry
 what was the cause the shock
sir i
that said sir rupert i dare not
even attempt to explain to you you must
be contented at present with the simple fact
this astonishing experiment gave sudden
celebrity and popularity to electricity accounts
 it were written to every country
where science could penetrate all persons
were eager to feel the shock notwithstanding
the terrible account it
numbers people made their livelihood by
going about and exhibiting it in every part
 europe philosophers all went to
work to repeat the experiment and to try
to account for what had happened many
theories or suppositions were formed but
as dr priestley says in his account it
the circumstances attending it remain in
many respects inexplicable and the experiment
is to this day justly viewed with
astonishment by the most profound electricians
since the first discovery the
ley den phial its power has been increased
by coating it to a certain height with tinfoil
both with inside and without and it
soon became an essential part an electrical
apparatus an electrical battery
such as you see in the machine before you
or as you lucy called it a tray full 
jars is formed several leyden jars
connected together by conductors so as
to increase prodigiously the power and accumulation
 electricity
 to console you harry for not attempting
to explain what i cannot explain
i will describe what i can describe the
electric kite franklin his delight and
astonish merit were great on hearing the
leydenjar he repeated the experiment
his ardour increased in pursuit electrical
discovery and a most brilliant discovery
soon rewarded his genius and perseverance
some points in which the flash
and sound electricity seemed to resemble
thunder and lightning had early occurred
to him and he now resolved to examine
the truth his conjecture by experiments
but harry it is very important to inform
you that several other people had long before
been on the brink this discovery 
had actually touched it but had let it go
the man who first saw the electric light a
hundred and fifty years before this time
said and wrote that the crackling noise and
flash reminded him thunder and lightning
 but he pursued the idea no further
at a more advanced period our electrical
knowledge their identity with thunder
and lightning was again suggested by
others but franklin when once the
happy thought occurred to him pursued it
unremittingly and has left us what is almost
as valuable as his discovery an account
 the reasoning by which his mind
arrived at that grand truth this harry
you will be curious to know hereafter
 i am curious to know it now sir
cried harry will you tell it me 
no that is not in my promise said
sir rupert that would lead me too faraway
from my present engagement to lucy
this much to please you i will mention
that franklin argued thus with himself if
lightning be the same as electricity it will
obey the same laws it can be managed
by the same means if there be electric
fire in a thunder cloud it may be attracted
and brought down to the earth by some
 those substances which are found to
conduct it he therefore made a kite a
silk handkerchief stretched on a light cross
 wood with an iron wire pointing upwards
the string was twine to the
 the string he tied a silk ribbon and
where the silk and twine joined he fastened
a key lucy can you tell me why he tied
a silk ribbon below the key why did not
he hold the kite by the key
because the key would be a conductor
and bring the lightning down to his hand
but the ribbon would stop it because silk
as you told me is a nonconductor
 very true said sir rupert but
harry why did not he hold the kite by ths
twine 
because perhaps he thought sir said
harry that if it rained and if the twine
should be wet in the thunder shower it
would like the weet packthread used formerly
conduct the lightning down to his
hand
just so harry all that he had foreseen
happened and all the precautions he
had taken succeeded in preventing danger
his kite went up as soon as a thundercloud
came over it the electrical matter in
the cloud was attracted by the iron wire
conductor it rained the string was wet
the lightning ran along the string to the
key and there was stopped from going onto
his hand by the silk ribbon
oh i am glad it cried lucy i
am glad he succeeded he deserved success

 he afterwards applied this discovery
to a useful purpose upon the same principle
as that his electric kite he attached
rods or chains iron to buildings and
connecting them with the earth the electric
fire the clouds was safely conducted
there and away from all it could injure
and here at this excellent application 
the discovery i will leave you my young
friends i cannot leave you with an impression
more favourable to science
but sir said harry could not you
go on i do not say now but another day
could not you go on to the discoveries made
since that time and then to galvanism and
magnetism 
no harry i cannot i will not said
sir rupert
but sir rupert could not you at
least be so good as to explain to lucy what
i now recollect was a thing that puzzled
me the difference between positive and negative
electricity you never mentioned
them is it not necessary to understand
what they mean v
necessary to the knowledge the
science electricity certainly said sir
rupert but you know i did not undertake
to teach you that
no but i wish you would said
both harry and lucy
come with me and i will show you
how impossible it is for me to fulfil your
wish
they followed and he led them to the
library their father who was writing a
letter looked up as they came in and
saw sir rupert go to one the bookcases
and take down two volumes one them
a very thick quarto these he laid on the
library table before harry and lucy
to give some idea said he the
quantity that has been written and may be
vol 
read and learned upon the subject electricity
look at these volumes
harry's father looked at the titles
oh sir rupert what have you done 
it is all over with harry now thought he
and sighed
one these volumes the largest 
them was the very which harry had
sat up a night to read his eyes grew
round the moment he espied it again
and pouncing upon it he neither saw
nor heard any thing more not even his
father's sigh
poor innocent sir rupert equally unconscious
 the delight and the alarm
he had given to father and son stood considering
lucy with whom also as his ill
fate would have it his intended good lesson
was not operating as he had designed
he had expected that lucy would have
been completely awed by the sight the
bulk these volumes and that by turning
over the pages and the titles he could
have soon proved to her how vain an attempt
it must be for her to master such a
voluminous subject but it chanced that
the lesser the quartos was left to her
and immediately turning to its excellent
index she found ani electrical parti 
pleasures and a bill fare that quickened
her appetite amazingly as she read 
 electrical eel electrical dinner 
dinner electricians the turkey to be
killed by an electrical shock roasted by
an electrical jack before a fire kindled by
an electric spark the healths all the
company to be drank in electrified bumpers
under the discharge an electrical
battery 
 very good philosophical nonsense after
all said sir rupert addressing himself
to harry's father and not clearly understanding
the cause the uneasiness
visible in his countenance franklin
well knew how to catch and fix the attention
 young and old there is no harm
is there in her amusing herself with
these things she will soon find what she
can understand and what she cannot
d 
her father assented but still the uneasiness
in his countenance continuing sir
rupert added
 she is too sensible a girl to pretend to
know what she does not know she will
never i will venture to say turn out one
 those mere index hunters who some
witty poet describes as catching the eel
 science by the tail but let young
people catch the eel any way they can so
that they do but catch it
 but we must be sure that they can
hold it afterwards said her father
 true true you are right and i was
wrong misled by my own simile as reasoners
fond similes usually are said
the candid sir rupert
 harry said his father harry
started
i am sorry to see you at that 
again
 i am sorry that you are sorry father
said harry in some confusion
you recollect what happened last year
harry you lost a whole month your
life trying to make an electrical machine
i found your head so full that that
i could get nothing else into it like an
intellectual glutton you had devoured till
your mind had an indigestion and absolutely
could not stir
but i am a year older now and a
year wiser i hope you shall see how
moderate i will be if you will let me finish
the while i am here i will read it
only one hour before breakfast and i
really think i deserve that father because
from the time you stopped me i not only
put it quite out my head but never
mentioned it or electricity even to lucy
till just now when she showed me the
electrical machine and then indeed it
all came out
 and it was all my fault said lucy
there is no fault in the case mv
dear children said their father let
us consider only what is best for
you
harry closed his and without uttering
a word returned it to sir rupert
with proud submission and dignified humility

i will give you my reasons as well as
my advice harry said his father for you
are a reasonable creature and wherever
practicable opinion should be supported
by reasons even from age to youth even
from a father to his son
i advise you my dear son to defer
the pleasure reading that entertaining
 and to reserve electricity altogether
as a study for a later period your life 
because in the first place you have not
time for it at present you have many
things more necessary to learn more essential
to the progress your education 
in other words essential to your acquiring
that strength understanding which can
alone enable you to advance in knowledge
hereafter neither boy nor man can embrace
all the sciences at once you are
now learning those which are in a state 
certainty as far as human certainty goes 
electricity as a science is in but an imperfect
state since that has been
written many discoveries have been made
new and vast views have been opened ot
which at this moment none can even guess
the termination many the theories
adopted as certain when that was
published are now considered as obsolete
or what is worse unfounded
i beg your pardon for interrupting
you father said harry but the facts
proved by experiments must remain the
same must not they as far as they go t 
 true harry replied his father as
far as they go they remain the same but
the explanations the phenomena the
reasonings on these experiments and the
conclusions formed from them have varied
in consequence later information and
will vary from day to day as fresh experiments
and newer discoveries are made 
so that supposing harry you gave up
every thing else in order to make yourself
master all the knowledge in this
thick quarto and granting that you accomplished
this object in what condition
would you be not up to the modern
state the science far from it on the
contrary not in nearly so good a condition
for advancing as you are in at this moment
because you would have much to
unlearn and false notions and favourite
prepossessions to lay aside if you postpone
reading this work for some years the
science will probably have taken a more
stable form then go on with electricity if
you will when you are able to distinguish
truth from error you will read
this with infinite advantage and you
will find it not only an excellent history 
this particular science but an admirable
view the progress the human mind
in making discoveries and an invaluable
lesson in the errors as well as the efforts 
the human understanding have i satisfied
you harry 
satisfied oh thank you my dear
fathers said harry
there were certain nephews and nieces
 lady digby's whom sir rupert had
once mentioned regretting that they could
not be at digby castle while harry and
lucy were there by some new arrangement
 journeying it was however discovered
to be quite possible that they could
now come to spend three whole days
when this was announced harry to say
the truth felt more sorry than glad he
knew that the pleasures the workshop
and the laboratory must be given up
and that they could not hope to have so
much sir rupert's conversation and instruction
 besides harry was not naturally
inclined to like strangers nevertheless
when they arrived he liked them tolerably
well even the first evening the
party consisted a father and mother
two daughters and three sons the
boys one was about harry's age the
others younger the young ladies were
older than lucy almost grown up and
quite unaffected goodhumoured and gay
when they went out to walk all together
they became well acquainted and soon
joined in various amusements as they
d 
s
were standing on the bowlinggreen one
 the boys observed that there were bowls
in the alcove his brothers ran for them
and all began to play at bowls its being
rather an oldfashioned game was no objection
 but the young ladies found the
bowls rather heavy and cumbersome on
hearing this lady digby suddenly recollected
a ball a new sort which she had
brought from london thinking it would
be agreeable to some her young friends
she went for it and returned bearing in
her hand a ball as large as lucy's head
and a beautiful light brown colour
it looked transparent it felt light as a
feather sir rupert bid harry try if it
would bound well harry struck it on the
ground and it rebounded high over the
heads the admiring circle higher as all
declared than ever ball was seen to bound
before all inquired eagerly what
is it made all examined it and guessed
but none guessed rightly sir rupert told
them that it was made caoutchouc which
is naturally very elastic but by a new and
ingenious mode preparation it may be
blown out to almost any size
 this ball then is filled with nothing
but air so that it is no wonder that it
should be light said lucy
sir rupert said that he had seen such
balls in a shop the day before he left
town they were then quite new things
while the showman was showing him how
well one them rebounded it suddenly
disappeared and for some time could nowhere
be found at last it was discovered
in a comer a shrunk shrivelled bao it
had struck upon a nail a young person
who was in the shop suggested that a
covering leather might preserve such
balls from similar disasters in future sir
rupert did not know whether this advice
had been followed but he had little doubt
that the ball would become popular it was
much admired by the present company for
its elasticity its beauty and its safety for
with this they could play even in the
house without danger to windows or to
lookingglasses
they played with their new ball till by
chance it fell among the branches a tree
one the young alloys lady digby's
nephews climbed the tree with great
agility to bring it down some one said
he vas as active as a harlequin and this
led another to mention a harlequin entertainment
he had lately seen and from harlequin
entertainments they talked pantomimes
and it was proposed that they
should act pantomimes this evening
harry and lucy had never tried but
they were very willing to take any part
proposed to them they understood that
the thing to be done was to represent by
action without speaking any well known
story or character or event in fiction
poetry or history after having assisted in
some subordinate parts their companions
begged harry and lucy to choose some
subjects for themselves they proposed
several but from want experience their
choice was seldom happy
harry's first thought was william tell
and the tyrant who ordered him to shoot

at an apple placed on his son's head
harry was provided with a bow and arrows
for william tell a tyrant was
easily found but who could stand for the
child harry stuffed a little coat with
straw and lucy made it a head and put a
hat on and the apple was set on the hat
but harry could not hit the apple and the
stuffed child tumbled on its nose and when
its hat fell off there was an william
tell
miss mallory recommended the favourite
stories in english history alfred
disguised as a minstrel in the danish
camp and alfred in the old woman's
cottage the new performers had
good success harry in the character 
alfred wasted and burned the cakes with
wellacted carelessness and lucy's box on
the ear was capital but these had been
acted rather too often at digby castle to
have the charm novelty
lucy was resolved now to choose quite
a new subject and she thought one from
the new arabian tales xailoun surnamed
the silly who was desired by his
wife to change himself and who never
could find out what she meant but nobody
was acquainted with xailoun or his
follies this was as much too new as the
other subjects were too old
lucy next proposed surely an unexceptionable
scene the parting hector and
andromache harry to be hector and
miss mallory andromache for she
acts so well said lucy and i act so
ill but i think i could be the nurse soit
was arranged hector provided himself
with a dazzling helm and nodding
crest to scare the young astyanax but
unluckily though they had chosen the
least the children from the porter's
lodge the child was too old to cling
crying to the nurse's breast obviously
too large for nurse mother or father
the young astyanax besides was
terribly awkward he would keep his
thumb in his mouth notwithstanding all
his nurse could do to hold down his hand
astyanax began to kick and pushed his
father from him in the midst andromache's
distress there was no standing
the contrast hector and andromache
parted more abruptly than they had intended
and left the nurse to get off astyanax
as she could
they were more successful in ulysses
and euryclea lucy was admirable as
euryclea and started finely at the sight 
the scar but this was too short one
start is not enough to make a good pantomime
harry proposed to lengthen it by
placing penelope at her loom and shooting
the suitors at their riotous feast a feast
is always a good thing for acting as frederic
mallory observed and his eldest sister
who was tall and graceful would act penelope
beautifully her mother's shawl and
veil happily disposed converted her into
the queen ithaca in a trice and when
harry had taught her to weave and unweave
she bent over her loom with dignity
and pensive sat and mourned by
lamplight in the great hall but a penelope
was nothing without suitors vain
was the bow ulysses for he had nobody
to shoot only three suitors could
be had the three young alloys and
they were dressing for the forty thieves
an experienced manager however suggesting
that the suitors might be supposed
to be feasting in the diningroom he left
the door half open between them and the
queen ulysses looked in and frowned
and twanged his bow at them through the
door way with fine tragic effect
harry and lucy found that in the pantomimic
art as in all others actual experiment
is necessary in the selection subjects
as well as in the mode execution
one general remark was made that the
caliph haroun alraschid and his vizier
giafar were constantly well received so
were zobeide and her favourite with the long
unpronounceable name nouzhatoul aoua
dat there was something in the turban
and in the eastern costume which was becoming
 this prepossessed the spectators
favourably at first sight besides the effect
 the complete disguise upon the actors
themselves gave them courage the only
part in which harry felt at ease was in
giafar his black face was as good asa
mask behind which his own was safely
concealed when thus thoroughly incognito
the little actors can forget themselves
and be what they represent
it is peculiarly difficult to act any part approaching
to our own character or touching
upon our real tastes this truth lucy
was made sensible by a mistake she fell into
in the choice a character for harry
she persuaded him to act archimedes
it did not suit him at all lucy acted
the soldier bravely with a drawn sword
brandished high over his head but harry
was a very awkward archimedes at his problem
 and this was the more mortifying
because there was not time to prepare
another part for him it was the last night
and too late to act any thing else it was
disagreeable to with a failure
harry and lucy however showed so
much good humour upon this as well as
upon many other occasions during these
plays that though they failed in most 
their attempts at acting they succeeded in
making themselves liked by their young
companions the good nature and perfect
freedom from little jealousies displayed
by the whole party made them all
happy together and harry and lucy
agreed on the morning when their young
friends were leaving them that the visit
had been very pleasant though it had interrupted
them in their own little pursuits
such interruptions are good for us all
they prevent us from becoming selfish 
they teach us to turn readily and in an
obliging manner from one thing to another
and further show us that there are
many ways employing the time and 
occupying the mind different from our
own and yet which tend to the same ends
utility and happiness
the carriage drove from the door and
by the time the sound the wheels was
out hearing harry and lucy who
were standing in the porch heard in the
hall the short little bark a dog and
then that sort noise which is made by
a provoked cat which ould fain call
by a more genteel name than spitting
if we could find any that would better
suit the action the short bark they
knew to be that sir rupert's own little
terrier dustfoot the other sound they
suspected to come from the housekeepers
great persian cat selima who was rather
a spiteful creature
oh the ball the ball hamr cried
lucy
harry ran to the rescue at that instant
there was silence the dog had the
great ball between his paws the cat with
her backup hair erect tail still eyes glaring
stood and looked while harry patting
the dogs head with one hand drew away
the ball with the other but with a sudden
spring the cat darted forward and set
her paw upon it harry seizing hold 
her leg shook it and loosened the claw 
she gave him one scratch and seemed
to meditate another lucy then advanced
unfurled her parasol full in the
creature's face and straight selima fled to
her regions below no shame for cat to
fly before that terror which has ere now
scared the most furious the tiger race
the ball is safe said harry after
careful examination selima's vile claws
have not gone through it has had a narrow
escape in future we will put it in a
place safety
while harry looked round to decide
where that place safety should be lucy
patted dustyfoot who stood wagging his
tail apparently much satisfied with himself
for having so well defended his masters
property but he suddenly sprung from
beneath her hands and darting to an opening
door ran to meet his master sir rupert
had the key the laboratory in his
hand which he held up to harry and
lucy and they followed him with the
speed dustyfoot
harry was going to inquire where they
should secure the ball but sir rupert interrupted
him by asking
 what is the matter with that bleeding
hand yours which is tied up in your
handkerchief
 only a scratch sir answered harry
in his cutthemattershort tone lucy
desired no better than to fight the battle
oer again
 but after all harr said lucy i
wish you would let me put some court
plaster on the scratch she had one
precious bit in her pocketbook which she
produced no harry would not hear 
 it court plaster would never stick
upon him he said
 a man must never mind a scratch 
that i have known ever since i was four
years old said sir rupert nevertheless
since i have come to man's estate i
have found that scratches are troublesome
when they fester and if you will take my
advice harry accept your sister's offer
you will be able to do nothing in the laboratory
with your hand muffled up in that
fashion
this was an unanswerable argument
whereupon harry surrendered his hand 
but he persisted in his objections to court
plaster goldbeater's skin was the only
thing which would stick on his wounds
sir rupert recollected that in edward's
press some might be found edward's
press as everybody knows was in the laboratory
sir rupert unlocked it observing
that as in his son's absence he
was sole guardian and administrator his
effects he had no scruples in administering
this
lucy opened her eyes at the sight a
piece goldbeater's skin a foot wide and
a quarter a yard long she cut off the
strip she wanted inquiring at the same
time what goldbeater's skin was sir rupert
told her that this skin so called from
its being used by gold beaters was the inner
membrane one the intestines 
an ox narrow slips which are joined
simply by moistening and laying the
edges over each other he added that
the gold was first flattened between steel
rollers then beaten out between leaves 
parchment with broad heavy hammers 
and lastly reduced to the proper degree 
thinness between pieces this membrane
by beating them with lighter hammers
lucy next asked why edward had such
a store this among his valuables did
he cut his fingers so very often as to need
such a provision 
sir rupert told her that edward had it
for a very different purpose for mending
balloons at the word balloon delight and
eager curiosity glowed in harry's and
in lucy's faces
oh sir cried harry did he ever
send up a balloon 
 only some very small ones with
which we were trying some experiments
well even a small one said lucy
i should like to see for i never saw a
balloon in my life
sir rupert went back to edward's press
and took down from the hook on which it
hung a bag or bladder about the size a
man's head
harry observed it was thinner than any
bladder he had ever seen it was a ready
formed globe in which he could discover
no joining he asked what it was made
 from what he had heard about the
caoutchouc ball he began to suspect that
this little balloon might be the same
substance
 animal or vegetable sir asked
he
animal answered sir rupert he
told them it was the craw a turkey
harry began to blow into it to swell it
out that they might see its full extent
sir rupert desired him to take care what
he was about and to handle it gently for
it was one his son's most precious valuables
it was the craw an uncommonly
large norfolk turkey and had been
peculiarly well prepared some skill and
care were necessary he observed in the
cleansing and preparation he knew that
his housekeeper had spoiled several before
the art had been attained so completely as
to render them thus inoffensive to smell
and so light as to be the balloon maker's
lucy admired its delicate texture and
 weight harry observed that there
had been several little tiny holes in it not
larger than pin holes which had been
carefully patched
yes as sir rupert said it had been in
truth most carefully patched he had seen
his son at it for half a day sir rupert
bid them guess how edward had contrived
to detect all these small fractures which
were scarcely discernible before the patches
had marked their situation
lucy thought that in the first place he
must have blown air into the craw so as
to swell it out nearly to its utmost extent
and then he might have pressed it to discover
where the air came out and there he
must have applied his patches
 this was the way he first tried said
vol e
sir rupert but his feeling was not acute
enough he was obliged to think another
method can you invent what that
was r
lucy at this moment saw a bit downy
feather which was floating in the air as
sir rupert observed her eye caught by it
he said that is a good idea lucy
edward held a bit down as light as this
to the parts the balloon where he suspected
there were holes and as he pressed
the balloon the motion the light filaments
gave him notice the place from
whence the air issued but this dovn was
not sufficiently sensitive to detect the
smallest holes
perhaps said harry edward went
round it with a lighted taper holding the
flame as near to the surface as he could
without endangering its safety and at
whatever place he perceived that the flame
 the candle was blown he must have been
sure that there was a hole
 you are right harry said sir rupert
 this way succeeded very welland
still better when he fixed the light
and turned the globe round so that he
might try each part in succession
 but why was it necessary to fill up
every little hole so excessively carefully
asked harry my uncle's balloon went
up very well without all that care
sir rupert asked what size it was
and with what it was filled
it was about ten feet in diameter answered
harry it was filled with hot
air from a fire lighted straw over which
its mouth was held
sir rupert explained to him that the
turkey's craw was to be filled with hydrogen
gas which is much more difficult to
confine than the common heated air that
had been used for filling the balloon
harry had seen at his uncle's
lucy was very much afraid that harry
would ask some further question befoi'c
she should have time to make a petition
which was on her lips and which was
keeping her breathless with anxiety
 well my dear lucy said sir rupert
e
taking compassion upon her say whatever
you want to say
 i wish i could see a balloon go up
cried lucy and the vehemence the exclamation
expressed the strength the
wish
then you shall if we can manage to
send one up for you said kind sir rupert
but only this squall one i have no other 
will this content you 
oh yes thank you sir said lucy
any one for i never saw any
sir rupert asked how it had happened
that she had not seen that which harry saw
at his uncle's 
 because she was not there it was at
the time her long visit to aunt pierrepoint
harry said and i hope she will
never be away so long again
then turning to the balloon harry's and
lucy's attention anxiously waited for what
sir rupert should say next to their great
satisfaction he determined on filling the
little balloon that very day he would immediately
look for the materials for making
the hydrogen gas and explain the process
which was very simple he said
that he knew he might leave them to
harry's care though it was not to everyone
 his age that sulphuric acid should
be trusted
harry and lucy in the same breath
though in different tones said thank
you oh thank you sir
but before we go to the sulphuric
acid sir said harry could you be so
kind as to tell us something more about
balloons i mean their use i have seen
only one and know very lite about them
from what you said just now said
lucy i understand that there are different
kinds i should like to know how they
differ but what i particularly wish to
hear is how balloons were invented if you
would be so very good as to begin at the
very beginning their history
 then i must go back again to the
reign charles h my dear said sir rupert
 and even to an earlier period about
four hundred years before his time whenas
the biographical dictionary makers
would tell novi flourished one roger bacon
not the great philosopher bacon but a
monk a most ingenious man with whose
name perhaps harry is acquainted he
who made that brazen head which is said
to have pronounced the words time is
time was time will be whether his
brazen head ever pronounced these words
or any other i will not take upon me to
decide you may judge the probability
for yourselves added he smiling
 but what is more certain he made a discovery
which was scarcely less extraordinary
 gunpowder and it was he who
invented lucy what is more in your way
and will please you better the camera obscura
it was this roger bacon that first
suggested the possibility a machine
by which a man might mount into the
air but none believed him some
hundred years as usual passed between
the first suggestion and accomplishment
 a great invention nothing more was
done or attempted after roger the great's
time till the days that constellation 
scientific men who shone forth at the first
establishment our royal society in
charles the second's reign
at that period there arose another bold
genius the name wilkins a daring
inventor who rather imprudently published
before he had actually tried the
experiment that he should soon be able
to fly with wings his own contrivance
by the aid these wings he was not only
to raise but sustain himself in the air and
to travel in a flying chariot which by mechanical
means he promised himself he
could guide at pleasure and raise or
lower by the movement his wings
he further prophesied that in future
times men would travel through the air
as commodiously and as easily as on the
water or on the earth and that the day
would come when people would call for
their wings in setting out on a journey as
commonly as men call for their boots
those were his words and they have been
too often repeated in scorn projectors
and inventors
i am sorry said harry that he was
so imprudent as to boast before hand
whatever he might hope did he try any
experiment 
 he tried and tried but 
let him try or wood or wire
he never got two inches higher
i am sorry for it repeated harry
i cannot bear when ingenious men do
not succeed in their inventions for then
stupid people laugh at them
therefore ingenious men should be
prudent harry and not bolt out their inventions
before they have tried them the
wings did not answer and as there appeared
to be little probability that his audacious
prophecy would ever be fulfilled
the world both learned and unlearned
joined in laughing at wilkins and at his
wings send his voyage to the moon even
philosophers deemed it beyond the powers
 mechanism or science for man to mount
and sustain his flight in the air and common
people expressed their sense the
impracticability or visionary nature any
scheme by saying it is as impossible as
to fly or to mount above the clouds
yet this was not impossible for science
at last exclaimed harry triumphantly
about the same time continued sir
rupert an ingenious jesuit the name
 lana laying aside the idea wings
thought mounting in the air on thin
hollow copper globes in which he had
produced a vacuum
 a vacuum very ingenious cried
harry did he succeed 
 no poor man he failed with all his
ingenuity he did not know how to make
his vacuum perfect enough besides the
weight his copper balls was too great 
and when he made them very thin the
pressure the atmosphere drove them
inwards and destroyed them
ah there was no resistance within
said harry who came next 
 another ingenious man galen who
e 
wrote a little in which he plainly
said that if any lighter kind air than
the common atmosphere could be found
and if a bag were filled with it people
might mount by means it into the air
that is exactly the description a
balloon is not it sir said harry
 yes but he never discovered this
lighter kind air said sir rupert
 he only said said lucy
his principle however was quite
right but there it remained no one applied
or pursued it for another century till
at last the simplest observation imaginable
led again to the right point from observing
the smoke rising in the air and
clouds floating in the atmosphere it occurred
to montgolfier 
montgolfier exclaimed lucy now
i know we are coming to real balloons
it occurred to montgolfier continued
sir rupert that if he could confine the
smoke or the cloud in a bag it would rise
into the air and that if he could fill the
bag with it on earth he could mount along
with it to the skies pursuing these ideas
he observed that air when heated is
lighter than when not heated because it is
more expanded more rarefied and he resolved
to try heated air for his balloon 
now he has it cried harry
yes said sir rupert when filled
with heated air up it went then his
next ambition was to make a balloon that
should not only rise itself but carry him
up also for this purpose it was necessary
to ascertain what size would give it
sufficient power when the capacity a
balloon is such that the difference between
the weight the lioht heated air that it
couta'uhs and that the heavier atmospheric
air which it displaces is exactly
equal to the united weijjhts the man
the car and the balloon then that balloon
will just float in the air but as we find
that the atmosphere is gradually thinner
and lighter in proportion as we rise above
the earth so it becomes necessary to
make the balloon considerably larger in
order to ascend to anv rreat elevation
the difference between these weights is
called the ascension power and you see
harry continued sir rupert how necessary
it was for this great inventor to
know how to calculate with exactness or
he would never have mounted in triumph
into the air as he did
 he did mount then cried lucy oh
yes i know he did
this balloon was filled with air rarefied
or heated by a fire straw made underneath
it continued sir rupert and
crowds spectators assembled at paris to
see the first public experiment which completely
succeeded but i need not describe
it as accounts it can be read in
so many books in prose and in verse
but how did he keep up asked
harry for when the outside air cooled
the heated air inside his balloon he must
have come down
very true harry but then he carried
fire up with him fastened to the bottom
 the balloon to keep the air within
constantly rarefied
was not that very dangerous t said
lucy
 it was said sir rupert those
fire balloons are very dangerous
and besides said harr how could
they carry up weight fuel enough to
supply the fire 
yes that was another difficulty said
sir rupert
and how were all these difficulties
conquered said harry
they are not all conquered yet answered
sir rupert but some improvements
have been made
 by what means sir said harry
 principally by chemical means long
before the time jniontgolfier philosophers
had discovered a kind air or gas
that was much lighter than atmospheric
air it was first called inflammable air
from its property easily inflaming but
now it is called hijdrogeti gas
then still even that was dangerous
said lucy
yes said sir rupert but it only
b
inflames when it conies in contact with
flame if we keep it from this it is safe
 well that was much better said
lucy than carrying up fire flaming under
the balloons then they filled them with
this hydrogen
not for some time first one man
said it might be tried and another man
tried it but only in blowing large soap
bubbles at last three ingenious chemists
employed this gas in filling a large balloon
which was made silk and well varnished
to keep it from escaping
 and i hope that kept it in tight said
lucy for then the man might stay up in
the air as long as he pleased
it kept it in too well said sir rupert 
as it rose very high the outward pressure
 the atmosphere became so much less
that the gas expanded with great force
and having no way to escape the silk
burst and down fell the balloon
and the poor men said lucy what
became them 
 they did not go up in it said sir
rupert but the experiment succeeded
so well that the inventors resolved to try
it again and this time to go up themselves
for now having considered what caused
the accident they thought that they had
found out a way preventing it from happening
again
sir rupert paused to give harry time
to think what way
harry said to himself the balloon
burst because the gas could not get out
when it expanded perhaps sir said
he they put a valve to their balloon
something like the safetyvalve a steamengine
so that they could let some it
out when they liked
just so said sir rupert
this succeeded then said lucy
 how far did they go 
 about a league as well as i remember
said sir rupert 
only a league three miles said
lucy i thought people had gone much
farther in balloons
much farther some time afterwards
said sir rupert one man crossed the
sea from england to france and another
went three hundred miles in a few hours 
seven i think
three hundred miles in seven hours 
that is real flying said lucy
i wish i had been with him said
harry
he was in great danger said sir
rupert he went up at night his
balloon was filled with this inflammable
gas and illuminated by several lamps
hung round it
how beautiful it must have been
cried lucy
but very dangerous said harry
for how could he let out the gas when
it was necessary the lamps would have
set it on fire
he was not quite so imprudent as you
think said sir rupert he had provided
a contrivance for keeping the hydrogen
safe from the lamps as well as to
permit his letting it out occasionally during
his voyage but it happened that at the
time his balloon was filling the mob 
paris crowded round it and they were so
impatient that they would have torn it to
pieces if he had delayed they would not
even give him time to adjust his apparatus
to the safety valve he rose with unexampled
rapidity high above the clouds 
the balloon suddenly expanded he saw
the danger but from fear the lamps he
dared not let out the hvdrooen it swelled
more he saw it must burst in another
minute what did he do harry
he put out the lamps answered
harry
 yes said sir rupert with one
hand he stretched to the lamps and extinguished
as many as he could reach
while with the other he tore a rent in the
balloon to let out the gas the inflammable
air was discharged in great quantities
and thus his presence mind saved
him
great presence mind indeed said
lucy i wonder how people can think
at all up in clouds at that terrible height
and no possible assistance near them
she wished to hear more entertaining
adventures people who had gone upon
voyages discovery in balloons
sir rupert told her that he would put
into her hands a in which she might
read all the adventures these aeronauts
or aerial voyagers related as he said ina
much more amusing manner than he
could tell them i will look for the 
for you in the library and you may read
it before you see our balloon go up or
afterwards whichever you please
 before if you please sir i should
like it now answered lucy it is so
pleasant to read about things at the very
time when we are thinking them harry
will you come and read it with me 
no thank you said harry if one 
us read it that will do you will tell it tome
afterwards and i want to see how this
balloon is to be filled
 i should like to see that too said
lucy
sir rupert began the operation he
put some filings iron into a bottle and
upon these he poured sulphuric acid diluted
with about six times the quantity 
water
lucy as soon as she saw the sulphuric
acid kept at a safe distance she did
wisely when the acid was poured upon
the iron filings a cloud white vapour
rose and she perceived a peculiar smell
sir rupert told her that the gas which
was then rising was hydrogen and with
this the little balloon was to be filled
sir rupert then took a bent glass tube
which was open at both ends one he
placed in the neck the bottle and the
other in a jug almost full water so that
the gas after passing through this tube
was made to rise through the water in the
jug in order to purify it over the jug he
put a glass funnel with its broad mouth
downwards to collect the little bubbles 
gas which rose to the surface the water
sir rupert having placed this apparatus
on the floor took the little balloon and
suspended it from a walkingstick which
he laid on the backs a couple chairs
the aperture in the bottom was tied fast
round a piece quill about an inch 
which was left projecting beyond the place
where it was tied this he put into the
small the funnel and plastered
round their joining with a lute made 
that which was ready at hand some almond
paste and water and he also luted the
glass tube into the neck the bottle the
joining being now airtight none the
gas could escape except through the quill
which left an open passage for it into the
balloon
presently lucy saw the bubbles rising
more and more thickly and as the gas
ascended through the funnel she observed
that it began to inflate the balloon
as the affair however seemed to proceed
but slowly she thought it would be tiresome
to stay till it was finished especially
as she could be no use she said therefore
that she was satisfied and went to
the library to read the adventures the
other aromatic voyagers
sir rupert accompanied her and having
kindly marked several entertaining
passages he returned to harry who ashe
said would want his assistance
lucy had time to read all that sir rupert
had marked in the history aerial voyages
before the little balloon was filled
she found harry alone in the laboratory
when she returned holding the balloon
which was now a perfect globe quite inflated
he showed her that the quill was
stopped at the bottom by a little plug 
cork which sir rupert had stuck in when
the balloon was sufficiently expanded so
that he might clean off the luting without
fear losing any the gas
i am glad sir rupert staid to do all
this for me said harry and that i
have seen how quick and dextrous it is
necessary to be with it you are come
just at the right time lucy added he
 we had but just finished
let go the string harry by which
you are holding the balloon said lucy
 that i may see if it will go up
go up to be sure it will said harry
look how it pulls against my hand i
am fastening this little weight to the bottom
 it i think it will carry this up
also
 that little weight said lucy is
that all it is able to carry
all and a great deal it is said harry
 for such a small balloon
it may be a good weight for it to carry
in proportion to its size to be sure said
lucy now harry pray loosen the
string there there up it mounts
 but i do not wish it to mount too
high or to strike itself against the ceiling
cried harry i must add more weight
he added a little more weight and tried
it again and at length to satisfy lucy he
let go the string it seemed to be nicely
balanced above their heads halfway between
the floor and ceiling after remaining
still a few moments it moved towards
the fireplace as if as lucy said it wanted
to warm itself and when it had remained
there till it was warm enough went away
again the fact was as harry observed
that the draught or current air wafted
it towards the fireplace as it approached
the fire heated the gas within so that the
balloon rose higher towards the ceiling
and floated about till the gas cooling it
descended and again wafted by the draught
the same movements were repeated harry
observed them with untired interest calling
out now it rises because and nowe it
falls because c
but after a minute or two lucy said
 it is very curious but when will you
let it up out doors harry i want to
see it go up to the clouds
 as soon as my father and sir rupert
come back said harry
 in the mean time said lucy i will
tell you what i have been reading sir
rupert might well say it was entertaining 
but i cannot tell it to you if you are so
entirely intent upon that balloon
 but my dear i am not entirely intent
upon it i can hear you very well
ah you can hear i know but you
will not listen to me comfortably while
you are watching that balloon
 then said harry laughing you
must watch the balloon and i will listen
to you while i am sharpening my knife 
and your's too if you will give it to me
may'ldo that
oh yes thank you said lucy i
know you can listen while you do that
my dear harry do you know any thing
about parachutes v
no answered harry nothing
i am glad it said lucy for i can
tell you something at least about them 
parachutes are used to prevent the danger
in falling from balloons the name parachute
from the french word chute shows
its use it is a sort umbrella which
spreads out itself the moment it feels
the resistance the air and that prevents
it from coming too suddenly down a
man tried it first with his dog he fastened
him to a small parachute and when the
balloon was at a great height he dropped
him out the parachute spread and 
very well said harry i see the
parachute must have been use in preventing
his descending too quickly
so i thought my dear harry and soit
would have been but for the wind the
wind blew and blew till it was a great
storm quite a whirlwind the poor dog
and parachute were blown up and down
and all manner ways and at the same
time the man in his balloon was equally
tossed about without power to stop or
to guide himself at last when the storm
began to cease man and dog came in sight
 each other again and the dog knowing
master began to bark just as he would
have done upon earth once they came so
close together that the master stretched
out his hand to take him into the balloon
but another provoking gust wind whirled
him away however at last the man and
the dog came to the ground man first
dog next with his parachute quite safely 
then it succeeded you see said
harry
 yes this time said lucy but
another time a poor man broke his leg by
vol f
coming down with a parachute and you
must know harry i am sorry to tell it
you but i must for it is the truth a
great many dreadful accidents have happened
to people with these balloons one
man was burnt to death and several were
near being drowned by dropping into the
sea they must have been drowned but
for some goodnatured fishermen who saved
them another balloonman was in a
terrible condition a thunderstorm came
on and he in the midst it up in the
clouds he says that at one time he was ina
state insensibility lying at the bottom
 the car he does not know how long 
then bounce came the balloon against the
earth and when it rebounded he was
dashed against a rock oh my dear
harry at last his anchor hooked in a
tree and this saved him philosophers
may say what they please but indeed i
liiink it is very bad work harry i should
not at all like to go up in a balloon
i am glad you would not said harry
for i do not think it would be fit for
you
but what is more harry i should not
like that yoii should go up in a balloon
said lucy
 that is another affair said harry
 it is a man's business to brave danger
 in a good cause said lucy
in a good and great cause to be sure
repeated harry
but then it comes to this what is a
great causes said lucy
is not the cause science my dear
a great cause
i do not know said lucy i think
it is quite enough if a man hazards his life
for his country for his father and mother
and friends or for poor women sisters
and so forth you may ask my father as
soon as he comes down stairs
not now said harry we will talk
 it another time you know we are going
to the balloon but lucy where is the
balloon oh lucy what is become 
it i told you to watch it
i do not know cried lucy what
has become it it must be somewhere
f 
in the room but i cannot see it look upon
that high press i will look under the
tables
high and low and everywhere they
looked but without seeing it
 the windows are shut the door is
shut nobody has opened it nobody has
come in nobody has gone out the
room since we had it safe said harry
ait must have burst said lucy look
for the skin
it could not have burst without some
little noise i think said harry
 we will settle about the noise after
we have found the skin said lucy but
i cannot see any thing like it what can
have become it
harry made another careful search in
silence and then said i am now sure
that it is not in the room and it could not
have got out the room any way but
one
 what way asked lucy
 up the chimney said harry
up the chimney said lucy but
now i recollect it is very likely you
know how fond it was going towards
the fire
 it may have stuck in its way up said
harry trying to look up the chimney but
nothing was to be seen
 nothing but darkness said lucy
popping up her head as harry withdrew
his harry ran out directly to try if the
balloon could be seen hovering over the
house where it had flown none could
tell one man had seen something very
odd come out the top the chimney 
another had seen this odd something passover
his head he had thought it was a
kite he could tell only what he had
thought it was and how much he was
surprised when he saw that it was not what
he had thought but more he could not
tell
harry ran from field to field jumped
over ditches and jumped back again and
breathless hot and tired came home no wiser
than he had gone out lucy all the time
was exceedingly sorry for her carelessness
for which harry never once reproached her
they were particularly vexed by the
loss this little balloon because it belonged
to edward digby who had as
sir rupert had told them spent nearly a
whole day in patching it the more they
thought it the more they grieved sir
rupert did all he could to comfort them
by saying that he would take it upon himself
to provide for edward as good and
great a norfolk turkey's craw as that which
was lost but added their kind comforter
i by no means give it up yet as lost only
strayed certainly not stolen our neighbours
and our neighbours children are all
honest and kind people some one will
probably find our little balloon and bring
back its skin tomorrow but now for today
i am sorry you are disappointed i
wish i had for you a beautiful little balloon
i once possessed my flyingfish
a flyingfish i wish we had it said
lucy
harry asked what size it was
about four feet from head to tail and
broad in just proportion for a fish said
sir rupert with proper fins and everything
that could make it look like a real
live fish it was made baudruche
harry asked what is baudruche v
 simply goldbeater's skin baudruche
is the french name for it and my thoughts
going back to paris where i had first seen
such a balloon i used the name by which
i had there heard it called i gave my
pretty fish to edward who was very young
at that time it was lost in coming over 
it fell i believe into the sea
very natural said lucy for the
fish to go into the sea
 but since we have not that or any
other pursued sir rupert what can be
done now since we have none ready
made what would you think trvino to
make one for yourselves 
i think it would be the happiest thing
in the world said lucy
 if we could do it said harry
 why not said lucy if we had
any thing to make it 
sir rupert thought that lady digby
who it seems had every thing that everybody
wanted could perhaps furnish a quite
or two silver paper
 then we can soon make a balloon 
silver paper i am sure said lucy
we have only three days more to stay
at digby castle said harry sighing profoundly

ft
only three days indeed said lucy
echoing the sigh sincerely but in a more
sprightly tone she added three whole
days and this remember is not half gone
harry but i wonder you are not more
eager even than i am about our balloon
 my dear i am eager about it said
harry very eager but i see many difficulties
 and i am afraid we should only
waste lady digby s silver paper which i
know is valuable to ladies for their cap
boxes
 i would not have you waste that my
dears or any thing else said sir rupert
smiling but i can answer for it that
lady digby for such a purpose will give
her silver paper willingly even out her
cap box if it were necessary however
ro
na to raise the merit her sacrifice
harry i can tell you that she happens to
have a store it which she bought for
edward there is much to be learned in
doing any thing this sort well and so
much ingenuity must be employed that i
am always a promoter such things i
am always for letting my young friends
try their own experiments
but do you really think sir said
harry that we can succeed
 tell me how you would set about it
and then i will give you my best opinion
said sir rupert
i do not know said harry i only
know that it is exceedingly difficult for i
recollect that when my uncle's balloon was
making he and my father were calculating
and measuring with long tables 
figures and scales and beamcompasses 
but i could not understand what they
were donors
but that was a year ago harry you
know said lucy
sir rupert took them to die library and
f 
showed them in one the plates the
edinburgh encyclopaedia the goie a
balloon with all the requisite dimensions
marked on it
lucy was awestruck at the sight a
diagram with curves and crossinglines
sand as she said with decimals innumerable
but harry's hopes began to
revive you once said he covered
a ball for me lucy and its cover was
divided into gores which were very like
this they were all different colours i
recollect and very pretty
there was no great difficulty in that
said lucy the ball was very small you
know and ready shaped for me i measured
it round and divided it into an equal
number parts and counted how many
gores such a breadth in their broadest
part would go round it and then i cut a
pattern in paper sloping it and guessing
by my eye and trying repeatedly what
would fit then i cut all the leather gores
by my paper pattern stuck them round
the ball with pins and by measuring and
cutting pulling and pushing and puckering
stretching and coaxing the ball was
at last finished
lucy showed the manner in which she
had creased her paper in various directions
in order to make her pattern but harry
thought it exceedingly difficult and incomprehensible
sir rupert to whom the
case was referred thought that lucy's
method might do if she took care to allow
sufficient margin for joining and to admit
 letting out or drawing the pieces closer
together as occasion might require to
compensate for inaccuracies
the chief difficulty now seemed to bethe
shape the pattern gore but lucy's
alarm at the innumerable decimals not
having yet subsided and harry still fearing
that a large part the three days
would be consumed in making himself
sufficiently master the subject to construct
it with mathematical accuracy sir
rupert compounded with them for a method
which he said would answer well
enough for a first attempt
 let us determine said he what is
to be the shape and size your balloon
suppose it to be a globe eighteen feet
in circumference in that case twelve
gores will probably be enough and the
greatest breadth each these must
evidently be eighteen inches or a little
more to allow for a pasting margin it is
equally clear that their length must be half
the circumference the globe or nine
feet to make your pattern i would advise
you to paste some sheets brown
paper together so as to form a narrow
parallelogram nine feet long and eighteen
inches wide this you know must be
tapered to a point at each not by
straight lines but as you observed harry
by curving the sides and as you are
doubtful accomplishing this with geometrical
precision i think we may trust to
your eye to draw the curves provided you
make the greatest quantity that they bulge
out from a straight edge about a tenth 
the extreme breadth the gore that is
in this case about one inch and threequarters

hairy and lucy were eager to begin on
the strength these directions but
now thought harry what sort a balloon
shall it be he asked sir rupert if he
had ever seen a balloon which carried up
fire with it to keep the air within rarified 
sir rupert said that he had seen several
one in particular he well recollected its
paper cover said he caught fire when
at a considerable height in the air it
seemed a globe flame and for a second or
two that retained its form it made a most
beautiful spectacle but harry said sir
rupert suddenly checking himself are
you thinking sending up fire with your
balloon
oh yes why not sir cried lucy i
should like very much to see it take fire
in the air
but sir rupert said he could not consent
to this he thought it too dangerous
there are several thatched houses and
ricks corn and hay in this neighbourhood
said he and if the balloon fell
upon them it would set them on fire
the moment that this danger was pointed
out harry abandoned all further idea a
no
fireballoon and asked whether he might
fill it with hot air 
sir rupert willingly consented to this
and told him that they should have a
chafingdish with burning charcoal by
which the balloon might be filled with
less danger setting it on fire than if they
lighted a fire straw under it sir rupert
added that though the sending up fire
with a balloon from his park would be
hazardous yet there were other situations
in which it might be done without danger
for instance when they returned to the
seashore they might if their father approved
try one when the wind blew towards
the sea sir rupert sat down immediately
and wrote for them the following
directions which were committed to
lucy's memorandumbook for a future
occasion
choose a calm dry evening and having erected
in the ground two poles at a sufficient distance apart
to prevent the balloon when inflated from touching
them pass a string through the ring at the crown 
the balloon and fasten the ends it to the tops 
hie poles then in order to inflate it place a chafingdish
with burning charcoal under the opening at
ill
the bottom it will presently swell out and consequently
rise to a greater distance from the chafingdish
which will enable you to hook on a small wirebasket
containing a sponge soaked in spirits wine 
this basket will also help to balance the balloon when
in the air the string on which the balloon is suspended
must be cut at the moment that the spirits 
wine in the sponge is lighted
there is no ancient saying vvliich the
wisdom is more cordially felt by youth
than that they who give quickly give
twice lady digby immediately ordered
for them a large deal table placed in one
 the spacious unoccupied bedchambers
where the carpet being rolled up they
might use floor or table as they liked she
also provided them with a dish good
paste two paste brushes two towels the
housekeeper's large cuttingout scissors a
pair compasses a long ruler and in
short all they could want including what
only her kindness could have suorested
two pair steady ablebodied clotheshorses
from the laundry on which to hang
their long sheets pasted paper to dry
they set to work lucy's first business
was to paste the sheets silver paper into
the narrow parallelograms while harry
was intent on his brownpaper pattern
harry's pattern ready lucy cut out all
the twelve gores in the silver paper leaving
ample room and verge enough in the
margin to compensate if necessary for inaccuracies
then came the magnum opus
 putting together the gores they proceeded
not without many little disasters too
tedious to relate lucy handled her brush
in a masterly style lightly and evenly 
ever keeping strictly within her bounds she
swept along with steady and determined
hand to the her course at last
each pair gores was pasted together
and each having been allowed time to dry
the patience necessary for which being the
greatest trial all the whole was with
a little coaxing and a little puckering
joined together it was necessary that the
balloon should open wide so that it might
be held over the fire to be filled with hot
air therefore the lower points the gores
were cut off and the bottom alas pasted round
a lio'ht hoop cane when they thought
the balloon was finished lucy put her
delighted head within it to contemplate
the inside but to her great dismay she
saw various little holes in the paper and
the remainder the day was spent in
putting patches over each detected flaw
on the morning their last day the
weary business patching was ended
each hole had its patch and every patch
was dry and never did artists contemplate
their work with more satisfaction 
lucy with a few exclamations delight 
harry with sober silent admiration they
stood before their balloon and wondered
that it had ever come together and father
and mother and lady digby and sir
rupert successively joined in the saw
surprise and admiration with sincere congratulations
in the moment success
the general gave due credit to his lieutenant
lucy without whose assistance ashe
was proud to acknowledge all his
generalship would have been no avail
he handsomely acknowledged the skill
with which all had been performed that
was left to her discretion though perhaps
he still more admired that which
those in command often prefer to ability 
prompt and mute obedience
it was a fine evening the smi just
setting out they bore their balloon to an
open space in the park it was suspended
from the top the poles which had been
prepared and the burning charcoal was
placed under the opening at the bottom
to inflate it in a few minutes the flaccid
bag began to swell out fold after fold
the last gleam sunset however disappeared
before it had completely expanded
it now pulled slightly against
the hands the holdersdown they had
orders not to let it go till the word command
should be given lucy who was
one the holders down felt that it was
hot service but harry was beside her and
emulous his fortitude she stood firmly
till she heard let go up rose the
balloon steady and majestically high
yet full in view and paused awhile hangings
in midair like a silver moon from the
blue sky the balloon again wafted upwards
and again stood still there was
now seen a beautiful light on one its
sides lucy thought it could not come
from the sun because it had disappeared
beneath the horizon it had set for them 
but as her father told her those who had
gone up in balloons had sometimes seen
the sun set twice once while on the earth
and once when raised above it this appearance
lasted but for a moment or two 
afresh breeze arose the balloon sailed
rapidly along they eagerly followed it
with their eyes but it did not sail steadily
far it wavered and turned sideways and
fell fell fell on a thornbush nevermore
to rise
it is all over said lucy but was
it not beautiful harry have we not had
a great deal pleasure harry
harry walked on in silence bearing the
mangled remains the balloon
 after all continued lucy when a
balloon does not carry any thing up with
it i do not see that it is much better thana
kite
this insulting remark roused harry from
his silence but when he had said all he
could about the ingenuity and curiosity 
the invention lucy still pressed him to
tell what use had been made it and
harry embarrassed looked to his father
and sir rupert for assistance and whatever
they could they supplied
once a balloon had been used for re
cvnnoitring that is for discovering the
situation forces and movements an hostile
army balloons have also been employed
in trying some magnetic and electrical
experiments one ingenious man
employed a balloon on purpose to try a
philosophical experiment on sound he
sent up explosive materials for this purpose
to be let off at different heights but
the shouts the crowd below prevented
these from being heard
and nothing more found out yet no
more use made balloons said lucy
oh harry what have you to say now
 that they have gone fast out favour
with you ever since you read and thought
about the danger said harry however
i must acknowledge it is surprising
that such a great invention has not yet
been more use
sir rupert observed that one reason for
this had been that it was so expensive to
make balloons that poor philosophers could
not afford it the expense however has
now been somewhat diminished by the
use coalgas in the place hydrogen
balloons he said were generally sent up
merely as shows and paid for by people
who went to see them merely for amusement
the exhibitors therefore thought only
 producing a grand effect for instance
they made one to represent meg terrifies
another was a figure clothed in a flamecoloured
robe and another was a pegasus
transporting a richlyaccoutred warrior
through the clouds
oh said lucy i wish they could
manage the balloon pegasus as the man
in the arabian tales managed his 
 by turning one peg he went
up and by turning another he came
down
that may be done yet perhaps said
harry by turning one peg to let the air
out and another to let it in if we could
but guide balloons then indeed they
would be useful
and not till then said his father
 but do you think father do you think
sir rupert said lucy that the way 
guiding them will ever be found out
harry looked eagerly from one to the
other in hopes a favourable answer
they would not say it was impossible 
they would not say they thought it probable

there was a time when it was thought
impossible to do what is now done said
harry who knows but the means 
guiding balloons are close to us and under
our eyes and hands just as the rarefied
air for raising them was ready long before
men invented how to use it
 true and sensible said sir rupert
encouraged by this acknowledgment
harry inquired what attempts had ever
been made to guide balloons he exclaimed
 what a glorious thing it would
be what signifies the danger men
must die some way or other
 well done well done harry said
sir rupert smiling i believe you have
hopes being a balloonguider yourself

harry blushed and was silent after
a pause he said in a low voice to his
father i may at least think on the subject
father
there is no reason why you should
not think it if you like it harry said his
father but many great men have thought
 it and failed there is however nothing
to be ashamed in this wish it springs
from a praiseworthy ambition
 and let his ambition take its flight
added sir rupert recollect our own
schemes when we were boys our grand
magnet scheme and our efforts to invent
perpetual motion the worst that can be
said is that though it does us no harm it
does nobody else any good
it may be a satisfaction to some kind
young heart or to some equally kind old
heart to be assured that sir rupert was
not mistaken in his good opinion his
neighbours and his neighbours children
the little balloon was brought back byone
 farmer dobson's young folks but
though farmer dobson himself accompanied
his boy to bring back this sir ay or
waif as he called it to the lord the
manor yet it was now little likely to be 
any further use and no longer worthy to
be placed among edward's valuables for
it had first stuck upon the branch a tree
that overhung higglesham ford then it
had fallen into the ford and just at the
worst place it could have fallen where
the cattle came to drink some beast had
set his foot upon it and the great halfmoon
rents even lucy could not hope to
repair
it was all over with it as a balloon but
still its remains were treated with respect
and deposited in a drawer with remnants
 other turkeycraws they might be 
service still to balloons yet unborn which
could only be mended by patches the 
same stuff
but i do not know whether my son
will care about balloons so much said
sir rupert now that his object has been
accomplished by other means
what was his object asked harry
eagerly
sir rupert told him that the seacoast
in that neighbourhood was dangerous 
vessels had been driven on shore and had
been wrecked property and lives had
been lost and edward's imagination had
been struck with the thoughts contriving
means affording assistance to these poor
shipwrecked people he knew that it was
often the utmost consequence to be able
to carry out a rope from a vessel in distress
to the shore and he had at one time had
an idea that small balloons might when
the wind served be used for this purpose 
but the object had been lately accomplished
in an ingenious manner by simpler means
a method had been invented sending a
rope from a vessel to the shore by means
 a kite which could be made to descend
at any place or time required by the
bye harry said sir rupert you cannot
vol tv g
do better than read the account this invention
 i am sorry we did not think 
it sooner that we might have tried it 
but you shall have the and take it
home with you i dare say you will be
able to make a kite this sort for yourself
it is a new and perfectly safe invention for
you to try no gas necessary no fire 
nothing dangerous and something really
within your power and present means to
accomplish for a useful purpose
harry's mind seized the idea instantly
with enthusiasm
yes added sir rupert even the
electric kite which drew down lightning
from the clouds and which led to the use
 conductors to save us from the danger
 thunderstorms could not be more useful
than such a kite as this which might
save the lives thousands
sir rupert went with harry immediately
to the library to look for this
 and some others which he and lucy
wished to borrow they were welcome
to any upon condition that they wrote
down their names in what was called the
bookbook a small volume which lay with
the catalogue upon the library table and
in which a debtor and creditor account
was regularly kept all that were borrowed
and returned
besides the st volume the transactions
 the society for the encouragement
 arts in which there was the description
 the kite harry wrote down priestley's
history vision vols in which he
particularly wanted to read about the
camera obscura lucy wished to have that
 franklin's which she had been
looking at the day they were at the electrical
machine or the sake some letters
which she had seen at the the
volume harry found the volume again
readily for lucy what she alluded to
were enticed letters to a young lady on
philosophical subjects in one which
the author says to her your observation
on what you have lately read concerning
insects is very just and solid superficial
minds are apt to despise those who make
that part the world their study as mere
g 
triflers but certainly the world has been
very much obliged to them
lucy wished also for a little volume
which she had seen in lady digby's bookcase
called nourjahad the beginning 
which had excited her curiosity lady
digby consented though it was a very
favourite as it had been given to herby
her father when she was about lucy's
age she also lent her two very interesting
accounts shipwrecks the loss
 the winterton and the voyage 
the alcestis
sir rupert's last kindness to harry and
lucy was the lending and explaining to
them the use a ientagraph an instalment
for reducing maps or drawings dr
wollaston's camera lucida he promised to
show harry the next time he came to see him
harry was very happy to hear those
words the next time
sir rupert expressed his desire to see
him and lucy again whenever their father
and mother would bring them and it was
settled that they should spend another
fortnight at digby castle making it their
way home
as lucy was listening most attentively
to this interesting arrangement she was
startled by the sound a carriage she
looked out the window and saw that it
was their own driving to the door
is it possible cried she i thought
it was much earlier oh there is mamma
with her bonnet on i did not think it
was near bonnettime yet
but alas it was come to that time and
to that last moment when she must say
goodbye
how often they said goodbye it would
be impossible to recount we are sure 
once in the drawingsroom once on the
steps the house once on the steps 
the carriage and again at the carriage
window and a goodbye as they passed
the porter's lodge to the mother astyanax

but the present moment as usual
pressed its claims to attention and had its
claims allowed harry began to settle
the books in the carriage their inconvenient
arrangement in the moment 
farewell none the party had been fully
sensible but now it hurt harry's mechanical
feelings to see parcels sliding and
slipping unable to stay in the places assigned
them as these were in direct opposition
to the laws gravity he set about
to alter their arrangement promising to
make it infinitely more convenient to everybody
how inconvenient his elbows were
to his mother during this operation need
not be represented it will readily be conceived
by all who have ever been in a
carriage with a settler
scarcely had harry packed the books
and lucy placed the great nosegay to her
satisfaction in one the pockets the
carriage than they began a comparison 
their feelings during their visit at dig by
castle
i have been very very happy said
lucy harry let me tell you all the
things which i liked and then you may
tell me what you liked best
what he or what lucy liked best it was
difficult to decide lucy seemed to think
that all was best i hope she added
 that lady digby's nephews and nieces
may be there at our next visit how happily
we shall play at hide and seek in the
annulled apartments i know a place
where you would not find me for a year if
i did not tell you up through the trapdoor
near the little staircase leading to
that observatory which you have not yet
seen
 i am to see the observatory and saturn
and his ring next time said harry if
next time ever comes
 ifs to be sure it will said lucy
 we have not seen half the park yet 
we shall have delightful walks with lady
digby she likes long rambling scrambling
walks harry is not she a nice woman
 no said harr i like her because
she is not iicey
not in the bad sense you mean not
aver nice said lucy
yes said harry i mean that she
is not one those fine ladies who have
always fine shoes and who can never stir
out the house except on a fine day she
has strong shoes and has the use her
feet and her hands and her head
 and knows where every thing can be
found that is wanted said lucy and
keeps every thing in order
 yet does not plague every body said
harry by being too exact some people
take every off the tables the moment
one leaves the room and put every thing
out the way which they call putting
things hyt
 that would not suit sir rupert said
lucy he said he did not like the look
 any room where there were no books and
no signs people being comfortably employed
i love the look the library and
the drawingroom at digby castle very
different from newport hall a fine house
aunt pierrepoint took me to last year my
dear harry you can have no idea how
tiresome it was lady newport sat or
lay on the sofa all day long without having
any thing in the world to do 
 i suppose the poor woman was a
cripple said harry
no she was not a cripple said lucy 
 she could dance though she could not
walk but i suppose that some days she
was ill though she eat and drank like
other people every day yet it was always
said that lady newport was so very delicate
 there was to be no wind in the
room and no noise all the company
talked in whispers but indeed that was
no loss for nobody ever said any thing
worth hearing nobody laughed and nobody
was allowed to yawn excepting lord
newport himself he did yawn indeed 
and aunt pierrepoint was so cruel as to
send me to bed one evening for a fit 
yawning which i caught from him so
i never looked at him aoairi in the evenings
i did not like looking at him at
any time at breakfast he was so pale
and miserable at dinner so red and cross 
and at night so stupid and sleepy i
believe he was unhappy because he had
never any thing to say
but many people are happy enough
when they have not any thing to say interrupted
harry
 are they said lucy doubtingly
g 
certainly said harry men are
often happy when they say nothing for
one i am sure i am often happiest
when 
you yes interrupted lucy but
there is a great deal difference between
saying nothing and having nothing to
say besides lord newport not only had
nothing to say but nothing to do poor
man with all his riches and his fine newcourthouse
and newportpark he was
the most unhappy person i ever saw now
i will make his face for you harry
harry could not help laughing at lucy's
imitation lord newport's dull face
she was going on mimicking his lordship's
yawn and the manner in which
lady newport lolled on the sofa and
her drawling affected voice but her
mother stopped her by saying that she
advised her not to acquire the habit 
mimickry
though it may be entertaining at the
moment lucy it is dangerous it would
make you disliked and what is worse
might lead you to say and do what is illnatured
and for which you ought to be
disliked
oh mamma i hope not said lucy
i did not mean to be illnatured but i
cannot help seeing the difference between
people who are sensible or agreeable
and those who are stupid or affected or
disagreeable how can i help mamma
seeing the difference between lord and
lady newport with their ways going
on at newporthouse and sir rupert
and lady digby and their manner 
spending their time at digby castle
you would not wish mamma would
you that i should not perceive the difference
and that i should like them all
equally 
certainly i should not my dear lucy
answered her mother i am very glad
that you can judge and distinguish what
it is in the characters and manners and
habits those you see which makes them
agreeable or disagreeable happy or miserable
and i should be very sorry by
what i say now to put any restraint upon
your expressing before me as wew as to
yciur brother your natural feelings and
opinions
oh mamma you need not fear that
said lucy i should never feel afraid to
speak before you you tell me so gently
and kindly when you think me wrong
now harry stop me pray the next time i
begin to mimick anybody and do not
laugh because that encourages me i do
not think i was quite right either mamma
in another thing which perhaps you did
not hear me say about aunt pierrepoint's
being so cruel as to send me to bed for
yawning i should not have said that
because she was very kind to me and i
should be very sorry to be ungrateful i
should not have told the only little thing
she did that was unjust
very true my dear lucy and i am
sure since you have this generous feeling
that i need say no more on the subject
mother said harry i am going to
ask you a question not on my own account
for i cannot complain anybody
having been unjust to me but when children
have been punished unjustly i want
to know how they can help recollecting
they cannot help recollecting it said
his mother but they can prevent themselves
from talking or thinking it by
which means they will avoid fixing the
impression more strongly in the memory 
and if on the other hand they try to recollect
the kindness that has been shown
to them they will avoid the danger which
lucy so justly dreads becoming ungrateful

 yes mamma said lucy i recollect
hearing that ungrateful girl miss kitty
maples who said 
her father interrupted her recollections
and gently desired her to look out at a
place they were just passing let us
talk said he things not persons
he stopped the carriage for a few minutes
that they might look at the building
which was near the road
what a strange ugly looking house
exclaimed lucy it is neither a house
nor a castle 
this was the mode building said
her father which followed the time 
gothic castles in england when fortified
castles were no longer wanted for defence
people began to build houses with walls
less thick and without the moat drawbridge
and portcullis they retained something
 the old castle appearance by way
 grandeur or because they had been
used to it but this style building
which lucy dislikes appears now to be
useless and that is one reason i think
why it looks ugly those blind towers
for instance in which there are neither
loopholes to shoot through with bow and
arrow nor windows to light even a narrow
staircase are ridiculous
a short time after this as they drove
through a town they took notice some
very old looking houses which seemed to
be built wood they had projecting
windows which in the second story jutted
out far into the street and others like
chequered frames black wood and
white plastering on one these they saw
the date such houses were common
as their father told them in the times
 elizabeth and james
did not we come through this town
on our way to digby castle said lucy
i wonder that i never took notice 
these odd looking houses did you
harry 
no said harry we were thinking
 something else i suppose
but now said lucy that we have
seen that gothic castle and chapel and
that we have learnt a little about such
think's we take more notice other buildings
and we feel interested about them
which is very pleasant
as they went on a little further they
met some loaded timbercarriages and on
one was a stone pillar which as one the
drivers told them had been brought by
water from far off they were going to
a nobleman's place near hand who is
building a fine house harry's father
found that by turning a little out their
direct road they could see it and he
ordered the postilion to drive that way
when they arrived they got out the
carriage to look at the building the
scaffoldings were up and many workmen
busy at work but enough was finished for
harry to see the style architecture it
was grecian with a portico supported by
doric columns lucy said the front looked
very like the print a temple which they
had seen the day before among the prints
at digby castle she could not recollect
the name it harry knew it was the
temple minerva but it had another
name the parthenon the architect heard
what they said and told them that this
was built after the model the parthenon
he then spoke some new buildings in
london and made use several terms
which they did not understand but harry
had now seen and heard enough to make
him anxious to learn more on these subjects
 how much there is to learn said
he in orettincr into the carriage not only
about building but about every thing 
from the greek word parthenope the virgin
 yes said lucy that puts me in
mind alps on alps arise harry do
you recollect that
alps on alps said harry what
can you mean lucy
she began to repeat some wellknown
lines pope harry recollected them 
he had learned them from her some months
before this time and he begged that she
would let him try if he could repeat them
only give me time said he when 
stop do not tell me the next word directly
very well if you are out i will not
put you in till i have counted a hundred
and that surely will be time enough for
you to think and for me to be silent 
harry began boldly 
 fired at first sight with what 
but with what or by what he was fired
he could not recollect lucy's hundred
was fairly counted and the last ten slowly
tolled out
he observed that these first lines which
he knew were something about the muse
he had always found very difficult but that
if lucy would repeat four or five he knew
he could then go on cleverly lucy repeated

fired at first sight with what the muse imparts
in fearless youth we tempt the height arts
while from the hounded level our mind
short views we take nor see the lengths behind
stop interrupted harry here is
my difficulty i never could learn this by
heart because i do not understand it nor
see the lengths behind behind i think
should be before does not the author
mean that in climbing the height the
arts we cannot see the length way before
us 
he does but the word behind is here
used in another sense
 what sense said harry
why for instance answered lucy
if you take away a little from what we
have to learn yet a great deal is left
behind
 still there is a puzzle said harry
as there always is when a word is used
that has two senses we do not know in
which to take it
well i cannot help it said lucy
let me on you must not be so exact
in poetry you will see by what is coming
that i am right
but more advanc'd behold with strange surprise

new distant scenes endless science rise
science interrupted harry now
my dear i can go on by myself
 so pleased at first the towering alps we try
mount o'er the vales and seem to tread the sky 
 th eternal snows appear already past
and the first clouds and mountains seem the last 
but those attained we tremble to survey
the growing labours the lengthen'd way 
th increasing prospect tires our wanting eyes
hills peep o'er hills and alps on alps arise
quite perfect said lucy
and very well repeated said his
mother
because i like these lines very much
said harry in this poetry there is some
sense as well as sound added he it
is true and it's pretty and its wise and it's
witty
 my dear harry that is rhyme you
will be a poet at last cried lucy
 it will be a long time first said harry
in the mean time here we are at home 
here is dame pelion's cottage
 and how well the roof looks papa
said lucy and there is dame peyton
coming out to welcome us
mamma do not you think that porch
would be much prettier if it were covered
with honeysuckle i will plant some there
tomorrow or cuttings clematis mamma
or some quickgrowing climber
it may be feared that after all the dissipation
 or if dissipation be not the proper
word all the amusement and variety they
had enjoyed during this last fortnight at
digby castle harry and lucy might find
it dull at rupert cottage it will be
feared by those who best know the nature
 boys that after the great excitement 
the workshop and the laboratory with
novelties mechanical chemical electrical
and aerial opening to his view every day
and hour harry would not be able to
settle soberly to his necessary employments
and to plod on daily through the requisite
portions greek latin and mathematics
it will and must be feared by all who
equally well know the nature girls that
after the polite praise and incessant attention
paid to her by those two most uncommonly
kind people sir rupert and
lady digby lucy would droop like a
plant suddenly removed from sunshine to
shade
harry and lucy's father and mother had
their fears on these points undoubtedly
and with some reason as all fathers and
mothers as well as masters and governesses
will confess those only excepted who have
been blessed or cursed with the care 
early prodigies prudence
it should be remarked that a few words
said by sir rupert digby to both harry
and lucy had operated on their minds to
prepare them to watch over themselves on
their return home he had shown that
uncommon degree justice which considers
not only what is agreeable to young
people at the moment but what is to happen
afterwards to them and to those who
have the everyday care providing for
their happiness
you know harry that if i were constantly
living with you could not afford
to give up to you so much my time 
and i hope you will prove to your father
and to yourself when you go home that
i have done you no mischief lucy will
i think follow your example whatever it
may be and this will be an additional
motive for your assiduity
harry had these words in his recollection
the morning after he came home and
when left entirely to himself in his own
room he went to his mathematics first
and then finished his portion greek and
latin before he tried the new glasses in
his camera obscura when lucy knew
this she could not for very shame go as
she had been desperately tempted to do
to nourjahad instead to arithmetic
after breakfast there was a new struggle
in their minds harry was tempted by
the sight the books shipwrecks and
was attracted by the titles in large characters
 the loss the alcestis and 
the winterton and a page on which she
opened in nourjahad describing the good
genius crowned with flowers was almost
irresistible to lucy
it will be an evil genius to you lucy
said her mother for if once it catches
hold you it will keep you from everything
else this i warn you for i have
myself felt the power that genius our
duties must be done first and then pleasures
can be enjoyed in comfort
i understand you mamma said lucy
 there i have put away nourjahad
but look at harry deep in the midst 
the shipwrecks though he advised me not
to touch the books
harry threw down the winterton and
ran off to his business
lucy had undertaken to make a frock
for dame peyton's grandchild but to
bay the truth it had been a oncr time
about and was in danger becoming as
yellow as certain indian muslin dresses
which the black servants who are employed
to embroider them for their mistresses
wind round their waists and trail
about the house for months working at
the flower or the leaf in the intervals 
domestic employments lucyss frock was
an example beautiful running and
equally beautiful backstitching with one
little border satin stitch smooth as any
save that which parisian fingers can perform
her mother nowe reminded her that
it ought to be completed as the christening
 the child was fixed for the next sunday
there was one row backstitching yet
to be done backstitching as every body
knows is desperately tiresome but what
will not hearty good will aided by a little
good sense and a little good example accomplish

harry has done all he promised
thought lucy and so will l mamma
shall see that i am not spoiled by all the
amusement we had at digby castle so
thinking and acting accordingly she completely
finished her work and held it up
before her mother's approving eyes
it happened that harry and lucy were
to spend that evening at home by themselves
their father and mother having
gone to drink tea with the good old vicar
at a few miles distance they had many
pleasant things to do lucy in the first
place went to try her frock on the baby
the joy that appeared in dame peyton's
eyes overpaid lucy for the labour the
work the baby was asleep in the cradle
but the grandame without ceremony took
it up to array it in its new vestments and
while harry was out digging the border
ready for the cuttings honeysuckle and
clematis round the porch the grandmother
and lucy had leisure to admire how pretty
the child looked in its christening robe
the dame only wished that its mother
were at home to see it but the mother
was gone to digby castle to visit her husband
who was a footman there
harry came into the cottage just to let
vol h
lucy know that lie had dug the border for
her and must now run off to finish a job
 his own some steps which he was
making to a bathingplace near dame
peyton's cottage he told lucy that he
should finish his work in half an hour and
that then he would come to her
 pray my dear lucy said he wait
for me at the seat do not come to see
whether i have done my work for i promise
you i will go to you as soon as i can
and then we will read the shipwreck 
the winterton together pray stay there
patiently
lucy promised to wait for him patiently
there was she thought little danger 
her not keeping this promise when she
had such a as nourjahad to read
she read and read on at last pausing at a
good restingplace just where nourjahad
sinks into his second hundred years sleep
lucy looked round her and saw the
lengthened shadows the evening there
was within view her seat a projecting
point rock whose shadow harry had
always consulted as his dial lucy now
looked at its long dark form upon the
water and said to herself 
it must be growing late very late 
i wonder harry is not come
she stood up and looked along the
path no harry nothing was to be seen
she considered what could have kept him
so long
 perhaps some the steps were wrong
said she to herself and he has stayed to
alter them i have a mind to go and see 
but no he begged that i would be patient
and particularly desired me to stay for him
here
she took up her again and read
on a little further but with divided interest
every now and then looking up to
see whether he was coming at length
unable to fix her attention any longer she
put down the for the last two
pages she did not know what she ava
reading she had been inventing all
manner things that could have befallen
harry
i must go and see what has become
h 
 him thought she why should not
i he bid me wait for him that we
might read the shipwreck here together 
but if i stay any longer it will be so dark
that we cannot read hark he is coming
no it was only the rustling the leaves
i cannot wait any longer i may be
 use to him i will go oh there he
is i see him among the trees i am
glad i stayed
it was only a dog but a boy followed
running full speed up the path towards
her dame peyton's grandson lucy
tried to go forward to meet him but she
was so much frightened that she could
not stir
 what is the matter where is my
brother oh speak cried lucy when
the boy came near enough to be heard
the boy trying to look and speak composedly
answered master harry is at
home miss by this time i met him at
the turn the road with master and mistress
and master harry sent me off hereto
tell you miss not to wait no longer
for he but to come home if you be pleased
miss
is that all said lucy relieved fora
moment from her fright but that is
not all i am sure by your look something
bad has happened tell me at once
why miss our house has been on
fire and half the roof burnt they say i
can't tell how it happened i only met
master harry and the folks as i was a
going towards home just at the turn 
the road grandmother was the first i
met and she asked me where i had been 
and i said with the cows then she told
me how our house had been all in a blaze
more than an hour ago and that the child
in the cradle would have been burnt to
death only for master harry not a soul
was near the house but he when the flames
broke out grandmother told me she was
gone to the wood to pick sticks mother
was at the castle betty had just ruined
out i can't say where 
oh never mind that tell me about
my brother cried lucy
 i can't miss for i don't know no more
than that he is badly burned i saw his
father carrying him home
canijiug him then it must be bad
indeed thought lucy
she asked no further questions but set
off running home as fast as she could
want breath forced her soon to slacken
her speed and the boy overtaking her
begged her not to be so much terrified
i cannot think master harry is very
badly hurt because he spoke quite like
himself strong and cheerful and his
face is not burned miss that i am clear
sure for i saw it quite plain as he
turned his head back over his father's
shoulder beckoning to me and sent me
off with his love to you miss and to beg
you would not be frightened which had
not time to tell you
lucy ran on while the boy was saying
this she felt as if she could not get on
fast do what she would at last she reached
the house and made her way through the
people who were standing in the passage
she tried softly to open the door her
mother's room where she heard that harry
was but it was fastened her father from
within opened it inquiring eagerly if a
messenger he had sent to the apothecary's
in the village had returned
here he comes said lucy with a
bottle in his hand
her father seized the bottle asking if
the surgeon was coming
no he was gone to a patient ten miles
off and would not be back till morning
her father had not seen lucy but she
caught hold his arm and asked if she
might see harry 
 yes you can help your mother but
can you command yourself lucy do
not come in if you cannot 
 i can i will said lucy only
tell me what i can do for him and throwing
off her bonnet and gloves she went
in it was worse than she expected when
she heard groans from harry who bore
pain so well she knew he must suffer
dreadfully going nearer she saw him
lying on his side the arm down to the
elbow covered with hue white blisters
or in some places raw and a fiery red
his whole frame writhing about in agony 
lucy could not help shrinking at this
sight but she made no exclamation she
looked at her mother to inquire what could
be done her mother was wetting some
soft linen rags with spirits turpentine
which her father poured out the
bottle these were gently laid on the
inflamed parts the arm taking great
care not to break the blisters lucy could
scarcely bear to see it done the first
touches gave harry such torture even withall
his mother's care and delicacy hand
she was now desired to take her mother's
place and to keep the linen on harry's
arm and shoulder wet with the turpentine
lucy's hands trembled when she began
but they soon became more steady the
consciousness that what she was doing
would relieve her brother gave her courage
to her unspeakable satisfaction his groans
became less frequent in a few minutes
his features which had been all drawn
up came to themselves and opening his
eyes for a moment he looked up at lucy
and said thank you dear lucy
his father and mother were employed
in melting basilicon ointment and minor
it with the oil turpentine in a small
saucepan a process that required great
caution to prevent the vapour that very
inflammable oil from taking fire this
preparation was now ready his mother
with a soft feather smeared it over the
whole surface the wound and then
spread the rest it on a large rag which
she gently laid over all scarcely was the
operation finished when harry's head sunk
upon his pillow and he dropped asleep 
this was in about fifteen minutes from the
first application the turpentine
lucy left the room by her mothers
desire to go to bed and as she was
moving very softly through the passage
she found dame peyton sitting there waiting
for some account harry when she
heard that he was easy and asleep she
went away repeating 
h 
bless him god bless lii 
for some days harry was so feverish
that the surgeon had forbidden all conversation
in his room but at last he was
allowed to talk a little and lucy being
most anxious to hear how the accident had
happened she said i left you harry
when you were going to work at the steps
go on from that
he had been at work he said very
busily finishing those steps and growing
warm had thrown off his coat when suddenly
observing a great light over the trees
near dame peyton's cottage he went up
the bank and saw flames coming from the
roof he ran on to the house the housedoor
was locked he knocked and called
in vain but hearing the cries the child
he broke the fastening a latticewindow
and sprung into the kitchen thick smoke
almost blinded him he knew however
that it was in the lite parlour and feeling
along the wall he was partly guided by
its cries till these were overpowered by
loud yells which burst out in some place
over his head he found the parlourdoor
but it stuck so fast that he could not
push it open he heard the rustling 
the flames he pushed again with all his
force and the door gave way firelight
now glared upon him from the roof harry
saw the cradle at the opposite side the
room he snatched up the infant and
made his way back through the suffocating
smoke and pieces blazing thatch which
were now falling he put the infant out
first in jumping after it he perceived
something on fire about himself and when
he came into the air he found his shirtsleeve
in a blaze he threw himself on the
ground in hopes to extinguish the flame 
but as fast as he extinguished it in one
place it appeared in another no help
was near the pain was intense 
this was all harry could tell what
had happened till he awakened again ashe
described it and heard a confusion 
voices and found himself in his fathers
arms
dame peyton had come morning noon
and night to inquire how he was and very
much wished to see him he was now
able in lucy's opinion and in his own to
see her and lucy admitted both the dame
and the mother the child who were
anxiously waiting at the door the mother
softly approached his bedside with her
infant in her arms judiciously considering
that no sight could be more gratifying to
harry their thanks were silent the
tears came into their eyes as they looked
at him and dame peyton uttered one low
and fervent god bless him not a
word more even harry with his horror
 flattery and dread being thanked
was pleased especially when the infant
stretched out its little arms towards him
and smiled
harry asked if they had found out what
the yells came from which he had heard
in the loft
the dame told him that they came from 
her cat which had been burned there with
its kittens
he then wished to know if the whole 
the new roof had been burned and how it
had caught fire 
yes the roof was all burned but not
much other damage had been done how
the house first took fire no one could tell
betsy declared that all was safe when she
went out no clothes nothing left near
the fireplace and the fire was very low
as far as they could judge the fire had
broken out in the loft
harry thought that perhaps the chimney
might have some crack in it but no it had
been examined and dame peyton repeated
that it was most extraordinary that a fire
should break out in a loft when nobody
had been in it or so much as up the stairs
which led to it for two days before 
this betsey and she were certain no
creature had been up there
 except the cat as lucy observed it
just occurred to her that the dame's favourite
tabby cat had been the cause all
the mischief lucy recollected to have
often seen her lying in the ashes almost
under the grate she thought it possible
that tabby lead gone up to her kittens in
the loft with a bit cinder sticking to
her which might have set fire to the
straw in which she and her kittens were
divino
this seemed very likely to all but dame
peyton alio could not bear that the blame
should be brought home to her poor dear
tabby jn zeal for the memory the best
 cats dame peyton forgot the undertone
proper to a sick room and she was
in loud demonstration the impossibility
 that which probably had happened when
the door opened and the surgeon entered
the room was cleared instantly even
lucy notwithstanding her protestations 
innocence and promises perpetual silence
found herself in the passage and the door
closed against her
the surgeon pronounced that harry had
still much fever and he found that though
the burn was rapidly healing yet his patient
could not raise himself nor turn in
his bed without much pain upon further
examination the surgeon discovered that
harry had received a severe strain the
consequences which might he said be
very serious he feared that it would be
necessary for harry to continue confined
to an horizontal position for some time
 how long sir said harry in an
intrepid tone
as far as the surgeon could guess it
would probably be some weeks before
harry could walk he might attempt it
sooner but if he did it would be at a great
risk on the contrary if he submitted
quietly and steadily to this confinement in
all human probability he would perfectly
recover and be as well and active as ever
the moment he was convinced the
reason and necessity the case harry
was perfectly submissive and better than
submissive resolute to bear and forbear
whatever was prescribed when the surgeon
had left the room harry looking up
and seeing his mother's anxious eyes fixed
upon him smiled and said do not be
afraid or me or me mother you shall
see how good and how well i shall be a
few weeks will soon be over and though
i am to lie fiat i may use my hands and
arms i suppose as soon as my burn is
well and i can read and entertain myself
and what is better i shall have lucy to
read to me and talk to me you need not
pity me mother i am not to be pitied at
all was not it very fortunate that i was
there and in time to save the child think
 the delight i felt when i got it safe out
 the window and the joy hearing it
squall again being certain it was alive 
i am sure that and the pleasure i have
just had in seeing the mother and child and
the old woman too are enough to pay me
for all the surgeon you know said we
might thank god it was no worse and i
thank god it is so well think mother
 my having been the means saving a
fellowcreature i am sure i do with all
my heart and soul thank god
after all this excitement his nurses
wisely left him to repose he fell into a
sound sleep how long he might have
slept none can tell for he was wakened
much to lucy's provocation by a loud
knock at the halldoor it was sir rupert
digby not he surely that gave the
thundering knock no that was his fool 
a groom for even wise men sometimes
have foolish grooms
sir rupert digby was allowed to come
into harris room and lucy was struck
by the melancholy expression his countenance
which did not clear up when
harry's own cheerful voice assured him
that he now suffered but little and that he
hoped to be quite well in a few weeks and
able to go to digby castle at these words
sir rupert shook his head sorrowfully
and said 
we shall not be there to meet you
my dear we are obliged to set out immediately
for the continent
one lady digby s nieces as they
had heard this morning had been taken
dangerously ill and they were going to
her this was a farewell visit from sir
rupert lady digby could not come 
she was too busy and too unhappy
harry and lucy were very sorry but
they were not so selfish as to think much
 their own little disappointment and
harry was grateful to sir rupert for thinking
 him at such a time sir rupert
had indeed thought every thing that
could contribute to harry's ease and comfort
in his absence and now offered the
key his library and the use his prints
and instruments which were most gladly
accepted
sir rupert promised not only to write to
harry's father but to harry himself if
he should see any thing on the continent
that he thought might amuse or instruct
him
farewell harry said he may god
bless you and keep alive in your mind
the benevolent feelings you possess and
the noble desire to improve the faculties
with which he has endowed you
during some succeeding days harry's
pulse and his own account himself
were at perpetual variance he asserting
that he was well quite well while his
pulse pronounced morning and evening
the reverse the surgeon preferred the
report the pulse and harry bound by
his wise resolutions was obliged to submit
to doctor diet and doctor quiet and to
have nothing yet to do with lucy's favourite
doctor merryman harry was
neither to talk or to be talked to neither
to read or to be read to neither to entertain
or be entertained lucy with a face
becoming the most discreet little nurses
sat by his bedside knitting for him future
comfortable or went about in silence but
never on tiptoe for that harry detested 
he always wakened when any one went on
tiptoe but moving quietly yet without
any appearance constraint she freed
him from the fear keeping her prisoner
in about a fortnight his arm healed but
from the effects the strain he was still
obliged to be a prisoner upon the sofa 
for some hours lying as required quite
flat at others raised from that tiresome
horizontal penance to a position which
with all the advantage rest restored him
to the use hands arms and eyes this
privilege he owed to the kindness his
friend sir rupert who in passing through
london saw and sent him abed invaluable
to all in his condition
the first day it came harry begged that
it might be placed in his view so that he
might examine its construction he saw
that the bedstead was hinged in the middle
and that either could be sloped to any
angle that was desired and firmly fixed
there by a supporting frame just as lucy
said like her music desk there were
various other contrivances which delighted
harry first as a mechanic and then as an
invalid he had himself raised and lowered
till he found the angle which was most
easy and convenient then lucy was
employed to make a pasteboard quadrant
and to fasten it on the side the bedframe
so that he could most accurately
as she said signify to her his inclinations
 you must allow me that pun harry
he allowed it to her in consideration 
her welldivided quadrant to say the
truth the quadrant was found little use
it was easier to say put me up to the
third notch or to the fifth notch as the
case might require but it is natural to
ingenious people especially when young
to make use superfluous inventions upon
common occasions
lucy more than ever rejoiced at having
acquired some taste for harry's pursuits 
because as she had been his best little
nurse when he was sick so now she could
be his most agreeable companion when he
was recovering
established on this most convenient 
beds his next object was to add to it a
reading and writingdesk which in its
kind he determined should be as perfect
as the bed sundry trials were made
sundry ways and at last a desk was contrived
by harry and executed by the carpenter
which was perfectly firm and yet
removeable at a moment's warning ceding
its place to the dinner breakfast or teatray

it is but justice to harry to mention
that before he thought all these conveniences
in his own establishment he had
been intent upon getting the roof repaired
for dame peyton
sir rupert had placed his carpenter
under harry's orders and had agreed to
his request that the house was now to be
slated harry looked at his old plan again
and with his father's concurrence made
some improvements in this second edition
 his roof when the ingenious and admirable
machinery mr brunei was a
few years ago burnt to the ground he
replied to a letter condolence that he
found sufficient consolation in the hopes 
materially improving it
as soon as the surgeon's permission was
obtained harry had great enjoyment in
the books which his mother brought for
him from digby castle among these were
scott's poetical works harry formerly
thought he had no taste for poetry but
now when his mother read to herr the
beginning the lay the last minstrel
he felt surprised at being so much pleased
with it as much even as lucy his mother
having refused to let him hear more than
one canto the first evening he looked forward
with eagerness to the time when
reading was to recommence this now
appeared the most delightful hour the
whole day and but for the shame not
allowing his mother time to take breath
lucy and he would willingly have listened
to canto after canto and poem after poem
from the lay the minstrel to the
lord the isles
but his mother managed their pleasures
so that they not only lasted the longer but
were relished the more keenly not swallowed
without being tasted lucy had
this art yet to learn
 mamma said she i think you are
too careful not to tire him with reading
i think he cannot have too much entertainment
it is only the stupid parts books
which tire one all that is necessary is
to pick out the plums and to have a
variety
 he would i think be soon tired 
plums my dear said her mother and
a great variety would weary him still
more
well mamma whispered lucy will
you let us try the experiment i should
like to see whether he could be tired 
plums i will pick out what i know he
likes best and never give him too much
 one thing at a time you will see
mamma
try my dear and you will see said
her mother
harry had now recovered sufficiently to
resume some his usual employments
and he begged lucy one day to bring
euclid that he might take his morning
halfhour at geometry before they did anything
else lucy was opinion that he
ought not yet to read any thing so very
serious when the surgeon came lucy
extorted a similar opinion from him and
therefore determined next day to try her
experiment accordingly at the hour
which harry had set apart for his mathematics
she stole in softly behind him and
while in the midst the square the
hypothenuse she laid beside him a fine
large butterfly who in the most obliging
manner rested there with outspread wings
 i will look at it in one instant said
harry as lucy called upon him to admire
the beautiful purple eyes on the wings
 only just wait one moment till i come
to the q e d
but as he spoke the butterfly made a
little motion as if preparing to rise
take care that it does not fly away
cried harry
there is no danger said lucy
in another instant before harry came
to his q e d the butterfly made a sudden
jump up and alighted upon harry's hand
he started when he felt its cold tail and
bony body it was no butterfly but a sort
 skipjack lucy had been at work
painting the wings from sunrise and for
all the labour bestowed on the feathertinctured
head and proboscis she was
overpaid by this start harry's emboldened
by her first success this morning
she closed euclid decidedly and drew it
from harry's hands
harry said she for the rest this
day you shall have nothing but plums and
have plenty in store for you all sorts
you will not i hope be above feasting on
such pretty and good ones as i have here
vol i
for you and she laid down a basket full
 books in each which there were
various paper marks
i am not above any thing good or
pretty said harry but i think it is too
early in the morning if you begin now
you will scarcely be able to supply me all
day long
try and we shall see as mamma
says
besides continued harry i think
plums all day long would make any body
sick
no no said lucy you shall have
such variety only trust to me give
me leave to entertain you all this day
harry will you 
let those who have tried the experiment
say which has the hardest part he who
undertakes to entertain or to be entertained
all day long lucy had made a
good beginning however having got rid 
euclid with her butterfly from her butterfly
she went on to the butterfly's ball
and the grasshopper's feast and the delightful
 peacock at home by some
strange chance harry had not yet become
acquainted with them
 mamma told me said lucy that
this little has had the honour being
quoted by a great man in the house 
commons these are the lines he repeated

for birds are like men in their contests together
and in questions right can dispute for a feather
but there is the breakfast bell said
lucy interrupting herself i must go
for your breakfast having set it before
him in order due now i must leave
you for a few minutes while i eat my own 
but i shall soon return to feed you with
plums upon her return lucy brought
up the newspaper which contained an extract
 a letter from sir thomas stamford
raffles late governor sumatra givingan
account the loss the ship fame after
describing the alarm excited by the cry 
fire and the hurry with which lady
raffles and her children were thrust into a
boat he says 
i 
ail this passed much quicker than i can write
it we pushed off as the flames were issuing from
our cabins the masts and sails now taking fire we
moved to a distance sufficient to avoid the immediate
explosion but the flames were coming out the main
hatchway and seeing the rest the crew with the
captain c still on board we pulled back to the ship
as we approached we perceived that the people were
getting into a boat we hailed her have you
all on board yes all save one johnson
sick in his cot can we save him no
impossible at this moment the poor fellow
scorched i imagine by the flames roared out most
lustily having run upon deck i will go for him
says the captain he pulled under the bowsprit 
the ship and picked the poor fellow up all lives
safe thank god pull off from the ship we then
hauled the boats close to each other and found the
captain fortunately had a compass our only chance
alas to regain bencoolen and the captain undertook
to lead no possibility being left that we could again
approach the ship for she was now one splendid
flame fore and aft and aloft her masts and sails in a
blaze and rocking to and fro the alarm had been
given about twenty minutes past eight and in less
than ten minutes she was in flames there was not a
soul on board at half past eight and in ten minutes
afterwards she was one grand mass fire
without a drop water or a grain food or a
rag covering except what we happened at that
moment to have on our backs we had embarked on
the wide ocean thankful to god for his mercies poor
sophia having been taken out her bed had nothing
on but a wrapper neither shoes nor stockings one
 the children had been snatched out his bed
after the flames had attacked it in short there was
not time for any one to think more than two
things can the ship be saved no let us
save ourselves then all else was swallowed up in
one great ruin the ship continued to burn till
about midnight when the saltpetre which she
had tons on board took fire and sent up one 
the most splendid and brilliant flames that was ever
seen illumining the horizon to an extent not less
than fifty miles and casting that kind blue light
over us which is all others most luridly horrible
rain now came on but fortunately it was not
 long continuance and the night became serene
and starlight the men behaved manfully they
rowed incessantly and never did poor mortals lookout
more anxiously for daylight and for land than wc
did not that our sufferings were any thing to what
has often befallen others about two o'clock we
landed safely and no words mine can do justice to
the expression sympathy and kindness with which
we were hailed by every one if any proof bad been
wanting that my administration had been satisfactory
here we had it unequivocally from all there was
not a dry eye and as we drove back to our former
home loud was the cry god be praised 
the property which i have lost on the most moderate
estimate cannot be less than cf but
the loss which have to regret beyond ail is mj
papers and drawings including my notes and observations
with memoirs and grammars dictionaries
and vocabularies and a grand map sumatra on
which i had been employed since my first arrival here
this however was not all all my collections in natural
history and my splendid collection drawings
upwards a thousand in number and to conclude
i will merely notice that there was scarce an unknown
animal bird beast or fish or an interesting
plant which we had not on board a living tapira
new species tiger splendid pheasants c c
all domesticated for the voyage we were in short a
perfect noah's ark all all has perished but thank
god our lives have been spared and we do not repine

harry was as much interested by this
as lucy had expected he admired the
activity and courage displayed by these
sufferers during the moment danger
and observed to his sister that the kindness
with which sir stamford was welcomed
on shore showed what a good governor
he had been he looked again at
the account and while lucy and he were
considering for which the losses they
were most sorry lucy exclaimed hark
a knock at the door that is to tell me that
my magnum bonum plum is ready and
you shall have it
she opened the door and received from
the hands the servant harry's camera
obscura in which with her father's assistance
she had fixed the new glass lucy
had prepared every thing she had a stand
ready so that harry could see and enjoy
it completely he did enjoy it as much as
she could have expected his eye was fixed
upon the landscape which he saw before
him and he admired the quiet cattle slowly
moving on the paper and the winding path
and the fresh green trees with their light
boughs dancing in the sunshine
while harry was looking at them and
considering what he saw before him lucy
exclaimed i know what you are thinking
 harry the coloured shadows we
used to see on the wall our room at
home
she darted out the room and returned
with a quarto volume now
harry cried she for blue shadows and
gi'een black shadows and red i will
read you all about them
she sat down and read 
 it is rather remarkable that so curious
an appearance as this blue shadows
should pass unnoticed near a century and
should then be hit upon by mere accident
buffon as he was busy about something
else observed that the shadows trees
which fell upon a white wall were green
here lucy read a curious but long account
 his observations upon green and
indigo shadows seen in different circumstances
ending with any person may see
a blue shadow if he will only hold his
finger before a piece white paper at sunrise
or sunset
harry said he should like to try this
 is it not all very entertaining asked
lucy
very said harry but is there not
some explanation given what is the
cause the different colours these shadows

there is a oreat deal about it in this
 replied lucy and the history 
a great many experiments which different
people have tried
let me see said harry stretching
out his hand for the 

no no said lucy they would betoo
difficult for you c besides they
would not be plums and you are to have
nothing else today i will put a mark in
the place for you and you may study coloured
shadows another time 
luc then turned over the pages quickly
to find a favourite anecdote about a poor
old woman who lived at montpelier butin
her search for the old woman she was
stopped on her way by an account a
prodigious rainbow lying on the ground
its colours almost as lively as any ever seen
in the heavens she chased the rainbow
into a chapter infinitely too deep for her
comprehension and found herself in the
midst single double and treble bows
and inverted bows in company with sir
isaac newton and bernoulli one minute
the next with m bouguer on the mountains
 peru or dr halley in chester
till neither she nor harry could tell where
she was she abandoned her chase the
rainbow but she stumbled upon her long
looked for old woman montpelier
 u
 and what her said harry has
she anything to say to the rainbow
nothing in the world my dear said
lucy quite another thing she had
bought a piece meat one day in the
market and hung it up in her bed room
dirty old woman said harry
poor old woman said lucy and at
night a very hot night it was she saw on
this meat which was hanging opposite to
the foot her bed what do you think
a bright light so bright as to illuminate the
wall the next day this luminous meat
which she thought was bewitched was
carried to henry bourbon duke conte
the governor the place who viewed it
with astonishment for some hours 
some lours harry thought that was
too much though he would gladly have
been allowed to pause upon it for a few
minutes the light as he guessed was
phosphoric and he reminded lucy a
shining light which they had once seen in
the shell a decayed lobster but lucy
rapidly turned over to a new page with an
account some experiments which boyle
tried on phosphoric substances placed in
the airpump then she went on to a
story doctor beale's cook who was
boiling some mackarel and saw the fish
and the water shining as if on fire and
the children the family diverting themselves
by running about the house with
the luminous drops which were as large as
pennypieces think that harry
she then ran on to father bourse's
voyage to the east indies during which
he noticed a wonderful luminous appearance
in the sea by which he could read in
the nioht
harry wished to know whether it proceeded
from putrescent substances or from
luminous insects he asked lucy if she
recollected having heard a captain in the
navy a friend his father's say that he
had brought to enoland and driven to sir
joseph banks some luminous animals
three inches long which he had taken up
from the southern ocean and which oave
so strong a light diet he could read a very
small print by one them which he had
put in a bucket salt water
lucy could not spare time to answer 
she wanted to read what would entertaining
as she hoped j more than asylum nous i insects
the bologna stone harry did you
ever hear this stone which gives light
in the dark and she read on for some
pages till she recollected quite a different
thing which she was sure would amuse
harry still more and throwing aside that
 she took up a description the
esquimaux houses built blocks snow
with wellturned domes and with windows
 thin ice this interested harry very
much but as lucy thought that he began
to look a little tired she hurried him out
 the house snow and read some anecdotes
 the esquimaux lady illigluk
who understood maps and drew charts so
well but whose head not being able to
bear the praises the english sailors she
became so conceited and affected that she
could do nothing but sit in her chair on
deck practising her airs
lucy again changed to something new
and travelled from the north pole to chili
and from chili to ali pacha and read the
account his delight in seeing ice made
in an air pump which had been sent out
to him from europe and in this manner
she went on almost all the morning flying
from one to another whenever she
thought she saw fatigue in harry's face
she turned to a fresh subject still fancying
that by variety entertainment she should
revive his attention and please him more
and more but at last observing his head
resting on his hand she stopped short and
said oh harry does your head ache
harry confessed it was beginning to ache
a little
i am very very sorry said lucy
 why did you not tell me sooner that you
were tired 
i did not know it till my head began
to ache said harry
i thought i was amusing you all the
time said lucy you told me that everything
i read was very entertaining
so each thing was said harry feelings
for her disappointment but altogether
they 
my dear harry say no more said
lucy sorrowfully and settling his cushions
she added there lay down your poor
head now and i will go away to mamma
harry was so much worn out that lucy
was not allowed to see him all the rest 
the morning and as she wished her mother
good night she said i see you were
quite right mamma i tired harry with
plums long before the the day
 my dear harry how do you do this
morning said lucy coming in with a
timid step and contrite look
 very well cried harry briskly perfectly
well thank you
 you have no reason to thank me said
lucy for giving you the head ache
but my head ache is gone now and it
was a good experiment after all
 a bad experiment for you i think
but good for me said lucy for now i
am convinced for life that plums all day
long will never do let them be ever so
sweet and well picked that mine were
well picked you will acknowledge harry
did you sleep well 
yes said harry and wakened this
morning as fresh as ever and then i spent
my time very happily in thinking
that is what i do sometimes when i
waken early said lucy and i think 
a hundred different things till i do not
know what i am thinking and fall
asleep again was that the way 
no said harry that was not the
way with me for i was thinking only 
one thing
what was that v asked lucy
harry hesitated i should like to tell
you lucy but perhaps it might vex you
oh no said lucy you cannot
vex me i am sure
 well then i was considering why i
was so much tired yesterday and i think i
have found it out shall i tell you
a cloud passed over lucy's brow at
this moment her mother came in with
harry's breakfast do you think
mamma said lucy there could be any
use in harry's going all over what passed
yesterday to tell me how i tired him so
much you know i am quite convinced
 my mistake
i am sure that said harry but
there were many reasons why i was so
tired i did not know them all myself till i
thought over the whole affair this morning
and it may be use to you to know them
i do not see much use said lucy
what do you say mamma 
i say that harry had better eat his
breakfast first and that afterwards as the
object a kind sister and good nurse
must be to entertain without fatiguing your
patient youhad better listen to his reasons
well mamma said lucy as i do
wish to be a good nurse i will ask him for
them as soon as he has done breakfast
accordingly the breakfast being dispatched
harry began with the comfortable
words i will be as short as lean in
the first place you know that my mind cannot
turn short round like a cranenecked
carriage whenever and wherever you
please yours can lucy therefore it
was more difficult to me than it was to you
to turn so frequently from one thing to
another from coloured shadows to luminous
insects and from the old woman at
montpelier to ali pacha but besides
this i was continually disappointed and
you know lucy disappointment tires
oh yes i allow that said lucy i
felt tired yesterday myself the moment i
was disappointed in my hopes entertaining
you but how were you disappointed
and continually too what do you
mean 
i mean that when my interest was excited
by any thing you read to me i was
disappointed in not having time to understand
it completely
i know it would have tired mc much
more said lucy if i had been obliged to
study every thing to the the chapter
i think not said harry i think
lucy we are always better satisfied when
we get to the bottom one thing before
we fly off to another
 i am afraid that is not always my case
said lucy but at all events it would not
have been good for you to have gone on
with euclid all day long
probably not said harry but i
have still another reason for you all the
time you were reading i was anxious and
i am sure anxiety tires as much as disappointment

 but what anxiety had you asked
lucy
 i was anxious not to be tired while
you were trying all you could to entertain
me and the more i wished this the more
weary i grew
and that was the very thing said
lucy that made me hurry on from one
thing to another for i thought sometimes
you looked fatigued but still harry you
see it was not the plums alone you were
tired because you were disappointed and
anxious
yes said harry but the plums in
themselves would have been too much intime
one grows tired being entertained

would it then mend the matter to read
tiresome things between the entertaining
ones said lucy
 i am not sure but it would replied
harry lucy laughed i mean continued
harry if the tiresome things are
worth reading for tiresome things often
leave useful impressions behind them besides
there is a pride in getting through
them and if there is any difficulty we have
the pleasure success
i agree to that said lucy a little
success or a little bit praise refreshes
me very much and i think harry you
will allow that you are not tired now for
i am sure you have got to the bottom 
this subject
harry was this day to arrange his occupations
and amusements in his own way
while lucy went out to her garden he applied
to euclid for half an hour that he
might as he said earn an appetite for a
story which he knew lucy had in store for
him nourjaliad he stopped her at
nourjahad's first sleep a hundred years
at a moment when he was very curious to
know what would come next what would
happen when he awakened then he went
to a translation a passage in euripides
which he said he would prepare for his father
after working at that for some time he
amused himself with the shipwreck the
winterton in which he was much interested
 but his father coming in an hour
was spent between greek and english
tolerably successfully and therefore without
fatigue the next hour was spent in
trying to complete an invention which he
had long had in contemplation lucy went
to her own affairs while he was thus occupied
and promised to return in half an
hour but at the this time when she
appeared he told her she might stay away
another half hour and then she found
him looking very much tired for he had
not been successful in his invention and
he had persisted in thinking it too
long he was however refreshed by some
more nourjahad in which he was very
happily engaged when lucy was summoned
by the sound the dressing bell 
looking at each other they both exclaimed
 so soon
we cannot pretend to say that on the
following days harry was always equally
successful in arranging his occupations so
that labour and rest should equal periods
keep much greater philosophers
than he daily fail in this attempt and
harry it seems was not always so great a
philosopher as he thought himself though
he had been very grand in resisting the
temptation reading too much nour
jahad at once yet one day temptation
came which he could not resist in the form
 baron trench's memoirs lucy began
to read it to him after his morning's mathematics
 but after reading an hour she
observed that it was time to go to her garden
harry intreated her to go on half an
hour longer if she was not tired not
in the least said lucy i am only
afraid tiring you half an hour an
hour longer she went on and then she left
him to repose but no repose could harry
take he was so anxious to know whether
the first hole that baron trench made in
his dungeon wall was discovered by his
jailor he eyed the which lucy had
left on the table as she thought out 
his reach but with the aid a pair 
lazy tongs he drew the tempting volume
to him and never stopped till it was
finished lucy coming in he asked her
voraciously for the second volume she
was astonished at his having already devoured
the first and demurred but soon
yielded to his imploring emphasis on the
persuasive little word do let me have
it my dear li short the whole day was
spent upon it when he had finished he
felt as if there was a universal blank in the
world nothing could interest him after
this strong stimulus and in the evening
he was obliged acknowledge that he was
very much tired indeed
lucy demurely observed and harry readily
agreed with her that we may tire
ourselves as much by going on too long
with one entertaining thing as by flying
about to a variety
it must be said on behalf harry that
his confinement to the sofa rendered it
somewhat difficult for him to get through
the day without fatigue mind because
he was debarred from that kind labour
 body which we call exercise and which
is found most useful in restoring the freshness
 the spirits lucyss power 
making him laugh had been often found the
best substitute for bodily exertion and she
again satisfactorily proved that laughter
holding both his sides takes and gives
exercise in the most salutary manner
mamma said lucy when they had
done laughing it was very well worth
while to listen that day to harry s reasons
i have not tired him so much since
never cried harry indeed she
has always hindered me from tiring myself

and do you know mamma continued
lucy he can do much more in the day
now than he could before because we
have arranged it rightly
harry observed that they had been
obliged to try a great many experiments
before they had brought things to this
happy conclusion
 you see mamma said lucy that
harry must have experiments some way or
other and now that he has neither balloons
or workshop or laboratory and cannot
stir from his sofa he is reduced to try them
on his own mind or on mine
and that is very convenient said
harry for we have all we want for the
purpose in ourselves mother do not you
think it is useful 
very useful my dear for by these
means you may learn to command your
own mind while at the same time you are
acquiring some insight into the minds 
others and by judiciously arranging your
occupations you may not only get more
done in the same period but you may
strengthen quicken and enlarge all the
powers your understanding
harry was now well enough to be brought
out into the common sitting room his
sofa had lahore castors which moved so
easily that lucy without any help could
roll him from room to room one eveningshe
was admiring these castors and harry
who had not failed to examine their construction
undertook to explain to her on what
their excellence depended he told her that
in common castors the upright pin round
which they turn is so short that it has no
support being only just long enough to
rivet through the lower plate the
brass socket but that in these castors the
pin is five or six inches long and tapered
to the upper which is made to play ina
little iron thimble let into the leo the
sofa so that you see lucy the long
pin is always kept in its place and as it
turns round with very little friction it allows
the wheel to take at once the direction in
which the leg is moving
father remarked that castors on the
same principle were now sold as a recent
invention by the name french castors
though a print a similar contrivance is
to be found in a dutch on windmills
printed above a hundred years ago in
vol k
this trivial circumstance harry is an example
 what i have often observed to
you that the same things are invented
in different countries by people who have
no communication with each other simply
because the same wants are felt and because
the same progress has been made in
knowledge indeed these very castors
were invented and used by a friend mine
in this kingdom thirty years ago and yet
i can readily believe that some frenchman
may have again re invented them still
more lately
but if your friend invented them first
said harry i think it is wrong that they
should be called french castors
it is not worth while for nations or individuals
to dispute about such trifles my
dear boy said his father no persons who
have much invention are meanly anxious
to contest on every petty occasion their
claims to originality their feeling is 
better invent something new than dispute
about the past
here the conversation was interrupted
by tke arrival a lady who was to drink
tea with them when tea was over she
produced from her workbag a little manuscript
 containing a collection 
riddles and charades which she had brought
for harry's amusement lucy liked them
because she found them out quickly
harry was uncommonly slow and unsuccessful
in his attempts even hints intended
to help him invariably set him more
wrong he soon came to pray tell me
and when told he could not always understand
the explanations they appeared
more difficult than the riddles themselves
especially when both lucy and the lady were
explaining them to him at once and in different
ways however he was so good
humoured and afforded so much diversion
by his strange guesses and extraordinary
misapprehensions that their visitor as she
closed her declared that for her part
she should have been quite sorry if he had
made them out better sixorseven special
favourites she left copies with lucy and
after her departure harry begged lucy to
go over these again with him one by one
k 
if he had ever known he had by this time
forgotten their meaning so that they were
to be guessed by him again with lucy's
assistance
 first said lucy comes a riddle
you eat me you drink me deny it alio can 
i'm sometimes a woman and sometimes a man
i'm sometimes a woman and sometimes
a man repeated harry and yet you are
eaten only cannibals eat men and women 
and yet this cannot be a cannibal you
may as well tell me at once lucy for i
cannot find it out
then it is a toast said lucy you
eat a toast and you drink a toast do not
you and sometimes a woman is a toast
and sometimes a man deny it who can
harry could not deny it but he observed
it was a play upon the different
meanings the word
 yes and a happy play said lucy
happy for you who found it out
said harry well i have now some notion
how to set to work i shall look in
the next for a play upon the words now
for number two which he read accordingly
with his usual deliberation
i'm latin i'm english
both one and the other 
but the latin one half
is english for t'other
but neither latin nor english half could
he make out and when lucy told him it
was a toad it was a considerable time before
he could divide toad into to and ad or
comprehend that being latin for to and
each word being composed two letters the
terms the problem were exactly fulfilled
he acknowledged that it was a shame for
him not to have found out this as his latin
should have helped him but he sheltered
himself under the change pronunciation
in both words lucy told him that such
little variations sound must be allowed
or there would be no getting on with riddles

very well i will make allowance
another time and that will help me i hope
to make out number three
inscrib'd on many a learned page
in mystic characters and sage
long time my first has stood
and though its golden age be past
in wooden walls it yet may last
till clothed in flesh and blood
 my second is a glorious prize
for all who love their wondering eyes
with curious sights to pamper
but should they chance this prize to meet
al improvise in the street
oh how twould make them scamper f
my third's a sort wandering throne
to woman limited alone
the salique law reversing 
but when th imaginary queen
prepares to act this novel scene
her royal part rehearsing
overturning her presumptuous plan
up jumps the old usurper man
the lady had said that she believed this
riddle was composed by a great statesman
charles fox and lucy thought this very
likely from his statesmanlike allusion to
the salique law but be it written by
whom it might she thought it very ingenious

while she was saying all this harry
was pondering over the manuscript lucy
advised him to leave any first and go on
ta my second because he could easily guess
what would make any body run away if
suddenly met in the street and what
would at the same time be a curious sight
he did make out that this misfht be a
wild beast a tiger or a lion lucy bid
him stick to lion and goon to consider what
could be a wandering throne for woman 
yet a throne which must be enjoyed with
the assistance man with infinite
difficulty harry at last guessed a sedan
chair but sedan chair and lion would not
make any sort sense therefore said
lucy remember up jumps the old usurper
man that may help you but all
her helps were vain
oh tell me said he groaning
 a pillion said she he stared and
looked blank till she had repeated it syllabically

he went back to the pill the mystic
characters inscribed on many a learned
page being the physician s recipe and
the allusions to the old custom gilding
pills and to their present wooden receptacles
harry acknowledged to be somewhat
ingenious but he could not pass over
the fault in the spelling there was an 
too little if the lion's share was taken from
him to complete the pill lucy assured
him that he must make some allowance in
the spelling as well as in pronunciation 
a kind poetical licence must be given
he was willing to give any licence
which the laws riddlemakers allowed
all he asked was to know the laws that
he might guide himself by them
but the laws will not guide you much
i am afraid said lucy let us go on
with the fourth and we shall see
my first doth affliction denote
which my second was born to endures
my third is a sure antidote
that affliction to soften and cure
harry had no time nor opportunity to
puzzle or blunder at this for his father
hearing the words exclaimed that is
woman is it not lucy and addressing
himself to her mother observed that this
charade reminded him fontenelle's just
and elegant description the female sex 
ce sexe sans lequel le commencement
de la vie serait sans secours le milieu
sans plaisir et la fin sans consolation
lucy now read number five 
 my first conveys the irish lass
to ballyshannon fair 
my second oft contains a mass
 gold and diamonds rare 
my third is worn by those i wot
who gold and diamonds wear 
the irish lass she wants it not
at ballyshannon fair
harry gave this up for said he i
know nothing about irish lasses or ballyshannon
fair it is quite impossible for me
to make this out so tell it me lucy
 carmine
i wot he does not know that use it
said his mother
i do mother and you do not make
that use it answered he with a knowing
smile and i am glad you do not
do you remember lucy that when i was a
k 
very little boy and going my rounds wishing
good night i had to kiss a lady that
shall be nameless who wears quantities 
rouge i did not know that and unfortunately
kissed away half her cheek and left the
oddest mark i could not help staying to
look at it and she was very angry but
now go on lucy and read your next which
is so short that i hope it will be easy 
the beginning eternity the time and
space
the beginning every and the every
place
he looked very serious it sounded so
stand that he fancied it must be something
sublime and much was he provoked
when he was told at last that what
he had been aiming so high to reach was
only the letter e
but you found it out lucy cried he
how could you 
i cannot tell said she
oh do recollect what put it into your
head that it was a letter what was your
first thought how did you go on pray
think lucy
thus urged to it lucy did her best to
recollect and after a pause deep consideration
and snuffing the candles which
did not want snuffing she said that at
first she thought as harry did that it must
be something very sublime but its being
the every place convinced me
said she that it could not be any thing
serious then the contradictions the
impossibilities showed me it could not be
any one real thing except a letter
except a letter but how did you
come to that exception
lucy said she had long ago heard a
very pretty enigma upon the letter h
beginning 
twas whispered in heaven twas muttered in
hell's
she confessed she should never have found
it out if she had not heard this
that is really a great comfort to my
stupidity said harry for i never heard
one that sort before
now my dear harry let me go on to
another which i must tell you beforehand
is quite a different kind it is a
charade 
my first is a french negative my second an
english characteristic my whole the essence 
all the charades that ever were or ever will be
written
i do believe it is nonsense exclaimed
harr
it is harry said lucy how did
you find it out 
by my english characteristic said
harry drawing himself up with a look 
mock pride
since you have found this out said
lticy perhaps you can find out the next
and it is the last now this is not a
charade it is a conundrum burke's
famous satirical conundrum
what is majesty stripped its externals
harry went to work carefully and rationally
considering what are the externals
 a king
but lucy laughing told him that all his
fine reasonings would only carry him away
from the answer
 lead me to it then said he the
way you found it out
 i did not find it out said lucy but
i will tell you how i happened to know it
once in my old copybook in large hand
there was the word majesty it was divided
this way majests with hyphens between
each syllable look harry wdiat do you
see in the middle i 
 oh i see it now said harry jest
 yes said lucy and when i showed
my copy to mamma she or somebody in
the room repeated this conundrum
 it is very good said harry m andy
are the externals and it is a jest this is
very witty i acknowledge but i never
should have discovered it it is quite
different from any the others the
worst it is that after labouring ever so
hard at one riddle it does not in the least
lead to another the next is always on
some different principle 
 yes to be sure said lucy nobody
who knows how to puzzle would give
two riddles the same kind that would
be rather too plain
 but then without something to guide
me said harry there is no getting on
 not in your regular way said lucy
you cannot go on from one riddle to
another as you do in euclid from one
proposition to another and say by the first
proposition and by the second and so on
that is the very thing i complain 
said harry
complain but my dear harry riddles
are meant only to divert one
but they do not divert me when they
only puzzle me said harry
 but the object all riddlemakers
said lucy is to make riddles as puzzling
as they possibly can
well then said harry since you
seem to be in the riddlemaker's secrets
lucy pray explain to me the ways they
take to puzzle or rather the rules by which
you guess their meaning y
i would if i could harry but i
really have no rules i can only find out
riddles by lucky guesses happy hits i
do not know how or why but all at once i
see i feel that will dos a thought flashes
 
across my mind just as quickly as the
flame that candle jumped to mamma's
taper and lighted it as if by magic did
you see the flame jump 
i did said harry and i wish the
riddlemaker's ways were as plain as that
the taper had been just blown out and
there was a little smoke which still contained
some the inflammable gas from
the melted wax this you see made a
kind road for the flame to run along
in an instant the flame seemed to dart
upon the taper
it is just in that manner said lucy
that our thoughts dart from one idea to
another and sometimes without any connection
between them
no no said harry we may not
perceive any but i dare say there always
is some sort connection between our
thoughts like the train smoke between
the candles
 but mamma said lucy all this
time i want to hear your riddle very much
the lady interrupted you and you never
told it will you give us yours now
mamma
mine my dear said her mother
it is not mine it was written by
but i will not tell you by whom i never
like to prejudice you by celebrated names
judge for yourself
she repeated to them the following
lines 
we are spirits all in white
on a field as black as night 
there we dance and sport and play
changing every changing day 
yet with us is wisdom found
as we move in mystic round
mortal would'st thou know the grains
that ceres heaps on lydian plains
or leaves that yellow autumn strews
or the stars that herschel views 
or find how many drops would drain
the widescoops bosom the main
or measure central depths below 
ask us and thou shalt know
with fairy feet we compass round
the pyramid's capacious mound
or step by step ambitious climb
the cloudcapped mountain's height sublime
riches though we do not use
tis ours to gain and ours to lose
from araby the blest we came
in every land our tongue's the same 
and if our number you require
go count the bright ionian quire
would'st thou cast a spell to find
the track light the speed wind 
or when the snail with creeping pace
shall the swelling globe embrace 
mortal our's the powerful spell 
ask us for we can tell
beautiful cried lucy
yes beautiful poetry at least said
harry whatever else it is mother
will you repeat it once more for i quite
forgot to think finding it out
after it had been repeated lucy had
several the lines by heart and harry
had all the ideas lucy made a variety
 good guesses but wonderful to tell
harry found it out first he fixed upon
one positive assertion 
from araby the blest we came
here was a clear fact by the test which
he tried all his own suppositions and all
lucy's guesses as fast as they occurred
in every clime our tongue's the same
repeated lucy that may be the alphabet

 that did not come from araby the
blest it came from phoenicia you know
my father told us said harry
 hieroglyphics then said lucy
they are in every tongue the same
they will do for what is said about the
pyramids too
but hieroglyphics came from egypt
not arabia said harry
he had thought a telescope and a
barometer and a pedometer one after another
as he heard numbering the
stars and measuring the height the
 mountains or the breadth the pyramids
but none these things came from
 araby the blest
lucy mean time had flown off as she
was bid to the muses
if our number you require
go count the bright ionian quire
 their number must be nine harry
said she
then i know what they are cried
harry the nine arabic figures we
have it mother 
yes they come from araby the blest 
and they can number the stars and measure
the earth they do all that is required
harry is right is not he mother
cried lucy i am sure he is by your
smile
her mother made no answer but repeated

we are spirits all in white
on a field as black as night
there we dance and sport and play
changing every changing day
chalk figures on a black board said
harry
 or figures on a slate said lucy 
they are white on a field black and
they change every day on my slate i am
sure
now you have it said their mother
and good night it is very late we
must roll harry back again
one moment mamma said lucy
before we go will you tell us who wrote
those lines
the same person who wrote the hymns
which you learned by heart lucy the
same person harry who wrote your favourite
 perseverance against fortune
and many other things in evenings at
home which you like so much
mrs barbauld mamma the same
person who wrote the beautiful essay you
read in that we saw at digby castle
at the which was written in sir
rupert's own hand 
 admirable morality in most elegant
and classical language i wish mrs barbald
had written more
 papa said lucy i wish you would
be so good as to give harry and me one 
your old sort puzzles
my old sort puzzles my dear 
what do you mean
such questions i mean as you used
 against inconsistency in our expectations
in miscellaneous pieces by j akin m d and
anna laetitia barbauld
to ask us sometimes when we were sittinground
the fire last winter you may remember
papa one in particular which i
found out it was sancho panza's judgment
when he was governor the island
about the old man and the ten golden
crowns which were hid in the hollow staff
can you give us some other questions like
that papa
pray do father said harry or if
you have none those ready some question
like hero's crown or the kite and
pompey's pillar
only whatever it is pray papa added
lucy let there be along with the question
some little story
but my dear children said their
father i am not a baof stories and
questions as you seem to think me into
which you can put your hand and pull
one out whenever you please you must
give me a few minutes for recollection by
the time you have finished that game 
chess perhaps i shall have thought one
in a few minutes lucy warned her father
that she should very soon be beaten
there checkmate it is all over
with me
 but you made no battle said harry 
you were not worth beating you were
in such a hurry to get to the story
may be so said lucy now papa
is going to begin and we may roll your
sofa up close to the teatable this being
done their father began as follows 
 three arab brethren a noble family
were travelling together for improvement
it happened one day that their road lay
across a great plain sand where there
was little else to be seen except a few tufts
 grass towards the close the day
they met a cameldriver who asked them
if they had seen and could give him any
tidings a camel that he had lost
 was not your camel blind an eye
said the elder brother yes said the
cameldriver it had a tooth out before
said the second brother and it was
lame said the third very true replied
the man pray tell me which way it
went did it not carry asked the
arabians a vessel oil and a vessel 
honey it did indeed answered the
cameldriver pray tell me where you
met it met it we never saw your
camel they replied
 the enraged cameldriver could not
believe this he charged them with having
stolen his camel and brought them before
the prince from their manners and the
wisdom their answers to the questions
which the prince asked them upon other
subjects he was persuaded that they were
above committing such a theft he set
them at liberty but requested that before
they departed they would inform him how
they could possibly have hit upon so many
circumstances that were true without ever
having seen the camel
the brothers could not refuse to comply
with so just a request and after thanking
him for his clemency and kindness the
eldest spoke thus 
 we are not magicians nor have weever
seen the man's camel all we know
 him was discovered by the use our
senses and our reason i judged that he
was blind an eye because 
 now harry and lucy explain if you
can the methods by which the three
brothers guessed that the camel was blind
 an eye and lame a leg that he had
lost a front tooth and was laden with a
vessel oil and another honey
harry asked whether there was anything
in the camel driver himself by which
they judged no there was nothing in
or about the cameldriver that gave any
assistance
 papa i wish you would help us a
very little said lucy
do you not recollect telling me this
morning that you knew my horse had been
at the door though you did not see it
by the tracks oh yes papa cried
lucy no other horse ever comes up
that gravelpath and as the arabians
were travelling on a sandy desert probably
they had seen no other tracks but that
one camel but how did they know that
he was lame one leg 
the camel would put the lame foot
down more cautiously than the others
said harry and the trace that footstep
would be always less deep than those
 the other three
the bled eye was a more difficult question
lucy thought the camel might have
swerved more to one side than to the
other or perhaps the footsteps might show
places where he had started out the path
and always on the same side a few other
guesses were made but nothing more was
found out this evening
the next morning lucy said she had
thought the camel and the three brothers
the moment she wakened but the more
she thought the more she was puzzled
she was just going to add papa i give
it up but harry advised her to have
patience a little longer it happened at
this instant that her mother was helping
her to some honey a drop ell on the
tablecloth and a bee which was flying
about the room settled upon the sweet
spot
lucy started with delight on observing
this and exclaimed harry harry i
have found it out the vessel honey
leaked the drops fell on the sand and
vol l
the brother observed the little collections
 bees or insects which had settled on
them i am right for papa smiles as
to the oil some that might have been
spilled by the jolting the lame camel
the loss the tooth is all that now remains
so i leave that to you harry you
look as if you had a bright thought
 i remember said harry my father
in the beginning the story told us that
there were a few tufts grass on the road 
the hungry camel for no doubt he was
hungry in the desert might have bitten
these and one the sharpeyed brothers
might have seen that in each bite a few
blades grass stood up higher than the
rest because the gap left by the want
 the tooth
now we have it all right said lucy
and we were very little helped considering
 
 but i wish we had not been helped
at all said harry i wonder whether
any body our age ever found out these
questions without any help 
his father said that the questions had
perhaps never been asked before certainly
not in the same manner in which he had put
them because he had altered them for the
present purpose in the story from which
they were taken some the questions
would have been too difficult for harry
and lucy but they were now ambitious
to try these and their father was willing
to comply with their wish warning them
however the improbability success
in the original story said he instead
 a camel it was a horse and one
 the brothers discovered that the horse
had silver shoes and a golden bit and he
also told the exact value or fineness the
silver the shoes and the gold the
bit how did he know all this
i cannot conceive said lucy yet
perhaps if you give us time papa some
accident might put us in the right road
some lucky list like the falling the
honey on the tablecloth and the bee
settling on it might lead us to invent the
thing whatever it is
no lucy said her fitlier no lucky
hit could possibly help you to this you
l
want some particular facts without which
you cannot answer the question
 then cannot you be so good as to tellus
those particular facts said harry
 no my dear answered his father
they depend on the art assaying
metals that is ascertaining their fineness
and value so i may as well tell you
at once that the wise brothers had observed
the marks which the horse's shoes
had left on some stones in the path they
had also observed the marks which the
golden bit had left on the stone trough at
a well where the horse had rubbed it in
drinking the skilful eye one the
brothers had been able to judge the
fineness and value the golden bit and
silver shoes by the different colours these
marks
harry pondered for a few moments and
then observed that the difficulty explaining
these puzzling questions sometimes
arises from our not having the particular
sort knowledge that is necessary
and sometimes from our not being able to
recollect that which we really have for
instance said he we knew all that was
necessary for answering the first four questions
 all the difficulty was just to recollect
and apply our knowledge to the
purpose
 you can hardly call it knowledge
said lucy if you mean such little observations
as those about the tracks a horse
or the bees settling on the honey everybody
knows that bees eat honey
and yet it was for want oiu recollecting
those little things which every body
knows that we were puzzled so long said
harry
well then harry said lucy if a
fairy were to give you your choice this
minute all the knowledge from all the
books in the world without ofivinof you the
power recollecting it or the power 
recollecting well whatever knowledge you
could acquire for yourself which would
you choose 
to be sure i would choose the power
 recollecting well whatever i could get
for myself said harry for what use
would it be to me to have all the knowledge
in all the books that ever were written
if your fairy forbids my ever recollecting
any it when i want it
but i did not say that there should be
any forbidding in the case you may recollect
the knowledge she gives you just as
you please or can
please or can repeated harry there
is a great difference between them to be
sure i should please to recollect if i
could but often i cannot and it would
be still more difficult if i were to have that
immensity knowledge which your fairy
offers me i should never be able to find
any one thing i wanted in such a mass i
should be my whole life getting it into any
tolerable order
ah then you would feel the use 
what you would not allow when i was
sorting my shells classification harry
no single head could contain all the
knowledge all men's heads put together
said harry whether classified or not
but suppose my fairy has the power
to make yours contain it all said lucy
 would you have it yes or no she is
waiting for an answer
no is my answer said harry no
thank you mrs fairy i would rather not
have that load learning but for the
power recollecting quickly i should be
very much obliged to you indeed i feel
every day how much i want it and i cannot
get it for myself but knowledge i can
work for and get for myself nature or
one your good fairies must give memory
i wish one would appear this minute and
offer it to me
and i said lucy would be equally
obliged to her for knowledge but mamma
is it not curious that harry would refuse
the offer the knowledge and 
should be for accepting it what would
you do mamma and what would you
papa r
her mother agreed with lucy that she
would accept the knowledge and run her
chance for recollecting what she might
want her father joined with harry in
dreading the overwhelming quantity 
learning and in preferring the gift recollection
it should be observed that his
father like harry had not a remarkably
good memory but that both lucy and her
mother had quick recollective powers 
each chose according to their sense 
their own deficiencies and each argued
according to their own view the matter
long but not loud the question was
debated on each side even till the last cup
 tea lingered and grew cold
for some time harry and his father maintained
their argument on the ground that
it was best to accept from the fairy that
which cannot be obtained by one's own
exertions but this stronghold was shaken
by the attacks the opposite party and
lucy or rather her mother doubted the
truth the principle that the powers 
memory cannot be improved at length
they all rose from the breakfast table pretty
much but not quite the same opinions
with which they began it was however
settled that no hasty answer should be
given to the fairy till the matter had been
reconsidered and that in the mean time
the business the day must proceed
after harry's business the daw was
done his pleasure was to make a model
 a machine which he had been inventing
with some cards that lucy had brought
him she sat at work beside him but
her work was often put down while they
talked
 there was something mentioned yesterday
evening said lucy about a kite
and pompey's pillar i do not know what
you meant about the kite but i do know
a story about an obelisk
 i will tell you all i know said harry
about the pillar and the kite and then
you can tell me your story 
some english sailors laid a wager
that they would drink a bowl punch on
the summit pompey's pillar now that
pillar is almost a hundred feet high and
it is quite sniootli so that there was noway
 climbing to the top even for sailors
who are such experienced climbers the

question my father asked me was how did
they get up 
 i cannot conceive how a kite could
help them said lucy
you shall see said harry they
flew their kite exactly over the pillar so
that when it came down on the opposite
side the string lay across the top the
capital by means the string they
pulled a small rope over and by this a
larger one that was able to bear the weight
 a man a pulley was then fastened to
the the large rope and drawn close
up to the upper edge the capital and
then you know lucy they could easily
hoist each other up they did more for
they hoisted the english flag on the top
 mr pompey's pillar and they drank
their bowl punch there and they won
their wager
and they deserved it for their ingenuity
said lucy but my story is
quite different one evening after a wet
day as we were standing at the window
i observed that the ropes were very
tight between the posts in the fence 
they did not hani down nearly so low
as usual papa asked me if i could
tell the reason and i said that i supposed
the wet had swelled the ropes and
shortened them it was about our hygrometer
time harry so it was easy forme
to think this then papa recollected
the obelisk story but first i should
warn you as he did me that probably it is
not true
 well well let me hear it said harry
laughing whether it be true or false 
then you must know that there is at
rome a famous obelisk egyptian granite
and prodigious weight after it had
been brought from egypt to rome it lay
on the ground a length time no one
having ventured to erect it at last a great
architect and mechanic was employed for
this purpose by the pope great preparations
were made for fear injuring the
obelisk if it should fall but my father
did not describe the machinery
i am sorry for it said harry
 i could not have remembered it for you
if he had whatever the machinery might
have been the obelisk was at last raised
so as to be very nearly but not quite upright
the men pulled and pulled at the
ropes but oh terrible disappointment it
was found that they could not be tightened
any more by any means that had been
provided or that the architect could suggest
there the obelisk huno the workmen at
a stand the spectators all silent and the
architect in despair i forgot to tell you
harry that the pope had ordered under
pain death that nobody should speak
during the operation butt the instant when
none knew what to do an english sailor
from the crowd called out with a loud voice
wet the ropes water was thrown over
them they soon shortened just sufficiently
to raise the obelisk to its right place and
it stood perfectly perpendicular
harry thought it was a pretty story
whether true or not he could scarcely
think he said that the shrinking the
ropes would have been sufficient nor could
he imagine how the people could get upto
wet them all it however reminded him
 a circumstance which he had heard his
father relate to sir rupert digby
the walls some great building in
paris were beginning to give way under
the weight the roof they were pressed
outwards and were no longer exactly perpendicular
to squeeze them in and make
them again upright was the thing to be
done for this purpose several strong iron
bars were laid across the building from
wall to wall about half way up and their
ends were left projecting on the outside fires
were then lighted underneath these iron
bars till they were nearly red hot which
caused them to expand and while in their
highest state expansion large thick
plates iron with holes in their centres
were slipped on the ends the bars
close up against the outside the walls
and secured there as firmly as possible by
great iron nuts which screwed on after
them the bars were then allowed to
cool and in cooling they contracted and
consequently the iron plates and the walls
with them were drawn a little closer together
the operation was then repeated
with another set bars and so on alternately
with the two sets till the walls
were gradually restored to their perpendicularity

lucy thought this exceedingly ingenious
she observed too that harry had recollected
it at the right moment though he
complained so much his memory
after this a honos silence ensued
what can you have been thinking 
all this time said lucy only that
model you are making 
i have been thinking a great many
other things said harry among others
 some the questions my father asked
us last winter do you remember one
about a persian painter i cannot recollect
exactly how it was
yes i remember it said lucy it
was a very simple thing and yet i could
not answer it an lilian prince a conqueror
kouli khan or nadir shah or
tamerlane or bajazet or some those
people found among his prisoners after
some great victory a persian painter now
the conquering prince whoever he was
was not remarkably handsome he was
blind an eye lame a leg and one 
his arms was shorter than the other but
this man pleased the prince so much by
drawing his portrait in an attitude which
concealed all his personal defects that he
gave him his liberty without ransom and
 course half a dozen purses gold
besides he painted him drawing a bow
kneeling on the lame knee shutting the
blind eye and pulling back the lame arm
this attitude was the question
 well done the painter said
harry but not well done lucy for
this i think was an easy question particularly
for you who draw and are used to
think attitudes for figures how happened
it that you could not find it out at
the time you wanted 
 because i was thinking something
else
what when papa asked you the
question 
yes said lucy it put me in mind
 something else at first setting out and
off went my head to that other thing and
i could not get it back again
and pray what did it go off to
said harry
oh to nonsense my dear said lucy
 first when my father spoke an indian
prince and a great conqueror i began to
think who it could be that was lame and
blind and such a frightful figure then
i thought tamerlane and then the
iron cage in which he was shut up by
bajazet and then off went my thoughts
still further to a print garrick in the
character bajazet then came his great
turban before my eyes and the little cock's
feather in front which i thought looked
like the feather spun glass that you gave
me ages ago this put me in mind 
mamma's saying it was dangerous to wear
that spun glass because the little bits
might fall into our eyes my thoughts
then jumped off to the glasshouse in
short when papa asked me for the answer
i started my head was a hundred miles
off at least
i have often done the same thing and
felt the same way said harry about
questions my father has asked us another
reason for my not finding out the right
answer is that some fixed notion has taken
possession my wise head beforehand
and which i cannot get rid did you
ever feel this lucy
 oh yes said lucy and i recollect
having often been a provokingly long time
in answering something that was quite
easy merely because i had made sure that
it was difficult for instance that easiest
 questions which you asked me once 
a herring and a half for three halfpence
how many for elevenpence i fancied
because it was so gravely asked there
must be something difficult in it
harry smiled
 and you harry yourself continued
lucy may recollect you were full as long
a time as i was about the herrings in finding
how to write fiftysix with four fives
yes said harry because i had
taken it into my head that it must be
written in roman figures and this prejudice
prevented me from thinking the
right way with common figures and fractions
in this manner but now
continued harry let me before i forget
it give you another a better or a worse
instance the same sort prejudice ina
real good question my father's sometime
ago the day my father took me into
the dockyard he showed me a ship lying
in what is called a dock the keel was
to be repaired and for this purpose it was
necessary to raise up the ship so that the
workmen might get underneath the question
my latter asjkcu ms vraa ixow lie
vessel could be raised i was an hour
puzzling about it because i was prepossessed
with a particular notion about tackles
and ropes with which i had seen sailors
raising and lowering a boat and i thought
the ship could be raised only in that sort
 way my father showed me the absurdity
 that idea and then i thought 
levers but i could get no further i went
on thinking levers and pulleys and
windlasses but never the easy way that
was before my eyes to let in the water
from outside the dock the water
you know would gradually float the vessel
and raise it up to the proper height where
it could be propped up and the water let
out again next tide
how simple said lucy just as
our boat in the lock was raised i wonder
you did not think that but harry
yesterday i heard my father talking to you
 some different way raising a ship
when it wanted to be repaired i came
into the room in the middle what you
were saying i wish you would explain
it if you can
i will try said harry you must
first all knows that when a vessel is
floated into a dock to be repaired she is
allowed to settle down with her keel upon
thick wooden blocks aloof the middle 
the dock and then i must tell you lucy
that formerly when she was to be raised
up for the people to get under the keel
two or three hundred shores or props 
timber were placed all under her bottom
nearly upright wedges were then just
pointed under the lower each 
these shores and all the workmen from
every part the dockyard being summoned
with their mauls or huge hammers
and stationed one or two to each shore
the wedges were all struck at the same
instant by word command a few blows
from all the mauls was sufficient just to
raise the ship from off the blocks which
were then taken away and the ship was
left hanging in the air supported by the
shores
 this was a very troublesome business
and wasted a great deal time and labour
but by the new way all this difficulty is
avoided the blocks on which the keel
is to lie are not solid lumps wood they
are composed three pieces two which
are wedges and when these are knocked
out the centre piece the block falls
the ship is floated into the dock as usual
and when the water subsides the keel
rests on the newfashioned blocks the forest
 shores are then firmly placed under all
parts the ships bottom in the same
way as i described to you before but
without any wedges now lucy comes
the beautiful contrivance two or three
men only are sufficient to do the rest 
they give a few knocks on the sides the
wedges which the blocks are composed
out they fly the blocks sink and the
ship hangs on the shores i do hope you
understand this lucy
yes i am sure i do said lucy but
it is such a pretty contrivance that should
like very much to see it done suppose
you make an experiment with your little
boat in our canal
so i will with pleasure when i am
well said harry it is very agreeable
to explain these things to you now lucy
added he because you do not think you
know it all before i can get my words or
thoughts out
it is a great while harry said lucy
since you called me mrs quickquick
it is a great while said harry looking
a little ashamed and i am glad 
it i think you are quite cured that
lucy added he
are you sure that i am quite cured
 yes perfectly cured he twice repeated
with emphasis and even if you
had not cured yourself i should not be so
impatient now i hope as i was then i
should be very ungrateful if i were you
who are so kind and goodnatured to me 
thinking nothing from morning till night
but what you can do to make me happy
 then if you are happy so am i said
lucy but harry i must tell you that
you are a little mistaken i am often in
too great a hurry still though you do not
see it because i have learned not to be in
such haste to speak but in thinking i
still often make sad mistakes and really
am prevented from finding things out by
being too quick
give me an instance said harry
i will said lucy about a thing
that happened very lately when we were
walking in the garden papa and i stopped
to look at the sundial which put him in
mind a story he told me that there
was a statue forget where on the statue
was this inscription whoever watches
my head and opens it on a certain day 
the year and at a certain hour that
day will if the sun shines find a treasure
the day and hour were mentioned on
the appointed day and at the appointed
hour some travellers who had read the
inscription assembled round the statue
the sun did shine but what was to be
done some were for pulling the statue
down to get at its head for it was oriaantic
height others proposed clambering upto
break open the head they did scramble
up and they did open the head but there
was nothing in it the people were very
much disappointed and they all went away
one after another grumbling at the statue
and the inscription which had made such
fools them one however wiser
than the rest stayed behind and understanding
the inscription rightly followed
its directions and found the treasure 
and how did he find it was the question
papa asked me and now i ask it you
harry
harry said he had met with the story
somewhere before the man observed
where the shadow the statue s head fell
on the plain at the appointed hour and
there he opened the ground just under
the shadow the head and found the
promised treasure was not that the
answer
exactly said lucy but i could
not find it out and all because i was too
quick
 how did your quickness hinder you 
said harry 
 i recollected another statue which
you had told me harry and as soon as i
heard the words statue and a certain hour
and the sun shining i galloped off to
your statue memnon which at a certain
hour in the day when the sun shone
on it used to send forth certain musical
sounds for the music was made as you
told me by the air when heated rushing
out holes in some pipes which were in
memnon s lyre all this i was thinking
and contriving how i could make sense 
it for i imagined that the statue's head
must be managed in the same way then
another strange thought came into my
head that the music which i had settled
this statue should play should be like our
play magical music and that it should
sound loudly or softly as the travellers
went nearer or further from the right place
and so guide them to it
very ingenious at least said harry
but it was all wrong said lucy
but i see mamma before the door with
her bonnet on cried lucy starting up
and looking out the window i daresay
she is going to walk to digby castle
and i should like to go with her if you
can spare me harry
 oh yes and thank you for the time
you have stayed said harry only
before you go give me a few large pins 
six stout pins thank you now away
with you my dear i shall be quite happy
till you come back again
when lucy returned from her walk she
brought a basket filled with flowers from
the hothouse at digby castle after
holding them for half a minute to harry to
vol m
admire and smell she began to put them
into a flowerpot telling him that she had
something solid for him at the bottom 
her basket under the flowers
 i know what it is said harry it is
a 
lucy looked immediately at the sides 
her basket to see if harry could have
spied the through the openings 
the wickerwork but that was impossible
you only guessed i suppose harry
that it was most likely that i should bring
you a 
harry said that he did not guess but
that he was quite sure it on which
lucy went to his sofa and looked from
thence out the window
but you could not while sitting here
said she see the mountain path down
which we came
i did see you said harry walking
down that path with a in your hand
and when you reached the great thornbush
i saw mamma sit down
then harry you must have got off
your sofa to look out the window
cried lucy oli fie harry you were
not to quit your sofa without leave from
the surgeon
i never stirred from the sofa said
harry
oh i have it now cried lucy 
the mirror out the camera obscura
 you are right said harry now
tell me what is the you were looking
into and where is it
 it is here in my basket said lucy
 but you shall not know its name yet i
must first tell you that in our walk to
digby castle i was giving mamma an
account what you and i had just been
talking about she said nothing or very
little only smiled now and then when
we reached the castle she went to the
library to look for some books and among
others she took down this which she put
into my hand telling me that perhaps i
should find some things in it like what you
and i had been saying to each other the
author was a most celebrated philosopher
i will not tell you his name harry but
m 
only think his having observed in his
own mind the very same sort faults
that we find in ours look at the heads
 these pages wandering attentions
that is my complaint then comes 
words abuse that means something
like what you hate in riddles harry
play upon words or using words inaccurately
which he says is a very great fault
in reasoning
i like him for that said harry whoever
he is
then said lucy here comes prejudice
and here is transferring 
thoughts by which he means not transferring
the not being able to turn them
from one subject to another easily that
you know harry is what you call your
ofreat hindrance look here it is
my picture at full length said harry
let me look at it
but it is not like you nowe said lucy
holding the fast
let me see said harry or if you
will not let me see let me hear
lucy read aloud 
men thus possessed in company that is with
their own favourite thoughts said lucy are as if
they lay under the power enchantment they see
not what passes before their eyes hear not the
audible discourse the company
like me i acknowledge on my disagreeable
day in the carriage said harry
when i did not hear what any you
were saying
 oh listen to this continued lucy
 and when by any strong application these absent
people are roused a little they are like men
brought to themselves from some remote region 
whereas in truth they come no farther than from
their secret cabinet within where they have been
wholly taken up with the puppet which was for that
time appointed for their entertainment the shame
that such dumps cause to wellbred people when it
carries them away from the company where they
should bear a part in the conversation is a sufficient
proof that it is a fault in the conduct their understanding

lucy repeated her opinion that this was
not like harry now with a very strong
consolatory emphasis on that word
but tell me said harry what were
you and my mother doing when i saw you
at the thornbush you and she opened
and shut the several times what
were you about
 looking at different parts this 
lucy replied mamma informed me
that it will tell us not our fortunes but
our faults therefore whoever does not like
to know them must not open it
i am not such a coward said harry
nor such a fool i will open it directly
then i must hold it for you said
lucy as mamma did for me
she held it between her hands and
bade him put his finger into the leaves
and take his chance
harry opened and read at the head 
the page presumption
 that is no fault your's luckily for
you said lucy let me try will you
shut and i will open
she opened at despondency
 no fault mine said lucy this
is not a good hit either but i must tell
you harry how luckily the opened
once for me when mamma held it it
opened at similies pray read what is
said about those who are always finding
similies begin here
 an aptness to jumble things together wherein
any likeness can be found is a fault in the understanding
near akin to this is letting the mind
upon the suggestion any new notion run immediately
after similies to make it the clearer to itself
 then interrupted lucy she goes onto
prove that this is wrong and he says
that these similelovers are apt to mistake
what is prettily said for sound knowledge
because they are content with their similies
which are never exact that is what long
ago harry you used to complain in my
similies do you remember 
i should like to read that said
harry
 no my dear harry i don't think you
would it is in such oldfashioned tedious
language it would tire you with its whereas a
and wherefores and parentheses and roundabout
sentences one thing however will
please you said lucy a grandissimo
panegyric that mamma showed me on mathematics
 and in the same page he says
something about the way in which young
scholars think and feel when first they begin
mathematics you can say whether he is
right or wrong there
she read the passage f to him and he
said that all about the young scholar was
true as far as he could judge now
lucy tell me the name the and
the author
 locke on the conduct the under
i have mentioned mathematics as a way to
settle in the mind a habit reasoning closely and
in train not that i think it necessary that all
men should be mathematicians but that having got
the way reasoning which that study necessarily
brings the mind to they might be able to transfer it
to other parts knowledge
t he that has to do with young scholars especially
in mathematics may perceive how their minds
open by degrees and how it is exercise alone that
opens them sometimes they will stick a long time
at a part a demonstration not for want will
and application but really for want perceiving the
connection two ideas that to men whose understanding
is more exercised is as visible as any thing
can be
standing the great locke said lucy
now harry is not it curious that we
should have thought and said to each other
some the same things which this grand
philosopher says in this but harry
it does not seem to surprise you do not
you think it extraordinary 
n o said harry it would have
been surprising indeed if we had thought
the same as the great locke about anything
else but who could know so well
as ourselves what passes in our own minds 
and there must be some likeness between
all people's minds pray does this 
tell us how to cure these faults
 mamma says replied lucy that
when i am old enough to study it attentively
 shall find a great deal excellent
advice in it but i have only read the one
page about my old disease wandering
thoughts
will you leave it on the sofa said
harry if it tires me i need not read it
 but harry said lucy before i
go i wish you would tell me why you
were so anxious about those riddles and
m 
puzzles why you made me recollect for
you step by step how i found some out
and how i failed in others 
because i thought it might teach me
to invent said harry
my dear harry to invent riddles and
puzzles do you mean 
no i do not care about them said
harry but i thought that if i discovered
what it was that puzzled me in the riddles
i could by the rule contraries prevent
myself from being puzzled in other things
well could you make out any general
rules said lucy
yes i think i have made out one said
harry you know that we found out
the figures on a slate by sticking to
araby the blest therefore in all cases
we should guide ourselves by some one
thing which is certain and thus go on from
the known to the unknown
yes and kill off the wrong guesses
that do not agree with that one fact said
lucy like the play the fourandtwenty
questions where you find out what
a person is thinking by asking is it
animal or vegetable or mineral and soon
 and each answer telling what it is not
brings you nearer to what it is till at last
you come quite to the right thing so far
so good for riddles and more good than i
expected and as for the story questions
it appears that the difficulty is less often
in the question than in ourselves in our
own minds
oxe fine sunshiny day lucy coming in
after working in the garden opened the
door the drawingroom where harry
was now daily stationed on his rolling
sofa and perceived that all the windowshutters
were shut
my dear harry what is the matter 
cried she
nothing is the matter but take care
take care cried harry do not knockdown
my little table
 i cannot see your little table said
lucy let me open a bit this shutter
 not for your life cried harry
 my father has just fixed it all for me
only walk straight to my sofa and shut
the door after you my father is going to
show me some sir isaac newton's famous
experiments on light and colours 
and my dear lucy your setting me in
pursuit the green and blue shadows is
the cause all this happiness to me my
father came in and found me at that 
he talked to me about it and found out
what i did understand and what i did not
and then he said that all my pains should
not be wasted he will give us halfanhour
a day as long as i am confined to the
sofa to show us these experiments and
perhaps he will tell us something about
the cause those colours in soap bubbles
about which we have been so curious
lucy now found that she had been mistaken
in supposing that harry could not
pursue any entertaining experiments while
out the reach laboratory and workshop
 and her father assured her that
no account is given these experiments because
they can be found in scientific dialogues and
various other publications
many most ingenious experiments have
been tried by the greatest philosophers
with the simplest apparatus he recollected
having seen a letter from sir humphrey
davy agreeing with priestley in opinion
that no man who waits to try experiments
till he has every convenience prepared
will ever make any discoveries in
chemistry
 but i hope said lucy that our
friend sir rupert digby's having such a
nice laboratory and workshop does not
prevent him from being a philosopher
not at all said her father that
does not follow what i tell you may bea
comfort to those who have not these advantages
and may prevent them from conceiving
that they are essential to success
a great deal may be done without them
but a man fortune cannot employ his
wealth better than by preparing such conveniences
for learning and science i
would say here the reverse what a peat
moralist has said upon another occasion 
dr johnson observes that it is often misery
to want what it is not happiness to possess
i should say the workshop and the laboratory
it is often happiness to have what
it is not misery to want
in repeating these experiments sir
isaac newton's his father told harry that
he had a farther object than his mere acquisition
 the facts he wished his son
early in life to observe with what care and
exactness this great philosopher had conducted
his experiments how cautious he
was to make himself certain by repeated
trials the causes the effects produced 
never venturing assertions nor trusting to
his own suppositions till they had been
verified by repeated trials never hazarding
general conclusions from a few facts and
what is perhaps the most difficult all
never taking any thing for granted
lucy having expressed some surprise
at her father's saying that this was the
most difficult he smiled and said per
have the day will not pass without your
giving me some little opportunity proving
it to you by your own practice
a little while afterwards lucy who was
making some pasteboard model for harry
went into a closet opening into the 
to look for a saucerfull paste
which she had left there but the mice had
eaten it and she was forced to wait while
a fresh supply was preparing during
this interval many were her invectives
against the whole race mice and many
her resolves to put the saucer this night
where none could reach it she stood
with an old newspaper ready spread on
the table for pasting suddenly a paragraph
in it caught her eye and she exclaimed
 now mice i defy you and all
your nibbling mamma look here i
have found an infallible receipt for preserving
paste or any thing against the
depredations mice the easiest way
in the world mamma only to surround
it with sprigs mint pray mamma read
this
i read it three months aoo mv dear
gait her mother and i tried it i surrounded
a plate paste with sprigs 
mint and next morning i found much 
the paste gone and the mint scattered
i repeated the experiment with different
things and always with equal want 
success
i
there is an then said lucy 
the infallible preservative
i do not know much about plants
said harry but i believe there are different
sorts mint they may not all have
the same properties perhaps the mint
you used mother might not be the kind
recommended in the receipt
his father observed that harry's was a
good suggestion that every circumstance
should be the same in repeating an experiment
otherwise it is not fairly tried and
the conclusion cannot be depended upon
lucy expressed a wish to try the experiment
for herself if her mamma would
not be offended but harry assured her
that nobody ever thinks being offended
about trying experiments
then i will run out to the garden
and gather plenty mint said lucy
away she ran and at night she fenced
her pasteplate round with a double row 
different kinds mint thus entrenched
she placed it on the same shelf in the
same closet and shut the door in the
morning her father and mother were at the
opening the closet to her agreeable
surprise she found that the paste had not
been touched there were no marks in it
 little feet or nibbling teeth and the
sprigs mint remained exactly in the
same order in which she had arranged
them
well mamma what do you think
now said lucy perhaps the receipt
writer may not be mistaken after all perhaps
mamma you did not join your fence
 mint as well as i did perhaps you had
not a double row or you left some little
loophole for the mouse to push his little
nose into what do you think mamma
and papa and what do you think
harry 
the door the closet being open he
could see all that passed
why do not you answer harry 
what are you looking at
i am looking at something which you
had better see before you decide said
harry
lucy followed the direction lies eyes
and saw just peeping out over the top 
a basket which stood in the corner the
closet the head a cat
oh pussy are you there all this
time cried lucy
at this instant the cat jumped out 
the basket and stretched herself as she
awakened upon inquiry it was found
that a servant who had heard lucy complain
 the loss her paste and who had
not known the mint experiment had
put the cat into the closet
then i suppose said lucy that it
was the cat frightened away the mice i
give up the mint
no said harry do not leave it to
suppose do not give it up till you have
fairly tried the experiment tonight make
sure the cat and leave the mint as
before
this was done and the result was that
the mint was found scattered and the paste
eaten
now i am convinced said lucy
 but how very extraordinary it is papa
that the mint should have succeeded for
the man in the newspaper and not for us
perhaps he never tried the experiment
said her father
oh papa cried lucy do you
think any body would publish that mint is
an infallible preservative against mice
without having tried it when i saw those
words in print papa how could i help
believing them 
her father laughed and told her that
she must not believe every thing she saw
in print a friend mine said he
once found a young man reading a romance
called amadis de gaul which is
full impossible adventures when he
asked the young man whether he believed
that it was all true he answered to be
sure sir it is in print 
 but father said harry i think
unless lucy had been very disagreeably
suspicious she could not have acted differently
how could she possibly tell that
the man in the newspaper was not to be
believed or that his experiments were inaccurate
 she has been used to live with
people who tell truth and who are accurate

 for that very reason my dear harry
 who have had experience a contrary
kind should put her on her guard against
that which at her age she could not possibly
imagine without being as you justly
say disagreeably suspicious
harry felt that this was just but still
he looked as if he had something else
sticking in his mind and which his understanding
could not swallow
 what is it harry
it is this father said harry if we
were to try all experiments over again
before we believed them we could never
get on something must be believed 
some things that are printed must be taken
for granted
 true harry said his father the
question therefore is zt we should believe
and whom we should trust you want rules
to guide you is this what you mean 
exactly said harry
here lucy was tired and went away to
make his pasteboard model leaving harry
to down to the bottom the well in
search truth
well harry said his father take for
instance sir isaac newton's experiments 
before we tried them over again you believed
in them did not you 
to be sure i did father
and why harry
because i knew said harry that
he had the character beings accurate
and that many other people had repeated
them
good and sufficient reasons they are
harry but when you do not know the
character the person who makes an
extraordinary assertion then how would
you judge 
after a few minutes reflection harry
said by considering whether the fact be
probable or improbable
 right said his father when anything
appears contrary to our experience
then it is necessary to examine the circumstances
carefully but at the same time
candidly some things in science that
appeared incredible at first sight have
been found perfectly true remember the
astonishment produced by the electrical
shock the powers steam and gas 
airballoons and steamboats suppose
you heard these things for the first time
you would probably have thought the accounts
ridiculous did you hear what
your mother was reading last night from
that new travels in mexico
 oh yes said harry you allude
to the mexican who was told by a man
from europe that by means a boiling
teakettle a thousand persons could
be safely moved a hundred miles a day
this was only exaggeration but there
was also an absurd story which the poor
mexicans were told that at birmingham
the clergymen are made castiron and
that they preach by steam now if i had
been a mexican i never could have believed
that if fifty thousand people had
told it to me because iron cannot feel or
speak or think
lucy returned to consult harry about
the pasteboard model she waited respectfully
while her father finished what
he was saying she heard these words 
then you feel harry that no assertions
could make you believe impossibilities
 and that in all cases which are contrary
to our experience it is necessary to
pause and doubt and examine i may
add that you will sometimes find it necessary
to doubt even the evidence your
own senses
 oh papa exclaimed lucy the
story you told us the celebrated instruct
and his wig is a good example
 that
 what can you mean my dear said
her mother
 your mother was not present when i
told harry and you that anecdote said
her father explain what you mean 
then mamma i will tell you there
was a famous mathematical instrumentmaker
 
 not there ives but there is interrupted
her father happily he is now living
and will i hope long live to be service
to science and an honour to his country
an englishman mamma continued
lucy and a very very famous instruct
 
say houghton that's enough whispered
harry
well then houghton said lucy
 having finished some great instrument
 which a magnetic needle formed a part
went to examine it for the last time and
found to his great surprise that the needle
pointed to different divisions at different
times having made this needle with
great care he could not believe that it did
not do its duty he thought there must be
some key or knife about him which attracted
it but no there was nothing 
the kind in his pockets he reasoned and
reasoned but in vain he could not discover
the cause he tried again and again the
same effect always took place and what
made it still more wonderful was that
when other people looked the needle was
quite steady this perplexing instrument
was the first tliino he thought when he
wakened next morning and he hurried
out bed in his nightcap to look at it
he found it quite steady yet after breakfast
when he looked again it was again
all wrong but now mamma he had a
distinct fact to guide him when wrong
he had had his wig on when right his
nightcap he immediately examined the
wig and found that it was fitted with small
sted springs to make it sit close to his
head the wig was thrown aside and the
instrument was perfect
mamma said lucy i think it was
scarcely worth while to spend so much
time and so much talking upon those little
cat and mint and paste experiments
 my dear said her mother if it be
worth while to try an experiment at all it
is worth while to try it accurately halftried
experiments are waste time indeed
they leave us no wiser than we
were before or what is worse they lead
vol n
us to reason upon wrong grounds and we
become only the more ignorant and the
more positive
you know mamma said lucy i
was willing to give up before i was quite
convinced
 yes but there is a great difference
between being willing to give up and
being convinced do you not feel that it
is more agreeable lucy more satisfactory
to be convinced
i do mamma if one gives up there
is always a sort feeling that one might
have been right if we had gone quite to
the bottom as harry says and after all
it is a very uncomfortable feeling not to be
certain whether we are right or wrong
 and j should be sorry my dear lucy
continued her mother that you were to
despise what you call little experiments
few people have the means trying
scientific ones but many little experiments
which are both instructive and amusing
are within everybody's reach your ingenuity
may be often more profitably employed
in finding out the causes common
appearances than in searching for those 
the most extraordinary wonders in nature
but mother said harry do you
really think that one can gain much scientific
knowledge by such accidental experiments

no harry said his mother certainly
not much scientific knowledge but
it has been said by a very good and sensible
man who made the human mind
his particular study that some exercises
are worth pursuing not so much for the
knowledge actually gained by them as for
the discipline they give the mind as
there are some crops which the farmer
sows not for the sake the profit they
afford but for their beneficial effect on the
sou
that is a beautiful allusion thought
lucy and the beauty the allusion added
much in her mind to the effect the
reasoning
 then mamma said she i wish you
would tell me some experiments to try 
this common sort
berkeley
n 
 what are you going to do my dear
with that piece new tape which you
have in your hand
 i am going to open it mamma and
to cut off some strings for my frock
 well before you begin consider which
is the best way to open it that you may
not tangle the piece as you did the last
which you took out my workbox
the best way to open it mamma are
there two ways 
yes said her mother some people
begin from the outside and some from the
inside
i have always taken the first i
found said lucy which was on the
outside but now i recollect mamma that
the other day you pulled the out from
the inside so i suppose since you did it
that must be the best way
 try my dear there is a little experiment
for you
oh mamma do you call that an experiment
 cried lucy yet to be sure
it is added she and a useful one too
if it settles the best way doing what we
want to do very often and though it is a
trifle it is better to do it well than ill and
better not to waste time by the necessity 
untangling it afterwards and better not
to waste temper too now i have wound
this piece upon a card without the least
difficulty and i am convinced that 
from the inside is best
there is another obvious advantage in
this method said her mother when
you have not time to wind the whole piece
upon a card you may take out as much or
as little you please and leave the rest unwound
because the outer coils protect and
keep in the rest
i shall follow the same plan with my
next ball twine said harry for that
is very good reasoning
 and there may be reasoning i see
even about such a thing as this said
lucy
at that moment lucy saw in her mother's
workbox an ambercoloured bonbonniere
 pellucid horn starred with gold
 oh i mamma i like this better than
the rubycoloured boxes harry do you
know how it is made mamma told me
that the horn is softened in boiling water
and then pressed into the proper shape by
a brass mould and those pretty little stars
harry she says are first placed in the
mould and squeezed in by the same operation
mamma may i help harry and
myself to some these manycoloured
sugarplums 
leave being granted lucy opened the
box but when the top was off she exclaimed
at the sight certain beautiful
green sugarplums do not touch them
harry stay one moment
she searched in her portfolio for a bit
 an old newspaper and said now
harry we may try a little experiment
listen she read as follows 
test for detecting the poison verdigris in
sugar plums sweetmeats pickles c
it is said that some confectioners give their
comfits and sweetmeats a green colour by means 
that dreadful poison verdigrise this as everybody
knows is produced by vinegar or any acid which
corrodes brass or copper the pickles which are
admired for their beautiful green are often made in
copper vessels and it is even said that cooks throw
halfpence into the saucepan to improve the green 
french beans
a gentleman whose children had been made unwell
by eating these green comfits wishes to make
known the following simple mode detecting the
presence copper drop on the comfits a little
liquid ammonia hartshorn if copper be present
they speedily acquire a blue colour
now mamma i am not going to take
it for granted that this man in the newspaper
is right this time i will try the
experiment before i say one word about
believing or not believing him if you
will give me some hartshorn mamma harry
and i will try it this minute
her mother directed her where she might
find the bottle having brought it and selected
from the box several the greenest
 the green sugarplums which she put on
a plate she applied to them a few drops
 hartshorn then adding more and more
to make herself and everybody else quite
sure the fact she cried they do not
change to blue mamma these comfits
then are quite safe hold your hand
harry and pouring a good supply into
it she added you may now eat them
without fear
 that i will said harry as he transferred
them to his mouth and without
the least fear because i never found that
they did me any harm and i am convinced
they have no copper in them nor
poison any kind but lucy my dear
if i had any doubt i must confess that
your experiment would not have quite
satisfied me
 not satisfied you harry why not
 because said harry you have not
proved to me the truth your test you
have not proved that hartshorn will turn
verdigrise or any thing which contains
copper to a blue colour that was the
very thing you were to prove
very true indeed said lucy
she now considered how she could try
whether her test was sufficient or not
 i must find a bit copper a halfpenny
mamma will do on it i will pour
some vinegar which will corrode the copper
 and after we have let it li sometime
if we see verdigrise on the halfpenny
as i hope we shall we will drop some
hartshorn over it and see whether it turns
blue then we shall be convinced whether
hartshorn is or is not a test for detecting
copper
harry said this would be a very fair
trial but his mother observed that the
poison copper was so dangerous that
she did not like to have lucy undertake
this experiment by herself if they could
wait till she was at leisure she would
assist them
she was at leisure or made leisure that
evening and without being reminded 
it recollected her promise she put two
or three halfpence into a saucer and
covered them with vinegar at the 
a few days she took the halfpence out
and left them some time exposed to the
air when they were most satisfactorily
covered with verdiirrise
quite green harry look at them
said lucy
 but do not touch them said her
mother a few grains verdigrise if
n 
swallowed might kill you now lucy
for your hartshorn drop a little on the
verdio'rise
she did so the green colour was instantly
turned to blue and harry was
satisfied
this evening lucy was preparing an
effervescence draught for her mother soda
and lemon juice the soda was in one
cup and she was squeezing the lemon
juice into the other at one unlucky squeeze
the lemon juice spirted on her mother's
ofown her own frock and her brother's
coat coat frock and gown were stained
in different avays her mothers gown was
 purple silk that was spotted yellow
but her mother instantly applying soda from
the cup in her hand the yellow spots
vanished and the purple reappeared lucy
tried the same remedy on the coat and on
the frock but it was not equally successful
and why 
her father now joined in the conversation
vv'hich this question produced and
lucy went to bed with her mind full 
experiments that it suggested
in days yore she had been a little
dabbler in vegetable dyes and her mother
had let her dabble on with saffron poppies
beetroot and weeds innumerable all
her dabbling was not quite in vain she
had learned some curious facts though no
general principles now recalled to the
subject she was delighted with the discovery
 a the next day in the
library at digby castle on the art 
dying wool silk and cotton from
this she hoped to learn how to take spots
out cotton silk or woollen cloth but
though the immediate object for which she
beoan to hunt through the was lost in
the chace she learned a great deal that was
more useful this told vegetable
animal and mineral dyes and those
substances which chemistry has taught the
dyer to use to brighten and to render
permanent his formerly fugitive colours
the beautiful system mordants opened
to lucy's view with her understanding
more enlarged than when she formerly
tried the dyer's trade she could
not be satisfied with mere receipts she
must know the reason for what she did
thus by degrees with her mother's assistance
and mrs market's the multitude
 separate facts classed themselves in her
mind and from these slight experiments
she gradually rose to general principles 
chemistry
we have learned more by our little
random experiments said lucy one day
than you expected have not we
yes said harry because though
they were little they were not random
experiments
fresh subjects seemed every hour to
arise and with entertaining variety but
no more shall be told enough is as good
as a feast in our opinion much better
harry have you finished the model 
the machine you were making with the
pasteboard and the large pins said
lucy what a long time you have been
about it
because i made a great many 

takes said he and was forced to alter
it several times but here it is at last
after a critical examination lucy pronounced
it to be tolerably neat considering
that it was a man's making she
thought the teeth the wheels might have
been cut rather cleaner and with fewer
jags left at the bottom each however
when the wheels were put in motion the
teeth took into each other well enough too

show the nature the contrivance it
was as harry told lucy an odometer or a
machine for measuring the lenoth road
over which a carriage passes this it was
to perform by registering the number 
turns made by the wheel the carriage
if the circumference a wheel is known
and the number turns it makes are
reckoned it becomes easy to calculate the
distance over which that wheel has rolled
but this machine fastened on the nave 
the wheel would as harry hoped save
the trouble calculation it being so
contrived as to show with two hands on a
dialplate in miles and furlongs the space
travelled over harry added that he had
been trying to invent some machine for
this purpose on the day he had been in
the dumps during their journey he could
not then hit upon any contrivance which
would answer though he had watched
the wheel so long but after thinking 
it again and again at different times and
in various ways he had at last made what
he hoped would succeed
when his father saw and had examined
the model harry pointed out exactly what
was his own and what was borrowed in
the invention very little it he said
was quite his own each part he had taken
from different machines which he had seen
at different times the first thought was
suggested by a common waywiser with
which long aso he had seen a man measuring
the road that machine you
know father measured by means a
wheel and made me first think that one
 the wheels a carriage mioht be made
to answer the same purpose the way 
connecting the turns the wheel with the
other parts my machine i took from
something i saw at the cotton mills and
an arithmetical machine that i saw at
diby castle helped me to the manner 
counting the turns and showing them in
miles and furlongs upon the dialplate
so you see father hardly any this was
my own except the putting together
his father highly approved his integrity
which he valued far above any ingenuity
 but i must observe to you
harry said he that all invention is in
fact only putting together in a new manner
or for a new purpose what we have
seen or known before
as to this little contrivance his father
said that he would have it executed for
him in the proper size and that he would
give him an opportunity putting it to
the test experiment by which means he
might see how far it would succeed and
what were its defects there is he
added a watchmaker in the village who
can i think divide this dialplate and cut
the teeth in these wheels for us and a
smith who can do the rest e work
lucy hoped that it would be ready by
the first day when harry was to go out in
the carriage and the surgeon said that
might be the following saturday
saturday came and the carriage at the
door but the demeter so far from being
finished was scarcely begun however
this was no disappointment to harry whatever
it might be to lucy on this first
day going out after his long confinement
so many pleasures such different
sorts absorbed his mind that as he acknowledged
after wards the demeter would
have been too much the freshness the
air the sight the country as they drove
along and all the old objects now new
to him he enjoyed with the keen relish 
restored health and liberty other and
more exquisitely pleasurable feelings filled
his heart gratitude to providence and
grateful affection to that dear father and
mother and sister whose sympathy and
tenderness and cheerfulness had in so
many ways made him happy he scarcely
spoke during the whole drive and recollecting
this just as they came home while
he pressed his mother's hand he said he was
afraid he had been very disagreeable i
believe mother i have hardly said a word
either to you or lucy
but his mother well knew the course
his feelings had taken and even lucy had
respected them in silence
it was if lucy counted rightly nine
days beyond the promised saturday before
harry's demeter was completed even
when the best workmen are employed
difficulties in making a new contrivance
will occur but in this remote place various
mistakes trying to the patience young
and old were committed at last however
it was completed and was fastened
on the carriage and the carriage was
driven on a road to a certain distance the
exact measure which had been previously
ascertained upon examination
it was found to answer as well as could be
expected on a first trial there were some
causes inaccuracy which harry perceived
and thought he could remedy it
was taken off and brought into the house 
and while harry and his father were considering
how it might be improved lucy
was talking in a low voice to her mother

whatever it was she was saying harry's
attention was so much distracted by it that
he could not comprehend some very simple
suggestion
is it possible that you do not understand
me harry said his father
no sir not yet said harry blushing
piteously then suddenly he looked
back at lucy and she stopped short
her last word was patois
 nonsense nonsense muttered harry
her father smiled now i perceive
said he what confused harry's understanding
so much
father i assure you cried harry
 i never thought such a thing for myself

but why should not lie papa said
lucy do not you remember the history
 the young gentleman eighteen who
had a patent for a new invention 
but i am not a young gentleman
 eighteen said harry i am only a
boy
notwithstanding harry's deepening
colour and tone discomfiture lucy now
went on because she fancied that her
father would agree with her and that it
was only harry's bashfulness which made
him oppose her so bluntly but her father
gravely and decidedly told her that
he thought harry was quite right and
that he was lad that he had good sense
enough not to have formed any such
scheme for himself lucy said no more
harry said his father a friend 
mine twelve years ago invented a measuring
machine on a new principle superior
to yours and to any i have seen
he has tried it for four years applied to
the wheel his gig and he has sent
an account it to dr brewsters new
series the edinburgh philosophical
journals
harry was very curious lo see it and
especially desirous to know the new and
better principle his father promised to
show him the description the contrivance
as soon as he could get the
journal
then yours is now no use harry 
no 
said lucy with a sigh i suppose you
will not do any thing more to it
but harry said that he should be
ashamed to leave it till he had made it
succeed at least till he had tried to mend
its faults
this resolution and his immediately
preparing to carry it into execution obtained
for him from his father a look 
affectionate approbation happy in this he
went off with his demeter to the watchmaker's
as soon as he had left the room
lucy returned to the subject the patent

papa i suppose that the reason why
you said it would be foolish to think a
patent for harry was because you knew
 this better machine
her father said that this was not his
reason
then papa perhaps there is something
about the expense a patent which
i do not understand but putting that
out the question would not you be
glad that he bad the honour and glory 
it
no i should not answered her father
 even supposing any honour and
glory were to be obtained by it
nor i lucy said her mother
though you look so credulous
lucy paused again upon this
then i see how it is said she yet
i should never have thought it you
would be afraid that it might make him
vain but i really do not think he is the
least inclined to be so
 well if he is not said her father
 why should we try to make him vain 
why put him in danger
i do not think papa said lucy that
there would be any canoer that sort
for harry
 my dear no human creature is altogether
exempt from vanity the most sensible
people are most aware the danger in
themselves and carefully guard against it
but independently the risk making
your brother conceited there are other
reasons which would prevent me as his
friend from desiring that he should be
early brought forward into public notice
if my son were really a genius if for
instance like bernini a famous italian
sculptor he had at twelve years old produced
a work to wonder at i should not
have done what his father did and should
not have set it up in the vatican to receive
the public admiration the observation
 the french wit is generally found to be
true c'est un fardeau tree pesant qu'un
nom trop tot fameux can you translate
that and apply it lucy
a name too early famous is a heavy
burthen answered lucy you mean
papa that people might afterwards expect
too much from such early fame but then
if harry could do more and more and go
beyond wiat is expected how glorious
that would be 
it would and in some few instances
that has been found to be the case for
example bernini exerted himself to support
his early fame and succeeded but in
general boywonders sink into insignificant
men
 without being a wonder however
said lucy it is surely a good thing that
a boy should be thought clever and i
have heard people say that harry is clever
for his age so have you mamma and you
like to hear him praised do not you
mamma
i acknowledge it said her mother
but this is no proof that it is good for
him
i know that you and papa must be
right said lucy but still i should like
to understand exactly all the harm it would
do him
it would probably give him the habit
 expecting praise for the slightest exertion
said her father and then he would
feel unhappy and unable to exert himself
without it this is one the first inconveniences
usually felt by those who have
been early overpraised he would afterwards
find other bad consequences more
importance he would no longer be satisfied
with the feeling doings what is useful
and good he would act not from the
right motive the desire to do his duty
but merely from the wish to obtain praise
then he would necessarily become dependent
upon the opinions and caprice 
others and might perhaps be led to do
what is foolish or wrong to obtain applause
even if his oood principles preserved
him from doing wrong and his
good sense from doing what was foolish
still he would lose that strength and vigour
 mind winch should enable him to labour
hard and long as all must do who wish
to attain eminence in any science or excellence
 any kind moral or intellectual
sir rupert digby as it may be remembered
told harry that a kite had
been lately employed for the useful purpose
 assisting in cases shipwreck
since they had lived on this coast
harry had heard instances ships
driven on the rocks in such situations that
in a storm boats could not get out to their
assistance and sometimes the vessels and
all on board had perished actually within
sight and almost within hail the people
on the shore who had no power to help
them in circumstances such as these a
kite that could carry out a line considerable
length and then drop in the
right place might effect a communication
with the shore and might be the means
 saving the lives the crew
the idea this kite had often during
harris illness flitted before his mind
he honored to know how it was contrived
he had brought home the volume containing
an account that ingenious invention
 but his father had advised him
to try if he could think any way 
effecting the purpose himself before he
read the description his father now told
him that captain danse's kite was not
made paper but light canvas
stretched upon two cross sticks and that
as those materials were to be found in
every vessel it might in case necessity
be made in a few minutes such a
kite it was said had carried out in a
strong breeze a rope half an inch in
circumference and twothirds a mile
in length
but continued his father you
vol o
know that the chief peculiarity these
kites is the ingenious apparatus for making
them suddenly descend and it is fair to
tell you that this is effected by a messenger
which travels up the string and detaches
it from the bellyband or bridle though
the string itself remains fast to the head
 the kite now harry an easy but
certain method doing this is what you
have to contrive however inferior your
method may be still it will have been a
good exercise for your invention and on
an interesting and useful subject within
your reach
to assist him a little further his father
added that the messenger was composed
 a hollow cylinder wood through
which the string passed and four cross
arms on which a small sail was stretched
all this being explained the question recurred
to harry at every spare moment 
and after devising sundry complicated
contrivances which were one after another
rejected he at last brought one his
projects to a simple form and immediately
set about its execution
 the strong wire which had been
given to him for his suspensionbridge he
had some left he bent a bit this wire
into a shape something like that a pair
 sugar tongs and about half an inch
from each the points these tongs he
again bent the wire inwards to nearly a
right angle these points however did
not meet but when the tongs were slightly
compressed they not only met but lapped
over each other he then cut a narrow hole
or slit in a thin bit wood so that when
his tongs were pushed into it they were
squeezed together and the points lapped
over the elasticity the wire prevented
the piece wood from slipping though
a slight blow would push it off and allow
the points to open so far being completed
harry carried his work to his father
and explained to him his plans
the bridle the kite said he is to
be hooked on the bent points these tongs 
and you see father they must hold it fast
till the messenger knocks off this piece 
wood the tongs will then open and the
bridle will slip off to the middle oro

handle part the tongs the main string
is to be tied but i shall also connect it
by a short loose piece to the head the
kite which would otherwise blow away
when the bridle slips off the hooks
this all sounded well but would the
force the messenger be sufficient to
drive the bit wood off the ends the
tongs this could be only proved by
experiment and harry was eager to
try it 
his father had the wooden cylinder for
the messenger turned for him on a small
scale proportioned to his kite it was
about six inches long and two inches
diameter its wooden arms about eight
inches in length the sail was made 
a square piece light linen the corners
 which being stretched out and tied to
the arms the messenger with its sail was
complete and ready for action
harry's kite was small but the same
proportions as captain danse's it was
made simply two laths tied together in the
middle crossform the cross lath being
twothirds the long one in length and
placed within onethird its length from
the top a square silk handkerchief
formed the covering he stretched it
over the laths tying one corner at top and
one at bottom over their ends then
stretching the two upper sides to the ends
 the cross lath and tying them in the
same way with twine he left the remaining
part the sides and the corners to
hang down as flaps or wings
the tail was made with coarse broad
tape and small bits wood instead 
wisps paper a coat button was tied
to the lower the kite a buttonhole
being made at one the tape so that
the tail could be buttoned on or taken oft
at pleasure this was a convenience
when it was to be carried out or put away
for entering into these trivial details
harry may be blamed by critics but perhaps
may be applauded by future kitemakers

anxiously was the wind watched every
morning now that the kite was ready for trial
at last a day came when there was happily
wind sufficient and out sallied harry
his father and his kite it was some time
before harry could get it up it fluttered
with uncertain motion rising a yard or
two then sinking it trailed on the grass
a fresh breeze raised it the whole length
 its tail which floating obliquely seemed
to struggle and writhe in the air by degrees
it rose higher flapping its silken
wings harry held in the string till he
felt that the wind had power over the kite
then he judiciously let out the line more
and more or less and less as he felt the
force slacken or the gusts increase now
running with the kite now stopping 
feeling as it were with its feelings humouring
its humours aiding its weakness
and glorying in its strength joyful at
last he saw it clear the trees rise rapidly
in the higher regions air and there
rest in steady poise
it is up cried harry
but can we bring it down said his
father
up goes the messenger the wind carrying
it swiftly along the line it appeared to
fly gladly on its errand
but will it can it do its business
for a few seconds this doubt kept
harry and harry's father breathless the
little kite reached and darted upon the
larger they struggled or seemed to
struggle for an instant like two birds in
unequal contest the little one gained
the victory
it's done it's done cried harry
the kite is falling 
and gently and safely both came down
together harry ran to the spot where
they fell to separate them and to see whether
they had done any mischief to each
other
all safe not the least damage
done cried harry
nothing could succeed better i give
you joy harry said his father
but there could be no complete joy
without lucy harry said he would run
home to tell her and his mother all about
it and to show them his good little messenger
he had kept the contrivance by
which the kite was to be brought down a
profound secret even from lucy having
determined to try it the first time with no
one by but his father and if it should
answer then he hoped to delight lucy
doubly with the pleasure the success
and the surprise
while harry had been flying his new
kite lucy's mind had been occupied with
far other thoughts she could not guess
what he and her father were about for
harry had taken out his kite by a back
way and then returning to the breakfastroom
had said in a half whisper can
you come out with me now father
 yes harry i am at your service
 so am i thought lucy yet he is
going without me
there had been for some days past
conferences and consultations between
harry and his father as lucy had remarked
to which she was not summoned 
her curiosity and some other uneasy feelings
were excited which she could hardly
suppress and yet did not like to express
she had been so much accustomed especially
 late to know and to be interested
in all that occupied harry that
she felt a sort disappointment when she
was excluded from these secret councils
her curiosity was now raised to an almost
insupportable height by the signal the
halfwhisper the abrupt exit and secret
expedition this morning they had
thrown open one the breakfast room
windows and jumped out her eyes followed
them as they walked briskly away
she then took up a to read but soon
laid it down and went to her drawingtable
 then she opened her workbox and
at last sat down near her mother after
an unusual silence lucy suddenly asked
her mother to guess what she had been
thinking all this time
it will be easier for you to tell me my
dear lucy said her mother smiling
i will mamma said lucy and
yet i do not know why but i am a little 
however i will then mamma you
must know that all this time have been
thinking or rather trying to hinder myself
from thinking something which i know
ois
not quite right but still the thoughts
come and i cannot help saying to myself
i wonder why harry did not wish me to
go with him i know this is all foolish
curiosity mamma you are going to tell
me so
i was going to remind you my dear
 the iron door said her mother
 ah yes to be sure but it was easy to
put that out my bead besides i did
not care much about the iron door but i
do care about harry and is it not natural
to be anxious about what concerns him
mamma
but if he wishes you not to know it 
i know what you are going to say
interrupted lucy that it is not right forme
to try to discover it therefore i really
want to put it out my head pray tell
me mamma how to do that
 turn your thoughts to some other subject
said her mother
indeed mamma i have been trying to
do so said lucy i took up a but
i read the same sentence over and over
again every instant i found myself looking
out the window at papa and harry
walking down the avenue the same
ideas would come back what are they
talking about what are they going to
do i cannot think anv things else
 if you cannot think do something
lucy said her mother suppose you
were to cut open the leaves that review
for me take this new motherofpearl
folding knife which your father gave me
this morning is it not pretty
 very pretty said lucy looking carelessly
at it
do you see the colours which change
continually as you move it said her
mother
they are beautiful said lucy but
i have often observed such colours in mother
 pearl
 but did you ever consider what produces
these colours said her mother
the reflection light from the polished
surface the mother pearl i
suppose mamma said lucy
then why do you not see the same
colours from the polished handle this
ivory knife said her mother placing the
two before her in the same light
lucy now began to examine the mother
 pearl more attentively she was struck
with the succession beautiful tints that
were developed by the least motion and
asked her mother if any thing was known
about the cause these changing colours
yes my dear said her mother it
has been lately discovered that the cause 
these colours depends upon a singular peculiarity
in the structure mother pearl
on its surface which to your eye and
touch appears so finely polished there are
innumerable scratches or indentures in
some places as many as two or three
thousand in the space an inch and
lying parallel to each other whether in
straight lines in waves or in circles
three or four thousand in an inch
mamma but i cannot see one all these
thousands i cannot feel even the slightest
roughness 
 but with a microscope said her mother
 and sometimes even with your
pocket magnifyingglass you would see
this exquisitely smooth surface full the
little lines or grooves that i have described
some people compare them to the delicate
texture the skin at the top an infant's
finger
lucy continuing to rub her finger over
the polished surface said but mamma
what can these scratches have to do with
the colours i have a knife with scratches
all over its handle look at it mamma 
you see it has no colours
 but the handle your knife lucy
is not mother pearl
 no mamma but if scratches are the
cause the colours in the one case why
not in the other
there is a great difference lucy the
indentures in mother pearl regularly
follow each other in all their windings 
the accidental scratches on the ivory cross
each other at random the rays light are
reflected by the edges the grooves and
the continual change colour arises from
their continual bending and turnings
then mamma said lucy by polishing
the mother pearl still more we
should get rid i suppose all these little
grooves and there would be no more
colours
polish as much and grind it down as
much as you will said her mother as
long as any the mother pearl remains
you will still find the grooves the same
structure is not only at the surface but
throughout the whole substance
 how extraordinary said lucy
 i have a still more extraordinary fact
to tell you my dear said her mother
oh what mamma
that the colours which you see on the
surface the mother pearl can be
communicated by pressure to sealingwax
and several other substances
 is it possible mamma cried lucy
 well since nothing should be taken for
granted will you be so very good as to
tell me how all that is proved
her mother told her that it was dr
brewster who first discovered the cause 
the colours seen in mother pearl and
that afterwards having stuck a piece it
on a cement made rosin and beeswax
he observed that the cement when separated
had actually acquired the property
 producing the same colours
 was not he excessively surprised 
said lucy
he was surprised and several gentlemen
who saw the experiment thought
that this unexpected phenomenon was
caused by a thin film the mother 
pearl which might have scaled off and
stuck to the cement a very simple experiment
however convinced them that this
conjecture was a mistake he made a
fresh impression the mother pearl on
black sealingwax and then plunged it
into an acid which does not affect wax
but which is known to destroy the substance
 which mother pearl is chiefly
composed f if there had been left on the
wax the slightest film mother pearl
it must have been dissolved but the acid
had no effect and the prismatic colours 
the impression remained undisturbed this
you see was a complete proof that there
nitric acid f carbonate lime
was no film mother pearl left on the
seal
 it does satisfactorily prove indeed
mamma said lucy that it was the
grooves as dr brewster thought which
caused the colours both in the mother 
pearl and in the impression on the wax
yes said her mother and he tried
similar experiments on other substances
such as tinfoil and lead and all showed
the prismatic colours in the same manner
and from the same cause so that the fact
and its cause are now quite ascertained 
and you find lucy that you may believe
them without taking any thing for
granted
lucy was quite satisfied and rejoiced at
understanding how the proof was complete
 this is another instance mamma
 the advantage trying to find out the
causes the common things we see everyday
how much dr brewster's accidental
observation led to 
and to more than you yet know said
her mother i will read to you part 
a letter your father received this morning
from him 
 there is also a very extraordinary fact respecting
the communicable colours in mother pearl
which deserves to be mentioned one set these
colours is produced by the right side the grooves
and another set by the left side and both them
are distinctly seen when the mother pearl is
polished but when the polish is removed by rough
grinding one the sets invariably disappears the
rough grinding therefore destroys the effect one
side the grooves without affecting the other
lucy's mother then told her that inconsequence
 dr brewster's discovery 
the cause the colours in mother pearl
another ingenious gentleman produced
the same appearance on glass and on different
metals by simply cutting grooved
lines on their surface the lines are so
fine she added that without a microscope
they are scarcely discernible and the glass
and the metal appear to retain their polish
yet they and the colours also may be communicated
by an impression like those from
the mother pearl to the wax
her mother then showed her a gilt button
mr barton
the lines on which had been struck by a
steel die and a bit glass on which they
had been cut by a diamond and from both
she saw the prismatic colours reflected as
beautifully as from mother pearl
 but harry exclaimed lucy all
this time i have forgotten about harry 
how very nicely you turned my thoughts
for me and quite put out my head
what i could not drive away mamma
this is all your doing i wish it had been
my own
the best part it is yours my dear
child said her mother the wish to do
right the asking for advice and assistance
was your own
i wish i could manage my thoughts
for myself in the same way said lucy
that curious discovery entertained me
so much that i forgot every thing else
mamma this is another advantage having
a taste for things this sort they
help us to turn our mind from what you
call foolish curiosity
j yes lucy they will often assist you
in managing your own thoughts and your
own mind said her mother this is
one the great benefits which women
derive from cultivating their understandings
and the best use they can make a
taste for literature and science
 mamma resumed lucy after some
pause i am very glad that you let me
go on with harry i am sure it has been
the cause great pleasure to me even
on the journey it was so pleasant to be
interested in the same think's but above
all during harry's illness it was the
greatest happiness to feel that he liked to
have me with him always reading and
talking to him and being interested in the
sorts things which he liked best mamma
i hope you do not think it has done meany
harm i hope you do not think that
i have grown careless about other things
 not in the least my dear said her
mother on the contrary i perceive that
you have become more attentive to all
which it is necessary for you to learn
 one other question mamma and i
shall be quite happy if you can answer it
as i wish i hope mamma that you do
not think that i have grown conceited
 no lucy said her mother i think
it will be with you as i have observed it
has been with others who are properly instructed
 that the more they know the less
danger there is their growing vain they
find out how infinitely much more there is
to be learned even from the most common
objects by which they are surrounded
yes mamma said lucy and i
begin to feel the truth what you have
often said to me that the more we learn
 what are called the works nature
and the wonderful inside our own
minds the better we must become and the
more pious i am not sure whether pious
is the right word or religious but you
know what i mean
 i do my dear said her mother and
as to the words it is little consequence
what words you use to express this sentiment
if you feel it as i hope and believe
you do sincerely and firmly
here he comes oh mamma here
is harry and his kite cried lucy running
to the window with a face radiant with
joy he came bearing his kite in triumph
high she threw up the sash and he sprang
in joy adding to his natural elasticity
lucy my dear lucy it does it
will do cried he i would not tell you
till i was sure it would succeed oh 
mother it does better than even my father
expected but come out lucy come out
and see it we will put it up again for
you for there is no joy without you and
my mother let me tell you about my
messenger
then eagerly he began to explain his kite
and his messenger but now when lucy
saw harry's kindness it struck her how
unjust she had been she was ashamed 
her past feelings and looked at her mother
with a consciousness and a change 
countenance which harry perceived he
became confused though in the middle 
a panegyric on his messenger and after
making some attempts to piece his story
with and so and so he stopped
and putting into her hand a knot in the
string which he had been endeavouring
to disentangle 
untie this for me will you my dear
said he his eye added what is the
matter 
nothing nothing worth telling you
i mean answered lucy it was only
that i was very very unjust and that i am
exceedingly ashamed
that you were a little foolish my
dear i will not deny said her mother 
but you need not be so exceedingly
ashamed because you did your best to
conquer your foolish feelings this is all
that the best us can do
lucy told her brother all that had passed
in her mind he regretted that she had
been vexed but was glad he said to
know how it was that he might avoid
doing the same thing again and she assured
him that it was all her own folly
and that she hoped never again to be so
weak
 there is your knot untied for you
brother she added returning the disentangled
string and now all's right
again
thank you all is right repeated
harry
and all will be rioht and will continue
so between friends who in this manner
speak openly to each other those little
feelings which perhaps they are at the
moment ashamed
this affair being cleared out lucyss
head there was some chance her understandings
harry's contrivance and she and
her mother went out and saw another
experiment the kite which succeeded
even better than the first the wind blew
stronger and with bolder wing as if better
knowing his business the messenger
darted up to the very heart the kite
and at one stroke accomplished its purpose
lucy rejoiced in the messenger's
happy performance his mission and
looked forward with still greater pleasure
to the idea seeing the kite carry out a
line from a boat to the shore she asked
her father when the experiment might be
tried and harry observed that as dame
peyton's sailorson had come home and
was permitted the use sir rupert digby's
boat they could have his assistance all
the circumstances a pretty little shipwreck
were quickly arranged and rehearsed
in lucy's imagination with the different
parts assigned which each were to act in
saving the stranded vessel harry's mind
in the mean time went to work at calculating
the proper size for a new kite which
would carry out a serviceable rope but
his mother put an to any further operations
by reminding harry that as he was
now perfectly recovered they were to leave
rupert cottage immediately and in these
circumstances the making a kite ten
feet long would not be very convenient
lucy thought that as it was only for
an experiment it might be as well tried
with the little kite all we want you
know harry is to be certain that you can
launch the kite from the boat we on shore
can make a signal when it is right over
our heads and then off you would send
your good little messenger and everybody
would see how well it did its business
a circumstance which they had left out
 their calculations but which was absolutely
essential to the experiment settled
the business during the few remaining
days their stay the wind never blew the
right way or strong enough to carry up a
kite the weathercock was every morning
watched in vain and frequently did harry
and lucy walk along the beach in hopes
 seeing a fine sea breeze curling the
water in one these walks a boat that
was rowing along the shore stopped abreast
 harry and lucy and a gentleman in
it whom harry knew asked him if he
thought his father would be so good as to
lend him his small telescope harry ran to
ask for it and his father with the telescope
in his hand walked with him to the seaside
and permitted him to accompany the
gentleman who promised to set him ashore
as he returned when he came back
harry described to lucy all he had seen 
and what was on the present occasion
more interesting to her repeated all he
had heard some people who were lately
vol p
saved from shipwreck by the use lifeboats

 a lifeboat lucy said harry is a
kind boat which cannot sink there
are several kinds that which was described
to me was lined with large copper
tubes empty and airtight so that in a
storm if it should fill with water the air
in the tubes would still buoy it up with
such a boat people can go out to a ship
in distress when none other could possibly
venture to sea
the gentleman pleased with harry's zealand
intelligence had talked to him much
on that subject and had related to him
several anecdotes a benevolent old
quaker who was in the habit going to
the sea coast every year for the recovery
 his health that part the shore was
very dangerous and hearing frequent
shipwrecks he had a lifeboat built which
cost him three hundred pounds and made
a present it to the inhabitants the
generous old quaker constantly rewarded
those who were most adventurous in going
out in it he was old infirm and very
ill when the gentleman last saw him evidently
dying but his mind was as much
alive and his feelings were as warm as if
he had been eighteen instead eighty
at that last interview the lifeboat was
talked then his enthusiasm broke out 
he seemed to forget his years and infirmities
 and conquering bodily pain he
started from his seat and took the gentleman
to his boathouse the boat was
mounted upon a carriage with wheels that
it might be ready for rolling down to the
shore they could only get up the side
by a ladder but the old man climbed up
without assistance jumped into the middle
 the boat showed every part and appeared
to feel a generous triumph m the
lives it had already saved and those which
he hoped it would yet save this was
the last time he ever saw him and the last
time this benevolent old man ever saw his
boat he died a few days afterwards 
all who knew him the whole country
flocked to his funeral and it was very
singular the gentleman added that while
p 
they were attending it the most violent
storm came on that had been known for
many years a vessel was cast upon the
rocks and the people returned just in time
to launch the lifeboat and to rescue three
persons who would otherwise have perished
the name this humane and truly
charitable man was backhouse a name
that better deserves to be remembered than
that many celebrated heroes warriors
are often famed only for the number 
lives they have destroyed but this excellent
quaker ought to be remembered for the
number lives he has saved
a day or two before they left rupert
cottage to return home harry went the
first long walk he had been allowed to
take since his release from confinement
it was to digby castle by the mountainpath
the day was bright and everything
was fresh and pleasant the path
in many places was quite as narrow as
those could desire who love the narrow
path danger there was full opportunity
also for scrambling up and down
the rocks so as to try to his heart's content
the newly recovered use his limbs
but at last the mountain path ended and
they came upon the road
here harry and lucy walked slowly
and soberly and recalled to each others
memories the first time their coming
this road the happy days they had spent
at digby castle and all sir rupert's and
lady digby s kindness to them then
they talked over what had passed at rupert
cottage in the olden times the canal
and the lock and the roof and even on the
misfortunes his broken bridges harry
could now moralize with composure he
had besides the consolation reflecting
that the failure in his bridges had led to
his learning mathematics
when once their recollections began
they went on or rather went backwards
through the whole time since they had
left home they travelled their journey
over again and tried how much they could
remember what they had seen or heard
their recollections were very different but
between them much was made out the
one supplying what the other forgot lucy
recalled a variety little entertaining
circumstances which had escaped harry's
memory and she benefited still more by
his clear remembrance the solid and
useful she was anxious to show harry
that the pains he had taken in explaining
some things to her had not been thrown
away and her father who now joined in
their conversation observed that she did
her brother credit
 then father said harry it is allowing
to those first experiments you took
so much pains in showing us when we
were quite children for instance you
made me then clearly understand the principle
 the barometer and that one thing
clear and fixed in my mind was i have
always felt the greatest help to me there
was something i was sure something
i could always go back to
lucy said she had felt the same and
that unless she had understood about the
barometer and the vacuum and the pressure
 the air harry could never have
got her on through the pumps to the
steamengine she lamented however not
remembering more the variety curious
things which she had seen on her journey
oh mamma she continued i wish
i had kept a journal then i should have
had them all safe
 your having them all safe on paper
said her mother would be useful because
you could refresh your memory from time
to time but it would be still better if you
had them all in your head so that you
could recollect them at any moment
certainly mamma but do you not
think that writing down things would fix
them better in my memory
 i am afraid not my dear said her
mother i have often found that i completely
forget those things which i had
written down
but why is that mamma said lucy
perhaps because we ease our conscience
 them said her mother and
never make any effort to recollect them
there is an english saying what is
written remains it may remain on the
paper but not the better on the memory
the italian proverb is probably more correct
 l'ho dimenticato perche i'ho script
i have forgotten it because i have written
it
perhaps said her father another
reason is that we are apt to write mechanically
that is without thought and
what we do without thought we seldom
remember
but papa said lucy if i had kept
a journal i must have tried to recollect
the things at the time i was to write their
description in my journal though after
all i dare say that i should have trusted
to harry's memory he used to ask me
every evening if i remembered such and
such a machine that we had seen in the
day and he reminded me so well all
the parts that i scarcely endeavoured to
recollect them for myself
you see said her mother that you
depended on your brother and did not
exert your own memory though yours
is perhaps naturally better his has served
him more usefully
yes mamma said lucy but i
really believe that talking what we have
seen or heard makes one remember better
than even writing down the pleasure
 talking is a great help added she
laughing
 i think there is also a pleasure in
listening said harry
 certainly said lucy when one is
listening to what is interesting or new but
otherwise i hear as it were without listening
and then the words go in at one ear
and out the other i have only the
sound left
 yes lucy said her father you hear
mechanically without attending in the same
way as you would copy with a machine
your mind is then merely passive whereas
the pleasure any successful exertion as
well as the labour thinking have the
effect fixing ideas or impressions in our
minds pain or pleasure any kind
joined or associated with our thoughts
secure them in the memory and assist us
in recollecting them if you reflect on
p 
your own mind i think you will find that
to be the case
harry drew closer to his father this
was a subject peculiarly interesting to him
as he had lately been so intent upon finding
out what he called the workings 
his own mind his father stopped short
and good humoured remarked that
though lucy knew much less than harry
did yet she had told them much more 
what she had seen and heard
harry was silent and lucy feeling for
his condition filled up the interval with
talking to give him time and she finished
with an allusion which relieved his embarrassment
and made even his gravity
smile papa harry and i are like two
bottles one full and the other with very
little in it shake the full bottle and you
hear no sound but shake the half empty
one and you hear it rattle finely
by this time they were within sight 
the castle and harry heartily glad to be
excused from further explanation came
forward to open the gates for his mother
their good friends the housekeeper had
from her turret window descried their approach
even from the farthest the
avenue and she had prepared for them a
luncheon such as might have tempted the
most determined antipuncheons to break
his resolution these were the first strawberries
 the season from the forcinghouse
which the gardener was proud to
set before his master's friends since ashe
said his master and mistress were not
at home this was the best could become
 them all were eager to offer harry
the best what the castle could afford
for the history his accident was well
known the father the child he had
saved waited upon them and lingered and
looked often and long before he could feel
convinced that master harry was quite
himself again as stout in his limbs and
as good as ever his last excuse for
coming into the room was to bring a message
from the steward about a box which
had come from sir rupert with some lamps
which he could not rightly understand
and begged to show them to harry's father
they were found to be miners safetylamps
which sir rupert before he left
england had bespoken and had given
orders should be sent to an estate his at
some distance where there were coal mines
by some mistake this box had been sent to
digby castle it was a mistake by which
harry profited once he had had a glimpse
 one these lamps in the mine which
he had seen on the journey but his father
had not then explained it to him the
ready footman carried one into the library
where harry might examine it at his
leisure his mother found for him the
description and explanation the lamp in
the philosophical transactions which he
immediately read with the lamp before
him he was struck with the simplicity
 this admirable invention by which the
lives thousands have been saved from
the destructive explosions the liredamp
in mines but what particularly delighted
harry was the account given by the inventor
 the way in which he was led
step by step to the discovery on which
the excellence this really wonderful
lamp depends first he discovered that
flame will not pass through long tubes 
less than a certain diameter then that tubes
 metal conduct away heat better than
those glass which determined him to use
metal then experiment proved to him
that it was the diameter and not the length
 the tubes that was essential to his purpose
in consequence which he shortened
and shortened them till to his great satisfaction
he found that tubes might be dispensed
with entirely and that a plate 
metal perforated with small holes or even
wire gauze with interstices the same
diameter as the tubes would answer equally
well
as harry's father observed to him there
cannot be a finer example the rise progress
and perfecting a useful philosophical
invention in the first place no part
 it was owing to accident to any lucky
bit or even to any casual observation but
all was the consequence a settled good
purpose working in the mind a man 
science genius knowledge and humane
views he had heard the destruction
caused by firedamps and determined to
try what could be done to avoid or prevent
the danger his first step was to go down
into the mines and examine into the nature
 these noxious vapours his previous
knowledge chemistry was here essential
to his success and each step was forwarded
by his philosophic habits in trying experiments
 by his observing and reasoning
on all appearances before him and employing
alternately theory and experiment
that is to say first forming a conjecture
how the thing might be done and then
impartially trying whether his suppositions
were right or wrong
how much the public his father
added and how much young people 
rising genius are obliged to inventors who
both can and will thus lay open their
minds many ingenious persons seem not
to have had the power describing their
own inventions for instance vaucanson
a celebrated french mechanic who never
could describe his own machines others
like hooke whose life harry you read
lately have been so suspicious their
rivals that during their whole lives they
would not open above half their minds
and at their death left their contrivances
locked up in enigmatical language they
seem to have taken pains to obliterate all
traces the road their minds took lest
rivals should follow in their tracks but
my dear son observe that really great men
are superior to such mean jealousy you
feel how much sir humphrey davy has in
this instance by his openness increased
our admiration and gratitude
when they were setting out on their walk
back to rupert cottage harry said to
lucy 
let me go on before with my father
i want to talk to him alone
very well said lucy this time j
shall have no foolish curiosity
you need not said harry it is no
secret if you please i will tell you my
reason for wishing that you should not
be by
 no pray do not harry i assure you
 am not curious now so go on with papa
my mother is going to make a sketch 
digby castle from this place i have
paper and pencil and i will also try what
i can do will you wait for us at the
suspension bridge
thank you my dear good lucy said
harry taking her pencil from her hand
and cutting it to a fine point but you
must let me tell you my reason it is only
that what i want to say to papa is all about
myself and you know that when one has
to talk oneself and one's own little
feelings and schemes one can speak much
more freely when nobody else is present
the fact was that the sight the
miners lamp and the account that discovery
and the admiration which his
father had expressed at the idea that thousands
 lives would be saved by this one
invention had altogether worked up harry's
enthusiasm thoughts which had been
lying quietly at the bottom his mind
were now set in motion and thrown to the
surface his father knew him better than
anybody else his father was therefore the
confidant he preferred to all others happy
the son who in like circumstances feels
that his father is his best friend
 father said harry a few words
you said to me long ago made a great
impression on me i have often thought
 them since and something the
same sort which sir rupert said to me at
the time the balloon when we were
talking great inventions do you recollect
father v
his father recollected and spared him
the difficulty repeating the words sir
rupert had prophesied that if harry's application
and diligence continued he would
hereafter distinguish himself as a man 
science
then must tell you father continued
harry that i have long had deep
down in my mind deeper i believe than
anybody sees but you a great ambition to
make some time or other in my life some
great discovery or invention i have been
long thinking this and considering how
other people have succeeded when i
was confined to the sofa i thought it
more and more and particularly how i
could manage my own mind so as to make
it do what i want in reading the accounts
 the childhood great or scientific
men i have tried to find out what
they did and said that i might compare
my thoughts and ways going on with
theirs but enough is never told these
things on the other hand father when
one thinks the millions people that
exist and the few that distinguish themselves
it does appear very presumptuous
to hope that i should succeed how many
people when young must have had the
same feelings that i have now and the
same ambition yet they have failed but
why have they failed this is what i want
to ask you father another thing puzzles
me continued harry who could now
speak fluently his thoughts flowing on
and forcing themselves into words during
our journey when we were at the glasshouse
and when we read all about the
discovery printing and since that time
when sir rupert digby was giving us the
history electricity and the invention
 balloons and more lately still in those
books which i have been reading during
my illness i have continually observed
with surprise how long it was before even
the most ingenious men hit upon those
discoveries and inventions which now
that we know them appear to us so easy
and simple and i have said to myself if
these things were so difficult to them how
little chance have i yet father i think
people have a better chance now than informer
times more discoveries have been
made in our days than in the time the
ancients
 yes said his father because knowledge
is more generally diffused more
people try experiments and all are convinced
that this is the best method 
arriving at truth or making discoveries
still father i want to find out why
now that this is known so few among the
numbers who try succeed i wish i could
find this out that i might learn how to
secure the best means for myself
some people said his father are
inaccurate in their mode trying experiments
or rash in drawing their conclusions
 or they may have some prejudice
or favourite theory which blinds the truth
from them and prevents their seeing what
is before their eyes their failure arises
from taking a wrong view the object ora
wrong road to it
harry asked his father if he knew 
any that gives directions or advice
how to get forward in science or that
points out the best ways trying experiments
 i looked over much that 
 locke's said harry to try if i could
find any thing this sort but i could not
is there any such helping 
his father mentioned bacon on the
advancement learning hooke on
the means improving natural philosophy
 mayfair's history the progress
 physical science and some others
then as soon as we get home and are
settled said harry i will begin and
read some these would you advise
it father
 i have such confidence in your good
sense and resolution harry said his father
 that i feel no apprehension discouraging
your laudable ambition by answering
 no i would not advise you to
read any those books yet they would
perhaps prevent you from working out your
own observations and from reflecting impartially
as you have begun to do upon
your own mind i advise you then my
dear son to persevere steadily and regularly
in your present course never let anyone
day pass without advancing some step
without acquiring some fresh knowledge
continue with your sister your happy
practice mutual instruction exercise
your faculties your memory your reasoning
power your invention no matter on
what so that you exercise them they
will strengthen and we can afterwards
turn them and your habits application
to whatever may be necessary for your progress
in science and virtue and for your
happiness
my happiness cried harry the
greatest possible happiness i can conceive
in this world next to doing my duty
would be to make some grand invention
some noble discovery
to this he recurred this was the chorus
 all his thoughts it was said with such
enthusiasm as strongly to excite the sympathy
 his father who paused for some
moments before he again spoke
i must not be misled by my hopes or
by yours harry said he lest i should
prepare for you bitter disappointment in
future whether you may ever distinguish
yourself or not will depend probably on
circumstances over which neither you nor
i may have any control but whether
you do or do not succeed in the object 
your ambition you may certainly my dear
boy by cultivating your taste for science
secure a large portion happiness you
may become such a man as your friend sir
rupert digby you see how useful how
respectable how happy he is you see
that it is his taste for science his indefatigable
pursuit knowledge and his constant
exertions to be use to others which
constitute his happiness a species happiness
that is independent all celebrity
and all human applause you have
seen on what it depends 
friendship books
ease and alternate labour useful knowledge
progressive virtue and approving heaven
harry stopped and looked back for
lucy sorry that she had not heard these
lines she and his mother joined them
soon afterwards just in time to hear the
words with which his father concluded the
conversation
i consider you my dear son as no
longer a child and i securely trust to your
own efforts for the continuance your own
education a celebrated person has observed
that every man has two educations
one which is given to him by his parents
or tutors while he is a child the other
which he gives to himself when he becomes
a man this latter is the greatest
consequence the two and this with
every wise and good man should go on to
the latest period his life
here ends all the history harry
and lucy that is to be published
the reader may perhaps feel relieved by
these words from certain fears which may
have arisen in his mind that the said history
might extend to a thousand and one

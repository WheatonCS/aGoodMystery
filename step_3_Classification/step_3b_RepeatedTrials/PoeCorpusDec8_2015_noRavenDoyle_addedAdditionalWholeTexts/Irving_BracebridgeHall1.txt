master simon has a most devout abhorrence
mingled with awe for this ancient spinster he
told me the other day in a whisper that she was
a cursed brimstone in fact he added another
epithet which i would not repeat for the world
i have remarked however that he is always
extremely civil to her when they meet

 hunting
on the skirts the neighbouring village there
lives a kind small potentate who for aught i
know is a representative one the most ancient
legitimate lines the present day for the
empire over which he reigns has belonged to his
family time out mind his territories comprise
a considerable number good fat acres
and his seat power is in an old farm house
where he enjoys unmolested the stout oaken
chair his ancestors the personage to whom
 ready money jack
i allude is a sturdy old yeoman the name 
john tibbets or rather ready money jack
tibbets as he is called throughout the neighbourhood

the first place where he attracted my attention
was in the churchyard on sunday where
he sat on a tombstone after the service with his
hat a little on one side holding forth to a small
circle auditors and as i presumed expounding
the law and the prophets until on drawing
a little nearer i found he was only expatiating
on the merits a brown horse he presented
such a picture a substantial english yeoman
as he is often described in books mingled with
some little finery peculiar to himself that i
could not but take note his whole appearance

he was between fifty and sixty a strong
muscular frame and at least six feet high with
a physiognomy as grave as a lion's and set off
with short curling iron gray locks his shirt
collar was turned down and displayed a neck
covered with the same short curling hair and he
ready money jack 
wore a coloured silk neckcloth tied very loosely
and tucked in at the bosom with a green paste
broach on the knot his coat was dark green
cloth with silver buttons on each which was engraved
a stag with his own name john tibbets
underneath he had an inner waistcoat figured
chintz between which and his coat was another
 scarlet cloth unbuttoned his breeches
were also left unbuttoned at the knees not from
any slovenliness but to show a broad pair scarlet
garters his stockings were blue with white
clocks he wore large silver shoe buckles a
broad paste buckle in his hat band his sleeve buttons
were gold seven shilling pieces and he had
two or three guineas hanging as ornaments to his
watch chain
on making some inquiries about him i gathered
that he was descended from a line farmers
that had always lived on the same spot and
owned the same property and that half the
churchyard was taken up with the tombstones 
his race he has all his life been an important
character in the place when a youngster he
 ready money jack
was one the most roaring blades the neighbourhood
no one could match him at wrestling
pitching the bar cudgel play and other athletic
exercises like the renowned pinner 
wakefield he was the village champion carried
off the prizes at all the fairs and threw his gauntlet
at the country round even to this day the
old people talk his prowess and undervalue
in comparison all heroes the green that have
succeeded him nay they say that if ready
money jack were to take the field even now
there is no one could stand before him
when jack's father died the neighbours shook
their heads and predicted that young hopeful
would soon make way with the old homestead 
but jack falsified all their predictions the
moment he succeeded to the paternal farm he
assumed a new character took a wife attended
resolutely to his affairs and became an industrious
thrifty farmer with the family property
he inherited a set old family maxims to which
he steadily adhered he saw to every thing
himself put his own hand to the plough workready
money jack 
ed hard eat heartily slept soundly paid for
every thing in cash down and never danced except
he could do it to the music his own money
in both pockets he has never been without
a hundred or two pounds in golden guineas by
him and never allows a debt to stand against
him this has gained him his current name 
which by the bye he is a little proud and has
caused him to be looked upon as a very wealthy
man by all the village
notwithstanding his thrift however he has
never denied himself the amusements life 
but has taken a share in every passing pleasure
it is his maxim that he that works hard can
afford to play he is therefore an attendant
at all the country fairs and wakes and has signalized
himself by feats strength and prowess
on every village green in the shire he often
makes his appearance at horse races and sports
his half guinea and even his guinea at a time 
keeps a good horse for his own riding and to
this day is fond following the hounds and is
generally in at the death he keeps up the rusvol
i 
 ready money jack
tic revels and hospitalities too for which his
paternal farm house has always been noted has
plenty good cheer and dancing at harvest home
and above all keeps the merry night as it is
termed at christmas
with all his love amusement jack is by no
means a boisterous jovial companion he is
seldom known to laugh in the midst his gayety 
but maintains the same lionlike demeanour
he is very slow at comprehending a joke and
is apt to sit puzzling at it with a perplexed look
while the rest the company are in a roar
this gravity has perhaps grown on him with the
growing weight his character for he is gradually
growing into patriarchal dignity in his
native place though he no longer takes an
active part in athletic sports yet he always presides
at them and is appealed to on all occasions
as umpire he maintains the peace on the vilmerry
night a rustic merry making in a farm house about
christmas there is abundance homely fare tea cakes fruit and
ale various feats agility amusing games romping dancing and
kissing withal they commonly break up at midnight
ready money jack 
lage green at holyday games and quells all
brawls and quarrels by collaring the parties and
shaking them heartily if refractory no one
ever pretends to raise a hand against him or to
contend against his decisions the young men
having grown up in habitual awe his prowess
and in implicit deference to him as the champion
and lord the green
he is a regular frequenter the village tavern
 the landlady having been a sweetheart 
his in early life and he having always continued
on kind terms with her he seldom however
drinks any thing but a draught ale smokes
his pipe and pays his reckoning before leaving
the bar room here he gives his little senate
laws decides bets which are generally referred
to him determines upon the characters and
qualities horses and indeed plays now and
then the part a judge in settling petty disputes
between neighbours which otherwise might
have been nursed by country attorneys into tolerable
lawsuits jack is very candid and impartial
in his decisions but he has not a head to carse
ready money jack
ry a long argument and is very apt to get perplexed
and out patience if there is much pleading
he generally breaks through the argument
with a strong voice and brings matters to a
summary conclusion by pronouncing what he
calls the upshot the business or in other
words the long and the short the matter
jack once made a journey to london a great
many years since which has furnished him with
topics conversation ever since he saw the
old king on the terrace at windsor who stopped
and pointed him out to one the princesses
being probably struck with jack's truly yeomanlike
appearance this is a favourite anecdote
with him and has no doubt had a great effect in
making him a most loyal subject ever since in
spite taxes and poor's rates he was also at
bartholomew fair where he had half the buttons
cut off his coat and a gang pickpockets attracted
by his external show gold and silver
made a regular attempt to hustle him as he was
gazing at a show but for once they found that
they had caught a tartar for jack enacted as
ready money jack 
great wonders among the gang as samson did
among the philistines one his neighbours
who had accompanied him to town and was
with him at the fair brought back an account
 his exploits which raised the pride the
whole village who considered their champion
as having subdued all london and eclipsed the
achievements friar tuck or even the renowned
robin hood himself
 late years the old fellow has seemed to
take things more easily works less and indulges
in greater leisure his son having grownup
and succeeded to him both in the labours 
the farm and the exploits the green like
all sons distinguished men however his father's
renown is a disadvantage to him he can
never come up to public expectation though
a fine active fellow threeandtwenty and
quite the cock the walk yet the old people
declare he is nothing like what ready money
jack was at his time life the youngster
himself acknowledges his inferiority and
has a wonderful opinion the old man who
 ready money jack
indeed taught him all his athletic accomplishments
and holds such a sway over him that i
am told even to this day he would have no
hesitation to take him in hands if he rebelled
against paternal government
the squire holds jack in very high esteem
and shows him to all his visitors as a specimen
 old english heart oak he frequently
calls at his house and tastes some his home
brewed which is excellent he made jack a
present old tusser's hundredth points 
good husbandry which has furnished him with
reading ever since and is his text and manual
in all agricultural and domestic concerns
he has made dog's ears at the most favourite
passages and knows many the poetical maxims
by heart
tibbets though not a man to be daunted or
fluttered by high acquaintances and though he
cherishes a sturdy independence mind and
manner yet is evidently gratified by the attentions
 the squire whom he has known from
boyhood and pronounces a true gentleman
ready money jack 
every inch him he is also on excellent
terms with master simon who is a kind privy
counsellor to the family but his great favourite
is the oxonian whom he taught to wrestle and
play at quarterstaff when a boy and considers
the most promising young gentleman in the
whole county
bachelors
the bachelor most joyfully
in pleasant plight doth pass his daies 
good fellowship and companie
he doth maintain and kepe always
evans old ballads
there is no character in the comedy human
life that is more difficult to play well than
that an old bachelor when a single gentleman
therefore arrives at that critical period when
he begins to consider it an impertinent question
be asked his age i would advise him to look
well to his ways this period it is true is much
later with some men than with others i have
witnessed more than once the meeting two
wrinkled old lads this kind who had not seen
each other for several years and have been
amused by the amicable exchange compliments
on each other's appearance that takes
bachelors 
place on such occasions there is always one
invariable observation why bless my soul 
you look younger than when last i saw you 
whenever a man's friends begin to compliment
him about looking young he may be sure that
they think he is growing old
i am led to make these remarks by the conduct
 master simon and the general who have
become great cronies as the former is the
youngest by many years he is regarded as quite
a youthful blade by the general who moreover
looks upon him as a man great wit and prodigious
acquirements i have already hinted
that master simon is a family beau and considered
rather a young fellow by all the elderly ladies
 the connexion for an old bachelor in an old
family connexion is something like an actor ina
regular company who seems to flourish in
immortal youth and will continue to play the
romeos and rangers for half a century together
master simon too is a little the camelion
and takes a different hue with every different
companion he is very attentive and courteous
vol i 
 bachelors
and somewhat sentimental with lady lillycraft 
copies out little namby namby ditties and love
songs for her and draws quivers and doves and
darts and cupids to be worked on the corners
 her pocket handkerchiefs he indulges however
in very considerable latitude with the other
married ladies the family and has many sly
pleasantries to whisper to them that provoke an
equivocal laugh and a tap the fan but when
he gets among the young company such as
frank bracebridge the oxonian and the general
he is apt to put on the madwag and to talk
in a very bachelorlike strain about the sex
in this he has been encouraged by the example
 the general whom he looks up to as a
man the ton that has seen the world the
general in fact tells shocking stories after dinner
when the ladies are gone which he gives as
some the choice things that are served up at
a knot bon vivants in london called the mule
club he also repeats a great many
fat jokes old major slings the wit the
dub which the general can hardly relate for
bachelors 
laughing though they always make the squire
look grave who has a great antipathy to a bawdy
jest in a word the general is a complete instance
 that declension in gay life by which a
young man pleasure is apt to cool down into
an obscene old gentleman
i saw him and master simon an evening or
two since conversing with a buxom milkmaid ina
meadow and from their elbowing each other
now and then and the general's shaking his
shoulders blowing up his cheeks and breaking
out into a short fit irrepressible laughter i had
no doubt that they were playing the mischief
with the girl
as i looked at them through a hedge i could
not but think they would have made a tolerable
group for a modern picture susanna and the
two elders it is true the girl seemed in no wise
alarmed at the force the enemy and i question
had either them been alone whether she
would not have been more than they would have
ventured to encounter such veteran oysters
are daring wags when together and will put
 bachelors
any female to the blush with their jokes but they
are as quiet as lambs when they fall singly into
the clutches a fine woman
in spite the general's years he evidently
is a little vain his person and ambitious 
conquests i have observed him on sunday in
church eying the country girls most suspiciously
and have even seen him leer upon them with a
downright amorous look even when he has been
gallantry lady lillycraft with great ceremony
through the churchyard the general in fact
is a veteran in the service cupid rather than
mars having signalized himself in all the garrison
towns and country quarters and seen service
in every ball room england not a celebrated
beauty but he has laid siege to and if his
word may be taken in a matter wherein no man
is apt to be veracious it is incredible the success
he has had with the fair at present he is like a
wornout warrior retired from service but who
still cocks his beaver with a military air and
talks stoutly fighting whenever he comes
within the smell gunpowder
bachelors 
i have heard him speak his mind very freely
over his bottle about the folly the captain intaking
a wife as he thinks a young soldier should
care for nothing but his bottle and kind landlady
 but in fact he says the service on the
continent has played the mischief with the young
men they have been ruined by light wines and
french quadrilles they've nothing he says 
the spirit the old service there are none 
your sixbottle men left that were the souls a
mess dinner and used to play the very deuce
among the women
as to a bachelor the general affirms that he
is a free and easy man with no baggage to take
care but his portmanteau but a married
man with his wife hanging on his arm always
puts him in mind a chamber candlestick with
its extinguisher hitched to it
i should not mind all this if it were merelyconfined
to the general but i fear he will bethe
ruin my friend master simon who already
begins to echo his heresies and to talk in the
style a gentleman that has seen life and
 bachelors
lived upon the town indeed he seems to have
taken master simon in hand and talks showing
him the lions in london next season and 
introducing him to the mulligatawney club ashe
is continually quoting the sayings this
club i have been curious to learn something
about it i find it is composed a knot old
nabobs officers and other choice spirits that
have seen service in india and been burnt outwith
curry and touched with the liver complaint
they meet regularly to eat mulligatawney soup
smoke the hookah talk about tippoo saib
and seringapatam and be tediously agreeable
in each others company
wives
believe me man there is no greater bliss
than is the quiet joy loving wife
which whoso wants half himselfe doth miss
friend without change playfellow without strife
food without fulness counsaile without strife
is this sweet doubling our single life
sir p sidney
it is a great pity that plays and novels should
always at the wedding and should not give
us another act and another volume to let us
know how the hero and heroine conducted themselves
when married their main object seems
to be to instruct young ladies how to get husbands
 but not how to keep them now this last
it appears to me is a desideratum in modem
married life it is appalling to those who have
not yet ventured into the state to see how soon
the flame romantic love burns out or is quenched
wives
ed in matrimony and the passionate poetic lover
declines into the phlegmatic prosaic husband
i am inclined to attribute this very much
to the defect i have just mentioned in the plays
and novels which form the principal study our
young ladies and which teach them how to be
heroines but leave them totally at a loss when
they come to be wives i have lately however
met with an exception to this practice in an old
writer who has bravely attempted to support
dramatic interest in favour a woman even after
she was married i was looking over an
album the fair julia's when i found a series
 poetical extracts in the squire's handwriting
which might have been intended as matrimonial
advice to his ward i was so much struck with
the beauty several them that i took the
liberty making a copy they are from the
old play the city nightcap in which is
drawn out and exemplified in the part abates
a character a patient and faithful wife 
by thomas davenport 
wives 
which i think might vie with that the renowned
griselda though i fear it would stand almost
as little chance being adopted as a model
the following is a commendation her to
her husband lorenzo 
she's modest but not sullen and loves silence
not that she wants apt words for when she speaks
she inflames love with wonder but because
she calls wise silence the soul's harmony
she's truly chaste yet such a foe to coyness
the poorest call her courteous and which is excellent
though fair and young she shuns to expose herself
to the opinion strange eyes she either seldom
or never walks abroad but in your company j
and then with such sweet bashfulness as if
she were venturing on crack'd ice and takes delight
to step into the print your foot hath made
and will follow you whole fields so she will drive
tediousness out time with her sweet character
notwithstanding all this excellence abstemious
the misfortune to incur the unmerited jealousy
 her husband instead however resenting
his harsh treatment with clamorous upbraiding
and the stormy violence high windy
virtue by which the sparks anger are so often
blown into a flame she endures it with the
meekness conscious but patient virtue and
vol i 
 wives
makes a beautiful appeal to a friend who has
witnessed her long suffering 
hast thou not seen me
bear all his injuries as the ocean suffers
the angry bark to plough thorough her bosom
and yet is presently so smooth the eye
cannot perceive where the wide wound was made
lorenzo being wrought on by false representations
at length repudiates her to the last
however she maintains her patient sweetness
and her love for him in spite his cruelty she
deplores his error even more than his unkindness
and laments the delusion which has turned his
very affection into a source bitterness there
is a moving pathos in her parting address to lorenzo
after their divorce 
farewell lorenzo
whom my soul doth love if you e'er marry
may you meet a good wife so good that you
may not suspect her nor may she be worthy
 your suspicion and if you hear hereafter
that i am dead inquire but my last words
and you shall know that to the last i lov'd you
and when you walk forth with your second choice
into the pleasant fields and by chance talk me
imagine that you see me lean and pale
wives 
strewing your path with flowers
but may she never live to pay my debts weeps
if but in thought she wrong you may she die
in the conception the injury
pray make me wealthy with one kiss farewell sir 
let it not grieve you when you shall remember
that i was innocent nor this forget
though innocence here suffer sigh and groan
she walks but thorow thorns to find a throne
in a short time lorenzo discovers his error 
and the innocence his injured wife in the
transports his repentance he calls to mind all
her feminine excellence her gentle uncomplaining
womanly fortitude under wrongs and sorrows

oh abstemia 
how lovely thou loosest now now thou appeared
chaster than is the morning's modesty
that rises with blush over whose bosom
the western wind creeps softly now i remember
how when she sat at table her obedient eye
would dwell on mine as if it were not well
unless it looked when i looked oh how proud
she was when she could cross herself to please me 
but where now is this fair soul like a silver cloud
she hath wept herself i fear into the dead sea
and will be found no more
 
it is but doing right by the reader if interested
in the fate abstemia by the preceding
 wives
extracts to say that she was restored to the
arms and affections her husband rendered
fonder than ever by that disposition in every
good heart to atone for past injustice by an
overflowing measure returning kindness 
the wealth worth more than kingdoms i am now
confirmed past all suspicion thou art far
sweeter in thy sincere truth than a sacrifice
decked up for death with garlands the indian winds
that blow from off the coast and cheer the sailor
with the sweet savour their spices want
the delight flows in thee
i have been more affected and interested by
this little dramatic picture than by many a
popular love tale though as i said before i do
not think it likely either abstemia or patient
grizzle stand much chance being taken fora
model still i like to see poetry now and then
extending its views beyond the wedding day and
teaching a lady how to make herself attractive
even after marriage
there is no great need enforcing on an unmarried
lady the necessity being agreeable 
wives 
nor is there any great art requisite in a youthful
beauty to enable her to please nature has multiplied
attractions round her youth is in itself
attractive the freshness budding beauty
needs no foreign aid to set it off it pleases merely
because it is fresh and budding and beautiful
but it is for the married state that a woman
needs the most instruction and in which she
should be most on her guard to maintain her
powers pleasing no woman can expect
to be to her husband all that he fancied her
when he was a lover men are always doomed
to be duped not so much by the arts the sex
as by their own imaginations they are always
wooing goddesses and marrying mere mortals
a woman should therefore ascertain what was
the charm that rendered her so fascinating when
a girl and endeavour to keep it up when she has
become a wife one great thing undoubtedly
was the chariness herself and her conduct
which an unmarried female always observes
she should maintain the same niceness and re
 wives
serve in her person and habits and endeavour
still to preserve a freshness and virgin delicacy
in the eye her husband she should remember
that the province woman is to be wooed
not to woo to be caressed not to caress man
is an ungrateful being in love bounty loses instead
 winning him the secret a woman's
power does not consist so much in giving as in
withholding a woman may give up too much
even to her husband it is to a thousand little
delicacies conduct that she must trust to keep
alive passion and to protect herself from that
dangerous familiarity that thorough acquaintance
with every weakness and imperfection incident
to matrimony by these means she may still
maintain her power though she has surrendered
her person and may continue the romance 
love even beyond the honey moon
she that hath a wise husband says jeremy
taylor must entice him to an eternal dearness
by the veil modesty and the grave robes
 chastity the ornament meekness and the
wives 
jewels faith and charity she must have no
painting but blushing her brightness must be
purity and she must shine round about with
sweetness and friendship and she shall be
pleasant while she lives and desired when she
dies
 v
i have wandered into a rambling series remarks
on a trite subject and a dangerous one fora
bachelor to meddle with that i may not
however appear to confine my observations entirely
to the wife i will conclude with another
quotation from jeremy taylor in which the
duties both parties are mentioned while i
would recommend his sermon on the marriage
ring to all those who wiser than myself are
about entering the happy state wedlock
there is scarce any matter duty but it
concerns them both alike and is only distinguished
by names and hath its variety by circumstances
and little accidents and what in one is
called love in the other is called reverence and
what in the wife is obedience the same in the
 wives
man is duty he provides and she dispenses 
he gives commandments and she rules by them 
he rules her by authority and she rules him by
love she ought by all means to please him and
he must by no means displease her
a literary antiquary
printed books he contemn as a novelty this latter age but a
manuscript he pores on everlastingly especially if the cover be all
motheaten and the dust make a parenthesis between every syllable
mlcocosmographie 
in the account my christmas visit to the
hall i made some mention the parson who
is a kind family chaplain to the squire and
was his chum at oxford a farther acquaintance
with the little man has increased my esteem
for him he is a scholar without arrogance
or pedantry very ignorant the world
having lived almost entirely among books and
those too old books so that his mind is as antiquated
as the squire's garden where one
finds formal flower beds and peacocks cut in
yew
his taste for literary antiquities was first imbibed
when a student at oxford where he
vol i 
 a literary antiquary
spent the chief his leisure hours in the bodleian
library foraging among the old manuscripts

in the course his life he has visited most
 the curious libraries in england and has
ransacked many the cathedrals though in
general quiet and rather dry yet on his favourite
theme he kindles up and becomes almost
eloquent no fox hunter relating his last day's
sport could be more animated than i have seen
the worthy parson when relating his search
after a curious document which he had traced
from library to library until he fairly earthed
it in the dusty chapter house a cathedral
when too he describes some venerable manuscript
with its rich illuminations its thick
creamy vellum its glossy ink and the odour
 the cloisters that seems to exhale from it
he rivals the enthusiasm a parisian epicure
expatiating on the merits a pate de strasbourg
he has a great desire however to
read works in the old libraries and chapter
houses to which they belong for he thinks a
a literary antiquary 
black letter volume reads best in one these
old chambers where the light struggles through
dusty lancet windows and painted glass and
that it loses half its zest if taken away from the
neighbourhood the curiously carved oaken
 case and gothic reading desk
the parson i am told has been for a longtime
meditating a commentary on struts brand
and douce in which he means to detect them
in sundry dangerous errors with respect to popular
games and superstitions he is also a
casual contributor to that long established
repository national customs and antiquities
the gentleman's magazine and is one those
that every now and then make an inquiry concerning
some obsolete custom or rare legend 
nay it is said that several his communications
have been at least six inches in length
he frequently receives parcels by coach
from different parts the kingdom containing
mouldy volumes and almost illegible manuscripts
it is singular what an active correspondence
is kept up among literary antiquaries
 a literary antiquary
and how soon the fame any rare volume or
unique copy just discovered among the rubbish
 a library is circulated among them the
parson is more busy than common just now
being a little flurried by an advertisement a
work preparing for the press on the mythology
 the middle ages the little man has long
been gathering together all the hobgoblin tales
he could collect illustrative the superstitions
 former times and he is in a complete fever
lest this formidable rival should take the field
before him shortly after my arrival at the
hall i called at the parsonage in company
with mr bracebridge and the general the
parson had not been seen for several days
which was a matter some surprise as he
was an almost daily visiter at the hall we
found him in his study a small dusky chamber
lighted by a lattice window that looked into the
church yard and was overshadowed by a yew
tree his chair was surrounded by folios and
quartos piled upon the floor and his table was
covered with books and manuscripts the
a literary antiquary 
cause his seclusion was a work which he
had recently received and with which he had
retired in rapture from the world and shut himself
up to enjoy a literary honey moon undisturbed
never did boarding school girl devour
the pages a sentimental novel or don quixote
a chivalrous romance with more intense delight
than did the little man banquet on the
pages this delicious work it was dibdin's
bibliographical tour a work calculated to have
as powerful an effect on the imaginations literary
antiquaries as the tales the early
american adventurers had on the spanish
dons filling them with dreams mexican
and peruvian mines and the golden realm
 el dorado
the good parson had long been looking forward
to the fruits this bibliographical crusade 
which had far greater importance in his eyes
than the expeditions to africa or the north pole
the work had realized all his anticipations
he had been transported in idea to the libraries
 the old german convents and universities 
 a literary antiquary
his mind's eye had feasted on vellum manuscripts
and exquisitely illuminated missals his brain
was haunted with lovesick dreams about gorgeous
old works in silk linings triple gold
bands and tinted leather locked up in wire
cases and secured from the vulgar hands the
mere reader and to continue the happy expressions
 an ingenious w r river dazzling
one's eyes like eastern beauties peering through
their jealousies
when the parson had finished a rapturous
eulogy on this most curious and entertaining
work he drew forth from a little drawer a
manuscript lately received from a correspondent
which had perplexed him sadly it was written
in norman french in very ancient characters
and so faded and smouldered away as to be almost
illegible it was apparently an old norman
drinking song that might have been brought
over by one william the conqueror's carousing
followers the writing was just legible
disraeli's curiosities literature
a literary antiquary ill
enough to keep a keen antiquity hunter on a
doubtful chace here and there would be a few
words so plainly written as to put him on the
scent again in this way he had been led on
for a whole day until he had found himself completely
at fault
the squire endeavoured to assist him but
was equally baffled the old general listened
for some time to the discussion and then asked
the parson if he had read captain morris or
george stevens or anacreon moore's bacchanalian
songs on the other's replying in the negative
 oh then said the general with infinite
bon homme if you want a drinking song
i can furnish you with the latest collection
i did not know you had a turn for those kind 
things and i can lend you the encyclopaedia
 wit into the bargain i never travel without
them they're excellent reading at an inn
it would be difficult to describe the odd look
 surprise and perplexity the parson on
this proposal or the difficulty that the squire
had in making the general comprehend that
 a literary antiquary
though a jovial song the present day was
totally abhorrent to the ears wisdom and
beneath the notice a learned man yet a
trowel written by a tosspot several hundred
years since was a matter worthy the gravest
research and enough to set whole colleges by
the ears
the farm house
love and hay
are thick sown but come up full thistles
beaumont and fletcher
i was so much pleased with the anecdotes
which were told me ready money jack gibbets
that i got master simon a day or two since
to take me to his house it was an old fashioned
farm house built brick with curiously twisted
chimneys it stood at a little distance from the
road with a southern exposure looking upon a
soft green slope meadow there was a small
garden in front with a row beehives humming
among beds sweet herbs and flowers
well scoured milking tubs with bright copper
hoops hung on the garden paling fruit trees
were trained up against the cottage and pots 
vol i 
 the farm house
flowers stood in the windows a fat superannuated
mastiff lay in the sunshine at the door 
with a sleek cat sleeping peacefully across him
tibbets was from home at the time our
calling but we were received with hearty and
homely welcome by his wife a notable motherly
woman and a complete pattern for wives since
according to master simon's account she never
contradicts honest jack and yet manages to have
her own way and to control him in everything

she received us in the main room the house
a kind parlour and hall with great brown
beams timber across it which tibbets is apt
to point out with some exultation observing that
they don't put such timber in houses nowadays
the furniture was old fashioned strong and
highly polished the walls were hung with coloured
prints the story the prodigal son
who was represented in a red coat and leather
breeches over the fireplace was a blunderbuss
and a hard favoured likeness ready money
jack taken when he was a young man by the
the farm house 
same artist that painted the tavern sign his mother
having taken a notion that the tibbets had
as much right to have a gallery family portraits
as the folks at the hall
the good dame pressed us very much to take
some refreshment and tempted us with a variety
 household dainties so that we were glad to
compound by tasting some her homemade
wines while we were there the son and heir
apparent came home a good looking young fellow
and something a rustic beau he took
us over the premises and showed us the whole
establishment an air homely but substantial
plenty prevailed throughout every thing
was the jest materials and in the best condition
nothing was out place or ill made 
and you saw every where the signs a man
that took care to have the worth his money
and that paid as he went
the farm yard was well stocked under a
shed was a taxed cart in trim order in which
ready money jack took his wife about the country
his wellfed horse neighed from the stag
the farm house
able and when led into the yard to use the words
 young jack he shone like a bottle for he
said the old man made it a rule that every thing
about him should fare as well as he did himself
i was pleased to see the pride which the young
fellow seemed to have his father he gave
us several particulars concerning his habits which
were pretty much to the effect those i have
already mentioned he had never suffered an
account to stand in his life always providing the
money before he purchased any thing and if
possible paying in gold and silver he had a
great dislike to paper money and seldom went
without a considerable sum in gold about him
on my observing that it was a wonder he had
never been waylaid and robbed the young fellow
smiled at the idea any one venturing upon
such an exploit for i believe he thinks the old
man would be a match for robin hood and all
his gang
i have noticed that master simon seldom goes
into any house without having a world private
talk with some one or other the family being
the farm house 
a kind universal counsellor and confidant
we had not been long at the farm before the
old dame got him into a corner her parlour
where they had a long whispering conference
together in which i saw by his shrugs that there
were some dubious matters discussed and by his
nods that he agreed with every thing she said
after we had come out the young man accompanied
us a little distance and then drawing
master simon aside into a green lane they walked
and talked together for nearly half an hour
master simon who has the usual propensity 
confidants to blab every thing to the next friend
they meet with let me know that there was a
love affair in question the young fellow having
been smitten with the charms phoebe wilkins
the pretty niece the housekeeper at the hall
like most other love concerns it had brought
its troubles and perplexities dame tibbets
had long been on intimate gossiping terms with
the housekeeper who often visited the farmhouse
but when the neighbours spoke to her
 the likelihood a match between her son and
 the farm house
phoebe wilkins marry come up she scouted
the very idea the girl had acted as lady's
maid and it was beneath the blood the gibbets
who had lived on their own lands time out
 mind and owed reverence and thanks to nobody
to have the heir apparent marry a servant

these vapourings had faithfully been carried
to the housekeeper's ear by one their mutual
gobetween friends the old housekeeper's
blood if not as ancient was as quick as that 
dame tibbets she had been accustomed to
carry a high head at the hall and among the
villagers and her faded brocade rustled with
indignation at the slight cast upon her alliance
by the wife a petty farmer she maintained
that her niece had been a companion rather thana
waiting maid to the young ladies thank
heaven she was not obliged to work for her
living and was as idle as any young lady in the
land and when somebody died would receive
something that would be worth the notice 
some folks with all their ready money
the farm house 
a bitter feud had thus taken place between
the two worthy dames and the young people
were forbidden to think one another as to
young jack he was too much in love to reason
upon the matter and being a little heady and
not standing in much awe his mother was
ready to sacrifice the whole dignity the gibbets
to his passion he had lately however
had a violent quarrel with his mistress in consequence
 some coquetry on her part and at
present stood aloof the politic mother was
exerting all her ingenuity to widen this accidental
breach but as is most commonly the case the
more she meddled with this perverse inclination
 her son's the stronger it grew in the meantime
old ready money was kept completely in
the dark both parties were in awe and uncertainty
as to what might be his way taking the
matter and dreaded to awaken the sleeping lion
between father and son therefore the worthy
mrs tibbets was full business and at her
wit's it is true there was no great danger
 honest ready money's finding the thing out
i
 the farm house
if left to himself for he was a most unsuspicious
temper and by no means quick apprehension
 but there was daily risk his attention
being aroused by those cobwebs which his wife
was continually spinning about his nose
such is the distracted state politics in the
domestic empire ready money jack which
only shows the intrigues and internal dangers to
which the best regulated governments are liable
in this perplexed situation their affairs both
mother and son have applied to master simon
for counsel and with all his experience in meddling
with other people's concerns he finds it an
exceedingly difficult part to play to agree with
both parties seeing that their opinions and wishes
are so diametrically opposite
story telling
a favourite evening pastime at the hall and
one which the worthy squire is fond promoting
is story telling a good old fashioned
fireside amusement as he terms it indeed i
believe he promotes it chiefly because it was
one the choice recreations in those days 
yore when ladies and gentlemen were not
much in the habit reading be this as it
may he will often at supper table when conversation
flags call upon some one or other
 the company for a story as it was formerly
the custom to call for a song and it is edifying
to see the exemplary patience and even satisfaction
with which the good old gentleman will sit
and listen to some hackneyed tale that he has
heard for at least an hundred times
in this way one evening the current 
anecdotes and stories ran upon mysterious per
vol i 
 story telling
songes that have figured at different times and
filled the world with doubt and conjecture such
as the wandering jew the man with the iron
mask who tormented the curiosity all europe
the invisible girl and last though not
least the pigfaced lady
at length one the company was called
upon that had the most unpromising physiognomy
for a story teller that i had ever seen
he was a thin pale weakenfaced man extremely
nervous that had sat at one corner
 the table shrunk up as it were into himself
and almost swallowed up in the cape his
coat as a turtle in its shell
the very demand seemed to throw him into
a nervous agitation yet he did not refuse
he emerged his head out his shell made a
few odd grimaces and gesticulations before he
could get his muscles into order or his voice
under command and then offered to give some
account a mysterious personage that he had
recently encountered in the course his travels
story telling 
and one whom he thought fully entitled to be
classed with the man with the iron mask
i was so much struck with his extraordinary
narrative that i have written it out to the best
 my recollection for the amusement the
reader i think it has in it all the elements
 that mysterious and romantic narrative so
greedily sought after at the present day
the stout gentleman
a tale mystery
ill cross it though it blast me 
hamlet
it was a rainy sunday in the gloomy month
 november i had been detained in the
course a journey by a slight indisposition
from which i was recovering but i was still
feverish and was obliged to keep within doors
all day in an inn the small town derby
a wet sunday in a country inn whoever has
had the luck to experience one can alone judge
 my situation the rain pattered against
the casements the bells tolled for church
with a melancholy sound i went to the windows
in quest something to amuse the eye 
but it seemed as if i had been placed completely

the stout gentleman 
out the reach all amusement the windows
 my bed room looked out among tiled
roofs and stacks chimneys while those 
my sitting room commanded a full view the
stable yard i know nothing more calculated
to make a man sick this world than a stable
yard on a rainy day the place was littered
with wet straw that had been kicked about
by travellers and stable boys in one corner
was a stagnant pool water surrounding
an island muck there were several half
drowned fowls crowded together under a cart
among which was a miserable crestfallen
cock drenched out all life and spirit his
drooping tail matted as it were into a single
feather along which the water trickled from
his back near the cart was a halfdozing
cow chewing the cud and standing patiently
to be rained on with wreaths vapour
rising from her reeking hide a walleyed horse
tired the loneliness the stable was poking
his spectral head out a window with the rain
dripping on it from the eaves an unhappy cur
the stout gentleman
chained to a dog house hard by uttered something
every now and then between a bark and
a yelp a drab a kitchen wench tramped
backwards and forwards through the yard in
patterns looking as sulky as the weather itself
every thing in short was comfortless and forlorn
excepting a crew harddrinking ducks
assembled like boon companions round a puddle
and making a riotous noise over their liquor
i was lonely and listless and wanted amusement
my room soon became insupportable i
abandoned it and sought what is technically called
the traveller's room this is a public room
set apart at most inns for the accomodation 
a class wayfarers called travellers or riders 
a kind commercial knights errant who are
incessantly scouring the kingdom in gigs on
horseback or by coach they are the only
successors that i know at the present day
to the knights errant yore they lead the
same kind roving adventurous life only
changing the lance for a whip the buckler fora
pattern card and the coat mail for an
the stout gentleman 
upper benjamin instead vindicating the
charms peerless beauty they rove about
spreading the fame and standing some substantial
tradesman or manufacturer arid are
ready at any time to bargain in his name it
being the fashion nowadays to trade instead 
fight with one another as the room the
hostel in the good old fighting times would
be hung round at night with the armour 
wayworn warriors such as coats mail falchions
and yawning helmets so the traveller's
room is garnished with the harnessing their
successors with box coats whips all kinds
spurs gaiters and oil cloth covered hats
i was in hopes finding some these
worthies to talk with but was disappointed
there were indeed two or three in the
room but i could make nothing them one
was just finishing his breakfast quarrelling
with his bread and butter and huffing the
waiter another buttoned on a pair gaiters
with many execrations at boots for not
having cleaned his shoes well a third sat
 the stout gentleman
drumming on the table with his fingers and
looking at the rain as it streamed down the
window glass they all appeared infected by
the weather and disappeared one after the
other without exchanging a word
i sauntered to the window and stood gazing
at the people picking their way to church with
petticoats hoisted midleg high and dripping umbrellas
the bell ceased to toll and the streets
became silent i then amused myself with
watching the daughters a tradesman opposite
 who being confined to the house for fear
 wetting their sunday finery played off their
charms at the front windows to fascinate the
chance tenants the inn they at length
were summoned away by a vigilant vinegarfaced
mother and i had nothing farther from
without to amuse me
what was i to do to pass away the longlived
day i was sadly nervous and lonely 
and every thing about an inn seems calculated to
make a dull day ten times duller old newspapers
smelling beer and tobacco smoke and
the stout gentleman 
which i had already read half a dozen times
good for nothing books that were worse than
the rainy weather i bored myself to death
with an old volume the lady's magazine
i read all the common placed names ambitious
travellers scrawled on the panes glass 
the eternal families the smiths and the
browns and the jacksons and the johnson
and all the other sons and i deciphered several
scraps fatiguing innwindow poetry that
i have met with in all parts the world
the day continued lowering and gloomy 
the slovenly ragged spongy clouds drifted
heavily along in the air there was no variety
even in the rain it was one dull continued
monotonous patter patter patter excepting that
now and then i was enlivened by the idea a
brisk shower from the rattling the drops
upon a passing umbrella it was quite refreshing
if i may be allowed a hackneyed phrase
 the day when in the course the morning
a horn blew and a stage coach whirled through
the street with outside passengers stuck all
vol i 
 the stout gentleman
over it cowering under cotton umbrellas and
seethed together and reeking with the steams
 wet box coats and upper benjamins
the sound brought out from their lurking
places a crew vagabond boys and vagabond
dogs with the carrots headed hostler and that
non rescript animal ycleped boots and all the
other vagabond race that infest the purlieus 
an inn but the bustle was transient the coach
again whirled on its way and boy and dog
and hostler and boots all slunk back again to
their holes and the street again became silent
and the rain continued to rain on in fact there
was no hope its clearing up the barometer
pointed to rainy weather mine hostess tortoiseshell
cat sat by the fire washing her face and
rubbing her paws over her ears and on referring
to the almanac i found a direful prediction
stretching from the top the page to the
bottom through the whole month 

i was dreadfully hipped the hours seemed
as if they would never creep by the very
ticking the clock became irksome at length
the stout gentleman 
the stillness the house was interrupted by the
ringing a bell shortly after i heard the
voice a waiter at the bar the stout gentleman
in no wants his breakfast tea
and bread and butter with ham and eggs the
eggs not to be too much done
in such a situation as mine every incident is
 importance here was a subject speculation
presented to my mind and ample exercise
for my imagination i am prone to paint
pictures to myself and on this occasion i had
some materials to work upon had the guest
up stairs been mentioned as mr smith or
mr brown or mr jackson or mr johnson
or merely as the gentleman in no it would
have been a perfect blank to me i should have
thought nothing it but the stout gentleman
 the very name had something in it
 the picturesque it at once gave the size it
embodied the personage to my mind's eye and
my fancy did the rest he was stoutor as
some term it lusty in all probability therefore
he was advanced in life some people expanding
 the stout gentleman
as they grow old by his breakfasting rather
late and in his own room he must be a man
accustomed to live at his ease and above the
necessity early rising no doubt abound rosy
lusty old gentleman
there was another violent ringing the stout
gentleman was impatient for his breakfast he
was evidently a man importance well todo
in the world accustomed to be promptly
waited upon a keen appetite and a little cross
when hungry perhaps thought i he maybe
some london alderman or who knows but
he may be a member parliament 
 the breakfast was sent up and there was a
short interval silence he was doubtless making
the tea presently there was a violent ringing
and before it could be answered another
ringing still more violent bless me what a
choleric old gentleman the waiter came
down in a huff the butter was rancid the
eggs were overdone the ham was too salt the
stout gentleman was evidently nice in his eating
one those who eat and growl and keep the
the stout gentleman v 
waiter on the trot and live in a state militant
with the household
the hostess got into a fume i should observe
that she was a brisk coquettish woman a
little a shrew and something a slammerkin
but very pretty withal with a nincompoop
for a husband as shrews are apt to have she
rated the servants roundly for their negligence
in sending up so bad a breakfast but said not a
word against the stout gentleman by which i
clearly perceived that he must be a man consequence
 entitled to make a noise and to give
trouble at a country inn other eggs and ham
and bread and butter were sent they appeared
to be more graciously received at least there
was no further complaint
i had not made many turns about the traveller's
room when there was another ringing
shortly afterwards there was a stir and an inquest
about the house the stout gentleman
wanted the times or the chronicle newspaper
i set him down therefore for a whig or rather
from his being so absolute and lordly where he
j the stout gentleman
had a chance i suspected him being a radical
hunt i had heard was a large man who
knows thought i but it is hunt himself
my curiosity began to be awakened i inquired
 the waiter who was this stout gentleman
that was making all this stir but i could
get no information nobody seemed to know
his name the landlords bustling inns seldom
trouble their heads about the names their
transient guests the colour a coat the
shape or sifee the person is enough to suggest a
travelling name it is either the tall gentleman
or the short gentleman or the gentleman in
black or the gentleman in snuff colour or as in
the present instance the stout gentleman a designation
 the kind once hit on answers every
purpose and saves all farther inquiry
rain rain rain pitiless ceaseless rain no
such thing as putting a foot out doors and no
occupation or amusement within by and bye
i heard some one walking over head it was in
the stout gentleman's room he evidently was
a large man by the heaviness his tread and
the stout gentleman 
an old man from his wearing such creaking
soles he is doubtless thought i some
rich old square toes regular habits and is now
taking exercise after breakfast
i now read all the advertisements coaches
and hotels that were stuck about the mantlepiece
the lady's magazine had become an
abomination to me it was as tedious as the day
itself i wandered out not knowing what todo
and ascended again to my room i had not
been there long when there was a squall from a
neighbouring bed room a door opened and
slammed violently a chambermaid that i had
remarked for a ruddy good humoured face went
down stairs in a violent flurry the stout gentleman
had been rude to her
this sent a whole host my deductions to
the deuce in a moment this unknown personage
could not be an old gentleman for old gentlemen
are not apt to be so obstreperous to chambermaids
he could not be a young gentleman
 for young gentleman are not apt to inspire
such indignation he must be a middle aged
 the stout gentleman
man and confoundedly ugly into the bargain or
the girl would not have taken the matter in such
terrible dudgeon i confess i was sorely puzzled
in a few minutes i heard the voice my
landlady i caught a glance her as she came
tramping up stairs her face glowing her cap
flaring her tongue wagging the whole way
she'd have no such doings in her house she'd
warrant if gentlemen did spend their money
freely it was no rule she'd have no servant
maids her's treated in that way when they
were about their work that's what she wouldn't
as i hate squabbles particularly with women
and above all with pretty women i slunk back
into my room and partly closed the door but
my curiosity was too much excited not to listen
the landlady marched intrepidly to the enemy's
citadel and entered it with a storm the door
closed after her i heard her voice in high windy
clamour for a moment or two then it gradually
subsided like a gust wind in a garret
then there was a laugh then i heard nothing
more after a little while my landlady came
the stout gentleman 
out with an odd smile on her face adjusting her
cap which was a little on one side as she went
down stairs i heard the landlord ask her what
was the matter she said nothing at all
only the girl's a fool i was more than ever
perplexed what to make this unaccountable
personage who could put a goodnatured chambermaid
in a passion and send away a termagant
landlady in smiles he could npt be so
old nor cross nor ugly either
i had to go to work at his picture again and
to paint him entirely different i now set him
down for one those stout gentlemen that are
frequently met with swaggering about the doors
 country inns moist merry fellows in bel
cher handkerchiefs whose bulk is a little assisted
by malt liquors men who have seen the world
and been sworn at highgate who are used
to tavern life up to all the tricks tapsters
and knowing in the ways sinful publicans
free livers on a small scale who are prodigal
within the compass a guinea who call all the
waiters by name tousle the maids gossip with
vol i
 the stout gentleman
the landlady at the bar and prose over a pint 
port or a glass negus after dinner
the morning wore away in forming these and
similar surmises as fast as i wove one system
 belief some movement the unknown would
completely overturn it and throw all my thoughts
again into confusion such are the solitary operations
 a feverish mind i was as i have
said extremely nervous and the continual meditation
on the concerns this invisible personage
began to have its effect i was getting a fit 
the fidgets
dinner time came i hoped the stout gentleman
might dine in the traveller's room and that
i might at length get a view his person but
no he had dinner served in his own room
what could be the meaning this solitude and
mystery he could not be a radical there
was something too aristocratical in thus keeping
himself apart from the rest the world and
condemning himself to his own dull company
throughout a rainy day and then too he lived
i 
too well for a discontented politician he seemed
the stout gentleman 
to expatiate on a variety dishes and to sit
over his wine like a jolly friend good living
indeed my doubts on this head were soon at
an for he could not have finished his first
bottle before i could faintly hear him humming
a tune and on listening i found it to be god
save the king twas plain then he was no
radical but a faithful subject one that grew
loyal over his bottle and was ready to stand by
king and constitution when he could stand by
nothing else but who could he be my
conjectures began to run wild was he not some
personage distinction travelling incog
god knows said i at my wit's it
may be one the royal family for aught i
know for they are all stout gentlemen 
the weather continued rainy the mysterious
unknown kept his room and as far as i could
judge his chair for i did not hear him move
in the mean time as the day advanced the traveller's
room began to be frequented some
who had just arrived came in buttoned up in
box coats others came home who had been
 the stout gentleman
dispersed about the town some took their dinners
and some their tea had i been in a different
mood i should have found entertainment
in studying this peculiar class men there
were two especially who were regular wags 
the road and up to all the standing jokes travellers
they had a thousand sly things to say
to the waiting maid whom they called louisa
and ethelinda and a dozen other fine names 
changing the name every time and chuckling
amazingly at their own waggery my mind
however had become completely engrossed by
the stout gentleman he had kept my fancy in
chace during a long day and it was not now to
be diverted from the scent
the evening gradually wore away the
travellers read the papers two or three times over
some drew round the fire and told long stories
about their horses about their adventures their
overturns and breaking down they discussed
the credits different merchants and different
inns and the two wags told several choice anecdotes
 pretty chambermaids and kind landladies
the stout gentleman 
all this passed as they were quietly taking what
they called their night caps that is to say
strong glasses brandy and water with sugar or
some other mixture the kind after which they
one after another rang for boots and the chambermaid
and walked up to bed in old shoes cut
down into marvellously uncomfortable slippers
there was only one man left a short legged
longbodied plethoric fellow with a very large
sandy head he sat by himself with a glass 
port wine negus and a spoon sipping and stirring
until nothing was left but the spoon he
gradually fell asleep bolt upright in his chair
with the empty glass standing before him and
the candle seemed to fall asleep too for the wick
grew long and black and cabbaged at the 
and dimmed the little light that remained in the
chamber
the gloom that now prevailed was contagious
around hung the shapeless and almost
spectral box coats departed travellers long
since buried in deep sleep i only heard the
ticking the clock with the deepdrawn breathe
the stout gentleman
kings the sleeping toper and the drippings 
the rain dropdropdrop from the ears the
house
the church bells chimed midnight all at
once the stout gentleman began to walk overhead
pacing slowly backwards and forwards
there was something extremely awful in all this
especially to one in my state nerves these
ghastly greatcoats these guttural breathing and
the creaking footsteps this mysterious being
his steps grew fainter and fainter and at length
died away i could bear it no longer i was
wound up to the desperation a hero romance
 be he who or what he may said i
to myself i'll have a sight him i seized
a chamber candle and hurried up to no 
the door stood ajar i hesitated i entered the
room was deserted there stood a large broad
bottomed elbow chair at a table on which was
an empty tumbler and a times newspaper
and the room smelt powerfully stilton
cheese
the mysterious stranger had evidently but
just retired i turned off to my room sorely disthe
stout gentleman 
appointed as i went along the corridor i saw
a large pair boots with dirty waxed tops
standing at the door a bed chamber they
doubtless belonged to the unknown but it would
not do to disturb so redoubtable a personage in
his den he might discharge a pistol or something
worse at my head i went to bed therefore
and lay awake half the night in a terribly
nervous state and even when i fell asleep i was
still haunted in my dreams by the idea the
stout gentleman and his waxtopped boots
i slept rather late the next morning and was
awakened by some stir and bustle in the house
which i could not at first comprehend until
getting more awake i found there was a mail
coach starting from the door suddenly there
was a cry from below 
the gentleman has forgot his umbrella
look for the gentleman's umbrella in no 
i heard an immediate scampering a chambermaid
along the passage and a shrill reply
as she ran here it is here's the gentleman's
umbrella 
 the stout gentleman
the mysterious stranger then was on the
point setting off this was the only chance
i should ever have knowing him i sprang
out bed scrambled to the window snatched
aside the curtains and just caught a glimpse 
the rear a person getting in at the coach door
the skirts a brown coat parted behind and
gave me a full view the broad disk a pair
 drab breeches the door closed all right
was the word the coach whirled off and that
was all i ever saw the stout gentleman 
forest trees
a living gallery aged trees
one the favourite themes boasting with
the squire is the noble trees on his estate which
in truth has some the finest that i have seen
in england
there is something august and solemn in the
great avenues stately oaks that gather their
branches together high in the air and seem to reduce
the pedestrians between them to mere pig
mies
an avenue oaks or elms the squire observes
 is the true colonnade that should lead
to a gentleman's house as to stone and marble
any one can rear them at once they are the
work the day but commend me to the covol
i 
 forest trees
colonnades that have grown old and great with the
family and tell by their grandeur how long the
family has endured
the squire has great reverence for certain
venerable trees gray with moss which he considers
as the ancient nobility his domain
there is the ruin an enormous oak which
has been so much battered by time and tempest
that scarce any thing is left though he says
christy recollects when in his boyhood it was
healthy and flourishing until it was struck by
lightning it is now a mere trunk with one
twisted bough stretching up into the air bearing
a green branch at the it this sturdy
wreck is much valued by the squire he calls
it his standard bearer and compares it to a veteran
warrior beaten down in the battle but bearing
up his banner to the last he has actually
had a fence built round it to protect it as much
as possible from farther injury
it is with great difficulty that the squire can
be brought to have any tree cut down on his estate
to some he looks with reverence as havforest
trees 
ing been planted by his ancestors to others with
a kind paternal affection as having been
planted by himself and he feels a degree awe
in bringing down with a few strokes the axe
what it has cost centuries to build up i confess
i cannot but sympathize in some degree
with the good squire on the subject
though brought up in a country overrun with
forests where trees are apt to be considered
mere incumbrances and to be laid low without
hesitation or remorse yet i could never see a fine
tree hewn down without concern the poets
who are naturally lovers trees as they are 
every thing that is beautiful have artfully awakened
great interest in their favour by representing
them as the habitations sylvan deities 
insomuch that every great tree had its tutelar
genius or a nymph whose existence was limited
to its duration evelyn in his sylva makes several
pleasing and fanciful allusions to this superstition
 as the fall says he a very
aged oak giving a crack like thunder has often
been heard at many miles distance constrained
 forest trees
as i often am to fell them with reluctancy i do
not at any time remember to have heard the
groans those nymphs grieving to be dispossessed
 their ancient habitations without some
emotion and pity and again in alluding to a
violent storm that had devastated the woodlands
he says methinks i still hear sure i am that i
still feel the dismal groans our forests the
late dreadful hurricane having subverted so many
thousands goodly oaks prostrating the trees
laying them in ghastly postures like whole regiments
fallen in battle by the sword the conqueror
and crushing all that grew beneath them
the public accounts he adds reckon no less
than three thousand brave oaks in one part only
 the forest dean blown down
i have paused more than once in the wilderness
 america to contemplate the traces 
some blast wind which seemed to have rushed
down from the clouds and ripped its way
through the bosom the woodlands rooting
up shivering and splintering the stoutest trees
and leaving a long track desolation
forest trees 
there was something awful in the vast havoc
made among these gigantic plants and in considering
their magnificent remains so rudely
torn and mangled and hurled down to perish
prematurely on their native soil i was conscious
 a strong movement the sympathy so feelingly
expressed by evelyn i recollect also
hearing a traveller poetical temperament expressing
the kind horror which he felt on beholding
on the banks the missouri an oak 
prodigious size which had been in a manner
overpowered by an enormous wild grape vine
the vine had clasped its huge folds round the
trunk and from thence had wound about every
branch and twig until the mighty tree had
withered in its embrace it seemed like laocoon
struggling ineffectually in the hideous coils
 the monster python it was the lion trees
perishing in the embraces a vegetable boa
i am fond listening to the conversation 
english gentlemen on rural concerns and noticing
with what taste and discrimination and
what strong unaffected interest they will 
forest trees
cuss topics which in other countries are abandoned
to mere woodmen or rustic cultivators i
have heard a noble earl descant on park and forest
scenery with the science and feeling a
painter he dwelt on the shape and beauty 
particular trees on his estate with as much pride
and technical precision as though he had been
discussing the merits statues in his collection
i found that he had even gone considerable
distances to examine trees which were celebrated
among rural amateurs for it seems that
trees like houses have their established points
 excellence and that there are some in england
which enjoy very extensive celebrity from
being perfect in their kind
there is something nobly simple and pure in
such a taste it argues think a sweet and
generous nature to have this strong relish for
the beauties vegetation and this friendship
for the hardy and glorious sons the forest
there is a grandeur thought connected with
this part rural economy it is if may be
allowed the figure the heroic line husbandry
forest trees 
it is worthy liberal and free born and aspiring
men he who plants an oak looks forward
to future ages and plants for posterity
nothing can be less selfish than this he cannot
expect to sit in its shade nor enjoy its shelter
but he exults in the idea that the acorn
which he has buried in the earth shall grow up
into a lofty pile and shall keep on flourishing
and increasing and benefiting mankind long after
he shall have ceased to tread his paternal
fields
indeed it is the nature such occupations
to lift the thought above mere worldliness as
the leaves trees are said to absorb all noxious
qualities the air and to breathe forth a purer
atmosphere so it seems to me as if they drew
from us all sordid and angry passions and
breathed forth peace and philanthropy there
is a serene and settled majesty in woodland
scenery that enters into the soul and dilates
and elevates it and fills it with noble inclinations
the ancient and hereditary groves too
that embower this island are most them full
 forest trees
 story they are haunted by the recollections
 great spirits past ages who have
sought for relaxation among them from the
tumult arms or the toils state or have
wooed the muse beneath their shade
who can walk with soul unmoved among the
stately groves penshurst where the gallant
the amiable the elegant sir philip sidney passed
his boyhood or can look without fondness
upon the tree that is said to have been planted
on his birth day or can ramble among the
classic bowers harley treading in the footsteps
 a pope and a littleton or can pause
among the solitudes windsor forest and look
at the oaks around huge gray and timeworn
like the old castle towers and not feel as if he
were surrounded by so many monuments long
enduring glory it is when viewed in this
light that planted groves and stately avenues
and cultivated parks have an advantage over
the more luxuriant beauties unassisted nature
it is that they teem with moral associations and
keep up the ever interesting story human
existence
forest trees 
it is becoming then for the high and generous
spirits an ancient nation to cherish these
sacred groves that surround their ancestral mansions
and to perpetuate them to their descendants
brought up as i have been in republican
habits and principles i can feel nothing 
the servile reverence for titled rank merely because
it is titled but i trust i am neither
churl nor bigot in my creed i do see and feel
how hereditary distinction when it falls to the
lot a generous mind may elevate that mind
into true nobility it is one the effects 
hereditary rank when it falls thus happily that
it multiplies the duties and as it were extends
the existence the possessor he does not
feel himself a mere individual link in creation
responsible only for his own brief term being
he carries back his existence in proud recollection
and he extends it forward in honourable
anticipation he lives with his ancestry and
he lives with his posterity to both does he
consider himself involved in deep responsibilities
as he has received much from those that have
vol i 
 forest trees
gone before so he feels bound to transmit much
to those who are to come after him
his domestic undertakings seem to imply a
longer existence than those ordinary men
none are so apt to build and plant for future centuries
as noble spirited men who have received
their heritages from foregone ages
i can easily imagine therefore the fondness
and pride with which i have noticed english
gentlemen generous temperaments but high
aristocratic feelings contemplating those magnificent
trees which rise like towers and pyramids
from the midst their paternal lands
there is an affinity between all natures animate
and inanimate the oak in the pride and lustihood
 its growth seems to me to take its
range with the lion and the eagle and to assimilate
in the grandeur its attributes to heroic
and intellectual man
with its mighty pillar rising straight and direct
toward heaven bearing up its leafy honours
from the impurities earth and supporting
them aloft in free air and glorious sunforest
trees 
shine it is an emblem what a true nobleman
should be a refuge for the weak a shelter for
the oppressed a defence for the defenceless 
warding off from them the pelting the storm
or the scorching rays arbitrary power he
who is this is an ornament and a blessing to
his native land he who is otherwise abuses
his eminent advantages abuses the grandeur
and prosperity which he has drawn from the
bosom his country should tempests arise
and he be laid prostrate by the storm who
would mourn over his fall should he be borne
down by the oppressive hand power who
would murmur at his fate why cumbered
he the ground 
horsemanship
indeed a coach was a strange monster in those days and the
sight one put both horse and man into amazement some said it
was a great crab shell brought out china and some imagined it to
be one the pagan temples in which the cannibals adored the divell
taylor the water poet
i have made casual mention more than once
 one the squire's antiquated retainers old
christy the huntsman i find that his crusty
crabbed humours are a source much entertainment
among the young gentlemen the family
especially the oxonian who takes a mischievous
pleasure now and then in slyly rubbing the old
man against the grain and then amuses himself
with smoothing him down again for the old
fellow is as ready to bristle up his back as a
porcupine he rides an old hunter called pepper
which is a counterpart himself a most
horsemanship 
wrathful headstrong animal that frets the flesh
off its bones bites kicks and plays all kinds
 villanous tricks
he is as tough and nearly as old as his rider
who has ridden him time out mind and is indeed
the only one that can do any thing with
him sometimes however they have a complete
quarrel and a dispute for mastery and then i am
told it is as good as a farce to see the heat they
both get into and the wrong headed contest that
ensues for they are quite knowing in each other's
ways and in the art teasing and fretting
each other notwithstanding these doughty
brawls however there is nothing that nettles old
christy sooner than to question the merits his
horse which he will uphold as tenaciously asa
faithful husband will vindicate the virtues 
the termagant spouse that gives him a curtain
lecture every night his life
the young men call old christy their professor
 equitation arid in explaining this
phrase they let me into some particulars the
squire's mode bringing up his children
 horsemanship
there is an odd mixture eccentricity any
good sense in all the opinions my worthy
host his mind is like modern gothic where
plain brick work is set off with pointed arches
and quaint tracery though the main groundwork
 his opinions is correct yet he has a
thousand little notions picked up from old books
which stand out whimsically on the surface 
his mind
thus in rearing his boys pelham markham
and such like old english writers were his
manuals at an early age he took his lads out
 their mother's hands w ho was disposed as
mothers are apt to be to make fine orderly children
 them that should keep out sun and
rain and never soil their hands nor tear their
clothes in place this the squire turned them
loose to run free and wild about the park without
heeding wind or weather he was also
particularly attentive in making them bold and
expert horsemen and these were the days when
old christy the huntsman enjoyed great importance
 as the lads were put under his care to
horsemanship 
practise them at the leaping bars and to keep
an eye upon them in the chase
the squire always objected to their riding in
carriages any kind and is still a little tenacious
on this point he often rails against the
universal use carriages and quotes the words
 honest nashe to that effect it was thought
says nashe in his quaternio a kind solecism
and to savour effeminacy for a young
gentleman in the flourishing time his age to
creep into his coach and to shroud himself
from wind and weather our great delight was
to outbrave the blustering boreas upon a great
horse to arm and prepare ourselves to go with
mars and bellona into the field was our sport
and pastime coaches and arches we left unto
them for whom they were first invented for ladies
and gentlemen and decrepid age and impotent
people
the squire insists that the english gentlemen
have lost much their hardiness and manhood
since the introduction carriages compare
he will say the fine gentleman 
horsemanship
mer times ever on horseback booted and
spurred and travel stained but open frank
manly and chivalrous with the fine gentleman
 the present day full affectation and effeminacy
rolling along a turnpike in his voluptuous
vehicle the young men those days
were rendered brave and lofty and generous in
their notions by almost living in their saddles
and having their foaming steeds like proud
seas under them there is something he
adds in bestriding a fine horse that makes a
man feel more than mortal he seems to have
doubled his nature and to have added to his
own courage and sagacity the power the speed
and stateliness the superb animal on which
he is mounted
it is a great delight says old nashe to see
a young gentleman with his skill and cunning
by his voice rod and spur better to manage
and to command the great bucephalus than the
strongest milo with all his strength one while
to see him make him tread trot and gallop the
ling and one after to see him make him gather
horsemanship 
up roundly to bear his head steadily to run a
full career swiftly to stop a sudden lightly anon
after to see him make him advance to yorke to
go back and sidelong to turn on either hand 
to gallop the gallop galliard to do the capriole
the chambetta and dance the corvette
in conformity to these ideas the squire had
them all on horseback at an early age and made
them ride slap dash about the country without
flinching at hedge or ditch or stone wall to the
imminent danger their necks
even the fair julia was partially included in
this system arid under the instruction old
christy has become one the best horsewomen
in the county the squire says it is better than
all the cosmetics and sweeteners the breath
that ever were invented he extols the horsemanship
 the ladies in former times when queen
elizabeth would scarcely suffer the rain to stop her
accustomed ride and then think he will say
what nobler and sweeter beings it made them
what a difference must there be both in mind
and body between a joyous high spirited dame

 horsemanship
 those days glowing with health and exercise
freshened by every breeze that blows seated
loftily and gracefully in her saddle with plume
on head and hawk on hand and her descendant
 the present day the pale victim modern
routs and ball rooms sunk languidly in one corner
 an enervating carriage
the good squire's equestrian system has had
a happy effect for his sons having passed through
the whole course instruction without breaking
nei k or limb are now healthful spirited and
active and have the true englishman's love fora
horse if their manliness and frankness are
praised in their father's hearing he quotes the
old persian maxim and says they have been
taught to ride to shoot and to speak the
truth
it is true the oxonian has now and then practised
the old gentleman's doctrines a little in the
extreme he is a wild youngster rather fonder
 his horse than his with a little dash 
the dandy though the ladies all pronounced
him to be the flower the flock
horsemanship 
the first year that he was sent to oxford he
had a private tutor appointed to overlook him 
a dry chip the university when he returned
home in the vacation the squire made many
inquiries about how he liked his college and
his studies and his tutor
oh as to my tutor sir i've parted with
him 
you have and pray why so 
oh sir hunting was all the go at our college 
so i discharged my tutor and kept a horse you
know
ah i was not aware that tom said the
squire mildly when tom returned to college
his allowance was doubled to enable him to
keep both horse and tutor

i will now begin to sigh read poets look pale go neatly and be
most apparently in love
marston
i should not be surprised if we should have
another brace turtles at the hall for master
simon has informed me in great confidence that
he suspects the general some design upon the
susceptible heart lady lillycraft i have
indeed noticed a growing attention and courtesy
in the veteran toward her ladyship he
softens very much in her company sits by herat
table and entertains her with long stories
about seringapatam and pleasant anecdotes 
the mulligatawney club i have even seen him
present her with a full blown rose from the hothouse
in a style the most captivating gallantlove
symptoms 
ry and it was accepted with great suavity and
graciousness for her ladyship delights in receiving
the homage and attention the sex
indeed the general was one the earliest admirers
that dangled in her train during her short
reign beauty and they flirted together for half
a season in london some thirty or forty years
since she reminded him lately in the course
 conversation about former days the time
when he used to ride a white horse in hyde
park and to canter so gallantly by the side 
her carriage whereupon i have remarked that
the veteran has regularly escorted her since
when she rides out on horseback and i suspect
he almost persuades himself that he makes
as captivating an appearance as in his youthful
days
it would be an amusing event in the history
 faithful love if this spark the tender
passion after lying dormant such a length 
time should again be fanned into a flame from
among the ashes two burnt out hearts it
may however be nothing but a little venerable
 love symptoms
flirtation the general being a veteran dangler
and the good lady habituated to these kind 
attentions master simon however thinks the
general now that he is growing old is desirous
 getting into warm winter quarters and i
doubt whether the former with all his admiration
 the veteran would be pleased at his
winning the lady as he looks upon lady lilly
craft's house as one his strong holds
among other symptoms that look suspicious
i have observed that the general has lately been
very assiduous in his attentions to her ladyship's
dogs and has several times exposed his fingers
to imminent jeopardy in attempting to pat beauty
on the head it is to be hoped his advances
to the mistress will be more favourably received
as all his overtures toward a caress are greeted
by the pestilent little cur with a wary kindling
 the eye and a most venomous growl
he has moreover been very complaisant toward
my lady's gentlewoman the immaculate
mrs hannah whom he used to speak in a
way that i do not choose to mention whether
love symptoms 
she has the same suspicions with master simon
or not i cannot say but she receives his
civilities with no better grace than the implacable
beauty unscrewing her mouth into the
most acid smile and looking as though she
could bite a piece out him in short the
poor general seems to have as formidable foes
to contend with as a hero ancient fairy tale 
who had to fight his way to his enchanted princess
through ferocious monsters every kind 
and to encounter the brimstone terrors some
fiery dragon
there is still another circumstance which inclines
me to give very considerable credit to
master simon's suspicions lady lillycraft is
very fond quoting poetry and the conversation
often turns upon it on which occasions
the general is thrown completely out it happened
the other day that spenser's fairy queen
was the theme for the great part the morning
 and the poor general sat perfectly silent
i found him not long after in the library with
spectacles on nose a in his hand and
 love symptoms
fast asleep on my approach he awoke slipped
the spectacles into his pocket and began to
read very attentively after a little while he
put a piece paper in the place and laid the
volume aside which i perceived was the fairy
queen i had the curiosity to watch how he
got on in his poetical studies but though i have
repeatedly seen him with the in his hand
yet i find the paper has not advanced above
three or four pages the general being extremely
apt to fall asleep when he reads
falconry
s t e is there hawk which mantle her on perch
whether high tow'ring or accosting low
but i the measure her flight doe search
and all her prey and all her diet know
spenser
among the many recreations the good old
times which the squire has endeavoured to revive
on his estate is that hawking he decries
shooting as a skulking solitary treacherous
sport in comparison but hawking he says was
the noble art hunting carried into the skies
it was the stately amusement gentlemen for
in old times he says according to the welsh saying
 you might know a gentleman by his hawk
horse and greyhound indeed a cavalier was
seldom seen abroad without his hawk on his fist
and even a stately dame did not think herself
vol i 
 falconry
completely equipped in riding forth unless she
had her tasseledhawk held by jesses on her delicate
hand it was thought in those excellent
days says an old writer quite sufficient for a
nobleman to wind their horn and to carry their
hawke fair and leave study and learning to the
children mean people
in pursuance this notion the squire and
his faithful coadjutor master simon have bestowed
unwearied pains in endeavouring to reclaim
as it is termed and to train up hawks for
the sport a bounty has been given for all hawks
that could be brought to them alive and the hall
has been well stocked with vermin the kind
they have studied the st albans and
markham and various other books that have
treated falconry but they have more especially
studied some old tapestry in the house whereon
is represented a party ladies and gentlemen in
ancient dresses with doublets and caps and
flaunting feathers mounted on horse with attendants
on foot all in animated pursuit the
game they have met however continual checks
falconry 
and disappointments in endeavouring to bring
this project into operation their feathered
school has turned out the most untractable and
graceless scholars and then they have had so
much trouble in drilling the hangers on who
were to take charge the hawks old christy
and the game keeper both set their faces against
it for a time christy having been nettled at hearing
what he terms a wild goose chase put on a
par with a fox hunt and the gamekeeper having
always been accustomed to look upon hawks as
highway robbers which it was his duty to
shoot down and nail in terrorem against the outhouses

christy has at length taken the matter in
hand but has done still more mischief by his
intermeddling he is as positive and wrongheaded
as he is about hunting master simon
has continual disputes with him as to feeding
and training the hawks he reads to him long
passages from the st albans but
christy who cannot read has a sovereign contempt
for all knowledge and persists in
 falconry
treating the hawks as if they were game cocks
the consequence is between these jarring systems
the poor birds have had a sad time it
many have fallen victims to christy's feeding and
to master simon's physicking for the latter has
gone to work secundum autem and given them
all the vomiting and cowering laid down in
the books never were poor hawks so fed and
physicked before others have been lost by
being but half reclaimed for on being taken
ir'o the field they have raked after the game
quite out all hearing the call and never
returned to school
all these have been petty but sore grievances
to the squire and have led him to despond about
success he has lately however been rejoiced
by the receipt a fine welch falcon
which master simon terms a li stately high
flyer it is a present from his friend sir watt
williams wynne and has soared many a
time about the pure airs snowdon and the
brow penmanmaur
ever since the squire has received this inva
falconry 
liable present he has been as impatient to sally
forth and make proof it as was don quixote
to assay his rusty armour there have been
some demurs as to whether the bird was in proper
health and training or whether it was the
proper season for the sport but all these have
been overruled by the vehement desire to play
with a new toy and it has been determined
right or w long in season or out season to
have a day's sport in hawking tomorrow
the hall as usual whenever the squire is
about to make some new sally on his hobby
is all agog with the thing miss templeton
who is brought up in reverence for all her guardian's
humours has proposed to be the party
and lady lillycraft has determined to ride out
to the scene action and look on this has
gratified the old gentleman extremely he hails
it as an auspicious omen the revival falconry
 and does not despair but the time will
come when it again will be the pride a fine
lady to carry about a noble falcon in preference
to a parrot or a lap dog
 falconry
i have amused myself with the bustling preparations
 that busy spirit master simon
and the continual thwarting he receives from
the genuine son a pepperbox old christy
they have had half a dozen consultations about
how the hawk is to be prepared for the morning's
sport old nimrod as usual has always
got in a pet upon which master simon has invariably
given up the point observing in a good
humoured tone well well have it your own
way christy only don't put yourself in a passion
a reply which always nettles the old
man ten times more than ever
hawking
the soaring hawk from fist that flies
her falconer doth constrain
sometimes to range the ground about
to find her out again
and if by sight or sound bell
his falcon he may see
wo ho be cries with cheerful voice
the gladdest man is he
handful pleasant desires
at an early hour this morning the hall was
in a bustle preparing for the sport the day i
heard master simon whistling and singing a
ditty under my window at sunrise as he was
preparing some jesses for the hawk's legs a
hearty breakfast well flanked by cold meats
was served up in the great hall all the retainers
and hangers on were in motion the
horses were led up and down before the door 
there was a direful yelping dogs some that
were to accompany us eager to set out and others
 hawking
that were to stay at home being whipped back
to their kennels at length there was a general
turning out the chivalry the fair julia was
dressed in a picturesque hunting dress with a
light plume feathers in her riding hat as
she mounted her favourite galloway i remarked
with pleasure that old christy unbent from his
usual crustiness and hastened to adjust her saddle
and bridle he touched his jockey cap as she
smiled on him and thanked him and then looking
round at the other attendants gave a knowing
motion with his head in which i read pride
and exultation at the charming appearance 
his pupil
lady lillycraft had likewise determined to
witness the sport she was dressed in her
broad white beaver tied under the chin and a
riding habit the last century she rode her
sleek ambling pony whose motion was as easy
as a rocking chair and was gallantly escorted
by the general who looked not unlike one 
the doughty heroes in the old prints the battle
 blenheim
hawking 
the parson likewise accompanied her on the
other side for this was a learned amusement in
which he took great interest and indeed had
given much counsel from his knowledge old
customs at length every thing was arranged
and off we set from the hall
the exercise on horseback puts one in fine
spirits and the scene was gay and animating
the young men the family accompanied miss
templeton she sat lightly and gracefully in
her saddle her plumes dancing and waving in
the air and the group had a charming effect as
they appeared and disappeared among the trees
cantering along with the bounding animation 
youth
the squire and master simon rode together
accompanied by old christy mounted on pepper
the latter bore the hawk on his fist as he insisted
the bird was most accustomed to him there
was a rabble rout on foot composed retainers
from the hall and some idlers from the village
with two or three spaniels for the purpose
 starting the game
vol t 
 hawkins
a kind corps de reserve came on quietly
in the rear composed lady liflycraft general
harbottle the parson and a fat footman
her ladyship ambled gently along on her sleek
pony while the general mounted on a tall hunter
looked down upon her with an air the most
protecting gallantry for my part being no
sportsman i kept with this last party or rather
lagged behind that i might take in the whole
picture and the parson occasionally slackened
his pace and jogged on in company with me
the sport led us at some distance from the
hall in a soft meadow reeking with the moist
verdure spring a little river ran through it
bordered by willows which had put forth their
tender early foliage the sportsmen were inquest
 herons which were said to keep about
this stream
i saw that there was some disputing already
among the leaders the sport the squire
master simon and old christy came every now
and then to a pause to consult together like the
field officers an army and i saw by certain
hawking 
motions the head that christy was as positive
as any old wrong headed german commander

as we were prancing up this quiet meadow
every sound we made was answered by a distinct
echo from the sunny wall an old building
that lay on the opposite margin the stream
the circumstance brought to my mind and i
could not help quoting aloud the description 
an echo on webster's duchess malay 
yond side o th river lies a wall
piece cloister which in my opinion
gives the best echo that you ever heard
so plain is the distinction our words
that many have supposed it is a spirit
that answers
upon hearing this quotation the parson mentioned
a beautiful appellation which the jews
had old for the echo which they called bathcool
that is to say the daughter the
voice
note they spid it was an oracle supplying in the second temple
the want the urim and thummim with which the first temple
was honoured
beaker le monde enchants
 hawking
we had not proceeded very far when a flight
 crows that had been regaling themselves in
the meadow alarmed by the noise we made
suddenly rose old christy all in a flurry
from previous disputing and present surprise
slipped off the hood the hawk and let her
fly immediately there was a bawling and
shouting and yelping and barking that baffles
all description
the crows flew screaming in all directions 
while the hawk soared into the air my attention
however was attracted for a time to the
party in the meadow riding along in the direction
that the bird flew their bright beaming
faces turned up to the bright skies as they
watched the game the men on foot scampered
along looking up and calling out the dogs
bounding and yelping with joyous sympathy i
was delighted with the graceful figure the
fair julia her eye beaming as blue as the sky
she was contemplating her gallant lover rode
close by her side and lady liilycraft who
watched them more than the hawk would every
hawking 
now and then exclaim oh the charming couple

i had paused on a rising ground close by her
ladyship from whence i had a good view the
sport the hawk had singled out a quarry from
among the carrion crew it was in vain old
christy called and whistled and endeavoured
to lure her down she paid no regard to him and
indeed his calls were drowned in the shouts and
yelps the army militia that he had brought
into the field
it was curious to see the efforts the two
birds to get above each other one to make the
fatal swoop the other to avoid it now they
crossed athwart a bright feathery cloud and now
they were against the clear blue sky i confess
being no sportsman i was more interested for
the poor bird that was striving for its life than
for the hawk that was playing the part a mercenary
soldier at length the hawk got the upper
hand and made a rushing stoop at her quarry
but the latter made as sudden a surge downwards
and slanting up again evaded the blow
 hawking
screaming and making the best his way for a
dry tree on the brow a neighbouring hill
the poor crow however began to flag the
falcon was again getting above him i felt more
and more interested when an exclamation from
lady liliycraft made me turn my head
i beheld a complete confusion among the
sportsmen in the little vale below us they
were gal lopping and running towards the edge 
a bank and i was shocked to see miss templeton's
horse galloping along without his rider
i rode to the place to which the others were
hurrying and when i reached the bank which
almost overhung the stream i saw at the foot 
it the fair julia pale bleeding and apparently
lifeless supported in the arms her frantic
lover
in galloping heedlessly along with her eyes
turned upwards she had unwarily approached
too near the bank it had given way with her
and she and her horse had been precipitated to
the pebbled margin the river
i never saw greater consternation the caphawking
ribs
tain was distracted lady lillycraft fainting
the squire in dismay and master simon at
his wit's ends the only one that had real presence
 mind was old christy who ran to the
stream dipped his jockey cap full water and
threw some in her face the beautiful creature
at length showed signs returning life she
opened her eyes looked around her upon the
agonized group and comprehending in a moment
the nature the scene gave a sweet smile
and putting her hand in her lover's exclaimed
feebly i am not much hurt guy i could
have taken her to my heart for that single exclamation
it was found indeed that she had
escaped almost miraculously with a contusion
 the head a sprained ancle and some slight
bruises after her wound was stanched she
was taken to a neighbouring cottage until a carriage
could be summoned to take her home
when the cavalcade which had issued forth so
gayly on this enterprize returned slowly and
pensively to the hall
i had been charmed by the generous spirit
 hawking
shown by this young creature who amidst paiii
and danger had been anxious only to relieve
the distress those around her i was gratified
therefore by the universal concern displayed
by the domestics on our return they
came crowding down the avenue each eager
to render some assistance the butler stood
ready with some curiously delicate cordial
the old housekeeper was provided with half a
dozen nostrums prepared by her own hands
according to the family recipe while her
niece the melting phoebe having no other way
 assisting stood wringing her hands and weeping
aloud
the most material effect that is likely to follow
this accident is a little delay the nuptials
which were close at hand though i
commiserate the impatience the captain on
that account yet i shall not otherwise be sorry
as i shall have a better opportunity studying
the characters here assembled with which i
grow more and more entertained
i cannot but perceive that the squire is quite
hawking 
disconcerted at this unlucky result his hawking
experiment and this unfortunate illustration 
his eulogy on female equitation old christy
too is very waspish having been sorely twitted
by master simon for having let his hawk fly
at carrion as to the falcon in the confusion
occasioned by the fair julia's disaster the bird
was totally forgotten i make no doubt she has
made the best her way back to the hospitable
hall sir watkyn williams wynne and may
very possibly be pluming her wings at this present

the conversation this evening at supper table
took a curious turn on the subject a superstition
formerly very prevalent in this part the
country relative to the present night the year
which is the eve st mark's it was believed
the parson informed us that if any one would
watch in the church porch on this eve for three
successive years from eleven till one o'clock at
night he would see on the third year the shades
 those the parish who were to die in the
st mark's eve 
course the year pass by him into the church
clad in their usual apparel
dismal as such a sight would be he assured
us it was formerly a frequent thing for persons
to make the necessary vigils he had known
more than one instance in his time one old
woman who pretended to have seen this phantom
procession was an object great awe
for the whole year afterwards and caused much
uneasiness and mischief if she shook her head
mysteriously at a person it was like a death warrant
and she had nearly caused the death a
sick person by looking ruefully in at the window

there was also an old man not many years
since a sullen melancholy temperament who
had kept two vigils and began to excite some
talk in the village when fortunately for public
comfort he died shortly after his third watching 
no doubt from a cold which he had taken as the
night was tempestuous it was reported about
the village however that he had seen his own
phantom pass by him into the church
 st mark t s eve
this led to the mention another superstition
 an equally strange and melancholy kind
which however is chiefly confined to wales
it is respecting what are called corpse candles
little wandering fires a pale bluish light that
move about like tapers in the open air and are
supposed to designate the way some corpse is to
go one was seen at lanylar late at night
hovering up and down along the bank the ista
r wish and was watched by the neighbours until
they were tired and went to bed not long
afterwards there came a comely country lass
from montgomeryshire to see her friends who
dwelt on the opposite side the river she
thought to ford the stream at the very place
where the light had been first seen but was
dissuaded on account the height the flood
she walked to and fro along the bank just where
the candle had moved waiting for the subsiding
 the water she at length endeavoured
to cross but the poor girl w r as drowned in the
attempt

there was something mournful in this little
anecdote rural superstition that seemed to
affect all the listeners indeed it is curious to
remark how completely a conversation the
kind will absorb the attention a circle and
sober down its gayety however boisterous by
degrees i noticed that every one was leaning
forward over the table with their eyes fixed
upon the parson and at the mention corpse
candles which had been seen about the chamber
 a young lady who died on the eve 
her wedding day lady lillycraft turned pale
i have witnessed the introduction stories 
the kind into various evening circles they were
often commenced in jest and listened to with
smiles but i never knew the most gay or the
most enlightened audiences that were not if
the conversation continued for any length time
completely and solemnly interested in it there
is i believe a degree superstition lurking in
every mind and i doubt if any one can thoroughly
examine all his secret notions and impulses
without detecting it hidden perhaps even from
 st mark's eve
himself it seems in fact to be a part our
nature like instinct animals acting independently
 our reason it is often found existing
in lofty natures especially those that are poetical
and aspiring a great and extraordinary poet
 our day whose life and writings evince a mind
subject to powerful exaltation is said to believe
in omens and secret intimations caesar it is
well known was greatly under the influence 
such belief and napoleon had his good and evil
days and his presiding star
i am now alone in my chamber but these
themes have taken such hold my imagination
that i cannot sleep the room in which i sit is
just fitted to foster such a state mind the
walls are hung with tapestry the figures which
are faded and look like unsubstantial shapes melting
away from sight over the fireplace is the
portrait a lady who according to the housekeeper's
tradition pined to death for the loss 
her lover in the battle blenheim she has a
most pale and plaintive countenance and seems to
fix her eyes mournfully upon me the family
st mark's eve 
have long since retired i have heard their steps
die away and the distant doors clap to after them
the murmur voices and the peal remote
laughter no longer reach the ear the clock
from the church in which so many the former
inhabitants this house lie buried has chimed
the awful hour midnight
i have sat by the window and mused upon
the dusky landscape watching the lights disappearing
one by one from the distant village and
the moon rising in her silent majesty and leading
up all the silver pomp heaven as i have
gazed upon these quiet groves and shadowy
lawns silvered over and imperfectly lighted by
streaks dewy moonshine my mind has been
crowded by thick coming fancies concerning
those spiritual beings which
walk the earth
unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
are there indeed such beings is this space between
us and the deity filled up by innumerable
orders spiritual beings forming the same gras
st mark's eve
relations between the human soul and divine perfection
that we see prevailing from humanity
down to the meanest insect it is a sublime and
beautiful doctrine inculcated by the early fathers
that there are guardian angels appointed to watch
over cities and nations to take care the welfare
 good men and to guard and guide the
steps helpless infancy nothing says st
jerome gives us a greater idea the dignity
 our souls than that god has given each us
at the moment our birth an angel to have care
 it
even the doctrine departed spirits returning
to visit the scenes and beings which were dear
to them during the bodies existence though it
has been debased by the absurd superstitions 
the vulgar in itself is awfully solemn and sublime

however lightly it may be ridiculed yet the
attention involuntarily yielded to it whenever it
is made the subject serious discussion its prevalence
in all ages and countries and even
among newly discovered nations that have had
st mark's eve 
no previous interchange thought with other
parts the world prove it to be one those
mysterious and almost instinctive beliefs to
which if left to ourselves we should naturally
incline
in spite all the pride reason and philosophy
a vague doubt will still lurk in the mind 
and perhaps will never be perfectly eradicated
as it is a matter that does not admit positive
demonstration who yet has been able to comprehend
and describe the nature the soul its
mysterious connexion with the body or in
what part the frame it is situated we
know merely that it does exist but whence it
came and when it entered into us and how it
is retained and where it is seated and how it
operates are all matters mere speculation and
contradictory theories if then we are thus ignorant
 this spiritual essence even while it
forms a part ourselves and is continually present
to our consciousness how can we pretend
to ascertain or to deny its powers and operations
when released from its fleshy prison house 
vol i 
 st mark's eve
every thing connected with our spiritual nature
is full doubt and difficulty we are fearfully
and wonderfully made we are surrounded
by mysteries and we are mysteries even to ourselves
it is more the manner in which this superstition
has been degraded than its intrinsic
absurdity that has brought it into contempt
raise it above the frivolous purposes to which it
has been applied strip it the gloom and horror
with which it has been enveloped and there
is none the whole circle visionary creeds
that could more delightfully elevate the imagination
or more tenderly affect the heart it would
become a sovereign comfort at the bed death
soothing the bitter tear wrung from us by the
agony our mortal separation what could
be more consoling than the idea that the souls 
those we once loved were permitted to return
and watch over our welfare that affectionate
and guardian spirits sat by our pillows when we
slept keeping a vigil over our most helpless
hours that beauty and innocence which had
languished into the tomb yet smiled unseen
st mark's eve 
around us revealing themselves in those blest
dreams wherein we live over again the hours 
past endearments a belief this kind would
i should think be a new incentive to virtue rendering
us circumspect even in our most secret
moments from the idea that those we once
loved and honoured were invisible witnesses 
all our actions
it would take away too from that loneliness
and destitution which we are apt to feel
more and more as we get on in our pilgrimage
through the wilderness this world and find
that those who set forward with us lovingly
and cheerily on the journey have one by one
dropped away from our side place the superstition
in this light and i confess i should like to
be a believer in it i see nothing in it that is incompatible
with the tender and merciful nature
 our religion nor revolting to the wishes and
affections the heart
there are departed beings that i have loved
as i never again shall love in this world that
have loved me as i never again shall be loved
 st mark's eve
if such beings do ever retain in their blessed
spheres the attachments which they felt on
earth if they take an interest in the poor concerns
 transient mortality and are permitted
to hold communion with those whom they
have loved on earth i feel as if now at this
deep hour night in this silence and solitude
i could receive their visitation with the most
solemn but unalloyed delight
in truth such visitations would be too happy
for this world they would take away from
the bounds and barriers that hem us in and keep
us from each other our existence is doomed
to be made up transient embraces and long
separations the most intimate friendship 
what brief and scattered portions time does
it consist we take each other by the hand
and we exchange a few words and looks 
kindness and we rejoice together for a few short
moments and then days months years intervene
and we have no intercourse with each
other or if we dwell together for a season
the grave soon closes its gates and cuts off all
st mark's eve 
further communion and our spirits must remain
in separation and widowhood until they
meet again in that more perfect state being
where soul shall dwell with soul and there
shall be no such thing as death or absence or
any other interruption our union

i have mentioned some peculiarities the
squire in the education his sons but i would
not have it thought that his instructions were
directed chiefly to their personal accomplishments
he took great pains also to form their
minds and to inculcate what he calls good old
english principles such as are laid down in the
writings pelham and his contemporaries
there is one author whom he cannot speak
without indignation which is chesterfield heavers
that he did much for a time to injure the
true national character and to introduce instead
 open manly sincerity a hollow perfidious
true gentlemen 
courtliness his maxims he affirms were
calculated to chill the delightful enthusiasm 
youth to make them ashamed that romance
which is the dawn generous manhood and to
impart to them a cold polish and a premature
worldliness
many lord chesterfield's maxims would
make a young man a mere man pleasure but
an english gentleman should not be a mere man
 pleasure he has no right to such selfish
indulgence his ease his leisure his opulence
are debts due to his country he should be a
man at all points simple frank and courteous 
intelligent accomplished and informed upright y
intrepid and disinterested one that can mingle
among freemen that can cope with statesmen 
that can champion his country and its rights
either at home or abroad
in a country like england where there is
such free and unbounded scope for the exertion
 intellect and where opinion and example
have such weight with the people every gentleman
 fortune and leisure should feel himself
 true gentlemen
bound to employ himself in some way towards
promoting the prosperity or glory the nation

in a country where intellect and action are
trammelled and restrained men rank and fortune
may become idlers and triflers with impunity 
but an english coxcomb is inexcusable and this
perhaps is the reason why he is the most offensive
and insupportable coxcomb in the world
the squire as frank bracebridge informs me
would often hold forth in this manner to his sons
when they were about leaving the paternal roof
one to travel abroad one to go to the army and
one to the university he used to have them
with him in the library which is hung with the
portraits sydney surrey raleigh what and
others
look at those models true english gentlemen
my sons he would say with enthusiasm
those were men that w r reached the graces 
the most delicate and refined taste around the
hardy virtues the soldier that mingled
what was gentle and gracious with what was
true gentlemen 
hardy and manly that possessed the true chivalry
 spirit which is the exalted essence manhood
they are the lights by which the youth
 this country should array themselves they
were the patterns and the idols their country
at home they were the illustrators its dignity
abroad surrey says camden was the first
nobleman that illustrated his high birth with the
beauty learning he was acknowledged to
be the gallants man the politest lover and the
completest gentleman his time and as to
what his friend surrey most amiably testifies
 him that his person was majestic and beautiful
his visage stern and mild that he sang
and played the lute with remarkable sweetness 
spoke the foreign languages with grace and
fluency and possessed an inexhaustible fund 
wit and see what a high commendation is
passed upon these illustrious friends
they were the two chieftains who having
travelled into italy and there tasted the sweet
and stately measures and style italian poetry
greatly polished our rude and homely manner
vol i 
true gentlemen
 vulgar poetry from what it had been before
and therefore may be justly called the reformers
 our english poetry and style and sir philip
sydney who has left us such monuments 
elegant thought and generous sentiment and
who illustrated his chivalrous spirit so gloriously
in the field and sir walter raleigh
the elegant courtier the intrepid soldier the
enterprizing discoverer the enlightened philosopher
the magnanimous martyr these are
the men for english gentlemen to study chesterfield
with his cold and courtly maxims
would have chilled and impoverished such spirits
he would have blighted all the budding
romance their temperaments sydney would
never have written his arcadia nor surrey
have challenged the world in vindication the
beauties his geraldine these are the
men my sons the squire will continue u that
show to what our national character may be
exalted when its strong and powerful qualities
are duly wrought up and refined the solidtrue
gentlemen 
est bodies are capable the highest polish
and there is no character that may be wrought
to a more exquisite and unsullied brightness
than that the true english gentleman

when guy was about to depart for the army
the squire again took him aside and gave him a
long exhortation he warned him against that
affectation cool blooded indifference which he
was told was prevalent among the young british
officers among whom it was a study to sink
the soldier in the mere man fashion a soldier
said he without pride and enthusiasm in
his profession is a mere sanguinary hireling
nothing distinguishes him from the mercenary
bravo but a spirit patriotism or a thirst for
glory it is the fashion nowadays my son
said he to laugh at the spirit chivalry 
when that spirit is really extinct the profession
 the soldier becomes a mere trade blood
he then set before him the conduct edward
the black prince who is his mirror chivalry 
valiant generous affable humane gallant in
 true gentlemen
the field but when he came to dwell on his
courtesy towards his prisoner the king france 
how he received him into his tent rather as a conqueror
than as a captive attended on him at table
like one his retinue rode uncovered beside
him on his entry into london mounted on a
common palfrey while his prisoner was mounted
in state on a white steed stately beauty the
tears enthusiasm stood in the old gentleman's
eyes
finally on taking leave the good squire put
in his son's hands as a manual one his favourite
old volumes the life the chevalier bayard
by godefroy on a blank page which he had
written an extract from the morte arthur
containing the eulogy sir actor over the body
 sir lancelot the lake which the squire
considers as comprising the excellencies a true
soldier
ah sir launcelot thou wert head all
christian knights now there holiest thou wert
never matched none earthly knight's hands
and thou wert the furthest knight that ever bare
true gentlemen 
shield and thou wert the truest friend to thy
lover that ever bestrode horse and thou wert the
truest lover a simple man that ever loved woman
 and thou wert the kindest man that ever
strook with sword and thou wert the goodliest
person that ever came among the presse 
knights and thou wert the meekest man and the
gentlest that ever late in hall among ladies 
and thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortal
foe that ever put spare in rest

as i was walking one evening with the oxon
man master simon and the general in a meadow
not far from the village we heard the sound
 a fiddle rudely played and looking in the
direction whence it came we saw a thread
 smoke curling up from among the trees the
sound music is always attractive for wherever
there is music there is good humour or goodwill
we passed along a foot path and had a
peep through a break in the hedge at the musician
and his party when the oxonian gave us a
wink and told us that if we would follow him
we should have some sport t
fortune telling 
ft proved to be a gipsy encampment consisting
 three or four little cabins or tents made 
blankets and sail cloth spread over hoops that
were stuck in the ground it was on one side
 a green lane close under a hawthorn hedge
with a broad beech tree spreading above it a
small rill tinkled along close by through the
fresh sward that looked like a carpet
a tea kettle was hanging by a crooked piece
 iron over a fire made from dry sticks and
leaves and two old gipsies in red cloaks sat
crouched on the grass gossipping over an evening
cup tea for these creatures though they
live in the open air have their ideas fireside
comforts there were two or three children
sleeping on the straw with which the tents were
littered a couple donkeys were grazing in
the lane and a thievish looking dog was lying
before the fire some the younger gipsies
were dancing to the music a fiddle played
by a tall slender stripling in an old frock coat
with a peacock's feather stuck in his hatband
as we approached a gipsy girl with a pair 
 fortune telling
fine roguish eyes came up and as usual offered
to tell our fortunes i could not but admire
a certain degree slattern elegance about the
baggage her long black silken hair was curiously
plaited in numerous small braids and
negligently put up in a picturesque style that a
painter might have been proud to have devised
her dress was figured chintz rather ragged
and not over clean but a variety most
harmonious and agreeable colours for these
beings have a singularly fine eye for colours
her straw hat was in her hand and a red cloak
thrown over one arm
the oxonian offered at once to have his fortune
told and the girl began with the usual volubility
 her race but he drew her on one
side near the hedge as he said he had no idea 
having his secrets overheard i saw he was
talking to her instead she to him and by his
glancing toward us now and then that he was
giving the baggage some private hints
when they returned to us he assumed a very
serious air zounds said he it's very asfortune
telling 
astonishing how these creatures come by their
knowledge this girl has told me some things
that i thought no one knew but myself
the girl now assailed the general come
your honour said she i see by your face
you're a lucky man but you're not happy in
your mind you're not indeed sir but have a
good heart and give me a good piece silver
and i'll tell you a nice fortune
the general had received all her approaches
with a banter and had suffered her to get hold
 his hand but at the mention the piece 
silver he hemmed looked grave and turning tous
asked if we had not better continue our
walk come my master said the girl archly
you'd not be in such a hurry if you knew all
that i could tell you about a fair lady that has a
notion for you come sir old love burns strong
there's many a one comes to see weddings that
go away brides themselves here the girl whispered
something in a low voice at which the
general coloured up was a little fluttered and
suffered himself to be drawn aside under the

hedge where he appeared to listen to her with
great earnestness and at the paid her half a
crown with the air a man that has got the
worth his money
the girl next made her attack upon master
simon who however was too old a bird to be
caught knowing that it would in an attack
upon his purse about which he is a little sensitive
as he has a great notion however 
being considered a royster he chucked her under
the chin played her off with rather broad jokes
and put on something the rakehelly air that
we see now and then assumed on the stage by
the sadboy gentleman the old school ah
your honour said the girl with a malicious
leer you were not in such a tantrum last year
when i told you about the widow you know
who but if you had taken a friend's advice you'd
never have come away from doncaster races
with a flea in your ear
there was a secret sting in this speech that
seemed quite to disconcert master simon he
jerked away his hand in a pet smacked his
fortune telling
whip whistled to his dogs and intimated that
it was high time to go home the girl however
was determined not to lose her harvest
she made an attack upon me and as i have a
weakness spirit where there is a pretty face
concerned she soon wheedled me out my
money and in return read me a fortune which
if it prove true and i am determined to believe
it will make me one the luckiest men in the
chronicles cupid
i saw that the oxonian was at the bottom 
all this oracular mystery and was disposed to
amuse himself with the general whose tender
approaches to the widow have attracted the
notice the wag i was a little curious however
to know the meaning the dark hints
which had so suddenly disconcerted master simon
 and took occasion to fall in the rear with
the oxonian on our way home when he laughed
heartily at my questions and gave me ample information
on the subject
the truth the matter is that master simon
has met with a sad rebuff since my christfortune
telling
mas visit to the hall he used at that time to
be joked about a widow a fine dashing woman
as he privately informed me i had supposed the
pleasure he betrayed on these occasions resulted
from the usual fondness old bachelors for
being teased about getting married and about
flirting and being fickle and false hearted i
am assured however that master simon had
really persuaded himself the widow had a
kindness for him in consequence which he
had been at some extraordinary expense in new
clothes and had actually got frank bracebridge
to order him a coat from stilts he began to
throw out hints about the importance a man's
settling himself in life before he grew old he
would look grave whenever the widow and
matrimony were mentioned in the same sentence
 and privately asked the opinion 
the squire and parson about the prudence
 marrying a widow with a rich jointure but
who had several children
an important member a great family connexion
cannot harp much upon the theme 
fortune telling 
matrimony without its taking wind and it soon
got buzzed about that mr simon bracebridge
was actually gone to doncaster races with a
new horse but that he meant to return in a
curricle with a lady by his side master simon
did indeed go to the races and that with a new
horse and the dashing widow did make her
appearance in her curricle but it was unfortunately
driven by a strapping young irish dragoon
 with whom even master simon's selfcom
placenta would not allow him to venture into
competition and to whom she was married shortly
after
it was a matter sore chagrin to master simon
for several months having never before
been so fully committed the dullest head in
the family had a joke upon him and there is no
one that likes less to be bantered than an absolute
joker
he took refuge for a time at old lady lillycraft's
until the matter should blow over and
occupied himself by overlooking her accounts
regulating the village choir and teaching a bullfinch
to whistle god save the king
 fortune telling
he has now pretty nearly recovered from the
mortification holds up his head and laughs as
much as any one affects to pity married men
and is particularly facetious about widows when
lady lillycraft is not by his only time 
trial is when the general gets hold him who
is infinitely heavy and persevering in his waggery
and will interweave a dull joke through
the various topics a whole dinner time master
simon often parries these attacks by a stanza
from his old work cupid's solicitor for
love
tis in vain to woo a widow over long
in once or twice her mind you may perceive 
widows are subtle be they old or young
and by their wiles young men they will deceive

come do not weep my girl
forget him pretty pensiveness there will
come others every day as good as he
sir j suckling
the approach a wedding in a family is
always an event great importance but particularly
so in a household like this in a retired
part the country master simon who is a
pervading spirit and through means the butler
and housekeeper knows every thing that
goes forward tells me that the maid servants are
continually trying their fortunes and that the
servants hall has late been quite a scene 
incantation it is amusing to notice how the
oddities the head a family flow down
through all the branches the squire in the
indulgence his love every thing that
 love charms
smacks old times has held so many grave
conversations with the parson at table about
popular superstitions and traditional rites that
they have been carried from the parlour to the
kitchen by the listening domestics and being
apparently sanctioned by such highauthority
the whole house has become infected by them
the servants are all versed in the common
modes trying luck and the charms to ensure
constancy they read their fortunes by drawing
strokes in the ashes or by repeating a form
 words and looking in a pail water st
mark's eve i am told was a busy time with
them being an appointed night for certain mystic
ceremonies several them sowed hemp
seed to be reaped by their true lovers they
even ventured upon the solemn and fearful preparation
 the dumb cake this must be done
fasting and in silence the ingredients are
handed down in traditional form an eggshell
full salt an egg shell full malt and
an egg shell full barley meal when the
cake is ready it is put upon a pan over the fire
love charms 
and the future husband will appear turn the
cake and retire but if a word is spoken or a
fast is broken during this awful ceremony
there is no knowing what horrible consequences
would ensue the experiments in the present
instance came to no result they that sowed the
hemp seed forgot the magic rhyme that they
were to pronounce so the true lover never appeared
 and as to the dumb cake what between
the awful stillness they had to keep and the
awfulness the midnight hour their hearts
failed them when they had put the cake on the
pan and seized with a sudden panic they all
ran out the room and did not return until
morning when they found the mystic cake
burnt to a cinder
the most persevering at these spells however
is phoebe wilkins the housekeeper's niece
as she is a kind privileged personage and
rather idle she has more time to occupy herself
with these matters she has always had her
head full love and matrimony she knows
the dream by heart and is quite an oracle

among the little girls the family who always
come to her to interpret their dreams in the
mornings
during the present gayety the house however
the poor girl has gone about with a face
full trouble and to use the housekeeper's
words has fallen into a sad hysterics way
lately it seems that she was born and brought
up in the village where her father was parish
clerk and she was an early playmate and
sweetheart young jack tibbets since she
has come to live at the hall however her head
has been a little turned being very pretty
and naturally genteel she has been much noticed
and indulged and being the housekeeper's
niece she has held an equivocal station between
a servant and a companion she has learned
something fashions and notions among the
young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis
 insomuch that her finery at church
on sundays has given mortal offence to her former
intimates in the village this has occasioned
the misrepresentations which have away
charms 
kened the implacable family pride dame
tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a
spice coquetry in her disposition showed it
on one or two occasions to her lover which produced
a downright quarrel and jack being very
proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back
upon her for several successive sundays
the poor girl is full sorrow and repentance
and would fain make up with her lover 
but he feels his security and stands aloof in
this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother 
who is continually reminding him what he owes
to his family for this same family pride seems
doomed to be the eternal bane lovers as 
hate to see a pretty face in trouble i have felt
quite concerned for poor phoebe ever since i
have heard her story am told that the coolness
 young ready money is very heavy at
her heart instead singing about the house
as formerly she goes about pale and sighing
and is very apt to break into tears when her
companions are full merriment
mrs hannah the vestal gentlewoman my
 love charms
lady lillycraft has had long talks with phoebe
and has endeavoured to squeeze some her
own verjuice into the other one's milky nature
she speaks with contempt and abhorrence the
whole sex and advises phoebe to despise all the
men as she does but phoebe's loving temper
is not to be curdled there is no such thing as
hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole
composition her only thoughts are how to
conciliate and reclaim her lover
the spells and love charms which are matters
 sport to the other domestics are serious concerns
with this lovestricken lass she is continually
trying her fortune in a variety ways
i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six
wednesdays and three fridays successively
having understood that it was a sovereign charm
to ensure being married to one's liking within
the year she carries about also a lock her
sweetheart's hair and a ribband he once gave
her being a mode producing constancy in
love she even went so far as to try her fortune
by the moon which has always had much to do
love charms
with lovers dreams and fancies for this purpose
she went out in the night the full moon
knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the
old traditional rhyme 
all hail to thee moon all hail to thee
i pray thee good moon now show to me
the youth who my future husband shall be
when she came back to the house she was faint
and pale and went immediately to bed the next
morning she told her companions that she had
seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow
which she was sure was young tibbets at any
rate she had dreamt him all night both 
which she was assured were most happy signs
it has since turned out that the person in the
meadow was old christy the huntsman who
was walking his nightly rounds with the great
stag hound so that phoebe's faith in the charm
is completely shaken

yesterday the fair julia made her first appearance
down stairs since her accident and the
sight her spread a universal cheerfulness
through die household she was extremely
pale however and could not walk without pain
and difficulty she was assisted therefore to a
sopha in the library which is pleasant and retired
looking out among trees and so quiet that the
little birds came hopping upon the windows and
peering curiously into the apartment
here several the family gathered round and
devised ways to amuse her and make the day pass
pleasantly lady lillycraft lamented the want
 some new novel to while away the time and
was almost in a pet because the author 
waverley had not produced a work for the last
three months
there was a motion made to call on the parson

for some his old legends or ghost stories but

at length the captain bethought himself and
said he believed he had a manuscript tale lying
in one corner his campaigning trunk which if
he could find and the company were desirous
he would read to them the offer was eagerly
accepted he retired and soon returned with a
roll blotted manuscript in a very gentlemanlike
but nearly illegible hand and a great part
written on cartridge paper
it is one the scribbling said he u 
my poor friend charles lightly the dragoons
he was a curious romantic studious
fanciful fellow the favourite and often the
unconscious butt his fellow officers who entertained
themselves with his eccentricities he
 the library
was in some the hardest service on the peninsula
and distinguished himself by his gallantry
when the intervals duty permitted he
was fond roving about the country visiting
noted places and was extremely curious about
moorish ruins when at his quarters he was a
great scribbler and passed much his leisure
with his pen in his hand
as i was a much younger officer and a
very young man he took me in a manner
under his care and we became close friends he
used often to read his writings to me having a
great confidence in my taste for i always
praised them poor fellow he was shot
down close by me at waterloo we lay wounded
together for some time during a hard contest
that took place near at hand as i was least
hurt i tried to relieve him and to stanch the
blood which flowed from a wound in his breast
he lay with his head in my lap and looked up
thankfully in my face but shook his head faintly
and made a sign that it was all over with
him and indeed he died a few minutes afterthe
library 
wards just as our men had repulsed the enemy
and came to our relief i have his favourite
dog and his pistols to this day and several 
his manuscripts which he gave to me at different
times the one i am now going to read
is a tale which he told me he wrote in spain
during the time that he lay ill a wound received
at salamanca
we now arranged ourselves to hear the story
the captain seated himself on the sofa beside
the fair julia who i had noticed to be somewhat
affected by the picture he had carelessly
drawn wounds and dangers in a field battle
she now leaned her arm fondly on his
shoulder and her eye glistened as it rested on
the manuscript the poor literary dragoon
lady lillycraft had a deep wellcushioned elbow
chair wheeled up for her accommodation
her dogs were nestled on soft mats at her feet 
and the gallant general took his station in an
arm chair at her side and toyed with her ladyship's

once upon a time in the ancient city granada
there sojourned a young student salamanca
 the name antonio de castro he
was pursuing a course reading in the library
 the university and at the same time indulging
his curiosity by examining those remains 
moorish magnificence for which granada is renowned
while occupied in his studies he frequently
noticed an old man singular appearance
who was likewise a visiter at the library
 

 the student salamanca
he was lean and withered apparently more from
study than age his eyes though bright and
visionary were sunk in his head and thrown into
shade by overhanging eyebrows his dress was
always the same a black doublet a short
black cloak very rusty and threadbare red
stockings a small ruff and a large overshadowing
hat
his appetite for knowledge seemed insatiable
he would pass whole days in the library absorbed
in study consulting a multiplicity authors
 as though he were pursuing some interesting
subject through all its ramifications so
that in general when evening came he was
almost buried among books and manuscripts
the curiosity antonio was excited and hei
inquired the attendants concerning the stranger
no one could give him any information
excepting that he had been for some time past a
casual frequenter the library that his reading
lay chiefly among works treating the occult
sciences and that he was particularly curious
in his inquiries after arabian manuscripts they
added that he never held communication with
o
the student salamanca 
any one excepting to ask for particular works 
that after a fit studious application he would
disappear for several days and even weeks and
when he revisited the library he would look more
withered and haggard than ever
the student felt interested by this account 
he was leading rather a desultory life and had
all that capricious curiosity which springs up in
idleness he determined to make himself acquainted
with this bookworm and find out who
and what he was
the next time that he saw the old man at the
library he commenced his approaches by requesting
permission to peruse one the volumes with
which the unknown appeared to have finished
the latter merely bowed his head in token 
assent after pretending to look through the
volume with great attention he returned it with
many acknowledgments the stranger made
no reply
may i ask senor said antonio with some
hesitation may i ask what you are searching
after in all these books 
 the student salamanca
the old man raised his head with an expression
 surprise at having his studies interrupted
for the first time arid by so intrusive a question
he surveyed the student with a side glance from
head to foot wisdom my son said he calmly
 and the search requires every moment 
my attention he then cast his eyes upon his
 and resumed his studies but father
said antonio cannot you spare a moment to
point out the road to others it is to experienced
travellers like you that we strangers in the paths
 knowledge must look for directions on our
journey
the stranger looked disturbed i have not
time enough my son to learn said he much
less to teach i am ignorant myself the path
 true knowledge how then can i show it to
others 
well but father 
senor said the old man mildly but earnestly
you must see that i have but few steps
more to the grave in that short space have i
to accomplish the whole business my existence
the student salamanca 
i have no time for words every word is as one
grain sand my glass wasted suffer me to
be alone
there was no replying to so complete a closing
 the door intimacy the student found
himself calmly but totally repulsed though
curious and inquisitive yet he was naturally
modest and on after thoughts he blushed at his
own intrusion his mind soon became occupied
by other objects he passed several days wandering
among the mouldering piles moorish
architecture those melancholy monuments an
elegant and voluptuous people he paced the
deserted halls the alhambra the paradise 
the moorish kings he visited the great court
 the lions famous for the perfidious massacre
 the gallant abencerrages he gazed with
admiration at its mosaic cupolas gorgeously
painted in gold and azure its basins marble 
its alabaster vase supported by lions and storied
with inscriptions
his imagination kindled as he wandered
among these scenes they were calculated to
awaken all the enthusiasm a youthful mind
 the student salamanca
most the halls have anciently been beautified
by fountains the fine taste the arabs delighted
in the sparkling purity and reviving
freshness water and they erected as it were
altars on every side to that delicate element
poetry mingles with architecture in the al alhambra
it breathes along the very walls whereever
antonio turned his eye he beheld inscriptions
in arabic wherein the perpetuity moorish
power and splendour within these walls was
confidently predicted alas how had the prophecy
been falsified many the basins where
the fountains had once thrown up their sparkling
showers were dry and dusty some the
palaces were turned into gloomy convents and
the barefoot monk paced through those courts
which had once glittered with the array and
echoed to the music moorish chivalry
in the course his rambles the student more
than once encountered the old man the library
he was always alone and so full 
thought as not to notice any one about him
he appeared to be intent upon studying those
the student salamanca 
half buried inscriptions which are found here
and there among the moorish ruins and seem
to murmur from the earth the tale former
greatness the greater part these have since
been translated but they were supposed by
many at the time to contain symbolical revelations
and golden maxims the arabian sages
and astrologers
as antonio saw the stranger apparently decy
peering these inscriptions he felt an eager longing
to make his acquaintance and to participate
in his curious researches but the repulse he had
met with at the library deterred him from making
any farther advances
he had directed his steps one evening to the
sacred mount which overlooks the beautiful valley
watered by the darro the fertile plain the
vega and all that rich diversity vale and
mountain that surrounds granada with an earthly
paradise it was twilight when he found himself
at the place where at the present day are
situated the chapels known by the name the
sacred furnaces they are so called from
vol i 
 the student salamanca
grottoes in which some the primitive saints
are said to have been burnt at the time antonio's
visit the place was an object much
curiosity in an excavation these grottoes
several manuscripts had recently been discovered
engraved on plates lead they were written
in the arabian language excepting one which
was in unknown characters the pope had
issued a bull forbidding any one under pain 
excommunication to speak these manuscripts
the prohibition had only excited the greater
curiosity and many reports were whispered
about that these manuscripts contained treasures
 dark and forbidden knowledge
as antonio was examining the place from
whence these mysterious manuscripts had been
drawn he again observed the old man the
library wandering among the ruins his curiosity
was now fully awakened the time and
place served to stimulate it he resolved to watch
this unknown groper after secret and forgotten
lore and to trace him to his habitation there
was something like adventure in the thing that
the student salamanca 
charmed his romantic disposition he followed
the stranger therefore at a little distance at
first cautiously but he soon observed him to be
so wrapped in his own thoughts as to take little
heed external objects they passed along
the skirts the mountain and then by the shady
banks the darro they pursued their way
for some distance from granada along a lonely
road that led among the hills the gloom 
evening was gathering and it was quite dark
when the stranger stopped at the portal a solitary
mansion
it appeared to be a mere wing or ruined fragment
 what had once been a pile some consequence
the walls were great thickness
the windows narrow and generally secured by
iron bars the door was planks studded
with iron spikes and had been great strength
though at present it was much decayed atone
 the mansion was a ruinous tower in
the moorish style architecture the edifice
had probably been a country retreat or castle 
pleasure during the occupation granada by
 the student salamanca
the moors and rendered sufficiently strong to
withstand any casual assault in those warlike
times
the old man knocked at the portal a light appeared
at a small window just above it and a
female head looked out it might have served
as a model for one raphael's saints the
hair was beautifully braided and gathered in a
silken net and the complexion as well as could
be judged from the light was that soft rich brunette
so becoming in southern beauty
it is i my child said the old man the
face instantly disappeared and soon after a
wicket door in the large portal opened antonio
who had ventured near to the building caught a
transient sight a delicate female form a pair
 fine black eyes darted a look surprise at
seeing a stranger hovering near and the door
was precipitately closed
there was something in this sudden gleam 
beauty that wonderfully struck the imagination
 the student it was like a brilliant flashing
from its dark casket he sauntered about re
tee student salamanca 
harding the gloomy pile with increasing interest
a few simple wild notes from among some rocks
and trees at a little distance attracted his attention
he found there a group giants a
vagabond gipsy race that at that time abounded
in spain and lived in hovels and caves the
hills about the neighbourhood granada some
were busy about a fire others were listening to
the uncouth music which one their companions
seated on a ledge the rock was making
with a split reed
antonio endeavoured to obtain some information
 them concerning the old building and its
inhabitants
the one who appeared to be their spokesman
was a gaunt fellow with a subtle gait a whispering
voice and a sinister roll the eye he
shrugged his shoulders on the student's inquiries
and said that all was not right in that building
an old man inhabited it whom nobody knew
and whose family appeared to be only his daughter
and a female servant he and his companions
he added lived up among the neighbouring
 the student salamanca
hills and as they had been about at night they
had often seen strange lights and heard strange
sounds from the tower some the country
people who worked in the vineyards among the
hills believed the old man to be one that dealt in
the black art and were not over fond passing
near the tower at night but for our parts
said the gitano we are not a people that trouble
ourselves much with fears that kind
the student endeavoured to gain more precise
information but they had none to furnish
him they began to be solicitous for a compensation
for what they had already imparted and
recollecting the loneliness the place and the
vagabond character his companions he was
glad to give them a gratuity and to hasten homewards

he sat down to his studies but his brain was
too full what he had seen and heard his eye
was upon the page but his fancy still returned to
the tower and he was continually picturing the
little window with the beautiful head peeping
out or the door half open and the nymphlike
form within
the student salamanca 
he retired to bed but the same objects
haunted his dreams he was young and susceptible
 and the excited state his feelings from
wandering among the abodes departed grace
and gallantry had predisposed him for a sudden
impression from female beauty
the next morning he strolled again in the direction
 the tower it was still more forlorn
by the broad glare day than in the gloom 
evening the walls were crumbling and weeds
and moss were growing in every crevice it
had the look a prison rather than a dwelling
house in one angle however he remarked a
window which seemed an exception to the surrounding
squalidness there w z as a curtain
drawn within it and flowers standing on the
window stone whilst he was looking at it the
curtain was partially withdrawn and a delicate
white arm the most beautiful roundness was
put forth to water the flowers
the student made a noise to attract the attention
 the fair florist he succeeded the
curtain was farther drawn and he had a glance
 the student salamanca
 the same face he had seen the evening before
 it was but a mere glance the curtain
again fell and the casement closed all this
was calculated to excite the feelings a romantic
youth had he seen the unknown under
other circumstances it is probable that he would
not have been struck with her beauty but this
appearance being shut up and kept apart
gave her the value a treasured gem he passed
and repassed before the house several times
in the course the day but saw nothing more
he was there again in the evening the whole
aspect the house was dreary the narrow
windows emitted no rays cheerful light to indicate
that there was social life within antonio
listened at the portal but no sound voices
reached his ear just then he heard the clapping
to a distant door and fearing to be detected
in the unworthy act eavesdropping
he precipitately drew off to the opposite side 
the road and stood in the shadow a ruined
archway
he now remarked a light from a window in
the student salamanca 
the tower it was fitful and changeable commonly
feeble and yellowish as if from a lamp
with an occasional glare some vivid metallic
colour followed by a dusky glow a column
 dense smoke would now and then rise in the
air and hang like a canopy over the tower
there was altogether such a loneliness and
seeming mystery about the building and its inhabitants
that antonio was half inclined to indulge
the country people's notions and to fancy it the
den some powerful sorcerer and the fair damsel
he had seen some spellbound beauty
after some time had elapsed a light appeared
in the window where he had seen the beautiful
arm the curtain was down but it was so
thin that he could perceive the shadow someone
passing and repassing between it and the
light he fancied that he could distinguish
that the form was delicate and from the alacrity
 its movements it was evidently youthful
he had not a doubt but this was the bed chamber
 his beautiful unknown
presently he heard the sound a guitar and
vol i 
 the student salamanca
a female voice singing he drew near cautiously
and listened it was a plaintive moorish
ballad and he recognized in it the lamentations
 one the abencerrages on leaving the
walls lovely granada it was full passion
ad tenderness it spoke the delights
 early life the hours love it had enjoyed
on the banks the darro and among the
blissful abodes the alhambra it bewailed
the fallen honours the abencerrages and imprecated
vengeance on their oppressors antonio
was affected by the music it singularly
coincided with the place it was like the voice
 past times echoed in the present and breathing
among the monuments its departed glories

the voice ceased after a time the light disappeared
and all was still she sleeps said
antonio fondly he lingered about the building
with the devotion with which a lover lingers
about the bower sleeping beauty the rising
moon threw its silver beams on the gray
walls and glittered on the casement the
the student salamanca 
late gloomy landscape gradually became flooded
with its radiance finding therefore that he
could no longer move about in obscurity and
fearful that his loitering might be observed he
reluctantly retired
the curiosity which had at first drawn the
young man to the tower was now seconded by
feelings a more romantic kind his studies
were almost entirely abandoned he maintained
a kind blockade the old mansion he
would take a with him and pass a great
part the day under the trees in its vicinity 
keeping a vigilant eye upon it and endeavouring
to ascertain what were the walks his mysterious
charmer he found however that she
never went out except to mass when she was
accompanied by her father he waited at the
door the church and offered her the holy
water in the hopes touching her hand a little
office gallantry common in catholic countries
she however modestly declined without raising
her eyes to see who made the offer and always
took it herself from the font she was attentive
 the student salamanca
in her devotion her eyes were never taken from
the altar or the priest and on returning home
her countenance was almost entirely concealed
by her mantilla
antonio had now carried on the pursuit for
several days and was hourly getting more and
more interested in the pursuit but never a step
nearer to the game his lurking about the
house had probably been noticed for he no longer
saw the fair face at the window nor the white
arm put forth to water the flowers
his only consolation was to repair nightly to
his post observation listen to her warbling
and if by chance he could catch a sight her
shadow passing and repassing before the window
he thought himself most fortunate
as he was indulging in one these evening
vigils which were complete revels the imagination
the sound approaching footsteps made
him withdraw into the deep shadow the ruined
archway opposite to the tower a cavalier
approached wrapped in a large spanish cloak
he paused under the window the tower
the student op salamanca 
after a little while began a serenade accompanied
by his guitar in the usual style spanish
gallantry his voice was rich and manly he
touched the instrument with skill and sang
with amorous and impassioned eloquence
the plume his hat was buckled by jewels
that sparkled in the moon beams and as he
played on the guitar his cloak falling off from
one shoulder showed him to be richly dressed
it was evident that he was a person rank
the idea now flashed across antonio's mind
that the affections his unknown beauty might
be engaged she was young and doubtless susceptible
and it was not in the nature spanish
females to be deaf and insensible to music and
admiration the surmise brought with it a
feeling dreariness there vas a pleasant
dream several days suddenly dispelled he
had never before experienced any thing the
tender passion and as its morning dreams are
always delightful he would fain have continued
in the delusion
u but what have i to do with her attached
the student salamanca
ments thought he i have no claim on her
heart nor even on her acquaintance how do
i know that she is worthy affection or if
she is must not so gallant a lover as this with
his jewels his rank and his detestable music
have completely captivated her what idle
humour is this that i have fallen into i must
again to my books study study will soon
chase away all these idle fancies
the more he thought however the more he
became entangled in the spell which his lively
imagination had woven round him and now
that a rival had appeared in addition to the
other obstacles that environed this enchanted
beauty she appeared ten times more lovely and
desirable it was some slight consolation to
him to perceive that the gallantry the unknown
met with no apparent return from the
tower the light at the window was extinguished
 the curtain remained undrawn and
none the customary signals were given to
intimate that the serenade was accepted
the cavalier lingered for some time about the
the student salamanca 
place and sang several other tender airs with a
taste and feeling that made antonio's heartache
at length he slowly retired the student
remained with folded arms leaning against the
ruined arch endeavouring to summon up resolution
enough to depart but there was a romantic
fascination that still enchained him to the
place it is the last time said he willing to
compromise between his feelings and his judgment
 it is the last time then let me enjoy
the dream a few moments longer
as his eye ranged about the old building to
take a farewell look he observed the strange
light in the tower which he had noticed on a
former occasion it kept beaming up and declining
as before a pillar smoke rose in the
air and hung in sable volumes it was evident
the old man was busied in some those operations
that had gained him the reputation a
sorcerer throughout the neighbourhood
suddenly an intense and brilliant glare shone
through the casement followed by a loud report
and then a fierce and ruddy glow a figure 
the student salamanca
feared at the window uttering cries agony or
alarm but immediately disappeared and a body
 smoke and flame whirled out the narrow
aperture antonio rushed to the portal and
knocked at it with vehemence he was only
answered by loud shrieks and found that the
females were ready in helpless consternation
with an exertion desperate strength he forced
the wicket from its hinges and rushed into the
house
he found himself in a small vaulted hall and
by the light the moon which entered at the
door he saw a stairs to the left he hurried up
it to a narrow corridor through which was ruling
a volume smoke he found here the
two females in a frantic state alarm one 
them clasped her hands and implored him to save
her father
the corridor terminated in a small spiral staircase
leading up to the tower he sprang up it
to a small door through the chinks which
came a glow light and smoke was spurning
out he burst it open and found himself in an
he student salamanca 
antique vaulted chamber furnished with furnace
and various chemical apparatus a shattered
retort lay on the stone floor a quantity combustibles
nearly consumed with various half
burnt books and papers were sending up an expiring
flame and filling the chamber with stifling
smoke just within the threshold lay the reputed
conjurer he was bleeding his clothes
were scorched and he appeared lifeless antonio
caught him up and bore him down the
stairs to a chamber in which there was a light
and laid him on a bed
the female domestic was despatched for such
appliances as the house afforded but the daughter
threw herself frantically beside her parent
and could not be reasoned out her alarm her
dress was all in disorder her dishevelled hair
hung in rich confusion about her neck and bosom
 and never was there beheld a lovelier picture
 terror and affliction
the skilful assiduities the scholar soon produced
signs returning animation in his patient
the old man's wounds though severe
vol j 
 the student salamanca
were not dangerous they bad evidently been
produced by the bursting the retort in his
bewilderment he had been enveloped in the stifling
metallic vapours which had overpowered
his feeble frame and had not antonio arrived to
his assistance it is probable he would never have
recovered
by slow degrees he came to his senses he
looked about with a bewildered air at the chamber
the agitated group around and the student
who was leaning over him
where am i said he wildly at the
sound his voice his daughter uttered a faint
exclamation delight my poor inez said
he embracing her then putting his hand to his
head and taking it away stained with blood he
seemed suddenly to recollect himself and to be
overcome with emotion
aye cried he all is over with me all
gone all vanished gone in a moment the
labour a lifetime lost
his daughter attempted to soothe him but he
became slightly delirious and raved incoherently
the student salamanca 
about malignant demons and about the habitation
 the green lion being destroyed his
wounds being dressed and such other remedies
administered as his situation required he sank
into a state quiet antonio now turned his
attention to the daughter whose sufferings had
been little inferior to those her father having
with great difficulty succeeded in tranquillizing
her fears he endeavoured to prevail upon
her to retire and seek the repose so necessary to
her frame proffering to remain by her father
until morning i am a stranger said he it is
true and my offer may appear intrusive but
i see you are lonely and helpless and i cannot
help venturing over the limits mere ceremony
should you feel any scruple or doubt however
say but a word and i will instantly retire
there was a frankness a kindness and a
modesty mingled in antonio's deportment that
inspired instant confidence and his simple scholar's
garb was a recommendation in the house
 poverty the females consented to resign the
sufferer to his care as they would be the better
able to attend to him on the morrow
 the student salamanca
on retiring the old domestic was profuse in
her benedictions the daughter only looked her
thanks but as they shone through the tears
that filled her fine black eyes the student
thought them a thousand times the most eloquent

here then he was by a singular turn 
chance completely housed within this mysterious
mansion when left to himself and the bustle
 the scene was over his heart throbbed as he
looked round the chamber in which he was sitting
it was the daughter's room the promised
land towards which he had cast so many a longing
gaze the furniture was old and had probably
belonged to the building in its prosperous
days but every thing was arranged with propriety
the flowers that he had seen her attend stood
in the window a guitar leaned against a table
on which stood a crucifix and before it lay a
missal and a rosary there reigned an air 
purity and serenity about this little nestling place
 innocence it was the emblem a chaste
and quiet mind some few articles female
the student op salamanca 
dress lay on the chairs and there was the very
bed on which she had slept the pillow on which
her soft cheek had reclined the poor scholar
was treading enchanted ground for what fairyland
has more magic in it than the bed chamber
 innocence and beauty 
from various expressions the old man in
his ravings and from what he had noticed on a
subsequent visit to the tower to see that the fire
was extinguished antonio had gathered that
his patient was an alchymist the philosopher's
stone was an object eagerly sought after by visionaries
in those days but in consequence 

the superstitious prejudices the times and the
frequent persecutions its votaries they were
apt to pursue their experiments in secret in
lonely houses in caverns and ruins or in the
privacy cloistered cells
in the course the night the old man had
several fits restlessness and delirium he would
call out upon theophrastus and geber and
albertus magnus and other sages his art 
and anon would murmur about fermentation
 the student salamanca
and x projection until towards daylight he once
more sank into a salutary sleep
when the morning sun darted his rays into
the casement the fair inez attended by the female
domestic came blushing into the chamber
the student now took his leave having himself
need repose but obtained ready permission to
return and inquire after the sufferer when he
called again he found the alchymist languid
and in pain but apparently suffering more in
mind than in body his delirium had left him
and he had been informed the particulars 
his deliverance and the subsequent attentions
 the scholar he could do little more than
look his thanks but antonio did not require
them his own heart repaid him for all that he
had done and he almost rejoiced in the disaster
that had gained him an entrance into this mysterious
habitation
the alchymist was so helpless as to need
much assistance antonio remained with him
therefore the greater part the day he repeated
his visit the next day and the next
the student salamanca 
every day his company seemed more pleasing
to the invalid and every day he felt his interest
in the latter increasing perhaps the presence
 the daughter might have been at the
bottom this solicitude
he had frequent and long conversations with
the alchymist he found him as men his
pursuits were apt to be a mixture enthusiasm
and simplicity curious and extensive
reading on points little utility with great
inattention to the every day occurrences life
and profound ignorance the world he was
deeply versed in singular and obscure branches
 knowledge and much given to visionary
speculations antonio whose mind was a
romantic cast had himself given some attention
to the occult sciences and entered upon
those themes with an ardour that delighted the
philosopher their conversations frequently
turned upon astrology divination and the great
secret the old man would forget his aches
and wounds rise up like a spectre in his bed
and kindle into eloquence on his favourite 
the student salamanca
pics when gently admonished his situation
it would but prompt him to another sally
 thought alas r my son he would say
is not this very decrepitude and suffering
another proof the importance those secrets
with which we are surrounded why
are we trammelled by disease withered by old
age and our spirits quenched as it were within
us but because we have lost those secrets 
life and youth which were known to our parents
before their fall to regain these have philosophers
been ever since aspiring but just as
they are on the point securing the precious
secrets for ever the brief period life is at an
 they die and with them all their wisdom
and experience nothing as de nuysment
observes nothing is wanting for man's perfection
but a longer life less crost with sorrows
and maladies to the attaining the full
and perfect knowledge things
at length antonio so far gained on the heart
 his patient as to draw from him the outlines
 his story
the student salamanca 
felix de vasquez the alchymist was a native
 castile and an ancient and honourable
line early in life he had married a beautiful
female the descendant one the moorish
families the marriage displeased his father
who considered the pure spanish blood contaminated
by this foreign mixture it is true
the lady traced her descent from one the
abencerrages the most gallant moorish cavaliers
who had embraced the christian faith
on being exiled from the walls granada
the injured pride the father however was
not to be appeased he never saw his son
afterwards and on dying left him but a scanty
portion his estate bequeathing the residue
in the piety and bitterness his heart to the
erection convents and the performance 
masses for souls in purgatory don felix resided
for a long time in the neighbourhood 
valladolid in a state embarrassment and obscurity
he devoted himself to intense study 
having while at the university salamanca
imbibed a taste for the secret sciences he was
vol r 
 the student salamanca
enthusiastic and speculative he went on from
one branch knowledge to another until he
became zealous in the search after the grand
arcanum
he had at first engaged in the pursuit with the
hopes raising himself from his present obscurity
and resuming the rank arid dignity to which
his birth entitled him but as usual it ended in
absorbing every thought and becoming the business
 his existence he was at length aroused
from this mental abstraction by the calamities 
his household a malignant fever swept off his
wife and all his children excepting an infant
daughter these losses for a time overwhelmed
and stupefied him his home had in a manner
died away from around him and he felt lonely
and forlorn when his spirit revived within him
he determined to abandon the scene his humiliation
and disaster to bear away the child
that was still left him beyond the scene contagion
 and never to return to castile until he
should be enabled to reclaim the honour his
line
the student salamanca 
he had ever since been wandering and unsettled
in his abode sometimes the resident populous
cities at other times absolute solitudes
he had searched libraries meditated on inscriptions
 visited adepts different countries and
sought to gather and concentrate the raps which
had been thrown by various minds upon the secrets
 alchymy he had at one time travelled
quite to padua to search for the manuscripts 
pietro d'abano and to inspect an urn which
had been dug up near este supposed to have
been buried by maximus olibius and to have
contained the great elixir
while at padua he had met with an adept
versed in arabian lore who talked the invaluable
this urn was found in it contained a lesser one
in which was a burning lamp betwixt two small vials the one 
gold the other silver both them full a very clear liquor on
the largest was an inscription stating that maximus olibius shut up in
this small vessel elements which he had prepared with great toil
there were many disquisitions among the learned on the subject it
was the most received opinion that this maximus olibius was an inhabitant
 padua that he had discovered the great secret and that
these vessels contained liquor one to transmute metals to gold the
other to silver the peasants who found thee urns imagining this
precious liquor to be common water spilt every drop so that the art
 transmuting metals remains as much a secret as ever
 the student salamanca
able manuscripts that must remain in the spanish
libraries preserved from the spoils the
moorish academies and universities the probability
 meeting with precious unpublished
writings geber and alfarabius and avicenna
the great physicians the arabian schools who
it was well known had treated much alchymy
 but above all he spoke the arabian
tablets lead which had recently been dug up
in the neighbourhood granada and which
contained the lost secrets the art
the indefatigable alchymist once more bent
his steps for spain full renovated hope he
had made his way to granada he had wearied
himself in the study arabic in decyphering
inscriptions in rummaging libraries and exploring
every possible trace left by the arabian
sages
in all his wanderings he had been accompanied
by inez through the rough and the smooth the
pleasant and the adverse never complaining but
rather seeking to sooth his cares by her innocent
and playful caresses her instruction had been
the student salamanca 
the employment and the delight his hours 
relaxation she had grown up while they were
wandering and had scarcely ever known any
home but by his side he was family friends
home every thing to her he had carried her
in his arms when they first began their wayfaring 
had nestled her as an eagle does its young
among the rocky heights the sierra morea
she had sported about him in childhood in the
solitudes the bateucas had followed him asa
lamb does the shepherd over the rugged pyrenees
and into the fair plains languedoc and
now she was grown up to support his feeble steps
among the ruined abodes her maternal ancestors

his property had gradually wasted away in
the course his travels and his experiments
still hope the constant attendant the alchymist
led him on ever on the point reaping
the reward his labours and ever disappointed
with the credulity that often attended his art
he attributed many his disappointments to the
machinations the malignant spirits that beset
 the student salamanca
the path the alchymist and torment him in his
solitary labours
it is their constant endeavour he observed to
close up every avenue to those sublime truths
which would enable man to rise above the abject
state into which he had fallen and to return to
his original perfection to the evil offices 
these demons he attributed his late disaster he
had been on the very verge the glorious discovery
 never were the indications more completely
auspicious all was going on prosperously
when at the critical moment which should
have crowned all his labours with success and
have placed him at the very summit human
power and felicity the bursting a retort had
reduced his laboratory and himself to ruin
i must now said he give up at the very
threshold success my books and papers are
burnt my apparatus is broken i am too old
to bear up against these evils the ardour that
once inspired me is gone my poor frame is exhausted
by study and watchfulness and this last
misfortune has hurried me towards the grave
the student salamanca 
he concluded in a tone deep dejection
antonio endeavoured to comfort and reassure
him but the poor alchymist had for once
awakened to a consciousness the worldly ills
that were gathering around him and had sunk
into despondency after a pause and some
thoughtfulness and perplexity brow antonio
ventured to make a proposal
i have long said he been filled with a
love for the secret sciences but have felt too ignorant
and diffident to give myself up to them
you have acquired experience you have amassed
the knowledge a lifetime it were a 
should be thrown away you say you are too
old to renew the toils the laboratory suffer
me to undertake them add your knowledge
to my youth and activity and what shall we not
accomplish as a probationary fee and a fund
on which to proceed i will bring into the common
stock a sum gold the residue a legacy
which has enabled me to complete my education
a poor scholar cannot boast much but i
trust we shall soon put ourselves beyond the
 the student salamanca
reach want and if we should fail why 
must depend like other scholars upon my brains
to carry me through the world
the philosopher's spirits were however
more depressed than the student had imagined
this last shock following in the rear so
many disappointments had almost destroyed
the reaction his mind the fire an enthusiast
however is never so low but that it maybe
blown again into a flame by degrees the
old man was cheered and reanimated by the
buoyancy and ardour his sanguine companion
he at length agreed to accept the services 
the student and once more to renew his experiments
he objected however to using the
student's gold notwithstanding that his own
was nearly exhausted but this objection was
soon overcome the student insisted on making
it a common stock and common cause and
then how absurd was any delicacy about such
a trifle with men who looked forward to discovering
the philosopher's stone
while therefore the alchymist was slowly
the student salamanca 
recovering the student busied himself in getting
the laboratory once more in order it was
strewed with the wrecks retorts and alembics
 with old crucibles boxes and phials 
powders and tinctures and half burnt books
and manuscripts
as soon as the old man was sufficiently recovered
the studies and experiments were renewed
the student became a privileged and
frequent visiter and was indefatigable in his
toils in the laboratory the philosopher daily
derived new zeal and spirits from the animation
 his disciple he was now enabled to prosecute
the enterprise with continued exertion
having so active a coadjutor to divide the toil
while he was poring over the writings sands
and philalethes and dominus de nuys
ment and endeavouring to comprehend the symbolical
language in which they have locked up
their inscrutable mysteries antonio would occupy
himself among the retorts and crucibles
and keep the furnace in a perpetual glow
with all his zeal however for the discovery
vol i 
 the student salamanca
 the golden art the feelings the student had
not cooled as to the object that first drew him
to this ruinous mansion during the old man's
illness he had frequent opportunities being
near the daughter and every day made him
more sensible to her charms there was a pure
simplicity and an almost passive gentleness in
her manners yet with all this was mingled something
whether mere maiden shyness or a consciousness
 high descent or a dash castilian
pride or perhaps all united which prevented
undue familiarity and made her difficult approach

the danger her father and the measures to
be taken for his relief had at first overcome this
coyness and reserve but as he recovered and her
alarm subsided she seemed to shrink from the
familiarity she had indulged with the youthful
stranger and to become every day more shy
and silent
antonio had read many books but this was
the first volume woman kind that he had
ever studied he had been captivated with the
the student salamanca 
very title page but the farther he read the
more he was delighted she seemed formed to
love her soft black eye rolled languidly under
its long silken lashes and wherever it turned it
would linger and repose there was tenderness
in every beam to him alone she was reserved
and distant now that the common cares 
the sick room were at an he saw little
more her than before his admission to the
house sometimes he met her on his way to
and from the laboratory and at such times there
was ever a smile and a blush but after a simple
salutation she glided on and disappeared
tis plain thought antonio my presence
is indifferent if not irksome to her she
has noticed my admiration and is determined to
discourage it nothing but a feeling gratitude
prevents her treating me with marked distaste
 and then has she not another lover rich
gallant splendid musical how can i suppose
she would turn her eyes from so brilliant a cavalier
to a poor obscure student raking among the
cinders her father's laboratory 
 the student salamanca
indeed the idea the amorous serenader
continually haunted his mind he felt convinced
that he was a favoured lover yet if so
why did he not frequent the tower why did
he not make his approaches by noonday 
there was mystery in this eavesdropping and
musical courtship surely inez could not be
encouraging a secret intrigue oh no she was
too artless too pure too ingenuous but then
the spanish females were so prone to love and
intrigue and music and moonlight were so seductive
 and inez had such a tender soul languishing
in every look oh would the
poor scholar exclaim clasping his hands if i
could but once behold those lovely eyes beaming
on me with affection
it is incredible to those who have not experienced
it on what scanty aliment human life and
human love may be supported a dry crust
thrown now and then to a starving man will
give him a new lease existence and a faint
smile or a kind look bestowed at casual intervals
will keep a lover loving on when a man in
his sober senses would despair
the student salamanca 
when antonio found himself alone in the laboratory
his mind would be haunted by one 
these looks or smiles which he had received in
passing he would set it in every possible light
and argue on it with all the selfpleasing selfteasing
logic a lover
the country around him was enough to
awaken that voluptuousness feeling so favourable
to the growth passion the window
 the tower rose above the trees the romantic
valley the darro and looked down
upon some the loveliest scenery the vega 
where the groves citrons and orange were refreshed
by cool springs and brooks the purest
water the xenel and the darro wound their
shining streams along the plain and gleamed
from among its bowers the surrounding hills
were covered with vineyards and the mountains
crowned with snow seemed to melt into the blue
sky the delicate airs that played about the
tower were perfumed by the fragrance myrtle
and orange blossoms and the ear was charmed
with the fond warbling the nightingale which
 the student salamanca
in these happy regions sings the whole day
long sometimes too there was the idle song
 the muleteer sauntering along the solitary
road or the notes the guitar from some
group peasants dancing in the shade all
these were enough to fill the head a young
lover with poetic fancies and antonio would
picture to himself how he could live among those
happy groves and wander by those gentle rivers
and love away his life with inez
he felt at times impatient at his own weakness
and would endeavour to brush away these
cobwebs the mind he would turn his
thoughts with sudden effort to his occult studies
 or occupy himself in some perplexing process
 but often when he had partially succeeded
in fixing his attention the sound inez lute
or the soft notes her voice would come stealing
upon the stillness the chamber and as it
were floating round the tower there was no
great art in her performance but antonio thought
he had never heard music comparable to this
it was perfect witchcraft to hear her warble forth
the student salamanca 
some her national melodies those little spanish
romances and moorish ballads that transport
the hearer in idea to the banks the
guadalquiver or the walls alhambra and
make him dream beauties and balconies and
moonlight serenades
never was poor student more sadly beset than
antonio love is a troublesome companion ina
study at the best times but in the laboratory
 an alchymist his intrusion is terribly disastrous
instead attending to the retorts and
crucibles and watching the process some experiment
entrusted to his charge the student
would get entranced in one these love dreams
from which he would often be aroused by some
fatal catastrophe the philosopher on returning
from his researches in the libraries would
find every thing gone wrong and antonio in despair
over the ruins the whole day's work
the old man however took all quietly for his
had been a life experiments and failure
we must have patience my son would he
say as all the great masters that have gone 
the student salamanca
fore us have had errors arid accidents and
delays are what we have to contend with did
not pontus err two hundred times before he
could obtain even the matter on which to found
his experiments the great flame too did
he not labour four and twenty years before he
ascertained the first agent what difficulties
and hardships did not cartilages encounter
at the very threshold his discoveries and
bernard de trees even after he had attained
a knowledge all the requisites was he not
delayed full three years what you consider
accidents my son are the machinations our
invisible enemies the treasures and golden
secrets nature are surrounded by spirits hostile
to man the air about us teems with them
they lurk in the fire the furnace in the bottom
 the crucible and the alembic and are
ever on the alert to take advantage those
moments when our minds are wandering from
the intense meditation on the great truths that
we are seeking we must only strive the more
to purify ourselves from those gross and earthly
the student salamanca 
feelings which becloud the soul and prevent
her from piercing into nature's arcana
alas thought antonio if to be purified
from all earthly feeling requires that i should
cease to love inez i fear i shall never discover
the philosopher's stone 
in this way matters went on for some time at
the alchymist's day after day was sending the
student's gold in vapour up the chimney every
blast the furnace made him a ducat the
poorer without apparently helping him a jot
nearer the golden secret still the young man
stood by and saw piece after piece disappearing
without a murmur he had daily an opportunity
 seeing inez he felt as if her favour would
be better than silver or gold and that every smile
was worth a ducat
sometimes in the cool the evening when
the toils the laboratory happened to be suspended
he would walk with the alchymist in
what had once been a garden belonging to the
mansion there were still the remains terraces
and balustrades and here and there a
vol i 
 the student salamanca
marble urn or mutilated statue overturned and
buried among weeds and flowers run wild
it was the favourite resort the alchymist in
his hours relaxation where he would give full
scope to his visionary flights his mind was
tinctured with the rosycrucian doctrines he
believed in elementary beings some favourable
others adverse to his pursuits and in the exaltation
 his fancy had often imagined that he
held communion with them in his solitary walks
about the whispering groves and echoing walls
 this old garden when accompanied by antonio
he would prolong these evening recreations
indeed he sometimes did it out consideration
for his disciple for he feared his too close application
and his incessant seclusion in the tower
would be injurious to his health he was delighted
and surprised by this extraordinary zealand
perseverance in so young a tyro and looked
upon him as destined to be one the great luminaries
 the art lest the student should
repine at the time lost in these relaxations the
good alchymist would fill them up with wholethe
student salamanca 
some knowledge in matters connected with their
pursuit and would walk up and down the alleys
with his disciple imparting oral instruction like
an ancient philosopher
in all his visionary schemes there breathed a
spirit lofty though chimerical philanthropy
that won the admiration the scholar
nothing sordid nothing sensual nothing petty
or selfish seemed to enter into his views in respect
to the grand discoveries he was anticipating
on the contrary his imagination kindled
with conceptions widely dispensed happiness
he looked forward to the time when he
should be able to go about the earth relieving the
indigent comforting the distressed and by his
unlimited means devising and executing plans
for the complete extirpation poverty and all its
attendant sufferings and crimes never were
grander schemes for universal good for the distribution
 boundless wealth and universal competence
devised than by this poor indigent alchemist
in his ruined tower
antonio would attend these peripatetic 
the student salamanca
turns with all the ardour a devotee but there
was another circumstance which may have given
a secret charm to them the garden was the
resort also inez where she took her walks 
recreation the only exercise that her secluded
life permitted
as antonio was duteously pacing by the side
 his instructor he would often catch a glimpse
 the daughter walking pensively about the alleys
in the soft twilight sometimes they would
meet her unexpectedly and the heart the
student would throb with agitation a blush
too would crimson the cheek inez but still
she passed on and never joined them
he had remained one evening until rather a
late hour with the alchymist in this favourite
resort it was a delightful night after a sultry
day and the balmy air the garden was peculiarly
reviving the old man was seated on a
fragment a pedestal looking like a part 
the ruin on which he sat he was edifying his
pupil by reading long lessons wisdom from
the stars as they shone out with brilliant lustre
the student op salamanca 
in the dark blue vault a southern sky and
by quoting by memory from behmen and other
 the rosycrucians concerning the signature 
earthly things and passing events which may be
discerned in the heavens the power the
stars over corporeal beings and their influence
in the fortunes the sons men
by degrees the moon arose and shed her
gleaming light among the chequered groves
antonio apparently listened with fixed attention
to the sage but his ear was drinking in the melody
 inez voice who was singing to her lute
in one the moonlight glades the garden
the old man having exhausted his theme sat
gazing in silent reverie at the heavens antonio
could not resist an inclination to steal a look at
this coy beauty that was playing the part the
nightingale so sequestered and musical leaving
the alchymist in his celestial reverie he stole
gently along one the alleys the music had
ceased and he thought he heard the sound 
voices he came to an angle a copse that
had screened a kind green recess ornamented
 the student salamanca
by a marble fountain the moon shone full
upon the place and by its light he beheld his unknown
serenading rival at the feet inez he
was detaining her by the hand which he covered
with kisses but at the sight antonio he started
up and half drew his sword while inez disengaged
fled back to the house
all the jealous doubts and fears antonio
were now confirmed he did not remain to encounter
the resentment his happy rival at
being thus interrupted but turned from the place
with sudden wretchedness heart that inez
should love another would have been misery
enough but that she should be capable a
dishonourable amour shocked him in the extreme
the idea deception in so young and
apparently artless a being brought with it that
sudden distrust in human nature so sickening to
a youthful and ingenuous mind but when he
thought the kind simple parent she was deceiving
whose affections all centered in her he
felt for a moment a sentiment indignation
and almost aversion
the student salamanca 
he found the alchymist still seated in visionary
contemplation the moon come hither
m on said he with his usual enthusiasm
come read with me this vast volume wisdom
thus nightly unfolded before us wisely
did the chaldean sages affirm that the heaven
is as a mystic page uttering speech to those
who can rightly understand warning them 
good and evil and instructing them in the
secret decrees late
the student's heart ached for his venerable
master and for a time he felt the futility all
his occult wisdom alas poor old man
thought he little dost thou dream while busied
in airy speculations among the stars what a
treason against thy happiness is going on under
thine eye as it were in thy very bosom oh
inez inez where shall we look for truth and
innocence where shall we repose in confidence
in woman if even you can deceive 
it was a trite apostrophe such as every lover
makes when he finds his mistress not quite
such a goddess as he had painted her with
 the student salamanca
the student however it sprang from honest
anguish heart he returned to his lodgings
in pitiable confusion mind he now deplored
the infatuation that had led him on until
his feelings were so thoroughly engaged he
resolved to abandon his pursuits at the tower
and trust to absence to dispel the fascination by
which he had been spell bound he no longer
thirsted after the discovery the grand elixir 
the dream alchymy was over for without
inez what was the value the philosopher's
stone 
he rose after a sleepless night with the determination
 taking his leave the alchymist
and tearing himself from granada for
several days did he rise with the same resolution
and every night saw him come back
to his pillow to repine at his want resolution
and to make fresh determinations for the
morrow in the meanwhile he saw less inez
than ever she no longer walked in the garden
but remained almost entirely in her apartment
when she met him she blushed more
the student salamanca 
than usual and once hesitated as if she would
have spoken but after a temporary embarrassment
and still deeper blushes she made some
casual observation and retired antonio read
in this confusion a consciousness fault and
 that fault's being discovered what could
she have wished to communicate perhaps to
account for the scene in the garden but how
can she account for it or why should she account
for it to me what am i to her or
rather what is she to me exclaimed he impatiently
with a new resolution to break through
these entanglements the heart and fly from
this enchanted spot for ever
he was returning that very night to his lodgings
full these excellent determinations
when in a shadowy part the road he
passed a person whom he recognized by his
height and form for his rival he was going
in the direction the tower if any lingering
doubts remained here was an opportunity 
settling them completely he determined to
follow this unknown cavalier and under favol
i 
 the student salamanca
your the darkness observe his movements
if he obtained access to the tower or in anyway
a favourable reception antonio felt as if it
would be a relief to his mind and would enable
him to fix his waveringesolution
the unknown as he came near the tower
was more cautious and stealthy in his approaches
he was joined under a clump trees by
another person and they had much whispering
together a light was burning in the chamber
 inez the curtain was drawn but the casement
was left open as the night was warm after
some time the light was extinguished a considerable
interval elapsed the cavalier and his
companion remained under covert the trees
as if keeping watch at length they approached
the tower with silent and cautious steps the
cavalier received a dark lanthorn from his companion
and threw off his cloak the other then
softly brought something from the clump trees
which antonio perceived to be a light ladder
he placed it against the wall and the serenade
gently ascended a sickening sensation came
over antonio here was indeed a confirmathe
student salamanca 
tion every fear he was about to leave the
place never to return when he heard a stifled
shriek from inez chamber
in an instant the fellow that stood at the foot
 the ladder lay prostrate on the ground antonio
wrested a stiletto from his nerveless hand
and hurried up the ladder he sprang in at the
window and found inez struggling in the grasp
 his fancied rival the latter disturbed from
his prey caught up his lanthorn turned its light
full upon antonio and drawing his sword made
a furious assault luckily the student saw the
light gleam along the blade and parried the
thrust with the stiletto a fierce but unequal
combat ensued antonio fought exposed to the
full glare the light while his antagonist was
in shadow his stiletto too was but a poor defence
against a rapier he saw that nothing
w r ould save him but closing with his adversary
and getting within his weapon he rushed furiously
upon him and gave him a severe blow with
the stiletto but received a wound in return from
the shortened sword at the same moment a
 the student salamanca
blow was inflicted from behind by the confederate
who had ascended the ladder it felled
him to the floor and his antagonists made their
escape
by this time the cries inez had brought
her father and the domestic to the room antonio
was found weltering in his blood and
senseless he was conveyed to the chamber
 the alchymist who now repaid in kind
the attentions which the student had once bestowed
upon him among his varied knowledge
he possessed some skill in surgery which at
this moment was more value than even his
chronical lore he stanched and dressed the
wounds his disciple which on examination
proved less desperate than he had at first apprehended

for a few days however his case was anxious
and attended with danger the old man
watched over him with the affection a parent
he felt a double debt gratitude towards
him on account his daughter and himself
he loved him too as a faithful and zealous
the student salamanca 
disciple and he dreaded lest the world should
be deprived the promising talents so aspiring
an alchymist
an excellent constitution soon medicine his
wounds and there was a balsam in the looks
and words inez that had a healing effect on
still severer wounds which he carried in his
heart she displayed the strongest interest in
his safety she called him her deliverer her
preserver it seemed as if her grateful disposition
sought in the warmth its acknowledgments
to repay him for past coldness
but what most contributed to antonio's recovery
was her explanation concerning his supposed
rival it was some time since he had
first beheld her at church and he had ever since
persecuted her with his attentions
he had beset her in her walks until she had
been obliged to confine herself to the house except
when accompanied by her father he had
besieged her with letters serenades and every
art by which he could urge a vehement but
clandestine and dishonourable suit the scene
 the student salamanca
in the garden was as much a surprise to her as
to antonio her persecutor had been attracted
by her voice and had found his way over a
ruined part the wall he had come upon her
unawares was detaining her by force and pleading
his insulting passion when the appearance
 the student interrupted him and enabled her
to make her escape she had forborne to mention
to her father the persecution which she
suffered she wished to spare him unavailing
anxiety and distress and had determined to confine
herself more rigorously to the house though
it appeared that even here she had not been
safe from his daring enterprize
antonio inquired whether she knew the name
 this impetuous admirer she replied that he
had made his advances under a fictitious name
but that she had heard him once called by the
name don ambrosio de loxia
antonio knew him by report for one the
most determined and dangerous libertines in all
granada artful accomplished and if he chose
to be so insinuating but daring and headlong
the student salamanca 
in the pursuit his pleasures violent and implacable
in his resentments he rejoiced to find
that inez had been proof against his seductions
and had been inspired with loathing by his splendid
profligacy but he trembled to think the
dangers she had run and he felt solicitude about
the dangers that must yet environ her
at present however it was probable the enemy
had a temporary quietus the traces blood
had been found for some distance from the ladder
until they were lost among thickets and as
nothing had been heard or seen him since
it was concluded thathe had been seriously
wounded
as the student recovered from his wounds he
was enabled to join inez and her father in their
domestic intercourse the chamber in which
they usually met had probably been a saloon 
state in former times the floor was marble
 the walls partially covered with the remains
 tapestry the chairs richly carved and covered
with tarnished and tattered brocade against
the wall hung a long rusty rapier the only re
 the student salamanca
pique that the old man retained the chivalry 
his ancestors there might have been something
to provoke a smile in the contrast between the
mansion and its inhabitants between present
poverty and the traces departed grandeur 
but the fancy the student had thrown so
much romance about the edifice and its inmates
that every thing was clothed with charms the
philosopher with his broken down pride and his
strange pursuits seemed to comport with the
melancholy ruin he inhabited and there was a
native elegance spirit about the daughter that
showed she would have graced the mansion in
its happier days
what delicious moments were these to the
student inez was no longer coy and reserved
she was naturally artless and confiding though
the kind persecution she had experienced
from one admirer had rendered her for a time
suspicious and circumspect she now felt an
entire confidence in the sincerity and w r orth 
antonio mingled with an overflowing gratitude
when her eyes met his they beamed with symthe
student salamanca 
path and kindness and antonio no longer
haunted by the idea a favoured rival once
more aspired to success
at these domestic meetings however he had
little opportunity paying his court except by
looks the alchymist supposing him like himself
absorbed in the study alchymy endeavoured
to cheer the tediousness his recovery
by long conversations on the art he even
brought several his half burnt volumes that
the student had once rescued from the flames
and entertained him by the hour by reading copious
chapters the old man delighted in the
mystic phrases and symbolical jargon in which
the writers that have treated alchymy have
wrapped their communications rendering them
unintelligible except to the initiated with
what rapture would he elevate his voice at a
triumphant passage announcing the grand discovery
 thou shall see would he exclaim in
the words henry kuhnrade the stone the
philosophers our king go forth thebedcham
amphitheatre the eternal wisdom
vol i 
 the student salamanca
ber his glassy sepulchre into the theatre this
world that is to say regenerated and made perfect
a shining carbuncle a most temperate splendour
whose most subtle and depurated parts
re inseparable united into one with a concordia
mixture exceeding equal transparent as
chrystal shining red like a ruby permanently
colouring or ringing fixt in all temptations or
tryals yea in the examination the burning
sulphur itself and the devouring waters and in
the most vehement persecution the fire always
incombustible and permanent as a salamander

the student had a high veneration for the
fathers alchymy and a profound respect for
his instructor but what was henry kuhnrade
geber lully or even albertus magnus himself
compared to the countenance inez
which presented such a page beauty to his
perusal while therefore the good alchymist
was doling out knowledge by the hour his disciple
would forget books alchymy every thing
but the lovely object before him
the student salamanca 
inez too unpractised in the science the
heart was gradually becoming fascinated by
the silent attentions her lover day by day
she seemed more and more perplexed by the
kindling and strangely pleasing emotions her
bosom her eye was often cast down in
thought blushes stole to her cheek without
any apparent cause and light half suppressed
sighs would follow these short fits musing
her little ballads though the same that she had
always sung yet breathed a more tender spirit
either the tones her voice were most soft and
touching or some passages were delivered with
a feeling which she had never before given them
antonio beside his love for the abstruse sciences
had a pretty turn for music and never did philosopher
touch the guitar more tastefully as
by degrees he conquered the mutual embarrassment
that kept them asunder he ventured to
accompany her in some her songs he had
a voice full fire and tenderness as he sang
one would have thought from the kindling
blushes his companion that he had been
 the student salamanca
pleading his own passion in her ear let those
who would keep two youthful hearts asunder
beware music oh this leaning over chairs
and conning the same music and entwining
 voices and melting away in harmonies 
the german waltz is nothing to it the worthy
alchymist saw nothing all this his mind
could admit no idea that was not connected
with the discovery the grand arcanum and
he supposed his youthful coadjutor equally devoted
he was a mere child as to human nature
 and as to the passion love whatever
he might once have felt it he had long since
forgotten that there was such an idle passion
in existence but while he dreamed the silent
amour went on the very quiet and seclusion
 the place was favourable to the growth 
romantic passion the opening bud love
was able to put forth leaf by leaf without an
adverse wind to check its growth there was
neither officious friendship to chill by its advice
nor insidious envy to wither by its sneers nor
an observing world to look on and stare it out
the student salamanca 
 countenance there was neither declaration
nor vow nor any other form cupid's canting
school their hearts mingled together and understood
each other without the aid language
they lapsed into the full current affection
unconscious its depth and thoughtless the
rocks that might lurk beneath its surface happy
lovers who wanted nothing to make their
felicity complete but the discovery the philosopher's
stone 
at length antonio's health was sufficiently restored
to enable him to return to his lodgings in
granada he felt uneasy however at leaving
the tower while lurking danger might surround
its almost defenceless inmates he dreaded lest
don ambrosio recovered from his wounds
might plot some new attempt by secret art or
open violence from all that he had heard he
knew him to be too implacable to suffer his defeat
to pass unrevenged and too rash and fearless
when his arts were unavailing to stop at
any daring deed in the accomplishment his
purposes he urged his apprehensions to the
 the student salamanca
alchymist and his daughter and proposed that
they should abandon the dangerous vicinity

went on to paint the beauties and delights va

paints the fields and groves which he is picturing
as the future scenes his happiness his eloquence
backed by the apprehensions inez
was successful with the alchymist who indeed 
had led too unsettled a life to be particular about
the place his residence and it was determined
that as soon as antonio's health was perfectly
restored they should abandon the tower and
seek the neighbourhood valencia
to recruit his strength the student suspended
his toils in the laboratory and spent the few remaining
days before departure in taking a farewell
look at the enchanting environs granada
he felt returning health and vigour as he in
the student salamanca 
haled the pure temperate breezes that play
about its hills and the happy state his mind
contributed to his rapid recovery inez was often
the companion his walks her descent by the
mother's side from one the ancient moorish
families gave her an interest in this once favourite
seat arabian power she gazed
with enthusiasm upon its magnificent monuments
and her memory was filled with the traditional
tales and ballads moorish chivalry
indeed the solitary life she had led and the
visionary turn her father's mind had produced
an effect upon her character and given it a tinge
 what in modern days would be called romance
all this was called into full force by
this new passion for when a woman first begins
to love life is all romance to her
in one their evening strolls they had ascended
to the mountain the sun where is
situated the generalise the palace pleasure
in the days moorish dominion but now
a gloomy convent capuchins they had
wandered about its garden among groves 
 the student salamanca
orange citron and cypresses where the waters
leaping in torrents or gushing in fountains
or tossed aloft in sparkling jets fill the
air with music and freshness still there is a
melancholy mingled with all the beauties this
garden that gradually stole over the feelings
 the lovers the place is full the sad
story past times it was the favourite abode
 the lovely queen granada where she
was surrounded by the delights a gay and
voluptuous court it was here too amidst her
own bowers roses that her slanderers laid
the base story her dishonour and struck a
fatal blow to the line the gallant abencer
rages
the whole garden has a look ruin and neglect
many the fountains are dry and
broken the streams have wandered from their
marble channels and are choked by weeds and
yellow leaves the reed whistles to the wind
where it had once sported among roses and
shaken perfume from the orange blossom the
convent bell flings its sullen sound or the drown

sy vesper hymn floats along these solitudes
which once resounded with the song and the
dance and the lover's serenade well may
the moors lament over the loss this earthly
paradise well may they remember it in their
prayers and beseech heaven to restore it to the
faithful well may their ambassadors smite their
breasts when they wander among these monuments
 their race and sit down and weep
among the fading glories granada 
it is impossible to wander among these scenes
 departed love and gayety and not feel the
tenderness the heart awakened it was then
that antonio first ventured to breathe his passion
arid to express by words what his eyes had
long since so eloquently revealed he made
his avowal with fervour but with frankness
he had no gay prospects to hold out he was a
poor scholar dependent on his good spirits to
feed and clothe him but a woman in love is
no interested calculator inez listened to him
with downcast eyes but in them was a humid
gleam that showed her heart was with him
vol j 
 the student salamanca
she had no prudery in her nature and she had
not been sufficiently in society to acquire it
she loved him with all the absence worldliness
 a genuine woman and amidst timid
smiles and blushes he drew from her a modest
acknowledgment her affection they wandered
about the garden with sweet intoxication
 the soul which none but happy lovers know
the world about them was all fairy land and
indeed it spread forth one its fairest scenes
before their eyes as if to fulfil their dream 
earthly happiness they looked out from between
groves orange upon the towers granada
below them the magnificent plain the
vega beyond streaked with evening sunshine
and the distant hills tinted with rosy and purple
hues it seemed an emblem the happy future
that love and hope was decking out for them
as if to make the scene complete a group 
andalusians struck up a dance in one the
vistas the garden to the notes the guitars
 two wandering musicians the spanish
music is wild and plaintive yet the people dance
the student salamanca 
to it with enthusiasm the picturesque figures
 the dancers the girls with their hair in silken
nets that hung in knots and tassels down their
backs their mantillas floating round their airy
figures their slender feet and ankles peeping
from under their basquines their arms thrown
up in the air to play the castanets had a beautiful
effect on this airy height with the rich
evening landscape spreading out below them
in a little while the dance ceased two the
parties approached antonio and inez and began
a soft and tender moorish ballad accompanied
by the lute it alluded to the story the garden
 the wrongs the fair queen granada
and the misfortunes the abencerrages it
was one those old ballads that abound in
andalusia and seem to e like echoes about
the ruins moorish greatness the tears rose
into the eyes inez as she listened to the tale 
her heart was open to every tender impression
the singer approached her and suddenly
varying her manner sang impending danger
and treachery the manner the look the gest
the student salamanca
circulation the singer was such as to make it
pointed arid startling she was about to ask
the meaning this evidently personal application
 the song when she was interrupted by
antonio who gently drew her from the place
while she had been lost in attention to the music
he had remarked a group men in the
shadow the trees whispering together they
were enveloped in the broad hats and great
cloaks so much worn by the spanish and while
they were regarding himself and inez attentively
seemed anxious to avoid observation
not knowing what might be their character or
intention he hastened to quit a place where the
gathering shadows evening might expose
them to intrusion and insult on their way
down the hill as they passed through the woods
 elms mingled with poplars and oleanders
that skirt the road leading from the alhambra
he again saw these men apparently following
at a distance and he afterwards caught sight 
them among the trees on the banks the varro
he said nothing on the subject to inez nor
the student salamanca 
her father for he would not awaken unnecessary
alarm but he felt at a loss how to ascertain
or to avert any machinations that might
be devising again the helpless inhabitants the
tower
he took his leave them at night full this
perplexity as he left the dreary old pile he
saw some one lurking in the shadow the wall
apparently watching his movements he hastened
after the figure but it glided away and
disappeared among some ruins shortly after he
heard a low whistle which was answered from a
little distance he had no longer a doubt but
that some mischief was on foot and turned to
hasten back to the tower and put its inmates on
their guard he had scarcely turned however
before he found himself suddenly seized from
behind by some one herculean strength his
struggles were in vain he was surrounded byarmed
men one threw a mantle over him that
stifled his cries and enveloped him in its folds
and he was hurried off with irresistible rapidity
the next day passed without the appearance
 the student salamanca
 antonio at the alchymist's another and
another day succeeded and yet he did not come
nor had any thing been heard him at his lodgings
his absence caused at first surprise and
conjecture and at length alarm inez recollected
the singular intimations the ballad
singer upon the mountain which seemed to warn
her impending danger and her mind was full
 vague forebodings she sat listening to every
sound at the gate or tread on the stairs she
would take up her guitar and strike a few notes
but it would not do her heart was sickening with
suspense and anxiety she had never before
felt what it was to be really lonely she now
was conscious the force that attachment
which had taken possession her breast for
never do we know how much we love never do
we know how necessary the object our love
is to our happiness until we experience the
weary void separation
the philosopher too felt the absence his
disciple almost as sensibly as did his daughter
the animating buoyancy the youth had in
the student salamanca 
spired him with new ardour and had given to
his labours the charm full companionship
however he had resources and consolations 
which his daughter was destitute his pursuits
were a nature to occupy every thought and
keep the spirits in a state continual excitement
certain indications too had lately manifested
themselves the most favourable nature
forty days and forty nights had the process gone
on successfully the old man's hopes were constantly
rising and he now considered the glorious
moment once more at hand when he should
obtain not merely the major lunaria but likewise
the tincture salaries the means multiplying
gold and prolonging existence he
remained therefore continually shut up in his
laboratory watching his furnace for a moment's
inadvertency might once more defeat all his expectations

he was sitting one evening at one his solitary
vigils wrapped up in meditation the hour
was late and his neighbour the owl was hooting
from the battlements the tower when he
 the student salamanca
heard the door open behind him supposing
it to be his daughter coming to take her leave 
him for the night as was her frequent practice
he called her by name but a harsh voice met his
ear in reply he was grasped by the arms and
looking up perceived three strange men in the
chamber he attempted to shake them off butin
vain he called for help but they scoffed
at his cries
peace dotard cried one think'st thou
the servants the most holy inquisition are to
be daunted by thy clamours comrades away
with him 
without heeding his remonstrances and entreaties
they seized upon his books and papers
took some note the apartment and the utensils
and then bore him off a prisoner
inez left to herself had passed a sad and
lonely evening by a casement which looked into
a garden she had pensively watched star after
star sparkle out the blue depths the sky
and was indulging a crowd anxious thoughts
about her lover until the rising tears began to
the student salamanca 
flow she was suddenly alarmed by the sound
 voices that seemed to come from a distant
part the mansion there was not long after
a noise several persons descending the stairs 
surprised at these unusual sounds in their lonely
habitation she remained for a few moments in a
state trembling yet indistinct apprehension 
when the servant rushed into the room with terror
in her countenance and informed her that
her father was carried off by armed men inez
did not stop to hear farther but flew down stairs
to overtake them she had scarcely passed the
threshold when she found herself in the grasp 
strangers
away away cried she wildly do not
stop me let me follow my father
we are come to conduct you to him senora
said one the men respectfully
where is he then 
he is gone to granada replied the man
an unexpected circumstance requires his presence
there immediately but he is among
friends
vol i 
 the student salamanca
we have no friends in granada said inez
drawing back but then the idea antonio
rushed to her mind something relating to him
might have called her father thither is senor
antonio de castro with him demanded she
with agitation
i know not senora replied the man it is
very possible i only know that he is among
friends and is anxious for you to follow him
let us go then cried she eagerly the men
led her a little distance to where a mule was
waiting and assisting her to mount they conducted
her slowly towards the city
granada was on that evening a scene fanciful
revel it was one the festivals the
maestranza an association the nobility to
keep up some the gallant customs ancient
chivalry there had been a representation 
a tournament in one the squares the streets
would still occasionally resound with the beat
 a solitary drum or the bray a trumpet
from some straggling party revellers sometimes
they were met by cavaliers richly dressed
in ancient costumes attended by their squires
the student salamanca 
and at one time they passed in sight a
palace brilliantly illuminated from whence
came the mingled sounds music and the
dance shortly after they came to the square
where the mock tournament had been held it
was thronged by the populace recreating themselves
among booths and stalls where refreshments
were sold and the glare torches
showed the temporary galleries and gay coloured
awnings and armorial trophies and other
paraphernalia the show the conductors 
inez endeavoured to keep out observation and
to traverse a gloomy part the square but they
were detained at one place by the pressure a
crowd surrounding a party wandering musicians
singing one those ballads which the
spanish populace are so passionately fond the
torches which were held by some the crowd
threw a strong mass light upon inez and the
sight so beautiful a being without mantilla
or veil looking so bewildered and conducted
by men who seemed to take no gratification in
the surrounding gayety occasioned expressions
 the student salamanca
 curiosity one the ballad singers approached
and striking her guitar with peculiar
earnestness began to sing a doleful air full 
sinister forebodings inez started with surprise
it was the same ballad singer that had addressed
her in the gardens generalise she was
young and beautiful with an air wildness and
melancholy
it was the same air that she had then sung
it spoke impending dangers they seemed
indeed to be thickening around her she was
anxious to speak with this girl and to ascertain
whether indeed she had a knowledge any definite
evil that was threatening her but as she
attempted to address her the mule on which she
rode was suddenly seized and led forcibly through
the throng by one her conductors while she
saw another addressing menacing words to the
ballad singer the latter raised her hand with
a warning gesture as inez lost sight her
while inez was yet lost in perplexity caused
by this singular occurrence they stopped at the
gate a large mansion one her attendants
the student salamanca 
knocked the door was opened and they entered
a paved court where are we demanded
inez with anxiety at the house a friend
senora replied the man ascend this staircase
with me and in a moment you will meet
your father they ascended the staircase that
led to a suite splendid apartments they
passed through several until they came to an
inner chamber the door opened some one
approached but what was her terror at perceiving
not her father but don ambrosio the
men who had seized upon the alchymist had at
least been more honest in their professions they
were indeed familiars the inquisition he
was conducted in silence to the gloomy prison 
that terrible tribunal it was a mansion whose
every aspect withered joy and almost shut out
hope it was one those hideous abodes which
the bad passions men conjure up in this fair
world to rival the fancied dens demons and
the accursed
day after day went heavily by without anything
to mark the lapse time but the decline
 the student salamanca
and reappearance the light that feebly glimmered
through the narrow window the dungeon
in which the unfortunate alchymist was
buried rather than confined his mind was harassed
with uncertainties and fears about his
daughter so helpless and inexperienced he
endeavoured to gather tidings her from the
man who brought his daily portion food the
fellow stared as if astonished at being asked a
question in that mansion silence arid mystery 
but departed without saying a word every
succeeding attempt was equally fruitless
the poor alchymist was oppressed by many
griefs and it was not the least that he had been
again interrupted in his labours on the very point
 success never was alchymist so near attaining
the golden secret a little longer and all his
hopes would have been realized the thoughts
 these disappointments afflicted him more even
than the fear all that he might suffer from the
merciless inquisition his waking thoughts
would follow him into his dreams he would be
transported in fancy to his laboratory busied
the student salamanca 
again among retorts and alembics and surrounded
by lully by d'abano by olibius and the other
masters the sublime art the moment 
projection would arrive a seraphic form would
arise out the furnace holding forth a vessel
containing the precious elixir but before he
could grasp the prize he would awake and find
himself in a dungeon
all the devices inquisitorial ingenuity were
employed to ensnare the old man and to draw
from him evidence that might be brought against
himself and might corroborate certain secret information
that had been given against him he
had been accused practising necromancy and
judicial astrology and a cloud evidence had
been secretly brought forward to substantiate
the charge it would be tedious to enumerate
all the circumstances apparently corroborative
which had been industriously cited by the secret
accuser the silence which prevailed about the
tower its desolateness the very quiet its inhabitants
had been adduced as proofs that something
sinister was perpetrated within
 the student salamanca
the alchymist's conversations and soliloquies
in the garden had been overheard and misrepresented
the lights and strange appearances at
night in the tower were given with violent exaggerations
shrieks and yells were said to have
been heard from thence at midnight when it
was confidently asserted the old man raised
familiar spirits by his incantations and even
compelled the dead to rise from their graves and
answer to his questionings
the alchymist according to the custom the
inquisition was kept in complete ignorance 
his accuser the witnesses produced against
him even the crimes which he was accused
he was examined generally whether he knew
why he was arrested and was conscious any
guilt that might deserve the notice the holy
office he was examined as to his country 
his life his habits his pursuits his actions and
opinions
the old man was frank and simple in his replies
 he was conscious no guilt capable no
art practised in no dissimulation after receiving
the student salamanca 
a general admonition to bethink himself whether
he had not committed any act deserving punishment
and to prepare by confession to secure the
wellknown mercy the tribunal he was remanded
to his cell
he was now visited in his dungeon by crafty
familiars the inquisition who under pretence
 sympathy and kindness came to beguile the
tediousness his imprisonment with friendly
conversation they casually introduced the
subject alchymy on which they touched with
great caution and pretended indifference there
was no need such craftiness the honest enthusiast
had no suspicion in his nature the moment
they touched upon his favourite theme he
forgot his misfortunes and imprisonment and
broke forth into rhapsodies about the divine
science
the conversation was artfully turned to the
discussion elementary beings the alchymist
readily avowed his belief in them and
that there had been instances their attending
upon philosophers and administering to their
vol i 
 the student salamanca
wishes he related many miracles said to
have been performed by apologies thanes
through the aid spirits or demons insomuch
that he was set up by the heathens in opposition
to the messiah and was even regarded with
reverence by many christians the familiars
eagerly demanded whether he believed apollo
ninus to be a true and worthy philosopher the
unaffected piety the alchymist protected him
even in the midst his simplicity for he condemned
apologies as a sorcerer and an impostor
no art could ever draw from him an admission
that he had ever employed or invoked
spiritual agencies in the prosecution his pursuits
though he believed himself to have been
frequently impeded by them
the inquisitors were baffled and disappointed
in not being able to inveigle him into a confession
 a criminal nature they attributed it to
craft to obstinacy to every cause but the right
one namely that the harmless visionary had
nothing guilty to confess
they had abundant proof a secret nature
the student salamanca 
against him but it was the practice the inquisition
to endeavour to procure confession
from the prisoners
an autodafe was at hand the worthy fathers
were eager for his conviction for they were always
anxious to have a good number culprits
condemned to the stake to grace their
solemn triumphs he was at length brought
to a final examination
the chamber trial was spacious and
gloomy at one was a huge crucifix the
standard the inquisition a long table extended
through the centre the room at which
sat the inquisitors and their secretary at the
other a stool was placed for the prisoner
he was brought in according to custom bareheaded
and bare legged he was enfeebled by
confinement and affliction by constantly brooding
over the unknown fate his child and the
disastrous interruption his experiments he
sat bowed down and listless his head sunk
upon his breast his whole appearance that 
one past hope abandoned and by himself
given over
 the student salamanca
the accusation alleged again him was now
brought forward in a specific form he was
called upon by name felix de vasquez formerly
 castile to answer to the charges 
necromancy and demonology he was told that
the charges were amply substantiated and
was asked whether he was ready by ample confession
to throw himself upon the wellknown
mercy the holy inquisition
the philosopher testified some slight surprise
at the accusation but simply replied am
innocent
what proof have you to give your innocence
 it rather remains for you to prove
your charges cried the old man i am a
stranger and a sojourner in the land and know
no one out the doors my dwelling i can
give nothing in my vindication but the word 
a nobleman and a castilian
the inquisitor shook his head and went onto
repeat the various inquiries that had before
been made as to his mode life and pursuit
the poor alchymist was too feeble and weary
at heart to make any but brief replies he re
the student salamanca 
quested that some man science might examine
his laboratory and all his books and papers 
by which it would be made abundantly evident
that he w r as merely engaged in the study alchymy

to this the inquisitor observed that alchymy
had become a mere covert for secret and deadly
sins that the practises it were known to
scruple at no means to satisfy their inordinate
greediness gold some had been known to
use spells and impious ceremonies to conjure
the aid evil spirits nay even to sell their souls
to the enemy mankind so that they might
riot in boundless wealth while living
o
the poor alchymist had heard all patiently or
at least passively he had disdained to vindicate
his name otherwise than by his word he
had smiled at the accusations sorcery when
applied merely to himself but when the sublime
art which had been the study and passion his
life was assailed he could no longer listen in
silence his head gradually rose from his bosom
a hectic colour came in faint streaks to his
 the student salamanca
cheeks played about there disappeared returned
 and at length kindled into a burning glow
the clammy dampness dried from his forehead 
his eyes which had been nearly extinguished
lightedup again and burned with their wonted
and visionary fires
he entered into a vindication his favourite
art his voice at first was feeble and broken
but it gathered strength as he proceeded until
it rolled in a deep and sonorous volume he
gradually rose from his seat as he rose with his
subject he threw back the scanty black mantle
which had hitherto wrapped his limbs the very
uncouthness his form and looks gave an impressive
effect to what he uttered it was as
though a corpse had become suddenly animated
he repelled with scorn the aspersions cast upon
alchymy by the ignorant and vulgar he assumed
it to be the mother all art and science citing
the opinions paracelsus sandivogius
raymond lully and others in support his
assertions he maintained that it was pure and
innocent and honourable both in its purposes
the student salamanca 
and means what were its objects the perpetuation
 life and youth and the production 
gold the elixir vitae said he is no
charmed potion but merely a concentration 
those elements vitality which nature has scattered
through her works the philosopher's
stone or tincture or powder as it is variously
called is no necromantic talisman but consists
simply those particles which gold contains
within itself for its reproduction for gold like
other things has its seed within itself though
bound up with inconceivable firmness from the
vigour innate fixed salts and sulphur
in seeking to discover the elixir life then
continued he we seek only to apply some 
nature's own specifics against the disease and
decay to which our bodies are subjected and
what else does the physician when he tasks his
art and uses subtle compounds and cunning distillations
to revive our languishing powers and
avert the stroke death for a season 
 in seeking to multiply the precious metals
also we seek but to germinate and multiply by

employed the latest hour their life

gaze what a glorious reverse will there be in
his condition how will he emerge from his
solitary retreat like the sun breaking forth from

here he was interrupted by the inquisitor
who had suffered him to go on thus far in hopes 
gathering something from his unguarded enthu
the student salamanca
siam senor said he this is all rambling
visionary talk you are charged with sorcery
and in defence you give us a rhapsody about alchymy
have you nothing better than this to
offer in your defence 
the old man slowly resumed his seat but did
not deign a reply the fire that had beamed
in his eye gradually expired his cheek resumed
its wonted paleness but he did not relapse
into inanity he sat with a serene steady patient
look like one prepared not to contend but
to suffer
his trial continued for a long time with cruel
mockery justice for no witnesses were ever in
this court confronted with the accused and the
latter had continually to defend himself in the
dark some unknown and powerful enemy
had alleged charges against the unfortunate alchymist
but who he could not imagine stranger
and sojourner as he was in the land solitary
and harmless in his pursuits how could he have
provoked such hostility the tide secret testimony
however was too strong against him he
the student salamanca 
was convicted the crime magic and condemned
to expiate his sins at the stake at the
approaching autodafe
while the alchymist was undergoing his trial
at the inquisition his unhappy daughter was
exposed to trials no less severe don ambrosio
into whose hands she had fallen was as has
before been intimated one the most daring and
lawless profligates in all granada he was a
man hot blood and headlong passions that
stopped at nothing in pursuit his desires yet
with all these he possessed manners address and
accomplishments that had made him eminently
successful with the sex he was sated however
with easy conquests and wearied with a life 
continual and prompt gratification there had
been a degree difficulty and enterprize in the
pursuit inez that he had never before experienced
it had aroused him from the monotony
 mere sensual life and stimulated him
with all the charm adventure now that he
had her in his power he was determined to protract
the pleasure pursuit he was vain 
 the student salamanca
his person and address and it was a kind trial
 skill to endeavour to gain by art and ingenuity
what he could at any time obtain by violence
he affected to treat her with respect and
kindness he endeavoured to soothe her alarms
concerning her father by assurances his safety
and that she should soon be restored to him
every means was lavished to calm and soften
her and if possible to dispose her mind to favourable
impressions the house resounded
with soft music the apartments breathed perfumes
 all about her enticed to pleasure and voluptuousness
 but the heart inez turned with
distaste from the cruel mockery and if eves
don ambrosio deceived by the mute dejection
into which she would sometimes sink would attempt
to plead his passion she recoiled from
him with loathing and detestation
the vanity don ambrosio was at length
incensed at this inflexible scorn from one whom
he considered so far beneath him and who
ought to have felt honoured by his admiration
still he was determined that his triumph should
the student salamanca 
be by artifice and that she should be in a manner
accessary to her own dishonour since all
his arts seduction were no avail he endeavoured
to conquer her through her fears
he now informed her her father's confinement
in the prison the inquisition that his
case was desperate that it depended upon the
evidence don ambrosio and others who were
at his beck either to save or destroy him but
i am wrong added he it is with you beautiful
inez to say the word life or death
one kind word and you will behold me at your
feet your father at liberty and in affluence and
we shall all be happy
inez listened to him with scorn and disbelief
she looked upon it as another his deceptions
my father exclaimed she is too inoffensive
to attract persecution he is too innocent and
good to be suspected crime tis a base a
cruel artifice don ambrosio repeated what he
had said with solemn protestations its truth
but she turned from him with indignation and
he felt awed and surprised at the pride and
 the student salamanca
loftiness her demeanour he had now gone
too far to retrace his steps and resume the affectation
 kindness a few days after he brought
her the proclamation the approaching 
in which the prisoners were enumerated
she glanced her eye over it and saw her father's
name condemned to the stake for sorcery
for a moment her brain reeled she stood transfixed
with horror the artful ambrosio seized
upon the transient calm think now beautiful
inez said he with a tone affected tenderness
 his life is yet in your hands one word
from you and i can save him
monster wretch murderer exclaimed
she recoiling with shuddering abhorrence
then clasping her hands with frantic violence
oh my father my father cried she in a
tone frantic agony
the perfidious ambrosio saw the torture 
her soul and anticipated from it a triumph he
saw she was in no mood during her present paroxysm
to listen to his words but he trusted
that a night agony would subdue her stubborn
resolution
the student salamanca 
tomorrow said he as he left the room
is to be the autodafe one night more have
you to reflect tomorrow you will hear the
very tumult the procession that carries your
father to his death you will almost hear the
groans from his funeral pile i leave you to
yourself think whether you can stand all this
without shrinking think whether you can
endure the reflection that you were the cause 
his death and that merely from a perversity in
refusing proffered happiness
what a night was it to inez her heart
already harassed and almost broken by repeated
and protracted anxieties and terrors her form
wasted and nearly exhausted on every side
horrors surrounded her there seemed to be no
escape from misery and perdition is there no
relief from man no pity in heaven exclaimed
she what what have we done that we should
be thus wretched all night long she paced
her chamber her mind in a whirl anguish and
dismay as the dawn approached she heard
the distant tread footsteps in the street and the
vol i 
 the student salamanca
confused murmur voices she fancied it the
early stir the populace always eager in spain
for this horrid ceremony at sunrise the great
bell the cathedral began to toll its awful notes
 funeral preparation every stroke seemed to
beat upon her heart and inflict an absolute corporeal
pang her blood grew hot in her veins 
her tongue was parched she panted and gasped
rather than breathed blessed virgin exclaimed
she clasping her hands and turning up

her strained eyes look down with pity and
support me in this hour agony 
all granada was in agitation on the morning
 this dismal day the heavy bell the cathedral
continued to utter its clanging tones that
pervaded every part the city summoning all
persons to the tremendous spectacle that was
about to be exhibited the streets through
which the procession was to pass were crowded
with the populace the windows the roofs
every place that would admit a face or a foothold
was alive with spectators in the great
square a spacious scaffolding like an amphitheatre
student salamanca 
tre was erected where the sentences the prisoners
were to be read and the sermon faith
to be preached and close by were the stakes
prepared where the condemned were to be
burnt to death seats were arranged for the
great the gay the beautiful for such is the
horrible curiosity human nature that this
cruel sacrifice was attended with more eagerness
than a theatre or even a ball feast
as the day advanced the scaffolds and balconies
were filled with expecting multitudes the
sun shone brightly upon fair faces and gallant
dresses one would have thought it some scene
 elegant festivity instead an exhibition 
human agony and death but what a different
spectacle and ceremony was this from those
which granada exhibited in the days her
moorish splendour her galas her tournaments
her sports the ring her fetes st
john her music her umbras and admirable
tilts with canes her serenades her concerts
her songs in generalise the costly liveries
 the abencerrages their exquisite inventions 
 the student salamanca
the skill and valour the alabeces the superb
dresses the series mazas and gomez 
all these were at an the days chivalry
were over instead the prancing cavalcade
with neighing steed and lively trumpet with
burnished lance and helm and buckler with
rich confusion plume and scarf and banner
where purple and scarlet and green and orange
and every gay colour were mingled with cloth
 gold and fair embroidery instead this
crept on the gloomy pageant superstition in
cowl and sackcloth with cross and coffin and
frightful symbols human suffering in place
 the frank hardy knight open and brave with
his lady s favour in his casque and amorous
motto on his shield looking by gallant deeds to
the smile beauty came the shaven unmanly
monk with downcast eyes and head and heart
bleached in the cold cloister secretly exulting
in this bigot triumph
the sound the bells gave notice that the
road's civil wars granada
the student salamanca 
dismal procession was advancing it passed
slowly through the principal streets the city
bearing in advance the awful banner the holy
office the prisoners walked singly attended
by confessors and guarded by familiars the
inquisition they were clad in different garments
according to the nature their punishments
 those who were to suffer death wore
the hideous samaria painted with flames and
demons the procession was swelled by choirs
 boys by different religious orders and public
dignitaries and above all by the fathers 
the faith moving with slow pace and profound
gravity truly triumphing as becomes the
principal generals that great victory
as the much dreaded banner the inquisition
advanced the countless throng sunk on
their knees before it they bowed their faces to
the very earth as it passed and then slowly rose
again like a great undulating billow a murmur
 tongues prevailed as the prisoners approached
 and eager eyes we're strained and
gonsalvius p 
 the student salamanca
fingers pointed to distinguish the different orders
 penitents whose habits denoted the degree
 punishment they were to undergo but
as those drew near whose frightful garb marked
them as destined to the flames the noise the
rabble subsided they seemed almost to hold in
their breaths filled with that strange and dismal
interest with which we contemplate a human
being on the verge suffering and death
it is an awful thing a voiceless noiseless
multitude the hushed and gazing stillness 
the surrounding thousands heaped on walls
and gates and roofs and hanging as it were in
clusters heightened the effect the pageant that
moved drearily on the low murmuring the
priests could now be heard in prayer and exhortation
with the faint responses the prisoners
and now and then the voices the choir at a
distance chanting the litanies the saints
the faces the prisoners were ghastly and
disconsolate even those who had been pardoned
and wore the sanbenito or penitential garment
bare traces the horrors they had underthe
student salamanca 
gone some were feeble and tottering from long
confinement some crippled and distorted by various
tortures every countenance was a dismal
page on which might be read the secrets their
prison house but in the looks those condemned
to death there was something fierce and
eager they seemed men harrowed up by
the past and desperate as to the future they
were anticipating with spirits fevered by despair
and fixed and clenched determination the
vehement struggle with agony and death which
they were shortly to undergo some cast now
and then a wild and anguished look about them
upon the shining day the sunlight palaces 
the gay the beautiful world which they w r ere
soon to quit for ever or a glance sudden indignation
at the thronging thousands happy in
liberty and life who seemed in contemplating
their frightful situation to exult in their own
comparative security
one among the condemned however was
an exception to these remarks he was an
aged man somewhat bowed down with a serene
 the student salamanca
though dejected countenance and a beaming
melancholy eye it was the alchymist the
populace looked upon him with a degree compassion
which they were not prone to feel towards
criminals condemned by the inquisition 
but when they were told he was convicted the
crime magic they drew back with awe and
abhorrence
the procession had reached the grand square
the first part had already mounted the scaffold
and the condemned were approaching the
press the populace became excessive and was
repelled as it were in billows by the guards
just as the condemned were entering the square
a shrieking was heard among the crowd a
female pale frantic dishevelled was seen struggling
through the multitude my father my
father was all the cry she uttered but it
thrilled through every heart the crowd instinctively
drew back and made way for her as she
advanced
the poor alchymist had made his peace with
heaven and by hard struggle had closed his
the student salamanca 
heart upon the world when the voice his
child called him once more back to worldly
thought and agony he turned towards the
wellknown voice his knees smote together he
endeavoured to stretch forth his pinioned arms
and felt himself clasped in the embraces his
child the emotions both were too agonizing
for utterance convulsive sobs and broken exclamations
and embraces more anguish than
tenderness were all that passed between them
the procession was interrupted for a moment
the astonished monks and familiars were filled
with involuntary respect at this agony natural
affection ejaculations pity broke from the
crowd touched by the filial piety the extraordinary
and hopeless anguish so young and
beautiful a being
every attempt to soothe her and prevail on
her to retire was unheeded at length they endeavoured
to separate her from her father by
force the movement roused her from her temporary
abandonment
with a sudden paroxysm fury she snatched
vol i 
 the student salamanca
a sword from one the familiars her late
pale countenance was flushed with rage and fire
flashed from her once soft and languishing eyes
the guards shrunk back with awe there
was something in this filial frenzy this feminine
tenderness wrought up to desperation that
touched even their hardened hearts they endeavoured
to pacify her but in vain her eye
was eager and quick as the she wolf's guarding
her young with one arm she pressed her father
to her bosom with the other she menaced everyone
that approached
the patience the guards was very soon exhausted
they had held back in awe but not
in fear with all her desperation the weapon
was soon wrested from her feeble hand and she
was borne shrieking and struggling among the
crowd the rabble murmured compassion but
such was the dread inspired by the inquisition
that no one attempted to interfere
the procession again resumed its march inez
was ineffectually struggling to release herself
from the hands the familiars that detained
the student salamanca 
her when suddenly she saw don ambrosio before
her wretched girl exclaimed he with
fury why have you fled from your friends 
deliver her said he to the familiars to my
domestics she is under my protection
his creatures advanced to seize her oh
no oh no cried she with new terrors and
clinging to the familiars i have fled from no
friends he is not my protector he is the
murderer my father 
the familiars were perplexed the crowd
pressed on with eager curiosity stand off
cried the fiery ambrosio dashing the throng
from around him then turning to the familiars
with sudden moderation my friends
said he deliver this poor girl to me her distress
has turned her brain she has escaped from
her friends and protectors this morning during
the confusion the house as the procession
went by a little quiet and kind treatment
will restore her to tranquillity
i am not mad i am not mad cried she
vehemently oh save me save me from
 the student salamanca
these men i have no protector on earth but my
father and him they are murdering 
the familiars shook their heads her wildness
corroborated the assertions don ambrosio
and his apparent rank commanded respect and
belief they relinquished their charge to him
and he was consigning the struggling inez to
his creatures let go your hold villain
cried a voice from among the crowd and antonio
was seen eagerly tearing his way through
the press people
seize him seize him cried don am
brosio to the familiars tis an accomplice 
the sorcerer
liar retorted antonio as he thrust the
mob to the right and left and forced himself to
the spot
the sword don ambrosio flashed in an
instant from the scabbard the student was
armed and equally alert there was a fierce
clash weapons the crowd made way for
them as they fought and closed again so as
to hide them from the view inez all was
the student salamanca 
tumult and confusion for a moment when there
was a kind shout from the spectators and
the mob again opening she beheld as she
thought antonio weltering in his blood
this new shock was too great for her already
overstrained intellects a giddiness seized
upon her every thing seemed to whirl before
her eyes she gasped some incoherent words
and sunk senseless upon the ground
days weeks elapsed before inez returned to
consciousness at length she opened her eyes
as if out a troubled sleep she was lying
upon a magnificent bed in a chamber richly
furnished with pier glasses and massive tables
inlaid with silver exquisite workmanship
the walls were covered with tapestry the cornices
richly gilded through the door which
stood open she perceived a superb saloon with
statues and chrystal lustres and a magnificent
suite apartments beyond the casements 
the room were open to admit the soft breath 
summer which stole in laden with perfumes
from a neighbouring garden from whence
the student salamanca
also the refreshing sounds fountains and the
sweet notes birds came in mingled music to
her ears female attendants were moving with
noiseless step about the apartment but as she
gazed around in silent wonder her eye rested
upon a new object interest in a chair at
the head her bed sat a venerable form
watching over her with a look fond anxiety
it was her father i will not attempt to describe
the scene that ensued nor the moments
 rapture which more than repaid all the sufferings
her affectionate heart had undergone as
soon as their feelings had become more calm
the alchymist stepped out the room to introduce
a stranger to whom they were indebted
for their lives and liberties he returned leading
in antonio no longer in his poor scholar's
garb but in the rich dress a nobleman
the feelings inez were nearly overpowered
by the sudden reverses and it was some time
before she was sufficiently calm to comprehend
the explanation this seeming romance
it appeared that the lover who had sought her
the student salamanca 
affections in the lowly guise a student was
only son and heir a powerful grandee valentia
some youthful irregularities had drawn
on him the displeasure his father he had
absented himself from home and remained incognito
at granada with a full resolve by study
and self regulation to reinstate himself in his
father's favour how hard he had studied
does not remain on record all that we know
is his romantic adventure the tower
it was at first a mere youthful caprice excited
by a glimpse a beautiful face in becoming a
disciple the achy mist he probably thought 
nothing more than pursuing a light love adventure
farther acquaintance however completely
fixed his affections in the mean time
he had been traced to his concealment his
father had relieved intelligence doubtless from
don ambrosio his being entangled in the
snares a mysterious adventurer and his daughter
trusty emissaries had been sent to seize
upon him and convey him by force to the paternal
home
 the student salamanca
what eloquence he used with his father to
convince him the perfect innocence and noble
descent the alchemist and the exalted worth
 his daughter does not appear all that we
know is that the father though a very passionate
was a very reasonable man as appears by
his consenting that his son should return to granada
and conduct inez as his affianced bride to
valentia on his arrival he had been shocked
at finding the tower deserted and reading the
alchymist's name on the list the condemned
at the autodafe he arrived just in time to
save him from the flames it was don ambrosia
that had fallen in their contest being
o
severely wounded and thinking his approaching
he had confessed to one the fathers
 the inquisition that he was the sole cause 
the alchymist's condemnation and that the evidence
on which it was founded was altogether
false the testimony don antonio came
in corroboration his innocence and as he was
a relation the grand inquisitor's it perhaps had
more than usual weight thus the poor alchy
the student salamanca 
mist was in a manner snatched from the very
flames and so great had been the sympathy excited
in his case that for once the populace
rejoiced in being disappointed an execution
the residue this story may readily be imagined
by any one versed in this valuable kind 
history don antonio married the lovely inez
and took her and her father with him to valencia
as she had been a loving and dutiful daughter
so she proved a true and tender wife it was
not long before he succeeded to his father's titles
and estates and he and his fair spouse were renowned
for being the handsomest and happiest
couple in all valentia
as to don ambrosio he partially recovered
to the enjoyment a broken constitution and a
blasted name and hid his remorse and disgraces
in a convent
the worthy alchymist took up his abode with
his children a pavilion in their garden was
assigned to him as a laboratory where he resumed
his researches after the grand secret he
was now and then assisted by his soninlaw
vol i 
 the student salamanca
but the latter slackened grievously in his zeal and
diligence after marriage still he would listen
with profound gravity and attention to the old
man's quotations from paracelsus sandivogius
and peter d'abano which daily grew longer
and longer in this way the good alchymist
lived on quietly and comfortably to what is called
a good old age that is to say an age that is
good for nothing and unfortunately for mankind
was hurried out life in his ninetieth
year just as he was on the point discovering
the philosopher's stone
such was the story the captain's friend 
which whiled away the whole morning very
tolerably the captain was every now and then
interrupted by questions and remarks which i
have not mentioned lest i should break the continuity
 the tale
he was also a little disturbed once or twice
by the general who fell asleep and breathed

the student salamanca 
rather hard to the great horror and annoyance
 lady lillycraft in a long and tender love
passage also which was particularly to her
ladyship's taste the unlucky general having his
head a little sunk upon his breast kept making
a sound at regular intervals very much like the
word pish long drawn out at length he made
an odd guttural sound that suddenly woke him 
he hemmed looked about with a slight degree
 consternation and then began to play with
her ladyship's work bag which however she
rather pettishly withdrew the steady sound
 the captain's voice however was too potent
a soporific for the poor general he kept gleaming
up and sinking in the socket until the cessation
 the tale again roused him when he
started awake put his foot down upon lady
lilly craft's cur the sleeping beauty which yelled
and seized him by the leg and in a moment
the whole library resounded with yelping and
exclamations never did a man more completely
mar his fortunes while he was asleep
silence was at length restored all the company
 the student op salamanca
expressed their thanks to the captain and gave
various opinions the story the parson said
he should have liked to have heard more the
leaden manuscript dug up at granada the general
said he could not well make out the drift
 the story he thought it a little confused i
am glad however said he that they burnt the
old chap the tower for i have no doubt he
was a notorious impostor

stay for the king has thrown his warder down
richard 
the combatants whom we left engaged at the
 the last volume made mutual passes at
each other with apparently equal skill and courage
charles had been too often in action and
too long a party as well as a victim to civil war
to find anything new or surprising in being obliged
to defend himself with his own hands and
everard had been distinguished as well for his
personal bravery as for the other properties 
c
 woodstock
a commander but the arrival a thud party
prevented the tragic conclusion a combat in
which the success either party must have given
him much cause for regretting his victory
it was the old knight himself who arrived
mounted upon a forest pony for the war and sequestration
had left him no steed a more dignified
description he thrust himself between the
combatants and commanded them on their lives to
hold so soon as a glance from one to the other
had ascertained to him whom he had to deal with
hedenanded whether the devils woodstock
whom folks talked about had got possession 
them both that they were tilting at each other
within the verge the royal liberties let me
tell both you he said that while old henry
fine is at woodstock the immunities the park
shall be maintained as much as if the king were
still on the throne none shall fight dwells here
excepting the stags in their seasons put up both
 you or i shall lug out as herdsman and prove
perhaps the worse devil the three as will
says
 ril so maul you and your toastingirons
that you sliull lliink illic devil has conic i'roui litll 
woodstock
the combatants desisted from their encounter
but stood looking at each other sullenly asmen
do in such a situation each unwilling to seem
to desire peace more than the other and averse
therefore to be the first to sheathe his sword
return your weapons gentlemen upon the
spot said the knight yet more peremptorily
one and both you or you will have something
to do with me i promise you you maybe
thankful times are changed i have known
them such that your insolence might have cost
each you your hand if not redeemed with a
round sum money nephew if you do not
mean to alienate me for ever i command you to
put up master kerneguy you are my guest
i request you not to do me the insult remaining
with your sword drawn where it is my
duty to see peace observed
 i obey you sir henry said the king
sheathing his rapier i hardly indeed know
wherefore i was assaulted by this gentleman
i assure you none respects the king's person or
privileges more than thyself though the devotion
is somewhat out fashion 
 woodstock
we may find a place to meet sir replied
everard where neither the royal person nor
privileges can be offended
faith very hardly sir said charles unable
to suppress the rising jest i mean the
king has so few followers that the loss the
least them might be some small damage to him
but risking all that i will meet you wherever
there is fair field for a poor cavalier to get off in
safety if he has the luck in fight
sir henry lee's first idea had been fixed upon
the insult offered to the royal demesne he now
began to turn them towards the safety his
kinsman and the young royalist as he deemed
him gentlemen he said i must insist on
this business being put to a final nephew
markham is this your return for my condescension
in coming back to woodstock on your warrant
that you should take an opportunity to cut
the throat my guest 
if you knew his purpose as well as i do 
said markham and then paused conscious that
he might only incense his uncle without convincing
him as anything he might say kerneguy's
woodstock 
addresses to alice was like to be imputed to his
own jealous suspicions he looked on the ground
therefore and was silent
and you master kerneguysaid sir henry
can you give me any reason why you seek to
take the use this young man in whom though
unhappily forgetful his loyalty and duty i
must yet take some interest as my nephew by
affinity 
 i was not aware the gentleman enjoyed that
honour which certainly would have protected
him from my sword answered kerneguy but
the quarrel is his nor can i tell any reason why
he fixed it upon me unless it were the difference
 our political opinions
you know the contrary said everard
you know that i told you you were safe from
me as a fugitive royalist and your last words
showed you were at no loss to guess my connexion
with sir henry that indeed is little
consequence i should debase myself did i use
the relationship as a means protection from
you or any one
as they thus disputed neither choosing to 
woodstock
proach the real cause quarrel sir henry looked
from the one to the other with a peacemaking
countenance exclaiming 
 why what an intricate impeach is this 
i think you both have drunk circe's cup
come my young masters allow an old man to
mediate between you i am not shortsighted in
such matters the mother mischief is no bigger
than a gnat's wing and i have known fifty
instances in my own day when as will says
gallants have been confronted hardily
in single opposition hand to hand
in which after the field was fought no one could
remember the cause quarrel tush a small
thing will do it the taking the wall or the
gentle rub the shoulder in passing each other
or a hasty word or a misconceived gesturecome
forget your cause quarrel be what it will
you have had your breathing and though you
put up your rapiers unbodied that was no default
 yours but by command your elder
and one who had right to use authority in malta
where the duello is punctiliously well understood
the persons engaged in a single combat
wooustock 
are bound to halt on the command a knight
or priest or lady and the quarrel so interrupted
is held as honourably terminated and may not
be revived nephew it is i think impossible
that you can nourish spleen against this young
gentleman for having fought for his king hear
my honest proposal markham you know i
bear no malice though i have some reason to be
offended with you give the young man your
hand in friendship and we will back to the
lodge all three together and drink a cup 
sack in token reconciliations
markham everard found himself unable to
resist this approach towards kindness on his uncle's
part he suspected indeed what was partly
the truth that it was not entirely from reviving
good will but also that his uncle thought
by such attention to secure his neutrality at least
if not his assistance for the safety the fugitive
royalist he was sensible that he was placed in
an awkward predicament and that he might incur
the suspicions his own party for holding
intercourse even with a near relation who harboured
such guests but on the other hand he
thought his services to the commonwealth had
 woodstock 
been sufficient importance to outweigh whatever
envy might urge on that topic indeed although
the civil war had divided families much
and in many various ways yet when it seemed
ended by the triumph the republicans the
rage political hatred began to relent and the
ancient ties kindred and friendship regained at
least a part their former influence many reunions
were formed and those who like everard
adhered to the conquering party often exerted
themselves for the protection then deserted
relatives
as these things rushed through his mind accompanied
with the prospect a renewed intercourse
with alice lee by means which he
might be at hand to protect her against every
chance either injury or insult he held out his
hand to the supposed scottish page saying at
the same time that for his part he was very
ready to forget the cause quarrel or rather to
consider it as arising out a misapprehension
and to offer master kerneguy such friendship as
might exist between honourable men who had
embraced different sides in politics
unable to overcome the feeling personal
woodstock 
dignity which prudence recommended to him
to forget louis kerneguy in return bowed low
but without accepting everard's proffered hand
 he had no occasion he said to make any
exertions to forget the cause quarrel for he
had never been able to comprehend it but ashe
had not shunned the gentleman's resentment
so he was now willing to embrace and return any
degree his favour with which he might be
pleased to honour him
everard withdrew his hand with a smile and
bowed in return to the salutation the page
whose stiff reception his advances he imputed
to the proud pettish disposition a scotch boy
trained up in ideas family consequence and
personal importance which his acquaintance with
the world had not yet been sufficient to dispel
sir henry lee delighted with the termination
 the quarrel which he supposed to be in
deep deference to his own authority and not displeased
with the opportunity renewing some
acquaintance with his nephew who had notwithstanding
his political demerits a warmer interest
in his affections than he was perhaps himself
aware said in a tone consolation never
woodstock
be mortified young gentlemen i protest it went
to my heart to part you when i saw you stretching
yourselves so handsomely and in fair love 
honour without any malicious or bloodthirsty
thoughts i promise you had it not been for
my duty as ranger here and sworn to the office
i would rather have been your umpire than
your hindrance but a finished quarrel is a
forgotten quarrel and your tilting should have
no further consequence excepting the appetite it
may have given you
so saying he mounted his pony and moved
forward in triumph towards the lodge by the
nearest alley his feet almost touching the ground
the ball his toe just resting in the stirrup 
the fore part the thigh brought round to the
saddle the heels turned outwards and sunk as
much as possible his body precisely erect the
reins properly and systematically divided in his
left hand his right holding a ridingrod diagonally
pointed towards the horse's left ear he
seemed a champion the menage fit to have
reined bucephalus himself his youthful companions
who attended on either hand like equerry
wooustock 
nes could scarce suppress a smile at the completely
adjusted and systematic posture the
rider contrasted with the wild and diminutive
appearance the pony with its shaggy coat and
long tail and mane and its keen eyes sparkling
like red coals from amongst the mass hair
which fell over its small countenance if the
reader has the duke newcastle's on horsemanship
splendid moles he may have some
idea the figure the good knight if he can
conceive such a figure as one the cavaliers there
represented seated in all the graces his art
on a welch or exmoor pony in its native savage
state without grooming or discipline any
kind the ridicule being greatly enhanced by the
disproportion size betwixt the animal and its
rider
perhaps the knight saw their wonder for the
first words he said after they left the ground
were pixie though small is mettlesome gentlemen
here he contrived that pixie should
himself corroborate the assertion by executing a
gambade he is diminutive but full spirit 
indeed save that i am somewhat too large for
hi
 woodstock
an elfin horseman the knight was upwards 
six feet high i should remind myself when i
mount him the fairy king as described by
mike drayton 
himself he on an earwig set
yet scarce upon his back could get
so oft and high he did curvet
ere he himself did settle
he made him stop and turn and bound
to gallop and to trot the round
he scarce could stand on any ground
he was so full mettle
my old friend pixie said everard stroking
the pony's neck i am glad that hellas
survived all these bustling days pixie must be
above twenty years old sir henry 
above twenty years certainly yes nephew
markham war is a whirlwind in a plantation
mhich only spares what is least worth leaving
old pixie and his old master have survived many
a tall fellow and many a great horse neither 
them good for much themselves yet as will
says an old man can do somewhat so pixie
and i still survive
so saying he again contrived that pixie should
show some remnants activity
woodstock 
 still survive said the young scot completing
the sentence which the good knight had left
unfinished ay still survive
to witch the world with noble horsemanship 
everard coloured for he felt the irony but
not so his uncle whose simple vanity never permitted
him to doubt the sincerity the compliment

are you advised that he said in king
james's time indeed i have appeared in the
tiltyard and there you might have said 
you saw young harry with his beaver up
as to seeing old harry why here the
knight paused and looked as a bashful man in
labour a pun as to old harry why you
might as well see the devil you take me master
kerneguy the devil you know is my namesake
ha ha ha cousin everard i hope your
precision is not startled by an innocent jest 
he was so delighted with the applause both
his companions that he recited the whole the
celebrated passage referred to and concluded
 woodstock
with defying the present age bundle all its wits
donne cowley waller and the rest them together
to produce a poet a tenth part the
genius old will
why we are said to have one his descendants
among us sir william d'avenant
said louis kerneguy and many think him as
clever a fellow
what exclaimed sir henry will
davenant whom i knew in the north an officer
under newcastle when the marquis lay before
hull why he was an honest cavalier and ivrote
good doggrel enough but how came he akin to
will shakspeare i trow 
why replied the young scot by the
surer side the house and after the old fashion
if davenant speaks truth it seems that his
mother was a goodlooking laughing buxom
mistress an inn between stratford and london
at which will shakspeare often quartered
as he went down to his native town and that out
 friendship and gossipred as we say in scotland
will shakspeare became godfather to will
d'avcnant and not contented with this spiritual
woodstock 
activity the younger will is for establishing some
claim to a natural one alleging that his mother
was a great admirer wit and there were no
bounds to her complaisance for men genius
out upon the hound said colonel everard
 would he purchase the reputation descending
from poet or from prince at the expense
 his mother's good fame this nose ought to
be slit
that would be difficult answered the disguised
prince recollecting the peculiarity the
bard's countenance
will d'avenant the son will shakspeare
 said the knight who had not yet recovered
his surprise at the enormity the pretension
 why it reminds me a verse in the 
 phaeton where the hero complains
to his mother 
besides by all the village boys i am shamed
you the sun's son you rascal you be d ed 
we observe this couplet in fielding's farce tumbledown
dick founded on the same classical story as it was current in
the time the commonwealth it must have reached the author
 tom jones by tradition for no one will suspect the present
author making the anachronism
vol iii b
 woodstock
i never heard such unblushing assurance in my
life swill d'avenant the son the brightest
and best poet that ever was is or will be but
i crave your pardon nephew you i believe
love no stageplays
nay i am not altogether so precise as you
would make me uncle i have loved them perhaps
too well in my time and now i condemn
them not altogether or in gross though i approve
not their excesses and extravagances i
cannot even in shakspeare but see many things
both scandalous to decency and prejudicial to
good manners many things which tend to ridicule
virtue or to recommend vice at least to
mitigate the hideousness its features i cannot
think these fine poems are an useful study
and especially for the youth either sex in
which bloodshed is pointed out as the chief occupation
 the men and intrigue as the sole employment
 the women
in making these observations everard was
simple enough to think that he was only giving
his uncle an opportunity defending a favourite
opinion without offending him by a contrawoodstock

diction which was so limited and mitigated but
here as on other occasions he forgot how obstinate
his uncle was in his views whether religion
policy or taste and that it would be as easy to
convert him to the presbyterian form government
or engage him to take the abjuration oath
as to shake his belief in shakspeare there was
another peculiarity in the good knight's mode 
arguing which everard being himself a plain
and downright character and one whose religious
tenets were in some degree unfavourable to the
suppressions and simulations often used in society
could never perfectly understand sir henry
sensible his natural heat temper was
wont scrupulously to guard against it and would
for some time when in fact much offended conduct
a debate with all the external appearance 
composure till the violence his feelings would
rise so high as to overcome and bear away the
artificial barriers opposed to it and rush down
upon the adversary with accumulating wrath it
thus frequently happened that like a wily old
general he retreated in the face his disputant
in good order and by degrees with so moderate
w woodstock
a degree resistance as to draw on his antagonist's
pursuit to the spot where at length making
a sudden and unexpected attack with horse
foot and artillery at once he seldom failed to
confound the enemy though he might not overthrow
him
it was on this principle therefore that hearing
everard's last observation he disguised his angry
feelings and answered with a tone where politeness
was called in to keep guard upon passion
that undoubtedly the presbyterian gentry had
given through the whole these unhappy times
such proofs an humble unaspiring and unambitious
desire the public good as entitled them
to general credit for the sincerity those very
strong scruples which they entertained against
works in which the noblest sentiments religion
and virtue sentiments which might convert
hardened sinners and be placed with propriety
in the mouths dying saints and martyrs
happened from the rudeness and coarse taste
 the times to be mixed with some broad jests
and similar matter which lay not mich in the
way excepting those who painfully sought it
woodstock sjl
out that they might use it in vilifying what was
in itself deserving the highest applause but
what he wished especially to know from his nephew
was whether any those gifted men
who had expelled the learned scholars and deep
divines the church england from the pulpit
and now flourished in their stead received
any inspiration from the muses if he might use
so profane a term without offence to colonel everard
or whether they were not as sottishly and
brutally averse from elegant letters as they were
from humanity and common sense 
colonel everard might have guessed by the
ironical tone in which this speech was delivered
what storm was mustering within his uncle's bosom
 nay he might have conjectured the state
 the old knight's feelings from his emphasis on
the word colonel by which epithet as that which
most connected his nephew with the party he
hated he never distinguished everard unless
when his wrath was rising while on the contrary
when disposed to be on good terms with
him he usually called him kinsman or nephew
markham indeed it was under a partial sense
n
woodstock
that this was the case and in the hope to see his
cousin alice that the colonel forbore making any
answer to the harangue his uncle which had
concluded just as the old knight had alighted at
the door the lodge and was entering the
hall followed by his two attendants
phoebe at the same time made her appearance
in the hall and received orders to bring some
beverage for the gentlemen the hebe 
woodstock failed not to recognize and welcome
everard by an almost imperceptible courtesy 
but she did not serve her interest as she designed
when she asked the knight as a question 
course whether he commanded the attendance 
mistress alice a stern no was the decided reply
and the illtimed interference seemed to increase
his previous irritation against everard for
his depreciation shakspeare i would insist
said sir henry resuming the obnoxious sub 
sect were it fit for a poor disbanded cavalier to
use such a phrase towards a commander the
conquering army upon knowing whether the
convulsion which has sent us saints and prophets
without has not also afforded us a poet with
woodstock s
enough both gifts and grace to outshine poor
old will the oracle and idol us blinded and
carnal cavaliers
surely sir replied colonel everard i
know verses written by a friend the commonwealth
and those too a dramatic character
which weighed in an impartial scale might equal
even the poetry shakspeare and which are free
from the fustian and indelicacy with which that
great bard was sometimes content to feed the
coarse appetites his barbarous audience
indeed said the knight keeping down his
wrath with difficulty i should like to be acquainted
with this masterpiece poetry may
we ask the name this distinguished person 
it must be vicars or withers at least
said the feigned page
no sir replied everard nor drummond
 hawthorne nor lord stirling neither 
and yet the verses will vindicate what i say if
you will make allowance for indifferent recitation
for i am better accustomed to speak to a
battalion than to those who love the muses the
speaker is a lady benighted who having lost her
 woodstock
way in a pathless forest at first expresses herself
agitated by the supernatural fears to which
her situation gave rise
a play too and written by a roundhead
author said sir henry in surprise
a dramatic production at least replied his
nephew and began to recite simply but with
feeling the lines now so well known but which
had then obtained no celebrity the fame the
author resting upon the basis rather his polemical
and political publications than on the poetry
doomed in after days to support the eternal
structure his immortality
these thoughts may startle but will not astound
the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
by a strongsiding champion conscience
my own opinion nephew markham my
own opinion better expressed but j must what i
said when the scoundrelly roundheads pretended
to see ghosts at woodstock go on i prithee

everard proceeded 
o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope
thou hovering angel girt with golden wings
and thou unblemish'd form chastity 
woodstock 
 see ye visibly and now believe
that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
are but as slavish officers vengeance
would send a glittering guardian if need were
to keep my life and honour assailed
was i deceived or did a sable cloud
turn forth her silver lining on the night 
the rest has escaped me said the reciter 
and i marvel i have been able to remember so
much
sir henry lee who had expected some effusion
very different from those classical and beautiful
lines soon changed the scornful expression
 his countenance relaxed his contorted upper
lip and stroking down his beard with his left
hand rested the forefinger the right upon his
eyebrow in sign profound attention after
everard had ceased speaking the old man sighed
as at the a strain sweet music he then
spoke in a gentler manner than formerly
cousin markham he said these verses
flow sweetly and sound in my ears like the welltouched
warbling a lute but thou knowest
i am something slow apprehending the full
meaning that which i hear for the first time
repeat mc these verses again slowly and delibc
 woodstock
lately for i always love to hear poetry twice
the first time for sound and the latter time for
sense
thus encouraged everard recited again the
lines with more hardihood and better effect the
knight distinctly understanding and from his
looks and motions highly applauding them
yes he broke out when everard was
again silent yes i do call that poetry 
though it were even written by a presbyterian
or an anabaptist either ay there were good and
righteous people to be found even amongst the offending
towns which were destroyed by fire and
certainly i have heard though but with little
credence begging your pardon cousin everard
that there are men among you who have seen the
error their ways in rebelling against the best
and kindest masters and bringing it to that
pass that he was murdered by a gang yet fiercer
than themselves ay doubtless the gentleness
 spirit and the purity mind which dictated
those beautiful lines has long ago taught a man
so amiable to say i have sinned i have sinned
yes i doubt not so sweet a harp has been broken
woodstock 
even in remorse for the crimes he was witness
to and now he sits drooping for the shame and
sorrow england all his noble rhymes as
will says
like sweet bells jangled out tune and harsh
dost thou not think so master kerneguy 
not i sir henry answered the page
what dost not believe the author these
lines must needs be the better file and leaning
to our persuasion 
i think sir henry that the poetry qualifies
the author to write a play on the subject dame
potiphar and her recusant lover and as for his
calling that last metaphor the cloud in a black
coat or cloak with silver lining would have dubbed
him a tailor with me only that i happen to
know that he is a schoolmaster by profession
and by political opinions qualified to be poet
laureate to cromwell for what colonel everard
has repeated with such unction is the production
 no less celebrated a person than john
milton
 woodstock
 john milton exclaimed sir henry in astonishment
 what john milton the blasphemous
and bloodyminded author the defense
populi anglican the advocate the infernal
high court fiends the creature and parasite
 that grand impostor that loathsome hypocrite
that detestable monster that prodigy the universe
that disgrace mankind that landscape 
iniquity that sink sin and that compendium
 baseness oliver cromwell 
even the same john milton answered
charles schoolmaster to little boys and tailor
to the clouds which he furnishes with suits 
black lined with silver at no other expense than
that common sense
markham everard said the old knight
i will never forgive thee never never thou
hast made me speak words praise respecting
one whose offal should fatten the regionkites 
speak not to me sir but begone am i your
kinsman and benefactor a fit person to be juggled
out ray commendation and praise and
brought to bedaub such a whitened sepulchre as
the sophist mihon 
woodstock 
i profess said everard this is hard measure
sir henry you pressed rne you defied
me to produce poetry as good as shakspeare's
i only thought the verses not the politics
 milton
oh yes sir replied sir henry we well
know your power making distinctions you
could make war against the king's prerogative
without having the least design against his person
oh heaven forbid but heaven will hear
and judge you set down the beverage phoebe
this was added by way parenthesis to
phoebe who entered with refreshment colonel
everard is not thirsty you have wiped your
mouths and said you have done no evil but
though you have deceived man yet god you
cannot deceive
charged thus at once with the faults imputed
to his whole religious sect and political party
everard felt too late what imprudence he had
been guilty in giving the opening by disputing
his uncle's taste in dramatic poetry he endeavoured
to explainto apologize
 woodstock
i mistook your purpose honoured sir and
thought you really desired to know something 
our literature and in repeating what you thought
not unworthy your hearing i profess i thought
i was doing you pleasure instead stirring your
indignation
o ay returned the knight with unmitigated
rigour resentment profess profess 
ay that is the new phrase asseveration instead
 the profane adjuration courtiers and
cavaliers oh sir profess less and practise more
and so good day to you master kerneguy
you will find beverage in my apartment
while phoebe stood gaping in admiration at
the sudden quarrel which had arisen colonel
everard's vexation and resentment was not a
little increased by the nonchance the young
scotchman who with his hands thrust into his
pockets with a courtly affectation the time
had thrown himself into one the antique chairs
and though habitually too polite to laugh aloud
and possessing that art internal laughter by
which men the world learn to indulge their
mirth without incurring quarrels or giving direct
woodstock
offence was at no particular trouble to conceal
that he was exceedingly amused by the result 
the colonels visit to woodstock colonel everard's
patience however had reached bounds
which it was very likely to surpass for though
differing widely in politics there was a resemblance
betwixt the temper the uncle and nephew

damnation exclaimed the colonel in a
tone which became a puritan as little as did the
exclamation itself
amen said louis kerneguy but in a tone
so soft and gentle that the ejaculation seemed
rather to escape him than to be designedly uttered

sir said everard striding towards him in
that sort humour when a man full resentment
would not unwillingly find an object on
which to discharge it
plait il f said the page in the most equable
tone looking up in his face with the most unconscious
innocence
i wish to know sir the meaning that
which you said just now 
s woodstock
only a pouring out the spirit worthy
sir returned kerneguy a small skiff dispatched
to heaven on my own account to keep company
with your holy petition just now expressed
sir i have known a man's bones broke for
such a smile as you wear just now replied everard

there look you now answered the malicious
page who could not weigh even the
thoughts his safety against the enjoyment 
his jest if you had stuck to your professions
worthy sir you must have choked by this time 
but your round execration bolted like a cork from
a bottle cider and now allows your wrath to
come foaming out after it in the honest unbaptized
language common ruffians
for heaven's sake master gurney said
rhcebe forbear giving the colonel these bitter
words and doyougood colonel markham scorn
to take offence at his hands he is but a boy
if the colonel or you choose mistress phoebe
you shall find me a man i think the gentleman
can say something to the purpose already 
probably he may recommend to you the part 
woodstock 
the lady in comus and i only hope his own
admiration john milton will not induce him
to undertake the part sampson agonies and
blow up this old house with execrations or pull
it down in wrath about our ears
young man said the colonel still in towering
passion if you respect my principles for
nothing else be grateful to the protection which
but for them you would not easily attain
nay then said the attendant i must fetch
those who have more influence with you than i
have and away tripped phoebe while kerneguy
answered to everard in the same provoking
tone calm indifference
before you menace me with a thing so formidable
as your resentment you ought to be certain
whether i may not be compelled by circumstances
to deny you the opportunity you seem to
point at
at this moment a lice summoned no doubt by
her attendant entered the hall hastily
master kerneguy she said my father
requests to see you in victor lee's apartment
vol hi c
 woodstock
kerneguy arose and bowed but seemed determined
to remain till everard's departure so
as to prevent any explanation betwixt the cousins

markham said alice hurriedly cousin
everard i have but a moment to remain here
for god's sake do you instantly begone be
cautious and patient but do not tarry here my
father is fearfully incensed
i have had my uncle's word for that madam
replied everard as well as his injunction
to depart which i will obey without delay i
was not aware that you would have seconded
so harsh an order quite so willingly but i go
madam sensible i leave those behind whose company
is more agreeable
unjust ungenerous ungrateful said
alice but fearful her words might reach ears
for which they were not designed she spoke
them in a voice so feeble that her cousin for
whom they were intended lost the consolation
they were calculated to convey
he bowed coldly to alice as taking leave and
said with an air that constrained courtesy
woodstock 
which sometimes covers among men condition
the most deadly hatred i believe master kern
that i must make it convenient at present
to suppress my own peculiar opinions on the matter
which we have hinted at in our conversation
in which case i will send a gentleman who i hope
may be able to conquer yours
the supposed scotsman made him a stately
and at the same time a condescending bow said
he should expect the honour his commands
offered hi hand to mistress alice to conduct her
back to her father's apartment and took a triumphant
leave his rival
everard on the other hand stung beyond his
patience and from the grace and composed assurance
 the youth's carriage still conceiving
him to be either wilmot or some his compeers
in rank and profligacy returned to the
town woodstock determined not to be outbearded
even though he should seek redress by
means which his principles forbade him to consider
as justifiable

macbeth
while colonel everard retreated in high
indignation from the little refection which sir
henry lee had in his goodhumour offered and
withdrawn under the circumstances provocation
which we have detailed the good old knight
scarce recovered from his fit passion partook
 it with his daughter and guest and shortly
after recollecting some sylvan task for though
to little efficient purpose he still regularly attended
to his duties as ranger he called bevis and
went out leaving the two young people together
 now said the amorous prince to himself
that alice is left without her lion it remains to
woodstock
si
see whether she is herself a tigress breed so
sir bevis has left his charge he said aloud i
thought the knights old those stern guardians
 which he is so fit a representative were more
rigorous in maintaining a vigilant guard
 bevis said alice knows that his attendance
on me is totally needless and moreover
he has other duties to perform which every true
knight prefers to dangling the whole morning by
a lady's sleeve
you speak treason against all true affection
said the gallant a lady's lightest wish should
to a true knight be more binding than aught excepting
the summons his sovereign i wish
mistress alice you would but intimate your
slightest desire to me and you should see how
i have practised obedience
you never brought me word what o'clock it
was this morning replied the young lady and
there i sat questioning the wings time when
i should have remembered that gentlemen's gallantry
can be quite as fugitive as time himself
how do you know what your disobedience may
have cost me and others pudding and dumpling
 o
 
 woodstock
may have been burned to a cinder for sir i
practise the old domestic rule visiting the
kitchen or i may have missed prayers or i may
have been too late for an appointment simply by
the negligence master louis kerneguy failing
to let me know the hour the day
o replied kerneguy i am one those
lovers who cannot endure absence i must be
eternally at the feet my fair enemy such i
think is the title with which romances teach us
to grace the fair and cruel to whom we devote our
hearts and lives speak for me good lute he
added taking up the instrument and show whether
i know not my duty
he sung but with more taste than execution
the air a french rondeau to which some the
wits or sonnetteers in his gay and roving train
had adapted english verses
an hour with thee when earliest day
dapples with gold the eastern grey
oh what can frame my mind to bear
the toil and turmoil care and care
new griefs which coming hours unfold
and sftd remembrance the old 
one hour with thes
woodstock j
one hour with thee when burning june
waves his red flag at pitch noon 
what shall repay the faithful swain
his labour on the sultry plain 
and more than cave or sheltering bough
cool feverish blood and throbbing brow 
one hour with thee
one hour with thee i when sun is set
o what can teach me to forget
the thankless labours the day 
the hopes the wishes siang away 
the increasing wants and lessening gains
the master's pride who scorns my pains 
one hour with thee
 truly there is another verse said the songster
 but i sing it not to you mistress alice because
some the prudes the court liked it not
i thank you master louis answered the
young lady both for your discretion in singing
what has given me pleasure and in forbearing
what might offend me though a country girl i
pretend to be so far the court mode as to receive
nothing which does not pass current among
the better class there
i would answered louis that you were
so well confirmed in their creed as to let all pass
with you to which court ladies would give currency

 woodstock
and what would be the consequence said
auce with perfect composure
in that case said louis embarrassed like a
general who finds that his preparations for attack
do not seem to strike either fear or confusion into
the enemy in that case you would forgive me
fair alice if i spoke to you in a warmer language
than that mere gallantry if i told you how
much my heart was interested in what you consider
as idle jesting if i seriously owned it was in your
power to make me the happiest or the most miserable
 human beings
master kerneguy said alice with the same
unshaken nonchance let us understand each
other i am little acquainted with highbred manners
and i am unwilling i tell you plainly to be
accounted a silly country girl who either from
ignorance or conceit is startled at every word 
gallantry addressed to her by a young man who
for the present has nothing better to do than coin
and circulate such false compliments but i must
sot let this fear seeming rustic and awkwardly
timorous carry me too far and being ignorant 
the exact limits i will take care to stop within
them
woodstock 
i trust madam said kerneguy that however
severely you may be disposed to judge 
me your justice will not punish me too severely
for an offence which your charms are alone the
occasion 
hear me out sir if you please resumed
alice i have listened to you when you spoke
en herder nay my complaisance has been so
great as to answer you en herbert for i do not
think anything except ridicule can come dialogues
betwixt lindor and jeannaton and the
principal fault the style is its extreme and tiresome
silliness and affectation but when you begin
to kneel offer to take my hand and speak with
a more serious tone i must remind you our
real characters i am the daughter sir henry
lee sir and you are or profess to be master
louis kerneguy my brother's page and a fugitive
for shelter under my father's roof who incurs
danger by the harbour he affords you and whose
household therefore ought not to be disturbed by
your un pleasing importunities
i would to heaven fair alice said the king
 that your objections to the suit which i am
 woodstock
urging not in jest but most seriously as that on
which my happiness depends rested only on the low
and precarious station louis keraeguy alice
thou hast the soul thy family and must needs
love honour i am no more the needy scottish
page whom i have for my own purposes personated
than i am the awkward lout whose manners
i adopted on the first night our acquaintance
this hand poor as i seem can confer a coronet

keep it said alice for some more ambitious
damsel my lord for such i conclude is
your title if this romance be true i would not
accept your hand could you confer a duchy
in one sense lovely alice you have neither
overrated my power nor my affection it is your
king it is charles stuart who speaks to you 
he can confer duchies and if beauty can merit
them it is that auce lee nay nay arise 
do not kneel it is for your sovereign to kneel to
thee alice to whom he is a thousand times more
devoted than the wanderer louis dared venture
to profess himself my alice has i know been
trained up in those principles love and obey

dienceto her sovereign that she cannot in conscience
or in mercy inflict on him such a wound
as would be implied in the rejection his suit
in spite all charles's attempts to prevent
her alice had persevered in kneeling on one knee
until she had touched with her lip the hand with
which he attempted to raise her but this salutation
ended she stood upright with her arms
folded on her bosom her looks humble but composed
keen and watchful and so possessed herself
 little flattered by the communication which
the king had supposed would have been overpowering
that he scarce knew in what terms
next to urge his solicitation
thou art silent thou art silent he said
my pretty alice has the king no more influence
with thee than the poor scottish page 
in one sense every influence said alice 
for he commands my best thoughts my best
wishes my earnest prayers my devoted loyalty
which as the men the house lee have been
ever ready to testify with the sword so are the
women bound to seal if necessary with their
blood but beyond the duties a true and devoir
woodstock
ted subject the king is even less to alice lee
than poor louis kerneguy the page could have
tendered an honourable union the monarch can
but offer a contaminated coronet
you mistake alice you mistake said the
king eagerly sit down and let me speak to
you sit down what isn't you fear 
i fear nothing my lord answered alice
what can i fear from the king britain i
the daughter his loyal subject and under my
father's roof but i remember the distance betwixt
us and though i might trifle and jest with
mine equal to ray king i must only appear in the
dutiful posture a subject unless where his safety
may seem to require that i do not acknowledge
his dignity
charles though young being no novice in such
scenes was surprised to encounter resistance 
a kind which had not been opposed to him in
similar pursuits even in cases where he had been
unsuccessful there was neither anger nor injured
pride nor disorder nor disdain real or affected
in the manners and conduct alice she
tond as it seemed calmly prepared to argue on
woodstock 
the subject which is generally decided by passion
showed no inclination to escape from the apartment
but appeared determined to hear with patience
the suit the lover while her countenance
and manner intimated that she had this complaisance
only in deference to the commands the
king
she is ambitious thought charles it is
by dazzling her love glory not by mere passionate
entreaties that i must hope to be successful
i pray you be seated my fair alice he said
the lover entreats the king commands you
the king said alice may permit the
relaxation the ceremonies due to royalty but
he cannot abrogate the subject's duty even by
express command i stand here while it is your
majesty's pleasure to address me a patient listener
as in duty bound
know then simple girl said the king
that in accepting my proffered affection and
protection you break through no law either 
virtue or morality those who are born to royalty
are deprived many the comforts private
life chiefly that which is perhaps the dearest
 woodstock
and most precious the power choosing their
own mates for life their formal weddings are
guided upon principles political expedience
only and those to whom they are wedded are
frequently in temper person and disposition
the most unlikely to make them happy society
has commiseration therefore towards us and
binds our unwilling and often unhappy wedlock
with chains a lighter and more easy character
than those which fetter other men whose marriage
ties as more voluntarily assumed ought in proportion
to be more strictly binding and therefore
ever since the time that old henry built
these walls priests and prelates as well as nobles
and statesmen have been accustomed to see a fair
rosamond rule the heart an affectionate monarch
and console him for the few hours constraint
and state which he must bestow upon some
angry and jealous eleanor to such a connexion
the world attaches no blame they rush to the
festival to admire the beauty the lovely esther
while the imperious vashti is left to queen it in
solitude they throng the palace to ask her protection
whose influence is more in the state an
woodstock 
hundred times than that the proud consort 
her offspring rank with the nobles the land
and vindicate by their courage like the celebrated
longford earl salisbury their descent from
royalty and from love from such connexions
our richest ranks nobles are recruited and
the mother lives in the greatness her posterity
honoured and blessed as she died lamented and
wept in the arms love and friendship
did rosamond so die my lord said alice
our records say she was poisoned by the injured
queen poisoned without time allowed to call to
god for the pardon her many faults did her
memory so live i have heard that when the
bishop purified the church at godstowe her monument
was broken open by his orders and her
bones thrown out into unconsecrated ground
those were rude old days sweet alice answered
charles queens are not now so jealous
nor bishops so rigorous and know besides that
in the lauds to which i would lead the loveliest
 her sex other laws obtain which remove from
such ties even the slightest show scandal
there is a mode matrimony which fulfilling
 woodstock
all the rites the church leaves no stain on the
conscience yet investing the bride with none 
the privileges peculiar to her husband's condition
infringes not upon the duties which the king
owes to his subjects so that alice lee may
in all respects become the real and lawful wife 
charles stuart except that their private union
gives her no title to be queen england
my ambition said alice will be sufficiently
gratified to see charles king without aiming
to share either his dignity in public or his
wealth and regal luxury in private
i understand thee alice said the king
hurt but not displeased you ridicule me being
a fugitive for speaking like a king it is a
habit i admit which i have learned and 
which even misfortune cannot cure me but my
case is not so desperate as you may suppose my
friends are still many in these kingdoms my allies
abroad are bound by regard to their own interest
to espouse my cause i have hopes given me
from spain from france and from other nations 
arid i have confidence that my father's blood has
not been poured forth in vain nor is doomed to
woo us took 
dry up without due vengeance my trust is in
him from whom princes derive their title and
think what thou wilt my present condition i
have perfect confidence that i shall one day sit on
the throne england
may god grant it said alice and that
he may grant it noble prince deign to consider
whether you now pursue a conduct likely to conciliate
his favour think the course you recommend
to a motherless maiden who has no
better defence against your sophistry than what
the natural feeling female dignity inspires
whether the death her father which would bethe
consequence her imprudence whether the
despair her brother whose life has been so often
in peril to save that your majesty whether
the dishonour the roof which has sheltered
you will read well in your annals or are events
likely to propitiate god whose controversy with
your house has been but too visible or recover
the affections the people england in whose
eyes such actions are an abomination i leave to
your own royal mind to consider
ol iii d
 woodstock
diaries paused struck with a turn to the conversation
which placed his own interests more in
collision with the gratification his present passion
than he had supposed
if your majesty said alice curtseying
deeply has no farther commands for my attendance
may i be permitted to withdraw 
stay yet a little strange and impracticable
girl said the king and answer me but one
question is it the lowness my present fortunes
that makes my suit contemptible 
i have nothing to conceal my liege she
said and my answer shall be as plain and direct
as the question you have asked if i could
have been moved to an act ignominious insane
and ungrateful folly it could only arise from my
being blinded by that passion which i believe is
pleaded as an excuse for folly and for crime much
more often than it has a real existence i must
in short have been in love as it is called and
that might have been with my equal but surely
never with my sovereign whether such only intitle
or in possession his kingdom
 yet loyalty was ever the pride almost the
wnoijstork ol
ruling passion your family alice said the
king
and could i reconcile that loyalty said
alice with indulging my sovereign by permitting
him to prosecute a suit dishonourable to himself
as to me ought i as a faithful subject to
join him in a folly which might throw yet another
stumblingblock in the path to his restoration
and could only serve to diminish his security
even if he were seated upon his throne 
at this rate said charles discontentedly
 i had better have retained my character the
page than assumed that a sovereign which it
seems is still more irreconcilable with my wishes
my candour shall go still farther said alice
i could have felt as little for louis kerneguy
as for the heir britain for such love as i have
to bestow and it is not such as i read in romance
or hear poured forth in song has been
already conferred on another object this gives
your majesty pain i am sorry for it but the
wholesome medicines are often bitter
yes answered the king with some asperity
 and physicians arc reasonable enough to 
woodstock
pet their patients to swallow them as if they
were honeycomb it is true then that whispered
tale the cousin colonel and the daughter
 the loyal lee has set her heart upon a rebellious
fanatic 
 my love was given ere i knew what these
words fanatic and rebel meant i recalled it not
for i am satisfied that amidst the great distractions
which divide the kingdom the person to
whom you allude has chosen his part erroneously
perhaps but conscientiously he therefore has
still the highest place in my affection and esteem
more he cannot have and will not ask until some
happy turn shall reconcile these public differences
and my father be once more reconciled to him
devoutly do i pray that such an event may occur
by your majesty s speedy and unanimous restoration

 you have found out a reason said the
king pettishly to make me detest the thought
 such a change nor have you alice any sincere
interest to pray for it on the contrary do
you not see that your lover walking side by side
with cromwell may or rather must share lii
woodstock 
power nay if lambert does not anticipate him
he may trip up oliver's heels and reign in his
stead and think you not he will find means to
overcome the pride the loyal lees and achieve
an union for which things are better prepared than
that which cromwell is said to meditate betwixt
one his brat and the no less loyal heir fauconcern

your majesty said alice has found a
way at length to avenge yourself if what i have
said deserves vengeance
i could point out a yet shorter road to your
union said charles without minding her distress
or perhaps enjoying the pleasure retaliation
 suppose that you sent your colonel word
that there was one charles stuart here who had
come to disturb the saints in their peaceful government
which they had acquired by prayer
and preaching pike and gun and suppose he
had the art to bring down a halfscore troopers
quite enough as times go to decide the fate 
this heir royalty think you not the possession
 such a prize as this might obtain from the
bumpers or from cromwell such a reward as
 woodstock
might overcome your father's objections to a
roundhead's alliance and place the fair alice and
her cousin colonel in full possession their
wishes 
my lord said alice her cheeks glowing and
her eyes sparkling for she too had her share 
the hereditary temperament her family this
passes my patience i have heard without expressing
anger the most ignominious persuasions
addressed to myself and i have vindicated myself
for refusing to be the paramour a fugitive
prince as if i had been excusing myself from accepting
a share an actual crown but can you
think i can hear all who are dear to me slandered
without emotion or reply i will not sir and
were you seated with all the terrors your father's
starchamber around you you should hear
me defend the absent and the innocent my
father i will say nothing but that if he is now
without wealth without state almost without a
sheltering home and needful food it is because he
spent all in the service the king he needed
not to commit any act treachery or villainy to
obtain wealth he had an ample competence in
wooisiock 
his own possessions for markham everard he
knows no such thing as selfishness he would not
for broad england had she the treasures peru
in her bosom and a paradise on her surface do a
deed that would disgrace his own name or injure
the feelings another kings my lord may
take a lesson from him my lord for the present
i take my leave
alice alice stay exclaimed the king
 she is gone this must be virtue real disinterested
overawing virtue or there is no such
thing on earth yet wilmot and villiers will
not believe a word it but add the tale to the
other wonders woodstock tis a rare wench 
and i profess to use the colonel's obtestation
that i know not whether to forgive and be friends
with her or study a dire revenge if it were not
for that accursed cousin that puritan colonel
i could forgive everything else to so noble a
wench but a roundheaded rebel preferred to me
the preference avowed to my face and justified
with the assertion that a king might take a lesson
from him it is gall and wormwood if the old
man had not come up this morning as he did the
 woodstock
king should have taken or given a lesson and a
severe one it was a mad rencontre to venture
upon with my rank and responsibility and yet
this wench has made me so angry with her and
so envious him that if an opportunity offered
i should scarce be able to forbear him ha 
whom have we here 
the interjection at the conclusion this royal
soliloquy was occasioned by the unexpected entrance
 another personage the drama
woodstock 
chapter iii
benedict shall i speak a word in your ear 
claudia god bless me from a challenge
much ado about nothing
as charles was about to leave the apartment
he was prevented by the appearance wildrake
who entered with an unusual degree swagger
in his gait and fantastic importance on
his brow i crave your pardon fair sir he
said but as they say in my country when
doors are open dogs enter i have knocked and
called in the hall to no purpose so knowing the
way to this parlour sir for i am a light partizan
and the road i once travel i never forget
i ventured to present myself unannounced
 sir henry lee is abroad sir i believe in
the chase said charles coldly for the appearance
 this somewhat vulgar debauchee was not
agreeable to him at the moment and master
 woodstock
albert lee has left the lodge for two or three
days
i am aware it sir said wildrake but
i have no business at present with either
and with whom is your business said
charles that is if i may be permitted to ask
since i think it cannot in possibility be with
me
pardon me in turn sir answered the cavalier
 in no possibility can it be imparted to any
other but yourself if you be as i think you are
though in something better habit master louis
girnigo the scottish gentleman who waits upon
master albert lee
i am all you are like to find for him answered
charles
in truth said the cavalier i do perceive
a difference but rest and better clothing will do
much and i am glad it since i would be
sorry to have brought a message such as i am
charged with to a tatterdemalion
let us get to the business sir if you please
said the king you have a message for me
you say 
woodstock 
true sir replied wildrake i am the
friend colonel markham everard sir a tall
man and a worthy person in the field although
i could wish him a better cause a message i
have to you it is certain in a slight note which
i take the liberty presenting with the usual
formalities so saying he drew his sword put
the billet he mentioned upon the point and making
a profound bow presented it to charles
the disguised monarch accepted it with a
grave return the salute and said as he was
about to open the letter i am not i presume
to expect friendly contents in an epistle presented
in so hostile a manner 
a hem sir replied the ambassador clearing
his voice while he arranged a suitable answer
in which the mild strain diplomacy might
be properly maintained not utterly hostile i
suppose sir is the invitation though it be such as
must be construed in the commencement rather
bellicose and pugnacious i trust sir we shall
find that a few thrusts will make a handsome conclusion
 the business and so as my old master
used to say pax nascitur ex bello for my own
 woodstock
poor share i am truly glad to have been graced
by my friend markham everard in this matter 
the rather as i feared the puritan principles with
which he is embued i will confess the truth to
you worthy sir might have rendered him unwilling
from certain scruples to have taken the
gentlemanlike mode righting himself in such
a case as the present and as i render a friend's
duty to my friend so i humbly hope master
louis girnigo that i do no injustice to you in
preparing the way for the proposed meeting
where give me leave to say i trust that if no
fatal accident occur we shall be all better friends
when the skirmish is over than we were before it
began
i should suppose so sir in any case said
charles looking at the letter worse than mortal
enemies we can scarce be and it is that footing
upon which this billet places us
 you say true sir said wildrake it is
sir a cartel introducing to a single combat for
the pacific object restoring a perfect good understanding
betwixt the survivors in case that
fortunately that word can be used in the plural
after the event the meeting
woodstock 
in short wc only fight i suppose replied
the king that we may come to a perfectly
good and amicable understanding
you are right again sir and i thank you for
the clearness your apprehension said wildrake
 ah sir it is easy to do with a person 
honour and intellect in such a case as this and
i beseech you sir as a personal kindness to myself
that as the morning is like to be frosty and
myself am in some sort rheumatic as war will
leave its scars behind sir i say i will entreat
 you to bring with you some gentleman honour
who will not disdain to take a part what
is going forward a sort potluck sir with
a poor old soldier like myself that we may take
no harm by standing unoccupied during such
cold weather
i understand sir replied charles if this
matter goes forward be assured i will endeavour
to provide you with a suitable opponent
i will remain greatly indebted to you sir
said wildrake and i am by no means curious
about the quality my antagonist it is true
i write myself esquire and gentleman and should
woodstock
account myself especially honoured by crossing
my sword with that sir henry or master
albert lee but should that not be convenient
i will not refuse to present my poor person in
opposition to any gentleman who has served the
king which i always hold as a sort letters 
nobility in itself and therefore would on no account
decline the duello with such a person
the king is much obliged to you sir said
charles for the honour you do his faithful
subjects
o sir i am scrupulous on that point very
scrupulous when there is a roundhead in
question i consult the herald's books to see
that he is entitled to bear arms as is master
markham everard without which i promise
you i had borne none his cartel but a cavalier
is with me a gentleman course be his
birth ever so low his loyalty has ennobled his
condition
it is well sir said the king this paper
requests me to meet master everard at six
tomorrow morning at the tree called the king's
oak i object neither to place nor time he
proffers the sword at which he says we possess
woodstock 
some equality i do not decline the weapon 
for company two gentlemen i shall endeavour
to procure myself an associate and a suitable
partner for you sir if you incline to join in die
dance
i kiss your hand sir and rest yours under
a sense obligation answered the envoy
i thank you sir continued the king i
will therefore be ready at place and time and
suitably furnished and i will either give your
friend such satisfaction with my sword as he requires
or will render him such cause for not doing
so as he shall be contented with
you will excuse me sir said wildrake
if my mind is too dull under the circumstances
to conceive any alternative that can remain betwixt
two men honour in such a case excepting
sa sa he threw himself into a fencing
position and made a pass with his sheathed
rapier but not directed towards the person 
the king whom he addressed
excuse me sir said charles if i do not
trouble your intellects with consideration a
case which may not occur but for example
woodstock
i may plead urgent employment on the part 
the public this he spoke in a low and mysterious
tone voice which wildrake appeared
perfectly to comprehend for he laid his forefinger
on his nose with what he meant for a very
intelligent and apprehensive nod
sir said he if you be engaged in any
affair for the king ray friend shall have every
reasonable degree patience nay i will fight
him myself in your stead merely to stay his stomach
rather than you should be interrupted 
and sir if you can find room in your enterprise
for a poor gentleman that has followed langford
and goring you have but to name day time
and place rendezvous for truly sir i am
tired the scald hat cropped hair and undertakers's
cloak with which my friend has bedizened
me and would willingly ruffle it out once
more in the king's cause when whether i be
banged or hanged i care not
i shall remember what you say sir should
an opportunity occur said the king and i
wish his majesty had many such subjects i
presume our business is now settled 
woodstock 
when you shall have been pleased sir to
give me a trifling scrap writing to serve for my
credentials for such you know is the custom 
your written cartel hath its written answer
that sir will i presently do said charles
and in good time here are the materials
and sir continued the envoy ahi 
ahem if you have interest in the household
for a cup sack i am a man few words
and am somewhat hoarse with much speaking
moreover a serious business this kind always
makes one thirsty besides sir to part
with dry lips argues malice which god forbid
should exist in such an honourable conjuncture
i do not boast much influence in the house
sir said the king but if you would have the
condescension to accept this broad piece towards
quenching your thirst at the george 
sir said the cavalier for the times admitted
 this strange species courtesy nor was
wildrake a man such peculiar delicacy as
keenly to dispute the matter i am once again
beholden to you but i see not how it consists
vol in e
 woodstock
with my honour to accept such accommodation
unless you were to accompany and partake
pardon me sir replied charles my safety
recommends that i remain rather private at
present
enough said wildrake observed poor
cavaliers must not stand on ceremony i see sir
you understand cutter's law when one tall fellow
has coin another must not be thirsty i wish
you sir a continuance health and happiness
until tomorrow at the king's oak at six o'clock
farewell sir said the king and added as
wildrake went down the stair whistling hey
for cavaliers to which air his long rapier jarring
against the steps and bannisters bore no unsuitable
burthen farewell thou too just emblem
 the state to which war and defeat and despair
have reduced many a gallant gentleman
during the rest the day there occurred nothing
peculiarly deserving notice alice sedulously
avoided showing towards the disguised
prince any degree estrangement or shyness
which could be discovered by her father or by
any one else to all appearance the two young
woodstock 
persons continued on the same footing in every
respect yet she made the gallant himself sensible
that this apparent intimacy was assumed
merely to save appearances and in no way designed
as retracting from the severity with which
she had rejected his suit the sense that this
was the case joined to his injured selflove and
his enmity against a successful rival induced
charles early to withdraw himself to a solitary
walk in the wilderness where like hercules in
the emblem ceres divided betwixt the personifications
 virtue and pleasure he listened
alternately to the voice wisdom and passionate
folly
prudence urged to him the importance his
own life to the future prosecution the great object
in which he had for the present miscarried 
the restoration monarchy in england the rebuilding
 the throne the regaining the crown 
his father the avenging his death and restoring
to their fortunes and their country the numerous
exiles who were suffering poverty and banishment
on account their attachment to his cause pride
too or rather a just and natural sense dignity
woodstock
displayed the unworthiness a prince descending
to actual personal conflict with a subject any
degree and the ridicule which would be thrown
on his memory should he lose his life for an obscure
intrigue by the hand a private gentleman
what would his sage counsellors nicholas
and hyde what would his kind and wise governor
the marquis hertford say to such an act
 rashness and folly would it not be likely to
shake the allegiance the staid and prudent persons
 the royalist party since wherefore should
they expose their lives and estates to raise to the
government a kingdom a young man who could
not command his own temper to this was to
be added the consideration that even his success
would add double difficulties to his escape which
already seemed sufficiently precarious if stopping
short death he merely had the better 
his antagonist how did he know that he might
not seek revenge b delivering up to government
the malignant louis kerneguy whose real character
could not in that case fail to be discovered 
these considerations strongly recommended to
charles that he should clear himself the chap
woodstock 
ienge without fighting and the reservation under
which he had accepted it afforded him some
opportunity doing so
but passion also had her arguments which she
addressed to a temper rendered irritable by recent
distress and mortification in the first place
if he was a prince he was also a gentleman entitled
to resent as such and obliged to give or
claim the satisfaction expected on occasion 
differences among gentlemen with englishmen
she urged he could never lose interest by
showing himself ready instead sheltering himself
under his royal birth and pretensions to
come frankly forward and maintain what he
had done or said on his own responsibility ina
free nation it seemed as if he would rather
gain than lose in the public estimation by a conduct
which could not but seem gallant and generous
then a character for courage was far
more necessary to support his pretensions than
any other kind reputation and the lying under
a challenge viithout replying to it might
bring his spirit into question what would valleys
and wilmot say an intrigue in which he
 woodstock
had allowed himself to be shamefully baffled by
a country girl and had failed to revenge himself
on the rival the pasquinades which they would
compose the witty sarcasms which they would
circulate on the occasion would be harder to endure
than the grave rebukes hertford hyde
and nicholas this reflection added to the stings
 youthful and awakened courage at length
fixed his resolution and he returned to woodstock
determined to keep his appointment come
 it what might
perhaps there mingled with his resolution a
secret belief that such a rencontre would not
prove fatal he was in the flower his youth
active in all his exercises and no way inferior to
colonel everard as far as the morning's experiment
had gone in that selfdefence at least
such recollection might pass through his royal
mind as he hummed to himself a wellknown
ditty which he had picked up during his residence
in scotland
a man may drink and not be drunk
a man may fight and not be slain 
a man may kiss a bonnie lass
and yet be welcome back again
woodstock 
meanwhile the busy and alldirecting doctor
rochecliffe had contrived to intimate to alice
that she must give him a private audience and
she found him by appointment in what was called
the study once filled with ancient books which
long since converted into cartridges had made
more noise in the world at their final exit than
during the space which had intervened betwixt
that and their first publication the doctor
seated himself in a highbacked leathern easychair
and signed to alice to fetch a stool and sit
down beside him
alice said the old man taking her hand affectionately
 thou art a good girl a wise girl a virtuous
girl one those whose price is above rubies
not that rubies is the proper translationbut
remind me to tell you that another time alice
thou knowest who this louis kerneguy islay
hesitate not to me i know everything i am
well aware the whole matter thou knowest
this honoured house holds the fortunes england
alice was about to answer nay speak
not but listen to me alice how does he bear
himself towards you 
 woodstock
alice coloured with the deepest crimsoned i
am a countrybred girl she said and his manners
are too courtlike for me
enough said i know it all alice he is
exposed to a great danger tomorrow and you
must be the happy means to prevent him
 i prevent him how and in what manner 
said alice in surprise it is my duty as a
subject to do anything anything that may become
my father's daughters
here she stopped considerably embarrassed
yes continued the doctor tomorrow he
hath made an appointment an appointment with
markham everard the hour and place are setsix
in the morning by the kings oak if they
meet one will probably fall
now may god forefend they should meet
said alice turning as suddenly pale as she had
previously reddened but harm cannot come 
it everard will never lift his sword against the
king
for that said doctor rochechffe i
would not warrant but if that unhappy young
gentleman shall have still some reserve the
woodstock 
loyalty which his general conduct entirely disavows
it would not serve us here for he knows
not the king but considers him merely as a cavalier
from whom he has received injury
let him know the truth doctor rochecliffs
let him know it instantly said alice he
lift hand against the king a fugitive and defenceless
 he is incapable it my life on the
issue he becomes most active in his preservation

 that is the thought a maiden alice
answered the doctor and as i fear a maiden
whose wisdom is misled by her affections it
were worse than treason to admit a rebel officer
the friend the archtraitor cromwell into so
great a secret i dare not answer for such rashness
hammond was trusted by his father and
you know what came it
then let my father know he will meet markham
or send to him representing the indignity
done to him by attacking his guest
we dare not let your father into the secret
who louis kerneguy really is i did but hint
 woodstock
the possibility charles taking refuge at woodstock
and the rapture into which sir henry broke
out the preparations for accommodation and defence
which he began to talk plainly showed
that the mere enthusiasm his loyalty would
have led to a risk discovery it is you alice
who must save the hopes every true royalist
i answered alice it is impossible 
why cannot my father be induced to interfere
as in behalf his friend and guest though he
know him as no other than louis kerneguy 
you have forgot your father's character my
young friend said the doctor an excellent
man and the best christians till there is a
clashing swords and then he starts up the
complete martialist as deaf to every pacific reasoning
as if he were a gamecock
you forget doctor rochechffe said alice
that this very morning if i understand the
thing aright my father prevented them from
fighting
ay answered the doctor because he deemed
himself bound to keep the peace in the royal
park but it was done with such regret alice
woodstock 
that should he find them at it again i am clear
to foretell he will only so far postpone the combat
as to conduct them to some unprivileged
ground and there bid them tilt and welcome
while he regaled his eyes with a scene so pleasing
no alice it is you and you only who can
help us in this extremity
 i see no possibility said she again colouring
 how i can be the least use
you must send a note answered doctor
rochecliffe to the king a note such as all
women know how to write better than any man
can teach them to meet you at the precise hour
 the rendezvous he will not fail you for i
know his unhappy foible
doctor rochecliffe said alice gravely
you have known me from infancy what have
you seen in me to induce you to believe that i
should ever follow such unbecoming counsel 
 and if you have known me from infancy
retorted the doctor what have you seen me
that you should suspect me giving counsel to
my friend's daughter which it would be misbecoming
in her to follow you cannot be foot
 woodstock
enough i think to suppose that i mean you
should carry your complaisance farther than to
keep him in discourse for an hour or two till i
have all in readiness for his leaving this place
from which i can fright him by the terrors an
alleged search so c s mounts his horse and
rides off and mistress alice lee has the honour
 saving him
yes at the expense her own reputation
said auce and the risk an eternal stain on
my family you say you know all what can
the king think my appointing an assignation
with him after what has passed and how will it
be possible to disabuse him respecting the purpose
 my doing so 
i will disabuse him alice i will explain
the whole
doctor rochecliffe said alice you propose
what is impossible you can do much by
your ready wit and great wisdom but if newfallen
snow were once sullied not all your art
could wash it white again and it is altogether
the same with a maiden's reputation
alice my dearest child said the doctor
woodstock 
 bethink you that if i recommend this means 
saving the ife the king at least rescuing him
from instant peril it is because i see no other 
which to avail myself if i bid you assume even
for a moment the semblance what is wrong
it is but in the last extremity and under circumstances
which cannot return i will take the
surest means to prevent all evil report which can
arise from what i recommend
say not so doctor said alice better
undertake to turn back the isis than to stop the
course calumny the king will make boast
to his whole licentious court the ease with
which but for a sudden alarm he could have
brought off alice lee as a paramour the mouth
which confers honour on others will then be the
means to deprive me mine take a fitter
course one more becoming your own character
and profession do not lead him to fail in an
engagement honour by holding out the prospect
 another engagement equally dishonourable
whether false or true go to the king himself
speak to him as the servants god have a
right to speak even to earthly sovereigns point
 woodstock
out to him the folly and the wickedness the
course he is about to pursue urge upon him
that he fear the sword since wrath bringeth the
punishment the sword tell him that the
friends who died for him in the field at worcester
on the scaffolds and on the gibbets since
that bloody day that the remnant who are in
prison scattered fled and ruined on his account
deserve better him and his father's race than
that he should throw away his life in an idle
brawl tell him that it is dishonest to venture
that which is not his own dishonourable to betray
the trust which brave men have reposed in
his virtue and in his courage
doctor rochecliffe looked on her with a melancholy
smile his eyes glistening as he said
alas alice even i could not plead that just
cause to him so eloquently or so impressively as
thou dost but alack charles would listen to
neither it is not from priests or women he
would say that men should receive counsel in
affairs honour
then hear me doctor rochecliffe i will
appear at the place rendezvous and i will
woodstock 
prevent the combat do not fear that i can do
what i say at a sacrifice indeed but not that
 my reputation my heart may be broken
she endeavoured to stifle her sobs with difficulty
 for the consequence but not in the imagination
 a man and far less that man her sovereign
shall a thought alice lee be associated
with dishonour she hid her face in her handkerchief
and burst out into unrestrained tears
what means this hysterical passion said
doctor rochecliffe surprised and somewhat
alarmed by the vehemence her grief maiden
i must have no concealments i must know
 exert your ingenuity then and discover
it said alice for a moment displeased at the
doctor's pertinacious selfimportance guess
my purpose as you can guess at everything
else it is enough to have to go through my
task i will not endure the distress telling it
over and that to one who forgive me dear
doctor might not think ray agitation on this
occasion fully warranted
nay then my young mistress you must be
ruled said rochecliffe and if i cannot make

 woodstock
you explain yourself i must see whether your
father can gain so far on you so saying he
arose somewhat displeased and walked towards
the door
you forget what you yourself told me doctor
rochecliffe said alice the risk communicating
this great secret to my father
it is too true he said stopping short and
turning round and i think wench thou art
too smart for me and i have not met many such
but thou art a good girl and wilt tell me thy
device freewill it concerns my character and
influence with the king that i should be fully 
acquainted with whatever is actum atque tracts
done and treated in this matter
trust your character to me good doctor
said alice attempting to smile it is firmer
stuff than those women and will be safer in my
custody than mine could have been in yours
and thus much i condescend you shall see the
whole scene you shall go with me yourself and
much will i feel emboldened and heartened by
your company
woodstock 
that is something said the doctor though
not altogether satisfied with this limited confidence
 thou wert ever a clever wench and i
will trust thee indeed trust thee i find i must
whether voluntarily or no
meet me then said alice in the wilderness
tomorrow but first tell me are you well
assured time and place a mistake were fatal

assure yourself my information is entirely
accurate said the doctor resuming his air 
consequence which had been a little diminished
during the latter part their conference
may i ask said alice through what channel
you acquired such important information 
you may ask unquestionably he answered
now completely restored to his supremacy but
whether i will answer or not is a very different
question i conceive neither your reputation
nor my own are interested in your remaining in
ignorance on that subject so i have my secrets
as well as you mistress and some them i
fancy are a good deal more worth knowing
be it so said alice quietly if you will
vol ill f
 woodstock
meet me in the wilderness by the broken dial at
half past five exactly we will go together tomorrow
and watch them as they come to the rendezvous
i will on the way get the better my
present timidity and explain to you the means i
design to employ to prevent mischief you can
perhaps think making some effort which may
render my interference unbecoming and painful
as it must be altogether unnecessary
nay my child said the doctor if you
place yourself in my hands you will be the first
that ever had reason to complain my want 
conduct and you may well judge you are the
very last one excepted whom i would see suffer
for want counsel at half past five then at
the dial in the wilderness and god bless our undertaking

here their interview was interrupted by the
sonorous voice sir henry lee which shouted
their names daughter alice doctor rochecliffs
through passage and gallery
what do you here said he entering sitting
like two crows in a mist when we have such
rare sport below here is this wild crackbrained
woodstock 
boy louis kerneguy now making me laugh till
my sides are fit to split and now playing on his
guitar sweetly enough to win a lark from the
heavens come away with you come away it
is hard work to laugh alone
 wood stock
chapter 
this is the iiacc the centre the grove 
here stands the oak the monarch the wood
john home
the sun had risen on the broad boughs 
the forest but without the power penetrating
into its recesses which hung rich with heavy
dewdrops and were beginning on some the
trees to exhibit the varied tints autumn it
being the season when nature ike a prodigal
whose race is well nigh run seems desirous to
make up in profuse gaiety and variety colours
for the short space which her splendour has then
to endure the birds were silent and even
robinredbreast whose chirruping song was
woodstock 
heard among the bushes near the lodge emboldened
by the largesses with which the good old
knight always encouraged his familiarity did not
venture into the recesses the wood alarmed
by the neighbourhood the sparrowhawk and
other enemies a similar description preferring
the vicinity the dwellings man from whom
he almost solely among the feathered tribes
seems to experience disinterested protection
the scene was therefore at once lovely and silent
when the good doctor rochechife wrapped
in a scarlet roquelair which had seen service in
its day muffling his face more from habit than
necessity and supporting alice on his arm she
also defended by a cloak against the cold and
damp the autumn morning glided through
the tangled and long grass the darkest alleys
almost ancledeep in dew towards the place appointed
for the intended duel both so eagerly
maintained the consultation in which they were
engaged that they were alike insensible the
roughness and discomforts the road though
often obliged to force their way through brushwood
and coppice which poured down on thciii
 woodstock
all the liquid pearls with which they were loaded
till the mantles they were wrapped in hung
lank by their sides and clung to their shoulders
heavily charged with moisture they stopped
when they had attained a station under the
coppice and shrouded by it from which they
could see all that passed on the little esplanade
before the king's oak whose broad and scathed
form contorted and shattered limbs and frowning
brows made him appear like some ancient
warworn champion well selected to be the umpire
 a field single combat
the first person who appeared at the rendezvous
was the gay cavalier roger wildrake he
also was wrapped in his cloak but had discarded
his puritanic beaver and wore in its stead a spanish
hat with a feather and gilt hatband all 
which had encountered bad weather and hard
service but to make amends for the appearance
 poverty by the show pretension the castor
was accurately adjusted after what was rather
profanely called the d mme cut used among
the more desperate cavaliers he came very hastily
and exclaimed aloud first in the field
woodstock t
after all by jove though i bilked everard in
order to have my morning draught it has done
me much good he added smacking his lips
well i suppose i should search the ground
ere my principal comes up whose presbyterian
watch trudges as slow as his presbyterian step
he took his rapier from under his cloak and
seemed about to search the thickets around
i will prevent him whispered the doctor
to alice i will keep faith with you you
shall not come on the scene nisi dignus venice
nodus i'll explain that another time vindex
is feminine as well as masculine so the quotation
is defensible keep you close
so saying he stepped forward on the esplanade
and bowed to wiidrake
master louis kerneguy said wiidrake
pulling off his hat but instantly discovering his
error he added but no i beg your pardon
sir fatter shorter older mr kerneguy's
friend i suppose with whom i hope to have a
turn by and by and why not now sir before
our principals come up just a snack to stay the
orifice the stomach till the dinner is served
sir what say you r
 woodstock
to open the orifice the stomach more likely
or to give it a new one said the doctor
 true sir said roger who seemed now in
his element you say well that is as thereafter
may be but come sir you wear your face muffled
i grant you it is honest men's fashion at
this unhappy time the more is the pity but we
do all above board we have no traitors here
i'll get into my gears first to encourage you and
show you that you have to deal with a gentleman
who honours the king and is a match fit to fight
with any who follows him as doubtless you do
sir since you are the friend master louis kern

all this while wildrake was busied undoing
the clasps his squarecaped cloak
 oft off ye lending he said borrowings
i should more properly call you 
via the curtain which shadow'd borgia 
so saying he threw the cloak from him and
appeared in cuerpo in a most cavalierlike doublet
 greasy crimson satin pinked and slashed
with what had been once white tiffany breeches
 the same and nclherstocks or as we now call
woods rock 
iceni stockings darned in many places and which
like those point had been once peachcoloured
a pair pumps ill calculated for a walk
through the dew and a broad shoulderbelt 
tarnished embroidery completed his equipment
 come sir he exclaimed make haste off
with your slough here i stand tight and true
as loyal a lad as ever stuck rapier through a
roundhead come sir to your tools he continued
 we may have halfadozen thrusts before
they come yet and shame them for their tardiness 
pshaw he exclaimed in a most disappointed
tone when the doctor unfolding his cloak showed
his clerical dress tush it's burt the parson
after all 
wildrake's respect for the church however
and his desire to remove one who might possibly
interrupt a scene to which he looked forward
with peculiar satisfaction induced him presently
to assume another tone
i beg pardon he said my dear doctor
i kiss the hem your cassock i do by the
thundering jove i beg your pardon again 
jut i am happy i have met with you they
arc initio for your presence a the i
said the doctor i wait for master louis kern

the devil you do exclaimed wildrake
why i always knew the scots could do nothing
without their minister but d n it i never
thought they put them to this use neither
but i have known jolly customers in orders who
wooustock 
understood to handle the sword as well as their
prayerbook you know the purpose our
meeting doctor do you come only as a ghostly
comforter or as a surgeon perhapsor do you
ever take bilboa in hand sa sa 
here he made a fencing demonstration with
his sheathed rapier
i have done so sir on necessary occasion
said doctor rochecliffe
good sir let this stand for a necessary one
said wildrake you know my devotion for
the church if a divine your skill would dome
the honour to exchange but three passes with
me i should think myself happy for ever
sir said rochecliffe smiling were there
no other objection to what you propose i have
not the means i have no weapon
what you want the de quoi that is unlucky
indeed but you have a stout cane in your
hand what hinders our trying a pass my rapier
being sheathed course until our principals
come up my pumps are full this frostdew
 and i shall be a toe or two out pocket
if i am to stand still all the time they are stretches
voustock
ing themselves for i fancy doctor you will be
 my opinion that the matter will not be a fight
 cocksparrows
my business here is to make it if possible
be no fight at all said the divine
now rat me doctor but that is too spiteful
said wildrake and were it not for my
respect for the church i could turn presbyterian
to be revenged
stand back a little if you please sir said
the doctor do not press forward in that direction
 for wildrake in the agitation his
movements induced by his disappointment approached
the spot where alice remained still concealed

and wherefore not i pray you doctor
said the cavalier
but on advancing a step he suddenly stopped
short and muttered to himself with a round oath
 astonishment a petticoat in the coppice by
all that is reverend and at this hour in the morning
 wheiv ew ew he gave vent to his
surprise in a long low interjectional whistle then
turning to the doctor with his finger on the side
woodstock 

 his nose youve sly doctor d d sly but
why not give me a hint your your commodity
there your contraband goods gad sir i
am not a man to expose the eccentricities the
church
sir said doctor rochecliffe you are impertinent
 and if time served and it were worth
my while i would chastise you
and the doctor who had served long enough
in the wars to have added some the qualities
 a captain horse to those the divine actually
raised his cane to the infinite delight 
the rake whose respect for the church was by no
means able to subdue his love mischief
nay doctor said he if you wield your
weapon backswordfashion in that way and raise
it as high as your head i shall be through you
in a twinkling so saying he made a pass with
his sheathed rapier not precisely at the doctor's
person but in that direction when rochecliffe
changing the direction his cane from the broadsword
guard to that the rapier made the cavaliers
sword spring ten yards out his hand
with all the dexterity my friend francalanza
 woodstock
at this moment both the principal parties appeared
on the field
everard exclaimed angrily to wildrake is
this your friendship in heaven's name what
make you in that doors jacket and playing the
pranks a jackpudding while his worthy second
somewhat crestfallen held down his head
like a boy caught in roguery and went to pick up
his weapon stretching his head as he passed into
the coppice to obtain another glimpse if possible
 the concealed object his curiosity
charles in the meantime still more surprised
at what he beheld called out on his part
 what doctor rochecliffe become literally one
 the church militant and tilting with my friend
cavalier wildrake may i use the freedom to
ask him to withdraw as colonel everard and i
have some private business to settle
it was doctor rochecliffes cue on this important
occasion to have armed himself with the
authority his sacred office and used a tone 
interference which might have overawed even a
monarch and made him feel that his monitor
spoke by a warrant higher than his own but the
woodstock 
indiscreet latitude lie had just given to his own
passion and the levity in which he had been detected
were very unfavourable to his assuming
that superiority to which so uncontrollable a spirit
as that charles wilful as a prince and
capricious as a wit was at all likely to submit
the doctor did however endeavour to rally his
dignity and replied with the gravest and at the
same time the most respectful tone he could assume
that he also had business the most urgent
nature which prevented him from complying
with master kerneguy's wishes and leaving
that spot
excuse this untimely interruption said
charles taking off his hat and bowing to colonel
everard which i will immediately put an
 to
everard gravely returned his salute and was
silent
are you mad doctor rochecliff'e said
charles or are you deaf or have you forgotten
your mothertongue i desired you to
leave this place
i am not mad said the divine rousing up
c woodstofif
his resolution and regaining the natural firmness
 his voice i would prevent others from being
so i am not deaf i would pray others to
hear the voice reason and religion i have
not forgotten my mothertongue but i have
come hither to speak the language the master
 kings and princes
to fence with broomsticks i should rather
suppose said the king come doctor rochecliffs
this sudden fit assumed importance befits
you as little as your late frolic you are not
i apprehend either a catholic priest or a scotch
mass john to claim devoted obedience from
your hearers but a church englishman
subject to the rules that communion and to
its head in speaking the last words the king
lowered his voice to a low and impressive whisper
everard observing this drew back the natural
generosity his temper directing him to avoid
overhearing private discourse in which the safety
 the speakers might be deeply concerned
they continued however to observe great caution
in their forms expression
master kerneguy said the clergyman it
woodstock 
is not i who assume authority or control over
your wishes god forbid i do but tell you
what reason scripture religion and morality
alike prescribe for your rule conduct
and i doctor said the king smiling and
pointing to the unlucky cane will take your
example rather than your precept if a reverend
clergyman will himself fight a bout at singlestick
what right can he have to interfere in gentlemen's
quarrels come sir remove yourself
and do not let your present obstinacy cancel former
obligations
bethink yourself said the divine i can
say one word which will prevent all this
 do it replied the king and in doing
so belie the whole tenor and actions an honourable
life abandon the principles your
church and become a perjured traitor and an
apostate to prevent another person from discharging
his duty as a gentleman this were indeed
killing your friend to prevent the risk 
his running himself into danger let the passive
obedience which is so often in your mouth
and no doubt in your head put your feet for
vol m c
 woodstock
once into motion and step aside for ten minutes
within that space your assistance may be needed
either as bodycurer or soulcurer
nay then said doctor rochechffe i have
but one argument left
while this conversation was carried on apart
everard had almost forcibly detained by his
own side his follower wildrake whose greater
curiosity and lesser delicacy would otherwise
have thrust him forward to get if possible into
the secret but when he saw the doctor turn into
the coppice he whispered eagerly to everard
 a gold carolus to a commonwealth farthing
the doctor has not only come to preach a peace
but has brought the principal conditions along
with him 
everard made no answer he had already
unsheathed his sword and charles hardly saw
rochecliffe's back fairly turned than he lost no
time in following his example but ere they
had done more than salute each other with the
usual courteous flourish their weapons doctor
rochecliffe again stood between them leading
in his hand alice lee her garments dank
woodstock 
with lew and her long hair heavy with moisture
and totally uncurled her face was extremely
pale but it was the paleness desperate
resolution not fear there was a dead
pause astonishment the combatants rested
on their swords and even the forwardness 
wildrake only vented itself in half suppressed
ejaculations as well done doctor this beats
the parson among the pease no less than
your patron's daughter and mistress alice
whom i thought a very snowdrop turned out a
dogviolet after all a lindabrides by heavens
and altogether one ourselves 
excepting these unheeded muttering alice
was the first to speak
master everard she said master kern
you are surprised to see me here yet
why should i not tell the reason at once convinced
that i am however guiltlessly the unhappy
cause your misunderstanding i am too much
interested to prevent fatal consequences to pause
upon any step which may it master kerneguy
have my wishes my entreaties my prayers
have your noble thoughts the recollections 
your own high duties no weight with you in this
woodstock
matter let me entreat you to consult reason
religion and common sense and return your
weapon
 i am obedient as an eastern slave madam
answered charles sheathing his sword but i
assure you the matter about which you distress
yourself is a mere trifle which will be much better
settled betwixt colonel everard and myself
in five minutes than with the assistance the
m'hole convocation the church with a female
parliament to assist their reverend deliberations
mr everard will you oblige me by walking
a little further we must change ground it
seems
i am ready to attend you sir said everard
who had sheathed his sword so soon as his
antagonist did so
i have then no interest with you sir said
alice continuing to address the king do
you not fear i should use the secret in my power
to prevent this affair going to extremity think
you this gentleman who raises his hand against
you if he knew 
if he knew diet i were lord wilmot madam
you would say accident has given him
woodstock 
proof lo that effect with which he is already satisfied
and i think you would find it difficult to
induce him to embrace a different opinion
alice paused and looked on the king with
great indignation the following words dropping
from her mouth by intervals as if they burst forth
one by one in spite feelings that would have
restrained them cold selfish ungrateful 
unkind woe to the land which here
she paused with marked emphasis then added
 which shall number thee or such as thee
among her nobles and rulers 
nay fair alice said charles whose good
nature could not but feel the severity this reproach
though too slightly to make all the desired
impression you are too unjust to me too partial
to a happier man do not call me unkind 
i am but here to answer mr everard's summons
i could neither decline attending nor withdraw
now i am here without loss honour and my
loss honour would be a disgrace which must
extend to many i cannot fly from mr everard
it would be too shameful if he abides by m
los woodstock
message it must be decided as such affairs usually
are if he retreats or yields it up i will for
your sake wave punctilio i will not even ask
an apology for the trouble it has afforded me
but let all pass as if it were the consequence 
some unhappy mistake the grounds which
shall remain on my part inquired into this
i will do for your sake and it is much for a man
 honour to condescend so far you know that
the condescension from me in particular is great
indeed then do not call me ungenerous or
ungrateful or unkind since i am ready to do
all which as a man i can do and more perhaps
than as a man honour i ought to do
do you hear this markham everard exclaimed
alice do you hear this the dreadful
option is left entirely at your disposal you
were wont to be temperate in passion religious
forgiving will you for a mere punctilio drive
on this private and unchristian broil to a murderous
extremity believe me if you now contrary
to all the better principles your life give the
reins to your passions the consequences may be
woodstock 
such as you will rue for your lifetime and even
if heaven have not mercy rue after your life is
finished
markham everard remained for a moment
gloomily silent with his eyes fixed on the ground
at length he looked up and answered her
alice you are a soldier's daughter a soldier's
sister all your relations even including one
whom you then entertained some regard for have
been made soldiers by these unhappy discords
yet you have seen them take the field in some
instances on contrary sides to do their duty where
their principles called them without manifesting
this extreme degree interest answer me 
and your answer shall decide my conduct is
this youth so short while known already more
value to you than those dear connexions father
brother and kinsman whose departure to battle
you saw with comparative indifference say this
and it shall be enough i leave the ground never
to see you or this country again
 stay markham stay and believe me when
i say that if i answer your question in the affirmative
it is because master kerneguy's safety
 woods k
comprehends more much more than that any
 those you have mentioned
 indeed i did not know a coronet had been
so superior in value to the crest a private gentleman
said everard yet i have heard that
many women think so
you apprehend me amiss said alice perplexed
between the difficulty so expressing
herself as to prevent immediate mischief and at
the same time anxious to combat the jealousy
and disarm the resentment which she saw arising
in the bosom her lover but she found no
words fine enough to draw the distinction without
leading to a discovery the king's actual
character and perhaps in consequence to his destruction
 markham she said have compassion
on me press me not at this moment
believe me the honour and happiness my
father my brother and my whole family
are interested in master kerneguy's safety are
inextricably concerned in this matter resting
where it now does
oh ay i doubt not said everard the
house lee ever looked up to nobility and
woodstock 
valued in their connexions the fantastic loyalty
 a courtier beyond the sterling and honest patriotism
 a plain country gentleman for them
the thing is in course but on your part you
alice o on your part whom i have loved so
dearly who have suffered me to think that my
affection was not unpaid can the attractions
 an empty title the idle court compliments 
a mere man quality during only a few hours
lead you to prefer a libertine lord to such a heart
as mine 
no no believe me no said alice in the
extremity distress
put your answer which seems so painful
in one word and say for whose safety it is you
are thus deeply interested 
for both for both said alice
that answer will not serve alice answered
everard here is no room for equality i
must and will know to what i have to trust i
understand not the paltering which makes a
maiden unwilling to decide betwixt two suitors 
nor would i willingly impute to you the vanity
that cannot remain contented with one lover at
once
 woodstock
the vehemence everard's displeasure when
he supposed his own long and sincere devotion
lightly forgotten amid the addresses a profligate
courtier awakened the spirit alice lee
who as we elsewhere said had a portion in her
temper the lionhumour that was characteristic
 her family
 if i am thus misinterpreted she said if
i am not judged worthy the least confidence
or candid construction hear my declaration and
my assurance that strange as my words may
seem they are when truly interpreted such as
do you no wrong i tell you i tell all present
and i tell this gentleman himself who well
knows the sense in which i speak that his life
and safety are or ought to be more value tome
than those any other man in the kingdomnay
in the world be that other who he will
these words she spoke in a tone so firm and
decided as admitted no farther discussion
charles bowed low and with gravity but remained
silent everard his features agitated by
the emotions which his pride barely enabled him
to suppress advanced to his antagonist and said
woodstock 
in a tone which he vainly endeavoured to make
a firm one sir you heard the lady's declaration
with such feelings doubtless gratitude
as the case eminently demands as her
poor kinsman and an unworthy suitor sir i
presume to yield my interest in her to you and
as i will never be the means giving her pain
i trust you will not think i act unworthily in
retracting the letter which gave you the trouble
 attending this place at this hour alice he
said turning his head towards her farewell
alice at once and for ever 
the poor young lady whose adventitious spirit
had almost deserted her attempted to repeat
the word farewell but failing in the attempt only
accomplished a broken and imperfect sound and
would have sunk to the ground but for doctor
rochecliffe who caught her as she fell roger
wildrake also who had twice or thrice put to
his eyes what remained a kerchief interested
by the lady's evident distress though unable to
comprehend the mysterious cause hastened to
assist the divine in supporting so fair a burthen
meanwhile the disguised prince had beheld the
 oolsl' k
whole in silence but with an agitation to which
he was unwonted and which his swarthy features
and still more his motions began to betray
his posture was at first absolutely stationary with
his arms folded on his bosom as one who waits
to be guided by the current events presently
after he shifted his position advanced and retired
his foot clenched and opened his hand and
otherwise showed symptoms that he was strongly
agitated by contending feelings was on the point
too forming some sudden resolution and yet
still in uncertainty what course he should pursue
but when he saw markham everard after
one look unspeakable anguish towards alice
turning his back to depart he broke out into his
familiar ejaculation odds fish i this must not
be in three strides he overtook the slowlyretiring
everard tapped him smartly on the
shoulder and as he turned round said with an
air command which he well knew how to
adopt at pleasure one word with you sir
at your pleasure sir replied everard
and naturally conjecturing the purpose his antagonist
to be hostile took hold his rapier with
woodstock 
the left hand and laid the right on the hilt not
displeased at the supposed call for anger is at
least as much akin to disappointment as pity is
said to be to love
pshaw answered the king that cannot
be now colonel everard i am charles
stuart 
everard recoiled in the greatest surprise and
next exclaimed impossible it cannot be 
the king scots has escaped from bristol 
my lord wilmot your talents for intrigue are
well known but this will not pass upon me
the king scots master everard replied
charles since you are so pleased to limit
his sovereignty at any rate the eldest son
 the late sovereign britain is now before
you therefore it is impossible he could have
escaped from bristol doctor rochecliffe shall
be my voucher and will tell you moreover that
wilmot is a fair complexion and light hair 
mine you may see is swart as a raven
rochecliffe seeing what was passing abandoned
alice to the care wildrake whose extreme
delicacy in the attempts he made to bring
 woodstock
her back to life formed an amiable contrast to
his usual wildness and occupied him so much
that he remained for the moment ignorant the
disclosure in which he would have been so much
interested as for doctor rochecliffe he came
forward wringing his hands in all the demonstration
 extreme anxiety and with the usual ex 
exclamations attending such a state
peace doctor rochecliffe said the king
with such complete selfpossession as indeed became
a prince we are in the hands i am
satisfied a man honour master everard
must be pleased in finding only a fugitive prince
in the person in whom he thought he had discovered
a successful rival he cannot but be aware
 the feelings which prevented me from taking
advantage the cover which this young lady's
devoted loyalty afforded me at the risk her
own happiness he is the party who is to profit
by my candour and certainly i have a right to
expect that my condition already indifferent
enough shall not be rendered worse by his becoming
privy to it under such circumstances at
any rate the avowal is made and it is for cowoodstock
ill
lonely everard to consider how he is to conduct
himself
oh your majesty my liege my king 
my royal prince exclaimed wildrake who
at length discovering what was passing had
crawled on his knees and seizing the king's
hand was kissing it more like a child mumbling
gingerbread or a lover devouring the yielded
hand his mistress than in the manner in which
such salutations pass at court if my dear
friend mark everard should prove a dog on this
occasion rely on me i will cut his throat on the
spot were i to do the same for myself the moment
afterward 
hush hush my good friend and loyal subject
said the king and compose yourself 
for though i am obliged to put on the prince
for a moment we have not privacy or safety to
receive our subjects in king cambyses vein
everard who had stood for a time utterly
confounded awoke at length like a man from a
dream
sire he said bowing low and with profound
deference if i do not offer you the homage 
 woodstock
a subject with knee and sword it is because
god by whom kings reign has denied you for
the present the power ascending your throne
without rekindling civil war for your safety
being endangered by me let not such an imagination
for an instant cross your mind had i
not respected your person were i not bound to
you for the candour with which yovir noble avowal
has prevented the misery my future life your
misfortunes would have rendered your person as
sacred so far as i can protect it as it could be
esteemed by the most devoted royalist in the
kingdom if your plans are soundly considered
and securely laid think that all which is now
passed is but a dream if they are in such a
state that i can aid them saving my duty to the
commonwealth which will permit me to be privy
to no schemes actual violence your majesty
may command my services
it may be i may be troublesome to you
sir said the king for my fortunes are not such
as to permit me to reject even the most limited
offers assistance but if i can i will dispense
with applying to you i would not willingly put
woodstock 
any man's compassion at war with his sense 
duty on my account doctor i think there will
be no farther taking today either with sword or
cane so we may as well return to the lodge
and leave these looking at alice and everard
 who may have more to say in explanation
 no no exclaimed alice who was now perfectly
come to herself and partly by her own observation
partly from the report dr rochecliffs
comprehended all that had taken place
my cousin everard and i have nothing to explain
he will forgive me for having riddled with
him when i dared not speak plainly and i forgive
him for having read my riddle wrong but
my father has my promise we must not correspond
or converse for the present i return instantly
to the lodge and he to woodstock unless
you sire bowing to the king command his
duty otherwise instant to the town cousin
markham and if danger should approach give
us warning
everard would have delayed her departure
would have excused himself for his unjust suspicion
would have said a thousand things but she
vor tit h
 woodstock
would not listen to him saying for all other answer
 farewell markham till god send better
days 
 she is an angel truth and beauty said
roger wildrake and i like a blasphemous
heretic called her a lindabrides but has your
majesty craving your pardon no commands
for poor hodge wildrake who will blow out his
own or any other man's brains in england to do
your grace a pleasure 
we entreat our good friend wildrake to do
nothing hastily said charles smiling such
brains as his are rare and should not be rashly dispersed
as the like may not be easily collected we
recommend him to be silent and prudent to tilt
no more with loyal clergymen the church 
england and to get himself a new jacket with all
convenient speed to which we beg to contribute
our royal aid when fit time comes we hope to
find other service for him
as he spoke he slid ten pieces into the hand
 poor wildrake who confounded with the excess
 his loyal gratitude blubbered like a child
and would have followed the king had not 

tor rochecliife in few words but peremptory
insisted that he should return with his patron
promising him he should certainly be employed
in assisting the king's escape could an opportunity
be found using his services
be so generous reverend sir and you bind
me to you for ever said the cavalier and i
conjure you not to keep malice against me on
account the foolery you wot 
i have no occasion captain wildrake said
the doctor for i think i had the best it
well then doctor i forgive you on my part
and i pray you for christian charity let me have
a finger in this good service for as i live in hope
 it rely that i shall die disappointment
while the doctor and soldier thus spoke together
charles took leave everard who remained
uncovered while he spoke to him with
his usual grace i need not bid you no longer
be jealous me said the king for i presume
you will scarce think a match betwixt
alice and me which would be too losing a one
on her side for other thoughts the wildest libertine
could not entertain them towards so highminded
a creature and believe me that my sense
 i woodstock
 her merit did not need this last distinguished
proof her truth and loyalty i saw enough
 her from her answers to some idle sallies 
gallantry to know with what a lofty character she
is endowed mr everard her happiness i see
depends on you and i trust you will be the careful
guardian it if we can take any obstacle
out the way your joint happiness be assured
we will use our influence farewell sir if we
cannot be better friends do not at least let us entertain
harder or worse thoughts each other
than we have now
there was something in the manner charles
that was extremely affecting something too in
his condition as a fugitive in the kingdom which
was his own by inheritance that made a direct
appeal to everard's bosom though in contradiction
to the dictates that policy which he
judged it this duty to pursue in the distracted circumstances
 the country he remained as we
have said uncovered and in his manner testified
the highest expression reverence up to the
point when such might seem a symbol allegiance
he bowed so low as almost approach his
lips to the hand charles but he did not kiss
woodstock 
it i would rescue your person sir he said
with the purchase my own life more 
ho stopped short and the king took up his sentence
where it broke off more you cannot do
said charles to maintain an honourable consistency
 but what you have said is enough you
cannot render homage to my proffered hand as
that a sovereign but you will not prevent my
taking yours as a friend if you allow me to call
myself so i am sure as a wellwisher at least
the generous soul everard was touched 
he took the king's hand and pressed it to his
lips
oh he said were better times to come 
bind yourself to nothing dear everard
said the goodnatured prince partaking his emotion
 we reason ill while our feelings are moved
i will recruit no man to his loss nor will i
have my fallen fortunes involve those others
because they have humanity enough to pity my
present condition if better times come why we
will meet again and i hope to our mutual satisfaction
if not as your future fatherinlaw
would say a benevolent smile came over ki
 woodstock
face and accorded not iinmeetly with his glistening
eyes if not this parting was well
made
everard turned away with a deep bow almost
choking under contending feelings the uppermost
 which was a sense the generosity with
which charles at his own imminent risk had
cleared away the darkness that seemed about to
overwhelm his prospects happiness for life 
mixed with a deep sense the perils by which he
was environed he returned to the little town
followed by his attendant wildrake who turned
back so often with weeping eyes and hands clasped
and uplifted as supplicating heaven that
everard was obliged to remind him that his gestures
might be observed by some one and occasion
suspicion
the generous conduct the king during the
closing part this remarkable scene had not
escaped alice's notice and erasing at once from
her mind all resentment charles's former conduct
and all the suspicions they had deservedly
excited awakened in her bosom a sense the
natural goodness his disposition which perwoodstock

mitted her to unite regard for his person with
that reverence for his high office in which she
had been educated as a portion her creed she
felt convinced and delighted with the conviction
that his virtues were his own his libertinism the
fault education or rather want education
and the corrupting advice sycophants and flatterers
she could not know or perhaps did not
in that moment consider that in a soil where no
care is taken to eradicate tares they will outgrow
and smother the wholesome seed even if the last
is more natural to the soil for as doctor rochecliffs
informed her afterwards for her edification
promising as was his custom to explain the
precise words on some future occasion if she would
put him in mind virtus restored ducemqiie 
 vita sine magistri discuntur
the quotations the learned doctor and antiquary were often
left uninterpreted though seldom un communicated owing to his
contempt for those vho did not understand the learned languages
and his dislike to the labour translation for the benefit ladies
and country gentlemen that fair readers and country thanes
may not on this occasion burst in ignorance we add the meaning
 the passage in the text virtue requires the aid a govern
nor and director vices arc learned without a teacher
 woodstock
there was no room for such reflections at present
conscious mutual sincerity by a sort 
intellectual communication through which individuals
are led to understand each other better
perhaps in delicate circumstances than bywords
reserve and simulation appeared to be
now banished from the intercourse between the
king and alice with manly frankness and at
the same time with princely condescension he
requested her exhausted as she was to accept 
his arm on the vay homeward instead that 
doctor rochecliffe and alice accepted his
support with modest humility but without a shadow
 mistrust or fear it seemed as if the last
half hour had satisfied them perfectly with the
character each other and that each had full
conviction the purity and sincerity the
other's intentions
doctor rochecliffe in the meantime had
fallen some four or five paces behind for less
light and active than alice who had besides
the assistance the king's support he was unable
without effort and difficulty to keep up
with the pace charles who then was as we
woodstock 
have elsewhere noticed one the best walkers
in england and was sometimes apt to forget
as great men will that others were inferior to
him in activity
 dear alice said the king but as if the
epithet were entirely fraternal i like your everard
much i would to god he were our determination
 but since that cannot be i am sure
he will prove a generous enemy
may it please you sire said alice modestly
but with some firmness my cousin will never
be your majesty s personal enemy and he
is one the few on whose slightest word you
may rely more than on the oath those who
profess more strongly and formally he is utterly
incapable abusing your majesty's most generous
and voluntary confidence
on my honour i believe so alice replied
the king but odd's fish my girl let majesty
sleep for the present it concerns my safety as
i told your brother lately call me sir then
which belongs alike to king peer knight and
gentleman or rather let me be wild louis kern
again
 woodstock
alice looked down and shook her head that
cannot be please your majesty
 what louis was a saucy companion a
naughty presuming boy and you cannot abide
him well perhaps you are right but we
will wait for doctor rochechffe he said desirous
with goodnatured delicacy to make alice
aware that he had no purpose engaging her in
any discussion which could recall painful ideas
they paused accordingly and again she felt relieved
and grateful
i cannot persuade our fair friend mistress
alice doctor said the king that she must
in prudence forbear using titles respect to me
while there are such very slender means sustaining
it
it is a reproach to earth and to fortune
answered the divine as fast as his recovered
breath would permit him that your most sacred
majesty's present condition should not accord
with the rendering those honours which
are your own by birth and which with god's
blessing on the efforts your loyal subjects i
iiopc to see rendered to you as your hereditary
woodstock 
right by the universal voice the three kingdoms

true doctor replied the king but in
the meanwhile can you expound to mistress
alice lee two lines horace which i have carried
in my thick head several years till now
they have come pat to my purpose as my canny
subjects scotland say if you keep a thing seven
years you are sure to find a use for it at last
telephusdiy so it begins 
 tclephus et peleus cum pauper et exult uterqjic
project ampullas et sesquipedalia verba 
i will explain the passage to mistress alice
lee when she reminds me it or rather he
added recollecting that his ordinary dilatory
answer ought not to be returned when the order
for exposition emanated from his sovereign i
will repeat a poor couplet from my own translation
 the poem 
heroes and kings in exile forced to roam
leave swelling phrase and sevenleagued words at home 
a most admirable version doctors said
 woodstock
charles i feel all its force and particularly
the beautiful rendering sesquipedalia verba
into sevenleagued boots words i mean it reminds
me like half the things i meet with in
this world the contes de commerce uoye 
thus conversing they reached the lodge and
as the king went to his chamber to prepare for
the breakfast summons now impending the idea
crossed his mind wilmot and villiers and
killigrew would laugh at me did they hear a
campaign in which neither man nor woman had
been conquered but odd's fish let them laugh
as they will there is something at my heart
which tells me that for once in my life i have
acted well
that day and the next were spent in tranquillity

which was to announce to him that a

none such was yet in readiness but he learned

two gentlemen verona
it is time we should give some account the
other actors in our drama the interest due to the
principal personages having for some time engrossed
our attention exclusively
we are therefore to inform the reader that
the lingering longings the commissioners who
had been driven forth their proposed paradise
 woodstock not by a cherub indeed but as
they thought by spirits another sort still detained
them in the vicinity they had indeed
left the little borough under pretence indifferent
accommodation the more palpable reasons
were that they entertained some resentment
i
nvoodstock 
against everard as the means their disappointment
and had no mind to reside where their
proceedings could be overlooked by him although
they took leave in terms the utmost respect
they went however no farther than oxford and
remained there as ravens who are accustomed to
witness the chase sit upon a tree or crag at a little
distance and watch the disembowelling the
deer expecting the relics which fall to their share
meantime the university and city but especially
the former supplied them with some means
 employing their various faculties to advantage
until the expected moment when as they hoped
they should either be summoned to windsor or
woodstock should once more be abandoned to
their discretion
bletson to pass the time vexed the souls such
learned and pious divines and scholars as he could
intrude his hateful presence upon by sophistry
atheistical discourse and challenges to them to
impugn the most scandalous theses desborough
one the most brutally ignorant men the period
got himself nominated the head a college
and lost no time in cutting down trees and plum
 woodstock
during plate as for harrison he preached in
full uniform in saint mary's church wearing his
buffcoat boots and spurs as if he were about to
take the field for the fight at arrcageddon and
it was hard to say whether that seat learning
religion and loyalty as it is called by clarendon
was more vexed by the rapine lesbos
the cold scepticism bletson or the frantic
enthusiasm the fifth monarchy champion
ever and anon soldiers under pretence relieving
guard or otherwise went and came betwixt
woodstock and oxford and maintained it
may be supposed a correspondence with trusty
tomkins who though he chiefly resided in the
town woodstock visited the lodge occasionally
and to whom therefore they doubtless trusted
for information concerning the proceedings
there
indeed this man tomkins seemed by some secret
means to have gained the confidence in part
if not in whole almost every one connected with
these intrigues all closeted him all conversed
with him in private those who had the means propitiated
him with gifts those who had not were
vvohisttftck 
been previously imposed upon he pointed them
out to pearson with no farther comment than
was implied in the exclamation the simple
fools
but his assistants began to lose heart and be
discouraged and required all his spirit to raise
theirs he then called their attention to voices
which they seemed to hear before them and urged
these as evidence that they were moving on
the track some enemy the commonwealth
who for the execution his malignant plots
had retreated into these extraordinary fastnesses
the spirits the men became at last downcast
notwithstanding all this encouragement
they spoke to each other in whispers the devils
 woodstock who might be all the while
decoying them forward to a room said to exist
in the palace where the floor revolving on an
axis precipitated those who entered into a bottomless
abyss humgudgeon hinted that he
had consulted the scripture that morning by way
 lot and his fortune had been to alight on the
passage eutychus fell down from the third
loft the energy and authority cromwell
is
iss woodstock
however and the refreshment some food and
strong waters reconciled them to pursuing their
task
nevertheless with all their unwearied exertions
morning dawned on the search before they
had reached doctor rochecliff'e's sitting apartment
into which after all they obtained entrance
by a mode much more difficult than that
which the doctor himself employed but here
their ingenuity was long at fault from the
miscellaneous articles that were strewed around
and the preparations made for food and lodging
it seemed they had gained the very citadel the
labyrinth but though various passages opened
from it they all terminated in places with which
they were already acquainted or communicated
with the other parts the house where their
own sentinels assured them none had passed
cromwell remained long in deep uncertainty
meantime he directed pearson to take charge 
the ciphers and more important papers which
lay on the table though there is little there
he said that i have not already known by
means trusty tomkins honest joseph for
woodstock 
an artful and thoroughpaced agent the like 
thee is not left in england
after a considerable pause during which he
sounded with the pummel his sword almost
every stone in the building and every plank on
the floor the general gave orders to bring the
old knight and doctor rochecliffe to the spot
trusting that he might work out them some
explanation the secrets this apartment
so please your excellency to let me to
deal with them said pearson who was a thoroughpaced
soldier fortune and had been a
buccaneer in the west indies i think that
by a whipcord twitched tight round their forehead
and twisted round with a pistolbut i
could make either the truth start from their lips
or the eyes from their head
 out upon thee pearson said cromwell
with abhorrence we have no warrant for such
cruelty neither as englishmen nor christians
we may slay malignant as we crush noxious
animals but to torture them is a deadly sin for
it is written he made them to be pitied 
those who carried them captive nay i recall
vol iii t
 woodstock
the order even for their examination trusting
that wisdom will be granted us to discover their
most secret devices
there was a pause accordingly during which
an idea seized upon cromwell's imagination 
 bring me hither he said yonder stool 
and placing it beneath one the windows 
which there were two so high in the wall as not
to be accessible from the floor he clambered up
into the entrance the window which was six
or seven feet deep corresponding with the thickness
 the wall come up hither pearson
said the general but ere thou comest double
the guard at the foot the turret called love's
ladder and bid them bring up the other petard
so now come thou hither
the officer however brave in the field was
one those whom a great height strikes with
giddiness and sickness he shrunk back from
the view the precipice on the verge which
cromwell was standing with complete indifference
till the general catching the hand his
follower pulled him forward as far as he would
advance i think said the general i have
woodstock 
found the clew but by this light it is no easy one 
see you we stand in the portal near the top 
rosamond's tower and yon turret which rises
opposite to our feet is that which is called lover's
ladder from which the drawbridge reached
that admitted the profligate norman tyrant to
the bower his mistress
true my lord but the drawbridge is gone
said pearson
ay pearson replied the general but
an active man might spring from the spot we
stand upon to the battlements yonder turret
i do not think so my lord said pearson
what said cromwell not if the avenger
 blood were behind you with his slaughterweapon
in his hand 
the fear death might do much answered
pearson but when i look at that sheer depth
on either side and at the empty chasm between us
and yonder turret which is i warrant you twelve
feet distant i confess the truth nothing short 
the most imminent danger should induce me to
try pah the thought makes my head grow
giddy i tremble to see your highness stand
 woodstock
there balancing yourself as if you meditated a
spring into the empty air i repeat i would
scarce stand so near the verge as does your highness
for the rescue my life
ah base and degenerate spirit said the
general soul mud and clay would st thou
not do it and much more for the possession 
empire that is peradventure continued he
changing his tone as one who has said too much
shouldst thou be called on to do this that thereby
becoming a great man in the tribes israel
thou lightest redeem the captivity jerusalem
ay and it may be work some great work for
the afflicted people this land
your highness may feel such calls said the
officer but it is not for poor gilbert pearson
your faithful follower you made a jest me
yesterday when i tried to speak your language 
and i am no more able to fulfil your designs
than to use your mode speech
but pearson said cromwell thou hast
thrice yea four times called me your highness
did i my lord i was not sensible it
i crave your pardon said the officer
woodstock 
nay said oliver there was no offence i
do indeed stand high and i may perchance stand
higher though alas it were fitter for a simple
soul like me to return to my plough and my
husbandry nevertheless i will not wrestle
against the supreme will should i be called onto
do yet more in that worthy cause for surely
he who hath been to our british israel as a shield
 help and a sword excellency making her
enemies be found leers unto her will not give
over the flock to those foolish shepherds westminster
who shear the sheep and feed them not
and who are in very deed hirelings not shepherds

i trust to see your lordship quoit them all
down stairs answered pearson but may i
ask why we pursue this discourse even now until
we have secured the common enemy 
i will tarry no jot time said the general 
fence the communication love's ladder as
it is called below as i take it for almost certain
that the party whom we have driven from fastness
to fastness during the night has at length
sprung to the top yonder battlements from the
i woodstock
place where we now stand finding the turret is
guarded below the place he has chosen for his
security will prove a rattrap from whence there
is no returning
there is a cask gunpowder in this cabinet
said pearson were it not better my
lord to mine the tower if he will not render
himself and send the whole turret with its contents
one hundred feet into the air 
ah silly man said cromwell striking him
familiarly on the shoulder if thou hadst done
this without telling me it had been good service
but we will first summon the turret and then
think whether the petit will serve our turn it
is but mining at last blow a summons there
down below
the trumpets rung at his bidding till the old
walls echoed from every recess and vaulted archway
cromwell as if he cared not to look upon
the person whom he expected to appear drew back
like a necromancer afraid the spectre which he
has evoked
he has come to the battlement said pearson
to his general
woodstock 
in what dress or appearance answered
cromwell from within the chamber
a grey ridingsuit assented with silver
russet walkingboots a cut band a grey hat and
plume black hair
it is he it is he said cromwell and another
crowning mercy is vouchsafed 
meantime pearson and young lee exchanged
defiance from their respective posts
surrenders said the former or we blow
you up in your fastness
i am come too high a race to surrender to
rebels said albert assuming the air with which
in such a condition a king might have spoken
i bear you to witness cried cromwell exultingly
 he hath refused quarter a surety his
blood be on his head one you bring down the
barrel powder as he loves to soar high we
will add what can be taken from the soldiers bandelivers
 come with me pearson thou understands
this gear corporal gracebehere stand
thou fast on the platform the window where
captain pearson and i stood but even now and
bend the point thy partizan against any who
 woodstock
shall attempt to pass thou art as strong as a
bull and i will back thee against despair itself
but said the corporal mounting reluctantly
 the place is as the pinnacle the temple 
and it is written that eutychus fell down from
the third loft and was taken up dead
because he slept upon his post answered
cromwell readily beware thou carelessness
and thus thy feet shall be kept from stumbling 
you four soldiers remain here to support the
corporal if it be necessary and you as well as
the corporal will draw into the vaulted passage
the minute the trumpets sound a retreat it is as
strong as a casemate and you may lie there safe
from the effects the mine thou zerobabel
robins i know wilt be their lance private
robins bowed and the general departed to join
those who were without
as he reached the door the hall the petard
was heard to explode and he saw that it had succeeded
 for the soldiers rushed brandishing their
swords and pistols in at the postern the turret
whose gate had been successfully forced a thrill
woodstock 
 exultation but not unmingled with horror shot
across the veins the ambitious soldier
now now he cried they are dealing
with him 
his expectations were deceived pearson and
the others returned disappointed and reported
they had been stopt by a strong trap door grated
iron extended over the narrow stair and they
could see there was an obstacle the same kind
some ten feet higher to remove it by force
while a desperate and wellarmed man had the advantage
 the steps above them might cost many
lives which lackaday said the general
it is our duty to be tender what dost thou
advise gilbert pearson 
we must use powder my lord answered
pearson who saw his master was determined he
should have the whole merit the proceeding 
there may be a chamber easily and conveniently
formed under the foot the stair we have
a sausage by good luck to form the train and
so 
ah said cromwell i know thou canst
manage such gear well but gilbert i go to
b woodstock
visit the posts and give them orders to retire to
a safe distance when the retreat is sounded you
will allow them five minutes for this purpose
three is enough for any knave them all
said pearson they will be lame indeed that
require more on such a service i ask but one
though i fire the train myself
take heed said cromwell that the poor
soul be listened to if he asks quarter it may be
he may repent him his hardheartiness and
cal for mercy
and mercy he shall have answered pearson
 providing he calls loud enough to make me
hear him for the explosion that damned petard
has made me as deaf as the devils dam
hush gilbert hush said cromwell you
offend in your language
zooks sir i must speak either in your way
or in my own said pearson unless i am to be
dumb as well as deaf away with you my lord
to visit the posts and you will presently hear
me make some noise in the world
cromwell smiled gently at his aiddecamp's
petulance patted him on the shoulder and called
him a mad fellow walked a little way then turned
back to whisper what thou doest do quickly
then returned again towards the outer circle 
guards turning his head from time to time as if
to assure himself that the corporal to whom he
had intrusted the duty still kept guard with his
advanced weapon upon the terrific chasm between
rosamond's tower and the corresponding turret
seeing him standing on his post the general
muttered between his mustachios the fellow
hath the strength and courage a bear and yonder
is a post where one shall do more to keep back
than an hundred in making way he cast a last
look on the gigantic figure who stood in that airy
position like some gothic statue the weapon half
levelled against the opposite turret with the but
rested against his right foot his steel cap and
burnished corslet glittering in the rising sun
cromwell then passed on to give the necessary
orders that such sentinels as might be endangered
at their present posts by the effect the mine
should withdraw at the sound the trumpet to the
places which he pointed out to them never on
any occasion his life did he display more calmness
and presence mind he was kind nay
tk woodstock
facetious with the soldiers who adored him and
yet he resembled a volcano before the eruption
commences all peaceful and quiet without while
an hundred contradictory passions were raging in
his bosom
corporal humgudgeon meanwhile remained
steady upon his post yet though as determined
a soldier as ever fought among the redoubled regiment
 ironsides and possessed no small
share that exalted fanaticism which lent so keen
an edge to the natural courage those stern religionists
the veteran felt his present situation to
be highly uncomfortable within a pike's length
 him arose a turret which was about to be dispersed
in massive fragments through the air and
he felt small confidence in the length time
which might be allowed for his escape from such
a dangerous vicinity the duty constant vigilance
upon his post was partly divided by this
natural feeling which induced him from time to
time to bend his eyes on the miners below instead
 keeping them rivetted on the opposite turret
at length the interest the scene arose to the
uttermost after entering and returning from the
turret and coming out again more than once in
woodstock 
the course about twenty minutes pearson issued
as it might be supposed for the last time
carrying in his hand and uncoiling as he went
along the sausage or linen bag so called from
its appearance which strongly sewed together
and crammed with gunpowder was to serve asa
train betwixt the mine to be sprung and the
point occupied by the engineer who was to give
fire he was in the act finally adjusting it
when the attention the corporal on the tower
became irresistibly and exclusively rivetted upon
the preparations for the explosion but while he
watched the aiddecamp drawing his pistol to
give fire and the trumpeter handling his instrument
as waiting the order to sound the retreat
fate rushed on the unhappy sentinel in a way he
least expected
young active bold and completely possessed
 his presence mind albert lee who had
been from the loopholes a watchful observer 
every measure which had been taken by his besiegers
had resolved to make one desperate effort
for selfpreservation while the head the sentinel
on the opposite platform was turned from
 woodstock
him and bent rather downwards he suddenly
sprung across the chasm though the space on
which he lighted was scarce wide enough for two
persons threw the surprised soldier from his precarious
stand and jumped himself down into the
chamber the gigantic trooper went sheer down
twenty feet struck against a projecting battlement
which launched the wretched man outwards and
then fell on the earth with such tremendous force
that the head which first touched the ground
tinted a hole in the soil six inches in depth
and was crushed like an eggshell scarce knowing
what had happened yet startled and confounded
at the descent this heavy body which
fell at no great distance from him pearson snapt
his pistol at the train no previous warning given 
the powder caught and the mine exploded had
it been strongly charged with powder many 
those without might have suffered but the explosion
was only powerful enough to blow out ina
lateral direction a part the wall just above
the foundation sufficient however to destroy the
equipoise the building then amid a cloud
 smoke which began gradually to encircle the
woodstock 
turret like a shrewd arising slowly from its base
to its summit it was seen to stagger and shake
by all who had courage to look steadily at a sight
so dreadful slowly at first the building inclined
outwards then rushed precipitately to its
base and fell to the ground in huge fragments
the strength its resistance showing the excellence
 the masonwork the engineer so soon
as he had fired the train fled in such alarm that
he well nigh ran against his general who was
advancing towards him while a huge stone from
the summit the building flying farther than
the rest lighted within a yard them
thou hast been overhasty pearson said
cromwell with the greatest composure possible
 hath no one fallen in that same tower 
sloe
some one fell said pearson still in great
agitation and yonder lies his body halfburied
in the rubbish
with a quick and resolute step cromwell approached
the spot and exclaimed pearson
thou hast ruined methe young man hath escaped
 this is our own sentinel plague on the
 woodstock
idiot let him rot beneath the ruins which crushed
him 
a cry now resounded from the platform rosamond's
tower which appeared yet taller than
formerly deprived the neighbouring turret
which emulated though it did not attain to its
height a prisoner noble general a prisoner
the fox whom we have chased au night is now
in the snare the lord hath delivered him into
the hand his servants
look you keep him in safe custody exclaimed
cromwell and bring him presently
down to the apartment from which the secret passages
have their principal entrance
 your excellency shall be obeyed 
the proceedings albert lee to which these
exclamations related had been unfortunate he
had dashed from the platform as we have related
the gigantic strength the soldier opposed
to him and had instantly jumped down into
rochecliffe's chamber but the soldiers stationed
there threw themselves upon him and after a
struggle which was hopelessly maintained against
such advantage numbers had thrown the young
woodstock 
cavalier to the ground two them drawn down
by his strenuous exertions falling across him at
the same moment a sharp and severe report was
heard winch like a clap thunder in the immediate
vicinity shook all around them till the
strong and solid tower tottered like the mast a
stately vessel when about to part by the board
in a few seconds this was followed by another sullen
sound at first low and deep but augmenting
like the roar a cataract as it descends reeling
bellowing and rushing as if to astound boil
heaven and earth so awful indeed was the
sound the neighbour tower as it fell that both
the captive and those who struggled with him
continued for a minute or two passive in each
other's grasp
albert was the first who recovered consciousness
and activity he shook off those who lay
above him and made a desperate effort to gain
his feet in which he partly succeeded but as he
had to deal with men accustomed to every species
 danger and whose energies were recovered
nearly as soon as his own he was completely 
 ir
 woodstock
cured and his arms held down loyal and faithful
to his trust and resolved to sustain to the last
the character which he had assumed he exclaimed
as his struggles were finally overpowered rebel
villains would you slay your king 
ha heard you that cried one the soldiers
to the lanceprivate who commanded the
party shall i not strike this son a wicked
father under the fifth rib even as the tyrant 
moab was smitten by thud with a dagger a
cubit's length 
but robins answered be it far from us merciful
strickalthrow to slay in cold blood the captive
 our bow and our spear methinks since
the storm tredagh f we have shed enough 
blood therefore on your lives do him no evil 
but take from him his arms and let us bring him
before the chosen instrument even our general
that he may do with him what is meet in his
eyes
 lanceprivate or lancebrigade a private appointed
to a small command a sort temporary corporal
i tredagh or drogheda was taken by cromwell in by
storm and the governor and whole garrison put to the sword
woodstock 
by this time the soldier whose exultation had
made him the first to communicate the intelligence
from the battlements to cromwell returned
and brought commands corresponding to the orders
 their temporary officer and albert lee
disarmed and bound was conducted as a captive
into the apartment which derived its name from
the victories his ancestor and placed in the presence
 general cromwell
running over in his mind the time which had
elapsed since the departure charles till the
siege if it may be termed so had terminated in
his own capture albert had every reason to hope
that his royal master must have had time to accomplish
his escape yet he determined to maintain
to the last a deceit which might for a time
insure the king's safety the difference betwixt
them could not he thought be instantly discovered
begrimed as he was with dust and smoke
and with blood issuing from some scratches received
in the scuffle
in this evil plight but bearing himself with
such dignity as was adapted to the princely chaos

racer albert was ushered into the apartment 
victor lee where in his father's own chair reclined
the triumphant enemy the cause to which

oliver cromwell arose from his seat as the
two veteran soldiers zerobabel robins and merciful
strickalthrow introduced into the apartment
the prisoner whom they held by the arms and
fixed his stern hazel eye on albert long before he
could give vent to the ideas which were swelling
in his bosom exultation was the most predominant

art not thou he at length said that egyptian
which before these days modest an uproar
and eldest out into the wilderness many thousand
men who were murderers ha youth i
 woodstock
have hunted thee from stirling to worcester and
we are met at last 
i would replied albert speaking in the character
which he had assumed that we had met
where i could have shown thee the difference betwixt
a rightful king and an ambitious usurper 
go to young man said cromwell say
rather the difference between a judge raised up
for the redemption england and the son 
those kings whom the lord in his anger permitted
to reign over her but we will not waste useless
words god knows that it is not our will
that we are called to such high matters being as
humble in our thoughts as we are ourselves 
and in our unassisted nature frail and foolish and
unable to render a reason but for the better spirit
within us which is not us thou art weary
young man and thy nature requires rest and refection
being doubtless dealt with delicately as
one who hath fed on the fat and drunk the
sweet and who hath been clothed in purple and
fine linen
here the general suddenly stopt and then
abruptly exclaimed but is this ah whom
woodstock till
have we here these are not the locks the swarthy
lad charles stuart a cheat a cheat 
albert hastily cast his eyes on a mirror which
stood in the room and perceived that a dark peruke
found among doctor rochecliffe's miscellaneous
wardrobe had been disordered in the
scuffle and that his own lightbrown hair was
escaping from beneath it
 who is this said cromwell again stamping
with fury pluck the disguise from him
the soldiers did so and bringing him at the
same time towards the light the deception could
not be maintained for a moment longer with any
possibility success cromwell came up to him
with his teeth set and grinding against each other
as he spoke his hands clenched and trembling
with emotion and speaking with a voice lowpitched
bitterly and deeply emphatic such as
might have preceded a stab with his dagger
thy name young man 
he was answered calmly and firmly while the
countenance the speaker wore a cast triumph
and even contempt
o woodstock
albert lee ditches a faithful subject 
king charles
i might have guessed it said cromwell 
ay and to king charles shalt thou go as soon
as it is noon on the dial pearson he continued
 let him be carried to the others and let
them be executed at twelve exactly
all sir said pearson surprised for cromwell
though he at times made formidable examples
was in general by no means sanguinary
all repeated cromwell fixing his eye on
yoimg lee yes young sir your conduct has
devoted to death thy father thy kinsman and the
stranger that was in thine household such wreck
hast thou brought on thy father's house
my father too my aged father said albert
looking upward and endeavouring to raise
his hands in the same direction which was prevented
by his bonds the lord's will be done 
all this havoc can be saved if said the general
 thou wilt answer one question where
is the young charles stuart who was called king
 scotland 
woods uk jis
under heavens protection and safe from
thy power was the firm and unhesitating answer
 the young royalist
 away with him to prisons said cromwell 
and from thence to execution with the rest 
them as malignant taken in the fact let a
court martial sit on them presently
one word said young lee as they led him
from the room
stop stop said cromwell with the agitation
 renewed hope let him be heard
you love texts scripture said albert
let this be the subject your next homily
had zimri peace who slew his master 
away with him said the general let
him die the death i have said it
as cromwell spoke these words his aiddecamp
observed that he became unwontedly pale
your excellency is overtoiled in the public
service said pearson a course the stag in
the evening will refresh you the old knight hath
a noble hound here if we can but get him to hunt
without his master which may be hard as he is
faithful and 
 woodstock
hang him up said cromwell
what whom hang the noble dog your
excellency was wont to love a good hound 
it matters not said cromwell let him be
killed is it not written that they slew in the valley
 anchor not only the accursed achan with
his sons and his daughters but also his oxen and
his asses and his sheep and every live thing belonging
unto him and even thus shall we do to
the malignant family lee who have aided
sisera in his flight when israel might have been
delivered his trouble for ever but send out
couriers and patrols follow pursue watch in
every direction let my horse be ready at the
door in five minutes or bring me the first thou
canst find
 it seemed to pearson that this was something
wildly spoken and that the cold perspiration was
standing upon the general's brow as he said it
he therefore again pressed the necessity repose
and it would appear that nature seconded strongly
the representation cromwell arose and made a
step or two towards the door the apartment 
but stopped staggered and after a pause sate
woodstock 
down in a chair truly friend pearson he
said this weary carcase ours is an impediment
to us even in our most necessary business
and i am fitter to sleep than to watch which is not
my wont place guards therefore tiu we repose
ourselves for an hour or two send out in every
direction and spare not for horses flesh wake
me if the court martial should require instruction
and forget not to see the sentence punctually executed
on the lees and those who were arrested
with them
as cromwell spoke thus he arose and halfopened
a bed room door when pearson again craved
pardon for asking if he had rightly understood
his excellency that all the prisoners were
to be executed
have i not said it answered cromwell
displeasedly is it because thou art a man 
blood and hast ever been that thou dost affect
these scruples to show thyself tenderhearted at
my expense i tell thee that if there lack one in
the full tale execution thine own life shall pay
the forfeit
so saying he entered the apartment followed
uj woodstock
by the groom his chamber who attended upon
pearson's summons
when his general had retired pearson remained
in great perplexity what he ought to do and
that from no scruples conscience but from uncertainty
whether he might not err either in postponing
or in too hastily and too literally executing
the instructions he had received
in the meantime strickalthrow and robins had
returned after lodging albert in prison to the
room where pearson was still musing on his generals
commands both these men were agitators
in their army and old soldiers whom cromwell
was accustomed to treat with great familiarity
 so that robins had no hesitation to ask captain
pearson whether he meant to execute the
commands the general even to the letter
pearson shook his head with an air doubt
but added there was no choice left
be assured said the old man that if thou
doest this folly thou wilt cause israel to sin and
that the general will not be pleased with your service
thou knowest and none better than thou
that oliver although he be like unto david the son
woodstock
 jesse in faith and wisdom and courage yet
there are times when the evil spirit cometh upon
him as it did upon saul and he uttered commands
which he will not thank any one for executing
pearson was too good a politician to assent directly
to a proposition which he could not deny 
he only shook his head once more and said that it
was easy for those to talk who were not responsible
but the soldier's duty was to obey his orders and
not to judge them
very righteous truth said merciful strickthrow
a grim old scotchman i marvel where
our brother zerobabel caught up this softness 
heart r
why i do but wish said zerobabel that
four or five human creatures nay draw the breath
 god's air for a few hours more there can be
small harm done by delaying the execution and
the general will have some time for reflection
ay said captain pearson but i in my service
must be more pointedly obsequious than thou
in thy plainness art bound to be friend zeroba
bel
o
 woodstock
 then shall the coarse friezecassock the
private soldier bear out the blast with the gilded
lining the captain said zerobabel ay indeed
i can show you warrant why we be artful to
each other in doing acts kindness 
seeing the best us are poor sinful crease
turns who might suffer being called to a brief accounting

 a verity you surprise me brother zeroba
bel said strickalthrow that thou being an old
and experienced soldier whose head hath grown
grey in battle should'st give such advice to a
young officer is not the general's commission to
take away the wicked from the land and to root
out the amalekite and the jebusite and the peruse
and the hittite and the graphite and
the morte and are not these men justly to be
compared to the five kings who took shelter in
the cave maketh who were delivered into the
hands joshua the son nun and he caused
his captains and his soldiers to come near and
tread on their necks and then he smote them
and he slew them and then he hanged them ony

woodstock 
five trees even till evening and thou gilbert
pearson by name be not withheld from the duty
which is appointed to thee but do even as has
been commanded by him who is raised up to
judge and to deliver israel for it is written cursed
is he who holdeth back his sword from the
slaughter 
thus wrangled the two military theologians
while pearson much more solicitous to anticipate
the wishes over than to know the will heaven
listened to them with great indecision and
perplexity

the reader will recollect that when rochecliffs
and joceline were made prisoners the party
which escorted them had two other captives in their
train colonel everard namely and the rev nehemiah
holdenough when they had obtained
entrance into woodstock and commenced their
search after the fugitive prince the prisoners were
placed in what had been an old guardroom and
which was by its strength well calculated to serve
for a prison and a guard was placed over them by
pearson no light was allowed save that a
woodstock 
glimmering fire charcoal the prisoners remained
separated from each other colonel everard conversing
with nehemiah holdenough at a distance
from doctor rochecliffe sir henry lee and jofeline
the party was soon after augmented by
wildrake who was brought down to the lodge
and thrust in with so little ceremony that his
arms being bound he had very nearly fallen on
his nose in the middle the prison
i thank you my good friend he said looking
back to the door which they who had pushed
him in were securing point de ceremonie no

yes replied the doctor and you know i
can use mine
i prithee be quiet master wildrake said
sir henry
nay good knight answered wildrake be
somewhat more cordial with a comrade in distress
this is a different scene from the brentford storming
party the jade fortune has been a very
stepmother to me i will sing you a song i made
on my own ill luck
at this moment captain wildrake we are
not in a fitting mood for singing said sir henry
civilly and gravely
nay it will aid your devotions egad it
sounds like a penitential psalm
when was a young lad
my fortune was bad
if e'er i do well tis a wonder
i spent all my means

the door opened as wildrake finished this
stanza at the top his voice and in rushed a
sentinel who greeting him by the title blasphemous
bellowing bull bashan bestowed a
severe blow with his ramrod on the shoulders 
the songster whose bonds permitted him no means
 returning the compliment
your humble servant again sir said wildrake
shrugging his shoulders sorry i have no
means showing my gratitude i am bound
over to keep the peace like captain boabdil 
ha knight did you hear my bones clatter that
blow came twanging off the fellow might inflict

be hanged decently in the morning which never
happened to me before in all my life

pshaw this is not the tunc it goes to here he
fell fast asleep and sooner or later all his companions
in misfortune followed his example
the benches intended for the repose the soldiers
 the guard afforded the prisoners convenience
enough to lie down though their slumbers
it may be believed were neither sound nor undisturbed
but when daylight was but a little while
broken the explosion gunpowder which took
place and the subsequent fall the turret to
which the mine was applied would have awakened
the seven sleepers or morpheus himself the
smoke penetrating through the windows left them
at no loss for the cause the din
there went my gunpowder said rochecliffe
which has i trust blown up as many rebel
villains as it might have been the means destroying
otherwise in a fair field it must have
caught fire by chance
by chance no said sir henry depend on
it my bold albert has fired the train and that in
yonder blast cromwell was flying towards the heaven
whoso battlements he will never reach ah
 woodstock
my brave boy and perhaps thou art thyself sacrificed
like a youthful sampson among the rebellious
philistines but i wil not be long behind
thee alberti
everard hastened to the door hoping to obtain
from the guard to whom his name and rank might
be known some explanation the noise which
seemed to announce some dreadful catastrophe
but nehemiah holdenough whose rest had
been broken by the trumpet which gave signal for
the explosion appeared in the very acme horror
 it is the trumpet the archangel he
cried it is the crushing this world elements
 it is the summons to the judgmentseat 
the dead are obeying the call they are with us
they are amongst us they arise in their bodily
frames they come to summon us 
as he spoke his eyes were rivetted upon dr
rochecliffe who stood directly opposite to him
in rising hastily the cap which he commonly
wore according to a custom then usual both among
clergymen and townsmen a civil profession had
escaped from his head and carried with it the
large silk patch which he probably wore for the
woodstock 

purpose disguise for the cheek which was disclosed
was unscarred and the eye as good as that
which was usually covered
colonel everard returning from the door endeavoured
in vain to make master holdenough
comprehend what he learned from the guard without
that the explosion had only involved the death
 one cromwell soldiers the presbyterian
divine continued to stare wildly at him the
episcopal persuasion
but dr rochecliffe heard and understood the
news brought by colonel everard and relieved
from the instant anxiety which had kept him stationary
he advanced towards the retiring calvinist
extending his hand in the most friendly
manner
avoid thee avoid thee said holdenough
 the living may not join hands with the
dead
 but i said rochecliffe am as much alive
as you are
thou alive thou joseph albany whom
my own eyes saw precipitated from the battlements
 clidcsthrow castle 
 woodstock
ay answered the doctor but you did not
see me swim ashore on a marsh covered with
sedgesugit ad salicesaher a manner which
i will explain to you another time
holdenough touched his hand with doubt and
uncertainty thou art indeed warm and alive
he said and yet after so many blows and a fall
so tremendous thou canst not be my joseph
albany
i am joseph albany rochecliffe said the
doctor become so in virtue my mother's little
estate which fines and confiscations have made an
 
and is it so indeed said holdenough
and have i recovered mine old chum 
even so replied rochecliffe by the same
token i appeared to you in the mirror chamber
thou wert so bold nehemiah that our whole
scheme would have been shipwrecked had i not
appeared to thee in the shape a departed friend
yet believe me it went against my heart to do it
ah fie on thee fie on thee said holdenough
throwing himself into his arms and clasping
him to his bosom thou wert ever a naughty
woodstock 
wag how couwst thou play me such a trick t 
ah albany doest thou remember dr purely
and caius college 
marry do i said the doctor thrusting
his arm through the presbyterian divine's and
guiding him to a seat apart from the other prisoners
who witnessed this scene with much surprise
remember caius college said rochecliffe
ay and the good ale we drank and our parties
to mother huflcaps
vanity vanities said holdeuough smiling
kindly at the same time and still holding his
recovered friend's arm enclosed and handlocked
in his
but the breaking the principal's orchard so
cleanly done said the doctor it was the first
plot i ever framed and much work i had to prevail
on thee to go into it
oh name not that iniquity said nehemiah
since i may well say as the pious master baxter
that these boyish offences have had their punishment
in later years inasmuch as that inordinate
appetite for fruit hath produced stomachic affections
under which i yet labour
s woodstock
 true true clear nehemiah said rochecliffe
but care not for them a dram brandy will
correct it all mr baxter was he was about to
say an ass but checked himself and only filled
up the sentence with a good man i dare say
but over scrupulous
so they sat down together the best friends
and for half an hour talked with mutual delight
over old college stories by degrees they got on
the politics the day and though then they
unclasped their hands and there occurred between
them such expressions as nay my dear
brother and there i must needs differ and
on this point i crave leave to think yet a hue
and cry against the independents and other sectaries
being started they followed like brethren
in full hollo and it was hard to guess which wag
most forward unhappily in the course this
amiable intercourse something was mentioned
about the bishopric titus which at once involved
them in the doctrinal question church
government then alas the floodgates were
opened and they showered on each other greek
and hebrew texts while their eyes kindled their
woodstock 
cheeks glowed their hands became clenched and
they looked more like fierce polemics about to rend
each other's eyes out than christian divines
roger wildrake by making himself an auditor
 the debate contrived to augment its violence
he took course a most decided part in a question
the merits which were totally unknown to
him somewhat overawed by holdenough's ready
oratory and learning the cavalier watched with a
face anxiety the countenance dr rochecliffe 
but when he saw the proud eye and steady bearing
 the episcopal champion and heard him
answer greek with greek and hebrew with hebrew
he backed his arguments as he closed them
with a stout rap upon the bench and an exulting
laugh in the face the antagonist it was with
some difficulty that sir henry and colonel everard
having at length and reluctantly interfered
prevailed on the two alienated friends to adjourn
their dispute removing at the same time to a distance
and regarding each other with looks in
which old friendship appeared to have totally
given way to mutual animosity
but while they sate lowering on each other
j woodstock
and longing to renew a contest in which each
claimed the victory pearson entered the prison
and in a low and troubled voice desired the persons
whom it contained to prepare for instant
death
sir henry lee received the doom with the
stern composure which he had hitherto displayed
colonel everard attempted the interposition
 a strong and resentful appeal to the
parliament against the judgment the court
martial and the general but pearson declined
to receive or transmit any such remonstrance and
with a dejected look and mien melancholy presage
renewed his exhortation to them to prepare
for the hour noon and withdrew from the
prison
the operation this intelligence on the two
clerical disputants was more remarkable they
gazed for a moment on each other with eyes in
which repentant kindness and a feeling generous
shame quenched every lingering feeling resentment
and joining in the mutual exclamation 
my brother my brother i have sinned i have
sinned in offending thee they rushed into each
woodstock 
other's arms shed tears as they demanded each
other's forgiveness nd ike two warriors who
sacrifice a personal quarrel to discharge their
duty against the common enemy they recalled

them to meet the doom that had been announced

most gracious prince good canning cried
leave vengeance to our god
and lay the iron rule aside
be thine the olive rod
ballad sir charles baxedin
the hour appointed for execution had been
long past and it was about five in the evening
when the protector summoned pearson to his presence
he went with fear and reluctance uncertain
how he might be received after remaining about
a quarter an hour the aiddecamp returned
to victor lee's parlour where he found the old
soldier zerobabel robins in attendance for his
return
how is oliver said the old man anxiously
why well answered pearson and hath
woodstock 
asked no questions the execution but many concerning
the reports we have been able to make regarding
the flight the young man and is much
moved at thinking he must now be beyond pursuit
also i gave him certain papers belonging to the
malignant doctor rochecuffe
then will i venture upon him said the adcurator
 so give me a napkin that i may look
like a sewer and fetch up the food which i directed
should be in readiness
two troopers attended accordingly with a ration
 beef such as was distributed to the private
soldiers and dressed after their fashion a pewter
pot ale a trencher with salt black pepper and
a loaf ammunition bread come with me he
said to pearson and fear not nol loves an
innocent jest he boldly entered the general's
sleeping apartment and said aloud arise thou
that art called to be a judge in israel let there
be no more folding the hands to sleep lo i
come as a sign to thee wherefore arise eat drink
and let thy heart be glad within thee for thou
shalt eat with joy the food him that laboured
in the trenches seeing that since thou wert comsc
woodstock
mander over the host the poor sentinel hath had
such provisions as i have now placed for thine
own refreshment
truly brother zerobabel said cromwell
accustomed to such starts enthusiasm among
his followers we would wish that it were so 
neither is it our desire to sleep soft nor feed more
highly than the meanest that ranks under our banners
verily thou hast chosen well for my refreshment
and the smell the food is savoury in my
nostrils
he arose from the bed on which he had lain
down half dressed and wrapping his cloak around
him sate down by the bedside and partook
heartily the plain food which was prepared for
him while he was eating cromwell commanded
pearson to finish his report you need not
desist for the presence a worthy soldier whose
spirit is as my spirit
nay but interrupted loins you are to
know that gilbert pearson hath not fully executed
thy commands touching a part those malignant
all whom should have died at noon
woodstock 
what execution what malignant said
cromwell laying down his knife and fork
those in the prison here at woodstock
answered zerobabel whom your excellency
commanded should be executed at noon as taken
in the fact rebellion against the commonwealth
wretch said cromwell starting up and
addressing pearson thou hast not touched
mark everard in whom there was no guilt for
he was deceived by him who passed between us 
neither hast thou put forth thy hand on the pragmatic
presbyterian minister to have all those 
the classes cry sacrilege and alienate them from
us for ever 
if your excellency wish them to live they
live their life and death are in the power a
word said pearson
enfranchise them i must gain the presbyterian
interest over to us if i can
rochecliffe the archplotters said pearson
i thought to have executed but 
barbarous man said cromwell alike ungrateful
and impolitic wouldst thou have destroyed
our decoyduck this doctor is but like
vol iii vr
 woodstock
a well a shallow one indeed but something deeper
than the springs which discharge their secret tribute
into his keeping then come i with a pump
and suck it all up to the open air enlarge him
and let him have money if he wants it i know his
haunts he can go nowhere but our eye will be
upon him but you look at each other darkly as
if you had more to say than you durst i trust
you have not done to death sir henry lee 
no yet the man replied pearson is a
confirmed malignant and 
 ay but he is also a noble relic the ancient
english gentleman said the general i
would i knew how to win the favour that race
but we pearson whose royal robes are the armour
which we wear on our bodies and whose leadingstaves
are our sceptres are too newly set up to
draw the respect the proud malignant who
cannot brook to submit to less than royal lineage
yet what can they see in the longest kingly line
in europe save that it runs back to a successful
soldier i grudge that one man should be honoured
and followed because he is the descendant
 a victorious commander while less honour
woodstock 
and allegiance is paid to another who in personal
qualities and in success might emulate the founder
 his rivers dynasty well sir henry lee lives
and shall live for me his son indeed hath deserved
the death which he has doubtless sustained
my lord stammered pearson since your
excellency has found i am right in suspending
your order in so many instances i trust you will
not blame me in this also i thought it best to
await more special orders
thou art in a mighty merciful humour this
morning pearson said cromwell not entirely
satisfied
if your excellency please the halter is ready
and so is the provost marshal
nay if such a bloody fellow as thou hast
spared him it would ill become me to destroy
him said the general but then here is
among ilochecliftes papers the engagement 
twenty desperadoes to take us off some example
ought to be made
my lord said zerobabel consider now
how often this young man albert lee hath been
near you nay probably quite close to your 
woodstock
excellency in these darkpassages which he knew
and we did not had he been an assassin's
nature it would have cost him but a pistolshot
and the light israel was extinguished nay
in the unavoidable confusion which must have
ensued the sentinels quitting their posts he might
have had a fair chance escape
enough zerobabel he lives said the general
 he shall remain in custody for sometime
however and be then banished from england
the other two are safe course for you
would not dream considering such paltry fellows
as fit victims for my revenge
one fellow the underkeeper called joliffe
deserves death however said pearson since
he has frailty admitted that he slew honest joseph
tomkins
he deserves a reward for saving us a labour
said cromwell that tomkins was a most doublehearted
villain i have found evidence among
these papers here that if we had lost the fight at
worcester we should have had reason to regret
that we had ever trusted master tomkins it was
only our success which anticipated his treachery
i
woodstock 
write us down debtor not creditor to joceline
an you call him so and to his quarterstaffs
there remains the sacrilegious and graceless
cavalier who attempted your excellency's life
last night said pearson
nay said the general that were stooping
too low for revenge his sword had no more
power than had he thrusted with a tobaccopipe
eagles stoop not at mallards or wilddrakes
either
yet sir said pearson the fellow should
be punished as a libeller the quantity foul
and pestilential abuse which we found in his pockets
makes me loath he should go altogether free
please to look at them sir
a most vile hand said oliver as he looked
at a sheet or two our friend wildrake's poetical
miscellanies the very hand writing seems
to be drunk and the poetry not very sober what
have we here 
when i was a young lad
my fortune was bad 
if e'er i do well tis a wonder 
why what trash is this and then again 
 woodstock
now a plague on the poll
 old politic noll
we will drink till we bring
in triumph back the king
in truth if it could be done that way this poet
would be a stout champion give the poor knave
five pieces pearson and bid him go sell his ballads
if he come within twenty miles our person
though we will have him flogged till the blood
runs down to his heels
there remains only one sentenced person
said pearson a noble wolfhound finer than any
your excellency saw in ireland he belongs to
the old knight sir henry lee should your excellency
not desire to keep the fine creature yourself
might i presume to beg that i might have
leave 
 no pearson said cromwell the old man
so faithful himself shall not be deprived his
faithful dog i would had any creature were
it but a dog that followed me because it loved
me not for what it could make me
your excellency is unjust to your faithful
soldiers said zerobabel bluntly who follow
woodstock s
you like dogs fight for you like dogs and have
the grave a dog on the spot where they happen
to fall
 how now old grumbler said the general
what means this change note 
corporal curmudgeon's remains are left to
moulder under the ruins yonder tower and
tomkins is thrust into a hole in a thicket like a
beast
true true said cromwell they shall be
removed to the churchyard and every soldier
shall attend with cockades seagreen and blue
ribbon every one the noncommissioned officers
and the agitators shall have a mourningscarf
we ourselves will lead the procession and
there shall be a proper dole wine burnt brandy
and rosemary see that it is done pearson after
the funeral woodstock shall be dismantled and
destroyed that its recesses may not again afford
shelter to rebels and malignant
the commands the general were punctually
obeyed and when the other prisoners were dismissed
albert lee remained for some time in
custody he went abroad after his liberation 
woodstock
tered in king charles's guards where he was promoted
by that monarch but his fate as we shall
see hereafter only allowed him a short though
bright career
we return to the liberation the other prisoners
from woodstock the two divines completely reconciled
to each other retreated arm in arm to the
parsonage house formerly the residence dr
rochecliffe but which he now visited as the guest
 his successor nehemiah holdenough the
presbyterian had no sooner installed his friend
under his roof than he urged upon him an offer to
partake it and the income annexed to it as his own
dr rochecliffe was much affected but wisely rejected
the generous offer considering the difference
 their tenets on church government which each
entertained as religiously as his creed another
debate though a light one on the subject the
office bishops in the primitive church confirmed
him in his resolution they parted the
next day and their friendship remained undisturbed
by controversy till mr holdenough's death
in a harmony which might be in some
degree owing to their never meeting again after
woodstock 
their imprisonment doctor rocheeliffe was restored
to his living after the restoration and ascended
from thence to high clerical preferment
the inferior personages the grand gaoldelivery
at woodstock lodge easily found themselves
temporary accommodations in the town among old
acquaintance but no one ventured to entertain the
old knight understood to be so much under the
displeasure the ruling powers and even the innkeeper
 the george who had been one his
tenants scarce dared to admit him to the common
privileges a traveller who has food and lodging
for his money everard attended him unrequested
unpermitted but also unforbidden the heart
 the old man had been turned once more towards
him when he learned how he had behaved
at the memorable rencontre at the king's oak
and saw that he was an object the enmity rather
than the favour cromwell but there was
another secret feeling which tended to reconcile
him to his nephew the consciousness that everard
shared with him the deep anxiety which he experienced
on account his daughter who was not
yet returned from her doubtful and perilous expel
woodstotft
lotion he felt that he himself would perhaps
be unable to discover where alice had taken refuge
during the late events or to obtain her
deliverance if she was taken into custody he
wished everard to offer him his service in making
a search for her but shame prevented his preferring
the request and everard who could not suspect
the altered state his uncle's mind was afraid to
make the proposal assistance or even to name
the name alice
the sun had already set they sate looking each
other in the face in silence when the trampling
 horses was heard there was knocking at the
door there was a light step on the stair and
alice the subject their anxiety stood before
them she threw herself joyfully into her father's
arms who glanced his eye heedfully round the
room as he said in a whisper is all safe 
safe and out danger as i trust replied
alice i have a token for you
her eye then rested on everard she blushed
was embarrassed and silent
you need not fear your presbyterian cousin
said the knight with a goodhumoured smile he
woodstock 
has himself proved a confessor at least for loyalty
and ran the risk being a martyr
she pulled from her bosom the royal rescript
written on a small and soiled piece paper and
tied round with a worsted thread instead a sealsuch
as it was sir henry ere he opened it pressed
the little packet with oriental veneration to iris
lips to his heart to his forehead and it was not
before a tear had dropt on it that he found courage
to open and read the billet it was in these
words 
loyal oui much esteemed friend our
trusty subject
it having become known to us that a purpose
 marriage has been entertained betwixt mrs alice
lee your only daughter and markham everard
esq severely chase her kinsman and by
affiance your nephew and being assured that
this match would be highly agreeable to you
had it not been for certain respects to our service
which induced you to refuse your consent
thereto we do therefore acquaint you that far
from our aflfiirs suffering by such an alliance we
 woodstock
do exhort and so far as we may require you to
consent to the same as you would wish to do us
good pleasure and greatly to advance our affairs
leaving to you nevertheless as becometh a christian
king the full exercise your own discretion
concerning other obstacles to such an alliance
which may exist independent those connected
with our service witness our hand together with
our thankful recollections your good services to
our late royal father as well as ourselves
c r
long and steadily did sir henry gaze on the
letter so that it might almost seem as if he were
getting it by heart he then placed it carefully
in his pocketbook and asked alice the account
 her adventures the preceding night they
were briefly told their midnight walk through
the chase had been speedily and safely accomplished
when she had seen charles and his
attendant set off she had taken some repose in
the cottage where they parted with the morning
came news that woodstock was occupied by
soldiers so that return thither might have led to
woodstock 
danger suspicion and inquiry alice therefore
did not attempt it but went to a house in the
neighbourhood inhabited by a lady established
loyalty whose husband had been major sir
henry lee's regiment and had fallen at the battle
 naseby mrs aylmer was a sensible woman
and indeed the necessities the singular times
had sharpened every one's faculties for stratagem
and intrigue she sent a faithful servant to scout
about the mansion at woodstock who no sooner
saw the prisoners dismissed and in safety and ascertained
the knight's destination for the evening
than he carried the news to his mistress and by
her orders attended alice on horseback to join
her father 
there was seldom perhaps an evening meal
made in such absolute silence as by this embarrassed
party each occupied with their own thoughts
and at a loss how to fathom those the others
at length the hour came when alice felt herself at
liberty to retire to repose after a day so fatiguing
everard handed her to the door her apartment
and was then himself about to take leave when
to his surprise his uncle asked him to return
 woodstock
pointed to a chair and giving him the king's
letter to read fixed his looks on him steadily during
the perusal determined that if he could discover
aught short the utmost delight in the
reading the commands the king himself should
be disobeyed rather than alice should be sacrificed
to one who received not her hand as the
greatest blessing earth had to bestow but the
features everard indicated joyful hope even
beyond what the father could have anticipated yet
mingled with surprise and when he raised his eye
to the knight's with timidity and doubt a smile was
on sir henry's countenance as he broke silence
the king he said had he no other subject
in england should dispose at will those the
house lee but methinks the family everard
have not been so devoted late to the crown as
to comply with a mandate inviting its heir to
marry the daughter a beggar
the daughter sir henry lee said everard
kneeling to his uncle and perforce kissing his
hand would grace the house a duke
the girl is well enough said the knight
proudly for myself my poverty shall neither
woodstock 
shame nor encroach on my friends some few
pieces i have by dr rochcliff'e's kindness and
joceline and i will strike out something
nay my dear uncle you are richer than you
think for said everard that part your
estate which my father redeemed for payment 
a moderate composition is still your own and
held by trustees in your name myself being one
 them you are only our debtor for an advance
 moneys for which if it will content you we will
count with you like usurers my father is incapable
 profiting by making a bargain on his own
account for the estate a distressed friend and
all this you would have learned long since but
that you would not i mean time did not serve
for explanation i mean 
you mean i was too hot to hear reason mark
and i believe it is very true but i think we ununderstand
each other nov tomorrow i go with
my family to kingston where is an old house i
may still call mine come hither at thy leisure
mark or thy best speed as thou wilt but come
with thy father's consent
 woodstock
with my father in person said everard
if you will permit
be that answered the knight as he and
you will i think joceline will scarce shut the
door in thy face or bevis growl as he did after
poor louis kerneguy nay no more raptures
but good night mark good night and if thou
art not tired with the fatigue yesterday why
if you appear here at seven in the morning i think
we must bear with your company on the kingston
road
once more everard pressed the knight's hand
caressed bevis who received his kindness graciously
and went home to dreams happiness
which were realized so far as this motley world
permits within a few months afterwards

tired shakspeare and solitude he was ever a
welcome guest at his soninlaw's where he went
the more frequently that markham had given up
all concern in public affairs disapproving the
forcible dismissal the parliament and submitting
to cromweirs subsequent domination rather
as that which was the lesser evil than as to
a government which he regarded as legal cromwell
seemed ever willing to show himself his
friend but everard resenting highly the proposal
to deliver up the king which he considered
as an insult to his honour never answered
such advances and became on the contrary 
the opinion which was now generally prevalent
in the nation that a settled government could not
be obtained without the recall the banished
family there is no doubt that the personal
kindness which he had received from charles
rendered him the more readily disposed to such
a measure he was peremptory however in
declining all engagements during oliver's life
whose power he considered as too firmly fixed to
be shaken by any plots which could be formed
against it
woodstock 
meantime wildrake continued to be everard's
protected dependent as before though sometimes
the connexion tended not a little to his inconvenience
that respectable person indeed while
he remained stationary in his patron's house or
that the old knight discharged many little duties
in the family and won alice's heart by his
attention to the children teaching the boys 
whom they had three to ride fence toss the
pike and many similar exercises and above all
filling up a great blank in her father's existence
with whom he played at chess and backgammon
or read shakspeare or was clerk to prayers when
any sequestrated divine ventured to read the service
 the church or he found game for him
while the old gentleman continued to go a sporting
and especially he talked over the storming
 brentford and the battles edgehill
banbury roadwaydown and others themes
which the aged cavalier delighted in but which
he could not so well enter upon with colonel
everard who had gained his laurels in the parliament
service
the assistance which he received from 
woodstock
rake's society became more necessary after sir
henry was deprived his gallant and only son
who was slain in the fatal battle dunkirk
where unhappily english colours were displayed
on both the contending sides the french being
then allied with oliver who sent to their aid a
body auxiliaries and the troops the banished
king fighting in behalf the spaniards sir
henry received the melancholy news ike an old
man that is with more external composure than
could have been anticipated he dwelt for weeks
and months on the lines forwarded by the indefatigable
doctor rochcliffe superscribed in small
letters c r and subscribed louis kerneguy in
which the writer conjured him to endure this inestimable
loss with the greater firmness that he
had still left one son intimating himself who
would always regard him as a father
but in despite this balsam sorrow acting
imperceptibly and sucking the blood like a vampire
seemed gradually drying up the springs 
life and without any formed illness or outward
complaint the old man's strength and vigour
woodstock 
gradually abated and the ministry wildrake
proved daily more indispensable
it was not however always to be had the
cavalier was one those happy persons whom
a strong constitution an unreflecting mind and
exuberant spirits enable to play through their
whole lives the part a schoolboy happy for
the moment and careless consequences
once or twice every year when he had collected
a few pieces the cavaliers wildrake made a start
to london where as he described it he went on
the ramble drank as much wine as he could come
by and led a sheltering life to use his own
phrase among fostering cavaliers like himself
till by some rash speech or wild action he got
into the marshalsea the fleet or some other
prison from which he was to be delivered at the
expense interest money and sometimes a little
reputation
at length cromwell died his son resigned the
government and the various changes which followed
induced everard as well as many others
to adopt more active measures in the king's belial
everard even remitted considerable sums
woodstock
for his service but with the utmost caution and
corresponding with no intermediate agent but
with the chancellor himself to whom he communicated
much useful information upon public affairs
with all his prudence he was very nearly
engaged in the ineffectual rising booth and
middleton in the west and with great difficulty
escaped from the fatal consequences that illtimed
attempt after this although the estate
 the kingdom was trebly unsettled yet no card
seemed to turn up favourable to the royal cause
until the movement general monk from scotland
even then it was when at the point 
complete success that the fortunes charles
seemed at a lower ebb than ever especially when
intelligence had arrived at the little court which
he then kept in brussels that monk on arriving
in london had put himself under the orders 
the parliament
it was at this time and in the evening while
the king buckingham wilmot and some other
gallants his wandering court were engaged ina
convivial party that the chancellor clarendon
suddenly craved audience and entering with less
woodstock j
ceremony than he would have done at another
time announced extraordinary news for the messenger
he said he could say nothing saving that
he appeared to have drunk much and slept little 
but that he had brought a sure token credence
from a man for whose faith he would venture his
life the king demanded to see the messenger
himself
a man entered with something the manners 
a gentleman and more those a rakehelly debauchee
 his eyes swelled and inflamed his gait
disordered and stumbling partly through lack 
sleep partly through the means he had taken to
support his fatigue he staggered without ceremony
to the head the table seized the king's
hand which he mumbled like a piece gingerbread
while charles who began to recollect
him from his mode salutation was not very
much pleased that their meeting should have taken
place before so many witnesses
i bring good news said the uncouth messenger
 glorious news the king shall enjoy
his own again my feet are beautiful on the
mountains gad i have lived with presbyterians
till i have caught their language but we
s woodstock
are all one man's children now all your majesty's
poor babes the rump is all ruined in london
 bonfires flaming music playing rumps
roasting healths drinking london in a blaze 
light from the strand to rotherhithe tankards
clattering 
 we can guess at that said the duke 
buckingham
my old friend mark everard sent me oft
with the news i'm a villain if i've slept since
your majesty recollects me i am sure your
majesty remembers sa sa at the king's oak
at woodstock 
o we'll dance and sins and play
for twill be a joyous day
wheen the king shall enjoy his own again 
master wildrake i remember you well
said the king i trust the good news is certain

certain your majesty did i not hear the
bells did i not see the bonfires did i not
drink your majesty's health so often that my
legs would scarce carr me to the wharf it is
as certain as that i am poor roger ildrake 
ualtlcscamerc lincoln
woodstock 
the duke buckingham here whispered to
the king i have always suspected your majesty
kept odd company during the escape from
worcester but this seems a rare sample
why pretty much ike yourself and other
company i have kept here so many years as
stout a heart as empty a head said charles
as much lace though somewhat tarnished as
much brass on the brow and nearly as much
copper in the pocket
i would your majesty would intrust this
messenger good news with me to get the
truth out him said buckingham
thank your grace replied the king but
he has a will as well as yourself and such seldom
agree my lord chancellor hath wisdom
and to that we must trust ourselves master
wildrake you will go with my lord chancellor
who will bring us a report your tidings 
meantime i assure you that you shall be no
loser for being the first messenger good news
so saying he gave a signal to the chancellor to
take away wildrake whom he judged in his
present humour to be not unlikely to 
woodstock
cate some former passages at woodstock which
might rather entertain than edify the wits his
court
corroboration the joyful intelligence soon
arrived and wildrake was presented with a
handsome gratuity and small pension which by
the king's special desire had no duty whatever
attached to it
shortly afterwards all england was engaged
in crossing his favourite ditty 
oh the twentyninth may
it was a glorious day
when the king shall eijoy his own again
on that memorable day the king prepared to
make his progress from rochester to london
with a reception on the part his subjects so unanimously
cordial as made him say gaily it must
have been his own fault to stay so long away from
a country where his arrival gave so much joy
on horseback betwixt his brothers the dukes 
york and glocester the restored monarch trod
slowly over roads strewn with flowers by conduits
running wine under triumphal arches and
through streets hung with tapestry there were
the citizens in various bands some arrayed in coats
fostok 
 black velvet with gold chains some in military
suits cloth gold or cloth silver followed
by all those craftsmen who having hooted
the father from whitehall were now come to
shout the son into possession his ancestral palace
on his progress through blockhead he
passed that army which so long formidable to
england herself as well as to europe had been
the means restoring the monarchy which their
own hands had destroyed as the king passed
the last files this formidable host he came to
an open part the heath where many persons
 quality wide others inferior rank had stationed
themselves to gratulate him as he passed
towards the capital
there was one group however which attracted
peculiar attention from those around on account
 the respect shown to the party by the
soldiers who kept the ground and who whether
cavaliers or roundheads seemed to contest emulously
which should contribute most to their accommodation
 for both the elder and younger
gentlemen the party had been distinguished in
the civil war
s woodstock
it was a family group which the principal
figure was an old man seated in a chair having
a complacent smile on his face and a tear swelling
to his eye as he saw the banners wave on in
interminable succession and heard the multitude
shouting the long silenced acclamation god
save king charles his cheek was ashy pale
and his long beard bleached like the thistle down
his blue eye was cloudless yet it was obvious that
its vision was failing his motions were feeble
and he spoke little except when he answered the
prattle his grandchildren or asked a question
at his daughter who sate beside him matured
in matronly beauty or at colonel everard who
stood behind there too the stout yeoman joce
line joliffe still in his sylvan dress leaned like
a second benaiah on the quarterstaff that had
done the king good service in its day and his
wife a buxom matron as she had been a pretty
maiden laughed at her own consequence and
ever and anon joined her shrill notes to the stentorian
halloo which her husband added to the
general exclamation
three fine boys and two pretty girls prattled
woodstock 
around their grandfather who made them such
answers as suited their age and repeatedly passed
his withered hand over the fair locks the little
darlings while alice assisted by wildrake blazing
in a splendid dress and his eyes washed with
only a single cup canary took off the children's
attention from time to time lest they should weary
their grandfather we must not omit one other
remarkable figure in the group a gigantic dog
which bore the signs being at the extremity 
canine life being perhaps fifteen or sixteen years
old but though exhibiting but the ruin his
former appearance his eyes dim his joints stiff
his head slouched down and his gallant carriage
and graceful motions exchanged for a stiff rheumatic
hobbling gait the noble hound had lost
none his instinctive fondness for his master
to lie by sir henry s feet in the sun in summer
or by the fire in winter to raise his head to look
on him to lick his withered hand or his shrivelled
cheek from time to time seemed now all that
bevis lived for
three or four liveryservants attended to protect
this group from the thronging multitude

but it needed not the high respectability and
unpretending simplicity their appearance gave
them even in th eyes the coarsest the people
an air patriarchal dignity which commanded
general regard and they sat upon the
bank which they had chosen for their station by
the way side as undisturbed as if they had been
in their own park
and now the distant clarion announced the
royal presence onward came pursuivant and
trumpet onward came plumes and cloth gold
and waving standards displayed and swords
gleaming to the sun and at length heading a
group the noblest in england and supported
by his royal brothers on either side onward came
king charles he had already halted more than
once in kindness perhaps as well as policy to
exchange a word nth persons whom he recognized
among the spectators and the shouts the
bysanders applauded a courtesy which seemed
so well timed but when he had gazed an instant
on the party we have described it was impossible
if even alice had been too much changed to be
recognized not instantly to know bevis and his
venerable master the monarch sprung from hi
wooustock st
horse and walked instantly up to the old knight
amid thundering acclamations which rose from
the multitudes around when they saw charles
with his own hand oppose the feeble attempts 
the old man to rise to do him homage gently
replacing him on his seat bless he said
father bless your son who has returned in
safety as you blessed him when he departed in
danger
 may god bless and preserve muttered
the old man overcome by his feelings and the
king to give him a few moments repose turned
to alice 
and you he said my fair guide how
have you been employed since our perilous nightwalk
 but i need not ask glancing round in
the service king and kingdom bringing up
subjects as loyal as their ancestors a fair lineage
by my faith and a beautiful sight to the eye
 an english king colonel everard we shall
see you i trust at whitehall here he nodded
to wildrake and thou joceline thou canst
hold thy quarterstaff with unhand sure thrust
forward the other palm
s woodstock
looking down in sheer bashfulness joceline
like a bull about to push extended to the king
over his lady's shoulder a hand as broad and hard
as a wooden trencher which the king filled with
gold coins buy a head gear for my friend phoebe
with some these said charles i she too has
been doing her duty to old england
the king then turned once more to the knight
who seemed making an effort to speak he took
his aged hand in both his own and stooped his
head towards him to catch his accents while the
old man detaining him with the other hand said
something faltering which charles could only
catch the quotation 
unthread the rude eye rebellion
and welcome home again discarded faith
extricating himself therefore as gently as possible
from a scene which began to grow painfully
embarrassing the goodnatured king said speaking
with unusual distinctness to insure the old
man's comprehending him this is something
too public a place for all we have to say but if
you come not soon to see king charles at whitehall
he will send down louis kerneguy to visit
woodstock s
you that you may see how rational he is become
since his travels
so saying he once more pressed affectionately
the old man's hand bowed to alice and all
around and withdrew sir henry lee listening
with a smile which showed he comprehended the
gracious tendency what had been said the
old man leaned back on his seat and muttered
the nunc dimittis
 excuse me for having made you wait my
lords said the king as he mounted his horse 
had it not been for these good folks you might
have waited for me long enough move on sirs
the array moved on accordingly the sound 
trumpets and drums again rose amid the acclamations
which had been silent while the kingstopped
 while the effect the whole procession
resuming its motion was so splendidly dazzling
that even alice's anxiety about her father's health
was for a moment suspended while her eye followed
the long line varied brilliancy that proceeded
over the heath when she looked again at
sir henry she was startled to see that his cheek
which had gained some colour during his convert
iii a
t woodstock
nation with the king had relapsed into earthy
paleness that his eyes were closed and opened
not again and that his features expressed amid
their quietude a rigidity which is not that sleep
they ran to his assistance but it was too late
the light that burned so low in the socket had
leaped up and expired in one exhilarating flash
the rest must be conceived i have only to
add that his faithful dog did not survive him
many days and that the image bevis lies carved
at his master's feet on the tomb which was
erected to the memory sir henry lee

o our travellers next arrived at franklin
hall in staffordshire where they were to
 spend three days sith their friends mr
nw and mrs franklin
 the first day at dinner an old gentleman
observed that the pie dishes wedges
wood's ware were good contrivances for
j keeping vegetables hot and remarked
 how very like real pie crust one them
looked
mr frankland who had been an intimate
friend the late mr westwood said
that he was present the first day when one
 these imitations pie crust appeared
at dinner the children the family did not

mistake it for a real pie and mr wedgwood
had new ones made repeatedly
till at last one appeared so perfect that at
a little distance it could not be known
from pie crust when i took off the
cover said mr frankland the child
next me was agreeably surprised to hear it
jingle on the dish
besides this said the old gentleman
mr wedgwood made a number little
everyday useful contrivances that dish
in which there is a well for the gravy
in the olden times unhappy carvers were
obliged to poke under the heavy sirloin
for gravy or to raise and slope the dish
at the imminent hazard overturning the
sirloin and splashing the spectators
knife fork spoon slipping all the while
one after another into the dish and ten
to one no gravy to be had after all nothing
but cakes cold grease but now
without poking sloping splashing the
happy carver free from these miseries 
life has only to dip his spoon into a well
 pure gravy thanks to the invention
 one man all men women and children
may now have gravy without stooping
the dish so i give you gentlemen and
ladies for a toast the late mr wedgwood
and the comforts life 
after he had drank his glass wine
the old gentleman continued speaking 
i remember that mr come the traveller
was pleased by meeting with a beautiful
service wedgwood ware in russia i
dare say he might find one now in siberia
last year when i was in holland i learnt
that even the town delft which for
many years used to furnish all europe
with crockery is now supplied from england
with our staffordshire ware
the conversation next turned on china
and chinese artists
 they are very exact said mr frankland
 in imitating whatever is bespoken
from them but sometimes they carry this
to a degree provoking stupidity
 this he gave an instance a lady
wanted to match some the plates a

remarkably handsome service china
which had been given to her husband by
the east india company she sent a
pattern to china and bespoke some dozens
to be made exactly the same in due
time they arrived were unpacked but
to her surprise and mortification the lady
found that every one the new plates had
the appearance a crack across it and
on examining the plate which had been
sent as a pattern it was found that there
was a crack in it which had been exactly
imitated
even harry though he loved exactness
thought this was too much
lucy observed the beauty the china
on her plate there lay or there seemed to
lie a convolvulus it looked so natural that
she thought she could take it up on her
mother's was a celia a geranium on another
and on harry's a honeysuckle 
which she could almost fancy that she
smelt the perfume even as she eat her
ripe cherries she paused to examine these
flowers she thought it the most beautiful
china she had ever seen when she
went into the drawingroom she saw on
the chimneypiece flowerpots the most
delicate blue with white figures on them
embossed like ivory and exquisitely carved
the drapery on the figures was so light that
it seemed as if blown by the wind and so
transparent that she could see the blue
ground through it
mrs frankland came to lucy as she
was looking at these flowerpots and told
her that they were wedgwood's ware as
well as the plates which she had admired
at the dessert
wedgwood's ware repeated lucy
i thought that wedgwood's ware was
always black or creamcoloured such as
the common yellowish plates
mrs frankland told her there was a great
variety wedgwood's wares she took
her into a cabinet at the the 
where she showed her several
vases made in imitation antiques which
had been dug up from the ruins etruria
in italy and thence called etruscan some
had red grounds with black figures others
red figures on black grounds others which
were called jasper were very valuable
after lucy had examined and admired all
these mrs frankland said she would show
her another which was more valuable than
all the rest the original from which it
was exquisitely imitated cost the present
possessor four thousand guineas as she
spoke she opened the case which contained
the vase and carefully raised it from its
crimsoncushioned bed
i know it i have seen it before mamma
exclaimed lucy
seen it before lucy said her mother
where
in a when i was reading to you
mamma
you mean that you have seen an engraving
 it said her mother
yes mamma you remember the three
views in the botanic garden a vase just
like this with a dark ground and white
figures i cannot recollect the name it
but i know it was dug up out ruins
her mother told her it was called the
bartering or portland vase bartering
from the name the italian family to whom
it had belonged and portland from the
duchess portland by whom it had been
purchased and brought to england
lucy whose memory was now awakened
recollected dr darwin's beautiful lines
addressed to mr wedgwood oh friend
 art but she refrained from repeating
them for which harry gave her credit
due
mr frankland who now came into the
room told her that the ancient etruscan
or greek vases were produced by a different
process from that which mr wedgwood
used in making his they appear
to have been made by covering the parts
representing the figures and ornaments
after their outlines had been traced and
then dipping the red ware in a black paint
the lines the drapery c were afterwards
traced in the same colour in those
ancient vases the colour which was red
was in the body the ware itself in
mr wedgwood's imitations both the red
and black are painted on the porcelain or
rather on the biscuit the name which is
given to the ware after its first baking in
the furnace he was the first person who
made what are called dry colours or enamel
without lustre without shining
harry thought that the smoothness and
polish these vases was more beautiful
than any glazing
and much safer and more durable
said mr frankland these colours
cannot be injured by damp or fire or air
or acid and will last as long as the substance
itself you may have observed
that the glazing on common earthenware
runs into little cracks
yes said lucy i have often observed
them covering a plate like network
they look very ugly
 but what is much worse continued
he in most kinds glazing lead is employed
which when dissolved in certain
acids is poisonous
lucy observed that glazing looked something
like glass and from the sound the
words too she heqvedi glazing came from
glass it might at first have been called
glassing
yes said mr frankland and there
is as you observe a resemblance between
the outside some porcelain and glass
but the difference between glass and
porcelain is that porcelain is but 
that means half turned to
glass the managing the heat so as
to stop the vitrification or turning to
glass at the right time is one the
most important points in making porcelain

lucy returned to admire the beauty 
the wedgwood's ware repeating that she
thought it much prettier than chinese
china
b
besides the beauty form and colour
and texture continued mr frankland
 the utility is great it is not only
perfectly safe for all culinary purposes but
most durable for some chemical experiments
in which the vessels must be exposed
to great heat
mr frankland showed them a crucible
and a retort made wedgwood's ware
and mrs frankland showed a white pestle
and mortar which looked like marble but
which was wedgwood's ware and used
for pounding medicines
harry asked whether the potteries where
all these were made was near frankland
hall
yes within a few miles us said
mr frankland at a village to which
mr wedgwood gave the name etruria
and where he established a manufactory
whose productions are probably more
known and more useful to a greater number
 people than ever were those the
ancient etruria
mr frankland said that he would the
next day take harry and lucy to see these
works in the mean time as harry seemed
anxious to know more he told him all that
he thought could interest him concerning
the history the staffordshire potteries
the clay this part england being fit
for making some kinds earthen ware
there have been potteries or remains 
potteries in staffordshire ever since the
time when the romans were in britain 
but they had continued in a rude state forages
as no person industry or knowledge
had attempted their improvement
till about a hundred and twenty years ago
when two brothers the name elders
came from holland settled here and manufactured
a red unglazed porcelain afterwards
they made a sort brown glazed
stone ware coarse and heavy yet the glazing
 these such as it was could not
be performed without great inconvenience
they used muriate soda which
they threw into the oven at a certain time
 the baking the vessels the fumes
from this were so odious that the neighbourhood
were alarmed and forced the
strangers to abandon their potteries and
quit the country soon afterwards a
workman who had found out the secret 
their mode glazing for even that was a
secret pursued the same method in a pottery
 his own and this was suffered to goon
in spite the nauseous fumes because
the inhabitants found the jars they
made so useful for holding their butter
they were employed chiefly for this purpose
and the manufactory was called the
butter pottery on glazing days however
the nuisance was terrible the offensive
fumes spread to a distance six or
seven miles thick clouds from these
furnaces rose over the hills and filled the
valleys with their dense vapours
the first great improvement in our potteries
was made in the substance the
ware itself by introducing ground flints into
the composition and then was made what
is still called white stone ware it is used
for many purposes you may have seen
it for instance for seltzer water bottles
i know what you mean said lucy
this was the safest and best ware we
had continued mr frankland before
mr wedgwood's time it is said that the
first idea using powdered flints was
suggested to a poor staffordshire potter
by accident
 by accident i am glad it said
lucy i like to hear discoveries
made by accident especially by poor
people
there was a staffordshire potter
whose name is forgotten or whose name i
forget he stopped on a journey to london
at dunstable in bedfordshire where the
soil is flinty and chalky he consulted
the hostler the inn where he stopped
about some disorder in his horse's eye
the hostler advised that powdered flint
should be put into the eye and for this purpose
he threw a flint into the fire to calcine
that is to burn it that it might be
more easily pulverized the potter who
was standing by observed the great whiteness
 the calcined flint and being an ingenious
as well as an observing man immediately
thought applying this circumstance
to the improvement his pottery
he first tried the experiment mixing
finelypowdered flints with tobacco pipeclay
 he succeeded to his hopes and
made white stone ware which put all the
brown and coloured stone ware out fashion
ugly as you think it lucy it was
much approved till wedgwood came and
gave us something better that creamcoloured
ware which was called queen's
ware because it was first patronized by
queen charlotte it was then and not
many years ago prized in palaces now it
is used in every cottage and known in
every place where plates or dishes are to
be found after this queen's ware he invented
all the varieties which you have
seen and many more
mrs frankland rang the bell and ordered
the servant to bring a plate cream
coloured wedgwood ware another the
white stone ware a crock the dark
glazed kind and a common red garden
pot these she placed in the order in
which they had been made beside wedgwood's
beautiful vases to show harry and
lucy the difference and contrast
and all these improvements or at
least the greatest part them were made
by one man thought harry then
more was done by him during his lifetime
than had been done in hundreds 
years before
lucy asked if any lucky accidents had
happened to mr wedgwood which put
improvements into his head or gave him
the first idea any his inventions she
said she should like very much to know
the story these if mr frankland would
tell it to her
mr frankland said he did not know 
any such and observed that though one
or two fortunate accidents might occur to
the same person it was not possible that
such progressive improvements as mr
wedgwood had made could have been
suggested by accident or accomplished by
any one who had not scientific knowledge
 i should like very much said harry
to know what he did first and what he
did next and how he went on from one
experiment to another
 all this i cannot pretend to give
you a history said mr frankland for
i am not sure that i know it clearly myself
all can tell you is that he improved
the potteries by the introduction 
substances which had not before been employed
in the composition these wares
it had been found that some cornwall
granite is as good for making porcelain
 a certain kind as the clay which the
chinese use mr wedgwood introduced
dorsetshire and cornwall clays
perhaps you could tell me sir said
lucy how the delicate blue the
ground this flowerpot is made
 that is given by a substance called
cobalt said mr frankland but as
you have never seen it the word cobalt
teaches you little
i wish i knew said lucy how the
beautiful colours the flowers on the
dessert plates and how the purple and
rose colours on this cup are produced 
the purple and rose colours are given
by the precipitate gold dissolved in nitromuriatic
acid the oxides iron also produce
many the colours which you admired
but as you are not acquainted with any 
the oxides iron or with nitric or muriatic
acid or with the precipitate gold you
know nothing more from my answer thana
number names which probably you
will not be able to remember an hour and
which unless you learn their properties
could be no use to you even if you
could keep them in your head all your
life
but without telling us all those hard
names sir said lucy could not you
give us some general idea how he did
it all
mr frankland smiled and answered
that he did not exactly know what she
meant by a general idea it all he
could tell her only that mr wedgwood in
the first place learnt the properties different
clays and minerals and what effect
would be produced on these by fire in
short he applied to the study chemistry
and mineralogy to learn all the experiments
which had been made by others and
then he tried new ones for himself but if
he had not read and acquired this knowledge
first he might have wasted his time
and ingenuity in doing what others had
done before him besides genius to invent
new and elegant things he had the
food sense to observe what is wanted
every day by the greatest number people
so that he not only produced what
pleased persons taste but what was useful
to all classes and he continually considered
how he could improve not only what
others made but what he had himself produced
it was by this attention to little
as well as to great objects and by steadily
adhering to one course pursuits that
he succeeded in accomplishing all that he
began no small praise for a man who
undertook so much the consequences 
his success we all know continued mr
frankland turning to harry's father and
we all rejoice in them wedgwood made a
large fortune for himself and his children
with a character a reputation above all
fortune he increased amazingly the industry
wealth and comforts the poor
in his neighbourhood multiplied the conveniences
elegancies and luxuries life
for the rich raised at home and abroad
the fame the arts and manufactures 
his own country extended her commerce
and spread his own name with his productions
to the most remote regions the
civilized world
a pause ensued after these words all
looked with admiration at his works
and those who had known him intimately
sighed for the loss an excellent man and
a kind friend 
the next day mr frankland took harry
and lucy to see the works at etruria
we shall not follow them through all the
processes but shall only mention what
harry and lucy recollected and told their
mother on their return
the first thing i remember said
harry is the improvement in the way 
grinding the flints
 but you must know mother in the
first place said lucy that formerly this
was very unwholesome work such a quantity
 the dust the powdered flint flew
off and as the workmen breathed it went
in at their mouths or up their noses and
it brought on complaints in their lungs
and stomachs and inflamed their eyes
besides
all this was remedied continued
harry by grinding the flints in water
which prevented the dust from flying off
the name the man who made this improvement
and who made the first mill on
this principle was brindled and the mill
is very ingenious
but you had better not stop to describe
that said lucy because perhaps
mamma does not care as much about it
as you do now let me go on harry
and tell a little well mamma the flints
ground in the great cauldron 
mill said harry
mixed with water continued lucy
looked at first like chalk and water
thickish then by mixing with clay and by
stirring and beating and straining through
sieves this became first a sort pulp
and then about as thick as paste or dough
r and then it was ready for the man to carry
vto the potter's wheel you know the 
mamma i remember first
seeing the print it in our trades
but there is an improvement in this the
very common one which i once saw long
ago was only a circular board turning on a
perpendicular stick
axis said harry

a boy whirled it round for the man
you know mamma while he went on
moulding the clay upon it into a bowl and
he called to the boy to make it go slower
or faster but in this potter'swheel no
boy to whirl the board is wanting for it is
turned by a shaft
and that shaft is turned by a steam
engine said harry the steam engine
mother at work again observe mother
yes said lucy papa called it the
great servant all work
but there was an improvement in this
potter's wheel which you have not told
yet lucy said harry
no no but i am coming to it let me
tell it said lucy
if you understand it whispered harry
in a very kind tone as he was only
afraid for her not anxious to show what he
knew
i understand one thing about it and
that is all i want to tell my dear said lucy
there was a sort large roller in the
shape a cone mamma opposite to the
potter's wheel and a strap or band round
it that could slide or be pushed up and
down upon this cone from the narrowest
part to the thickest harry took notice 
this the moment he saw it and asked the
use it papa bid him find out and he
did mamma it was to make the wheel
go slower or quicker whenever the man
who was moulding the clay desired that it
should this was necessary because the
steamengine which keeps the potter'swheel
in motion goes on always at its own
regular rate and would never mind his
calling out faster slower slower 
faster therefore he must have someway
 slackening or quickening the wheel
without interfering with the steam engine
this is done for him by a boy's simply
shifting that strap i described to you
higher or lower to the thicker or thinner
part the cone this was the use
mamma the cone and band and harry
found it out
i am glad you remember this my dear
lucy said her mother
thank you said harry's eyes
lucy went on with raised spirits
mamma i wish you had seen the man
moulding the clay and all the metamorphoses
 the potter'swheel first in
one minute the lump clay turned into
a bowl then the instant after he squeezed
this soft bowl up in his hand dashed it
on the wheel and again he turned and
moulded and in an instant it was a
plate in another instant the plate was
gone and in its stead a cup stood before
us
a cup without a handle said harry
the handle if wanted must be made
separately and stuck on afterwards only
certain shaped things round or flat are
made on the potter'swheel those which
have isis and outs in their shapes are made
in moulds into which the moist clay is
squeezed sometimes two parts a thing
the spout a teapot for instance are
made in separate moulds and the halves
joined together afterwards but i daresay
mother you know all this
 i knew most this myself before
continued lucy from the prints
and descriptions in our dear 
trades and from some others our little
and large books but i liked to see the
real work going on and the real things
there was always some difference between
the description and the reality or something
that i fancied larger or smaller than
it is or some little particular circumstance
which i did not comprehend till i saw it
mamma i did not tell you that we saw
the furnaces and kilns for baking firing
the porcelain as they call it these were
much larger than i expected when the
porcelain has been once baked it is called
fecwiy in which state it is ready for painting
mamma i have not told you how much 
was entertained in the painting room by
seeing how dull the colours look when they
are first laid on and how bright and brilliant
they are after they have been fired 
vol c
what was to be gold was quite dark beforehand

pray lucy said harry did you
observe a man alio was standing beside
one the furnaces whose business seemed
to be to regulate the heat he had some
little bits clay which looked like little
stoppers and he put these into the fire and
measured them did you see how 
no i saw the man said lucy but
i did not know what he was doing well
mamma there is one other thing i remember
and that is all you know the common
kind blue and white cups and saucers
and plates with windmills and houses
and strange chinese looking figures and
all manner things upon them
i do know luckily what you mean
said her mother laughing otherwise i
am not sure that i should know it from
your description
 mamma these were formerly painted
one at a time by hand but now there is a
much quicker way mr frankland showed
it to me first the patterns whatever
you wish houses or churches or geese or
turkies or shepherdesses or elephants or
windmills are printed on paper
engraved on copper first said harry
and the blue colour put upon the copperplate
instead printer's ink
and the blue colour oh let me tell
that harry cried lucy the blue colour
is made cobalt
 oxide cobalt i believe said harry
 which differs from cobalt mr frankland
told us if you recollect lucy as
much as rust differs from iron
 well oxide cobalt it should be i
recollect said lucy and this is mixed
with some earth and 
and linseed oil said harry like
what is used in printer's ink
and when it is altogether about as
thick and soft as paste it is put on the
copperplate you know mamma you
showed me common engraving once and
just like any common engraving this is
done as many copies patterns are
taken off on paper as you want
c
you forgot that the paper was smeared
first with soft soap said harry
 then when you want to use these
patterns said lucy the superfluous
paper is cut off and the printed part is
moistened and laid on the cup or whatever
you wish to put it on
 the cup must be in the state biscuit
remember said harry
biscuit to be sure said lucy the
biscuit instantly sucks in absorbs the colouring
stuff from the moistened pattern 
then the paper is washed off and you seethe
coloured pattern printed on the cup
directly is not that nice and quick 
mamma then the cup must be let to
dry and afterwards it is dipped in some
sort glazing stuff and the cobalt i mean
the oxide cobalt comes out a beautiful
blue and there is the cup finished
painted in this easy expeditious way a
hundred thousand i dare say could be
painted in this manner while a person
could paint one single cup in the old
way
the name the ingenious person as
mr frankland said who discovered this
method transferring engraving from
paper to earthenware has not been preserved
and i am sorry for it added harry
 mr frankland told us that since this
invention this blue and white ware has
been made in such quantities and so cheap
that now almost every body can afford to
buy it and it is in every cottage and the
poor people can have now what only the
rich and grand had formerly are not you
very glad that mamma
yes i am my dear said her mother 
 and i am glad added she smiling
that you give yourself time to take breath
at last and that you allow me time to
thank you for all you have told me you
seem to have been very much entertained
at the potteries and you have entertained
me by your account them
 mamma said lucy do you think
we have remembered enough i know i
cannot recollect half what i saw and heard
but i remember almost all that i understood
clearly
 that is quite enough my dear said
her mother i never wish you to remember
more than you understand what
use could it be 
good morning to you mamma said
lucy i forgot to tell you yesterday
when we were talking about the potteries
that we saw the house in which mr
wedgwood formerly lived and a very
nice house it is
good morning to you father said
harry do you recollect yesterday seeing
a man standing by one the furnaces
measuring some little stoppers baked
clay which he slid in between two pieces
 brass like the two parts a hinged
ruler these pieces brass were fixed
but not parallel to each other they were
closer together at one than at the
other the man took the bits clay or
stoppers out a heated furnace and he
tried each stopper between these rules
and looked at divisions which were marked
on the brass plates what was he doing
papa
he was using a sort thermometer
harry said his father
 a thermometer clay papa said
lucy
yes for measuring higher degrees 
heat than can be shown by that thermometer
which you have seen if that were
exposed to heat beyond the highest degree
marked on its scale the quicksilver would
expand so as to burst the glass and the
glass would melt if put into one those
furnaces which you saw yesterday but
these clay thermometers can bear and can
measure the heat the fire for which
reason it is called a pyrometer that is
measurer fire heat
i am glad i know the name and what
it means said lucy
 father said harry will you be so
good as to explain the pyrometer to me 
 harry will you be so good as to use
your own understanding said his father
 from what you have seen and from what
i have just told you you know enough to
comprehend or invent the rest without
any further explanation from me
harry was silent and considered first
its use he had seen the man put the
stopper into the furnace and then measure
it between the rulers and afterwards say
to another workman the man who was
feeding the furnace this heat will do
now thought harry what change could
have been made in the clay after it had
been put into the furnace and how did he
measure it when he pushed it in between
the two rulers he must have tried whether
it had grown larger or smaller after
having been put into the fire
 i think said harry that perhaps
some sorts clay either shrink or grow
larger when they are put into the fire if
they did so always regularly and if people
found this after a number trials then
they might know the heat the fire by
the quantity which the clay had shrunk or
increased in size if this is the case with
those bits clay that i saw they would
be promoters or measurers fire heat as
you said i mean if you had the degrees
marked upon the ruler to measure them
exactly so said his father you are
right as far as you have gone still there
is a part the pyrometer which you have
not explained to me you observed that
the rulers were not parallel to each other 
do you think that was done by accident or
on purpose v
i think it must have been on purpose
they seem to have been screwed down on
the plate firmly like a ruler partly open
then if they were placed so on purpose
for what purpose asked his father
that the different degrees shrinking
might be measured as the stoppers are
pushed in said harry the person who
first made the pyrometer must have tried
experiments and must have marked the
different degrees which the clay shrinks
c 
with different heats but i do not know
by what parts an inch or by what scale
it is made the rulers seemed to me to
be about two feet long
they are said his father and the
opening at the widest is fivetenths
and at the narrowest threetenths an
inch and so that this proportion is kept
it does not signify what inches or feet maybe
used in the length the rulers the
bits clay which you saw exactly fit into
the widest opening before they have been
used and they shrink according to the
degree heat to which they are exposed
if it is greater than that in which they were
first slightly baked
 then papa they can only show a
greater degree heat not a lesser and if
they do not swell out again to the former
size they are no use after they have
been in a great heat said lucy
 none replied he fresh stoppers
must be continually used
 that is a great inconvenience said
lucy because you must drag about this
weight stoppers not like a nice portable
thermometer in its little case
 but it has so many conveniences
lucy said her father that we may well
pardon that one disadvantage
one great convenience i see said
harry the stopper always remains the
same size after it is taken out the fire
so that there is no danger making mistakes
about it you may measure it over
and over again but the quicksilver varies
so that if you do not write down the degree
accurately you are undone
 this pyrometer continued his father
is chiefly used in manufactories or by
chemists in their laboratories it has been
 great use to mr wedgwood who made
it from feeling the want such a measure
in his potteries it was necessary that he
should know at what heats certain clays
melt or vitrify that is you know turn to
glass the common workmen's expressions
for this such as red heat or white
heat he found so inaccurate that in trying
experiments many things were spoiled for
want that exact measure which his barometer
now gives by it he has ascertained
what heat all kinds porcelains
can bear without breaking or melting or
turning to glass what is still more
use he can ascertain the exact degree 
heat required for baking or as they call
it firing any kinds porcelain or earthenware
 which he could obtain any specimen
whether made in this or in foreign
countries as mr wedgwood said in describing
it it speaks the language all
nations the advantage having an accurate
universal measure in any case
much as it pleases you now will please
you more when your knowledge enlarges
and when you see the further uses to which
it can be applied
 papa i remember seeing said lucy
in scientific dialogues the description
 a pyrometer but i do not think that it
ws made clay
 no that pyrometer is different said
her father that measures by the expansion
 metal bars with different degrees
 heat which is shown by the motion
given to an index
like the hygrometer said lucy
yes and there are several different
kinds promoters which you can read
the description at your leisure continued
her father in any encyclopedia if you
have any curiosity about them
yes said harry i should like to
compare them and see which is best if i
could
that would be a good exercise your
judgment harry said his father but
there are so many they might tire and
puzzle you
the clay which mr wedgwood's
promoters are made continued his father
possesses some properties which fit it
peculiarly for the purpose to which it has
been judiciously applied those halfburnt
bits it which you saw harry
may be dropped at once into intense fire
without cracking ands when they have received
its heat may be plunged into cold
water without the least injury in about
three minutes they acquire all the heat
from any fire which they are capable 
receiving so as to contract as much as
they ever will from that degree heat
they may afterwards be left in that heat
as long as you please for they will not
change take them out and they can as
you have seen be cooled in a few seconds
and are then ready for measuring in the
gauge or scale
how very convenient said harry
but as each promoterbit can be used
but once there ought to be a constant
fresh supply
there are large beds this clay in
cornwall said his father and to ease
your mind harry on this subject i can tell
you that mr wedgwood offered to give
the royal society a sufficient space a
bed that clay to supply the world with
pyrometer pieces for ages
i like that very much cried lucy
i cannot bear that people who discover
scientific things should be covetous 
them or afraid that others should have a
share
 how could you ever think such a
thing said harry
i never should have thought it
said lucy only that i heard a gentleman
once at aunt pierrepoint's say but
i believe i had better not tell it because
it can do no good to any body but
harry i hope and i am sure that if ever
you invent or discover any thing you will
be ready to let others share with you
that i will said harry oh i
wish it was come to that father there
is something else i want to say but i do
not know how to express it it is that
i think that a person who invents any
pyrometer or hygrometer or barometer
or new and exact instrument for measuring
heat or cold or height or quantity
does more service than a person who
invents only a machine which will do
only for some particular purpose because
those measuring instruments will
assist a great many other people in their
experiments for years perhaps for ages
to come do you understand what i
mean papa
yes my dear and i think what you
say is very true but do not twist the
poor button my coat any more or you
will pull it off and let me go now for
there is the breakfastbell
who will be down stairs first cried
lucy letting go her button and running
foremost harry might have overtaken
her perhaps in a race across the hall but
that he stopped to hold open a swingdoor
for mrs frankland she had in her
hand two small packets one which she
gave to him and the other to lucy on
opening the paper in which these were
wrapped they found two cameos 
wedgwood's ware lucy's which was
black on a white ground represented a
negro in chains kneeling with his hands
raised in a supplicating manner with
this motto engraved
 am i not a man and a brother
j
harry's cameo was all one colour
brown it represented three allegorical
figures peace art and labour and it
was made clay which had been brought
from botany bay mr wedgwood made
use this clay as mrs frankland told
harry on purposeto show the settlers
and inhabitants that country what
could be made their materials by industry
and ingenuity and thus he encouraged
them to exert themselves 
these cameos the late mr wedgwood distributed
many hundreds and no doubt
considerable effect was produced by
 the poor fettered slave on bended knee
from britain's sons imploring to be free
lucy you have not seen our garden
yet said mrs frankland we had not
time yesterday but if you are fond a
garden come with us now your mother
and i are going there
 oh thank you ma'am said lucy 
but i must call harry and we will
follow you directly
they followed and a gay garden it
was full a variety brightcoloured
flowers rich beds carnations and roses
in full blow
roses moss roses in full blow in
september cried lucy the day before
she had left home she had searched
their garden for a rose for her mother
but could find only one poor solitary bud
which had a yellow nightcap on she
asked mrs frankland to tell her how
she contrived to make her roses blow so
late in autumn
by pulling off some the buds in
spring said mrs frankland as soon
as they begin to form and by transplanting
some the rose trees early in
the spring so as to prevent them from
flowering at that time then they blow in
autumn
lucy said she would try this next
spring on her own two rose trees
not on both will you said harry
let us pull the buds off one and leave
them on the other then it will be a fair
experiment
 and besides you may then have a
chance said mrs frankland the
first rose spring as well as the last
rose summer
lucy took notice some large clusters
 bright blue flowers aga pant has and
varieties dahlias she thought them
beautiful but she supposed that these
could not be had without a great deal
 trouble and money and a hothouse ora
gardener at least but mrs frankland
said these did not require a hothouse
or even a gardener's skill indeed
said she all the flowers in this garden
excepting perhaps certain carnations
which my gardener prizes highly though
 do not may be had by any body wltk a
little care and exertion their own
by any body repeated lucy but
ma'am do you mean bodies like us like
harry and me with only our own hands 
yes bodies like you said mrs
frankland with your own hands provided
you use your heads as well as your
hands
in what way must we use our heads 
said lucy will it be very difficult
 no consult your gardener's dictionary
and follow its directions only remember
to do so at the right time year
said mrs frankland she told lucy
that she would give her the root an
agapantha and some dahlias and
that she and harry were welcome to
seeds roots cuttings or slipping 
any thing they liked in this garden
write down what you wish and i will
have them ready by the time your mother
brings you here again as i hope she will
on your return homewards
joy sparkled in their eyes and they
thanked mrs frankland with warm gratitude
but an instant afterwards they
looked unusually grave for the embarrassment
 riches came upon them they
were left to make out their list and how
to choose was the difficulty where all
were beautiful and when their little
garden could not hold all harry went
to work prudently he measured out a
space ground that was the size 
their own garden lucy could hardly
believe that it was so small as what he
now showed her but he had often
stepped the boundaries and was sure
 the size their territories rule and
measure soon settled the affair and
brought their wishes into proper compass
they calculated what their garden would
hold and made out their list accordingly
their chief wish was to have a great bed
 pinks and carnations
but the moment they went near these
an old gardener who was at work in the
garden and who had long been eyeing
them approached he began to praise
his carnations which he said were the
finest in the county and he pointed out
his favourites there was the prince
regent and the duke wellington in
full glory these every body knew but
beyond these he had two superlative new
favourites one he called the pride 
holland or the great van tromp the
other the envy the world or the great
panjandrum harry and lucy did not
much admire either these van tromp
they thought was a dull colour and
the great panjandrum had burst and was
falling to pieces in spite his card support
harry preferred some others
that which you are now at master
said the gardener is davy's duchess
 devonshire that little duchess was
thought a great deal some years ago
but she is quite out fashion now
harry did not care for that he liked her
 what does he say asked the deaf
gardener turning to lucy and leaning
down that he might hear the answer
 i say cried harry speaking loud in
his ear that i like my little duchess
better than your great panjandrum
indeed said the gardener smiling
in scorn why master what you have
taken such a fancy to is not a carnation
even it is only a pink
i do not care said hairy what
you call it i like it whether it be called
carnation or pink
the gardener looked at him with contempt

pray what is the difference between
them said lucy my mother has told
me but i forget it
the gardener told her that one chief
difference is in the roundness the
petals carnations and the jagged or
pinked edges the petals pinks
lucy liked these edges and she really
thought some the pinks prettier than
the carnations she told harry so in a
low voice but i am afraid said she
that the gardener would despise me if
he heard me say so
what signifies whether he despises
you or not said harry there is
nothing wrong in liking a pink better
than a carnation
the gardener who did not hear what
was said fancied that they were debating
whether they should ask for one his
grand pan jan drums and he began to say
that he was sorry that he could not offer
this he could not give this to any body
harry assured him that he need not
make any apology because they did
not wish for them piqued by harry's
indifference the gardener named several
lords and ladies who had admired his
panjandrum above all things and who
had tried in vain to obtain it it was a
very great rarity he said only two other
people in england had a real panjandrum

harry liked flowers for being pretty
and did not care whether they were rare
or not
the gardener did not believe him
soon afterwards he offered harry some
pinks a kind which he liked particularly

but master i can let you have them
only upon condition that you promise
not to give any cuttings or layers them
to any one
harry drew back with disdain and said
he would make no such promise
the gardener said that unless he would
he should not have the pinks
then said harry i will do without
them
he turned off abruptly and walked
away but lucy stood still and said
 i believe we may have them
mrs frankland told us we might have
any thing in this garden that we choose 
and here she is coming back from the
orchard
oh that alters the case said the
gardener with a look some mortification
 then master you must choose
what you will to be sure
vol ir d
harry turned back and walked composedly
along the sides the carnation
beds writing down the names those
he chose on a bit paper the
gardener breathed freely when harry
passed by the panjandrum and turned his
back upon the envy the world
lucy whispered to her brother did
you see how much he was afraid that
you should have chosen any those
that are really valuable and why did
not you 
because i did not like them and i
despise his mean reasons for liking them
said harry putting the paper and pencil
into her hands now go lucy and
choose
lucy admiring her brother's independence
followed his example and chose
what she liked without being influenced
by the foolish wish possessing what
other people cannot procure she did not
choose either the pride holland or the
envy the world
harry was quite right to adhere to his
own taste were was no trial complaisance
or generosity
mrs frankland and their mother now
returned from the orchard and harry and
lucy gave mrs frankland their list she
looked it over said she thought they had
chosen well and had been moderate in
their requests she called to her gardener
gave him the paper and desired him to
have the plants in readiness at the time
she mentioned
very well ma'am he answered coolly
looking over the list which he saw was
only common flowers but when she
added that he must also give some dutch
hyacinths and tulip roots the gardener's
whole countenance changed he exclaimed
my dutch tulips and hyacinths and
throwing down a hoe that he had in his
hand he walked off muttering to himself
that it was well his mistress's head was
not loose or she would give it away
mrs frankland laughed goodhumoured
at his anger she bore with him
dr

she said because he was an old and faithful
servant who had been long in the family
before she was married though
you might not think it said she he is
generous to his relations all that belongs
to himself and covetous only what
belongs to the garden which he considers
himself as guardian against his mistress's
extravagance but i cannot bear
this sort petty avarice and rivalship
about flowers in persons whose education
ought to have raised them above such illiberality
i have heard a lady who
when she was asked by a friend for the
roots some particularly fine flower
ashamed to refuse yet unwilling to give
boiled the roots before she sent them to
prevent the possibility their growing
harry expressed the greatest indignation
against this meanness
they now entered the conservatories
and observed the flowers a plant which
hung over the entrance the peachhouse
they looked as if they were cut out 
thick velvet and were covered with honey
their smell which had been pleasant at
first soon became disagreeable and overpowering
mrs frankland told lucy
that this plant is called hoy a carlos hoya
from the name mr hoy the gardener
who introduced it into england and carnose
from the fleshy appearance the
flower she had planted it at the door 
the peachhouse because it is there a useful
guard wasps are so fond its honey that
they will for this leave untouched peaches
and grapes after they had seen the
peachhouse they walked through the
conservatory where mrs frankland pointed
out a tree called the papaw tree carica
papaya which had been brought to her
lately from the west indies the gentleman
who gave it to her told her
that it will grow twenty feet in three
years that its juice has the singular property
 making meat tender if the juice
be rubbed on beef it makes it as tender as
veal and if an old fowl be hung on
the trunk this tree it becomes in a few
hours as tender as a young chicken this
it is affirmed is a fact which has been long
known to those who have resided in the
west indies but mrs frankland said
as she had not yet tried the experiment
she could not assert it to be true
at this moment harry put his hand to
the mouth one the flues or pipes in
the conservatory and perceived that warm
air came through it but mrs frankland
told him that this air was not well heated
and therefore did not heat the building
as it ought she said that a man was
just going to alter and she hoped to improve
them harry heard his father talking
to this man at the other the
conservatory and he went to see what was
doings
his father turned to him and asked
whether if he were to place the pipe he
would put it at the top or the bottom 
the building
harry answered at the bottom because
i know that heated air is lighter than
air that is not heated and therefore if it islet
in at the bottom the building it will
mix with the colder air and gradually
warm the whole house as it rises to the
top
as lucy walked on with harry she
asked him how he knew that hot air is
lighter than cold
 as you might know said harry if
you recollect a diversion we were fond 
when we were children and which i should
like this minute he puffed out his cheeks
and blew through his hand as he turned
his face up towards the sky
 blowing bubbles you mean said
lucy but what then 
 what do you think makes the bubble
go up said harry
it goes up because it is lighter than
the air
and how comes that what is it
filled with
it is filled with air from the mouth
blown through a tobacco pipe
well whether it is blown through a
tobacco pipe or not said harry is the
air from your mouth hotter or colder than
the outer air do you think when the
bubble rises 
oh hotter to be sure now i know
what you mean the bubbles go up because
they are filled with heated air indeed
i might have known from this that
heated air is lighter than cold air but i
did not recollect it at the right moment
i wonder how you came to remember it
so well
harry said that besides the bubbles
another thing fixed it in his mind a
thing which he had seen when she was
away from home a fire balloon which
went up because it was filled with heated
air he was one the persons employed
to hold the great bag the balloon
over a fire made straw it was
all flaccid at first said he as my
father called the bladder which you may
remember he showed us
yes said lucy and if your balloon
were filled with heated air it would expand
i know that
 yes but you do not know how it
pulled said harry i felt it beginning
to pull against my hands as it filled out
and at last when it was quite full it pulled
so hard that i could scarcely hold it but
i was desired to hold fast and i did
though my knuckles were burning the
instant papa cried let go we all loosed it
and up it went to a great height quite into
the clouds oh the pleasure seeing it
go up and the pain my knuckles
which were all blistered fixed the whole
in my mind so that you need not wonder
at my remembering it
while they were talking in this manner
their father was still speaking to the workmen
about the stove the hothouse they
joined him and listened to what he was
saying the man was asking mr frankland
if he had seen the new method 
heating houses used in a neighbouringtown
he had and admired it much
it had been first attempted at the house 
the gentleman by whom it had been invented
which it warmed most comfortably
d
then it was tried at die county infirmary
where it also succeeded to the satisfaction
 the medical men and the patients
it was the invention a gentleman
who has for many years exerted
his great knowledge mechanics for
purposes domestic comfort and who
has in the most liberal manner devoted
his wealth his time and his inventive
genius to public works useful to his native
town in particular and to mankind in
general
at this moment they were interrupted
some visitors had arrived and they returned
to the house when harry went
into the room he saw ladies with no bonnets
on their heads and one with artificial flowers
in her hair though not much skilled in
such matters he thought this looked as if
these people were not merely morning visitors
but would stay to dinner for which
as lucy knew by lies face he was very
sorry
the next time they were alone together
in their mother's dressing room in
othe
evening after the company were gone
lucy asked her brother if he had not been
unhappy all day since the time they were
interrupted at the stove but harry said
that on the contrary he had been very
happy and that he had heard several entertaining
things
at first said he when i saw that
woman with the artificial flowers in her
head i thought it would be a company
day and that it was all over with us
that lady was very goodnatured tome
said lucy in telling me something
about the artificial flower which she wore
did you observe it
not i said harry yes i believe
i did see it it was like a lilac and i was
glad it had no smell for i dislike the
smell lilac in a room but what did she
tell you about it
that she brought it from italy she
asked me to guess what it was made i
looked close and i touched it for she told
me that i might it was not paper nor
silk nor gauze nor cambric i could not
guess what it was though i had an indistinct
recollection having seen something
like it somewhere it was made the
cocoons silk worms in italy you know
they have great quantities these in the
silk worm's own country and it is well to
make use them instead throwing
them away
yes said harry if there must be
artificial flowers and i suppose there must
that lady gave also an entertaining account
 some travellers who were stopped
by banditti between rome and naples

yes said lucy and the little
girl who had her mother's jewels given to her
to take care and who concealed them in
her doll's cradle and who kept rocking the
cradle and talking to her doll all the time
the robbers were searching the carriage so
that they never suspected where the jewels
were and went away without finding them
i do not think i could have had courage or
presence mind to have done that i
wish i could
you do not know till you are tried
whether you could or not said harry
but what was i going to say i cannot
recollect said lucy oh i was
going to ask whether you heard what that
lady told me about straw bonnets 
 not i said harry i heard her
beginning to say something about the price
and the fineness hats women's business
thought i to which i need not listen
yet it was worth hearing said lucy
though it was about bonnets gentlemen
listened as well as ladies
i am ready to listen now said harry
 in the first place harry do you know
what leghorn bonnets are
yes i believe i do a sort straw
hats i know the things when i see them
said harry
very well and you must know too
that ladies think they are much better because
dearer than others said lucy no
i mean much dearer because better
 which is it are you sure said
harry laughing
quite sure said lucy they are
really better they wear much longer and
bear wetting and crumpling they are
infinitely better
you know best i am satisfied said
harry that is settled they are dearer
because they are better go on
and they must be much dearer than
the common straw bonnets which are made
in england you know because they are
brought from a great distance from italy
 aye from leghorn i suppose from
their name said harry
 yes at leghorn first i believe and
for a long long time hundreds years
i dare say ever since such hats have been
worn people never thought its being
possible to make them anywhere but in
italy the straw is plaited differently
and they thought that sort straw could
be got nowhere but there in short they
never thought looking or trying what
they could do till lately but now people
have found out first in america i believe
then in england and at last in ireland 
poor ireland they have found a sort 
grass the straw which will do and they
have learned how to plait it as well as they
plait it in italy that lady showed us
two bonnets her own and her daughter's 
her own she brought from italy and her
daughters was made in ireland and as well
as i could see the irish one was the finest
 the two and much better judges than i
am and people who looked through spectacles
and held magnifying glasses to
them said the same several ladies in
ireland as she told us have taken a great
deal pains to teach poor girls this straw
manufacture one lady who learned how
to do it herself from some directions in a
common newspaper set to work and tried
experiments
sensible woman said harry
and good said lucy for it was to
do good and after a great many trials
she made a bonnet from the very beginning
with her own hands from the first
preparing the straw to the finishing and
she won the prize for this the best that
ever was made i believe
oh now lucy do not go too far
how do you know said harry
i tell you just what was told me my dear
that a person who saw it and compared it
with one which had been sent from italy
to some french princess declared that the
irish hat was full as good as the finest 
fine leghorn hats which cost fifty guineas
and this irish hat was made a very
common grass called crested dogstail
which grows even on bad ground its
flower stalks are so remarkably harsh and
tough that cattle will not touch them
though they will eat the dry stalks many
other sorts grass but these remain all
winter in the fields useless and they are
called in irish trawnyeens when a thing
cynosure cristatus
is worth nothing the irish say it is not worth
a trawnyeen but now trawnyeens are made
good for something and for a great deal
too
would you know the grass if you
were to see it said harry
yes said lucy i know it very
well and i will show it to you the next
time we are in any field where it is
do said harry i like the woman
who stuck to the bonnet till she had succeeded

she succeeded in doing a great deal
more than making one fine bonnet that
would have been no great matter only ingenious
said lucy but i will tell you
much more and much better this kind
lady taught several poor irish girls to make
these hats and two not older than fourteen
working in their own cottages cabins
they called them made in one year
twelve bonnets and besides they did all
the work that was wanted in the house
as usual their twelve bonnets were sold
for a guinea a piece a great many
such have been bespoken and are to be
sent over to london the children 
those poor irish who as you knows we
heard were almost starving last winter
have now one good way by which they may
earn guineas for their fathers and mothers

that is good indeed said harry
i am sure that woman who made the first
bonnet and taught them all must be glad
yes i am sure i should if i were in
her place said lucy and harry
mamma told me that if i can learn to do
this plaiting i may teach it to our poor
widow wilson's daughters today i saw
a little bit it which the lady who told
us all this brought in her workbag she
let me undo a bit it to see how it was
done and she gave us some straw and we
began to try
 now i know said harry why you
were all plaiting straw so eagerly i could
not think what had seized you when
i saw you all so busy with straws when
i came back from playing but now
lucy to go to another thing for we have
said enough about this did you observe
the old gentleman who sat in the armchair
by the fireside 
the same gentleman who the first day
at dinner talked wedgwood's ware and
 vegetable pie dishes said lucy
 yes i saw him indeed he took a
great quantity snuff and i could not
bear
what
it oh horrible harry his pocket
handkerchief 
 i did not see it said harry
 i am glad it said lucy i do
not like him
you do not like him my dear i assure
you said harry he is a very sensible
man for i heard him talking to my
father and mr frankland about stoves
and flues and fire places and hot air
 very likely said lucy but i wish
that he had not had those two great
streaks snuff along the wrinkles his
waistcoat
never mind that said harry i
want to tell you something entertaining he
told me
 well do then i would rather hear it
from you than from him said lucy i
hope harry you will never take snuff
no no my dear no danger
but when you grow old my dear
great danger so many old people do
and young too now i will tell you the
names all the snuff takers i know
no no no my dear lucy said
harry stopping his ears pray do not
but let me tell you about a little bird
a little bird oh that is another
affair i thought you were going only to
tell me about stoves what about a little
bird
it was about stoves too said harry
you must hear that before you come to
the bird do you recollect some one
said that there was a disagreeable smell
from a stove in the passage
yes said lucy and the people began
to debate whether it was a smell 
smoke or burnt air
then it was that my old gentleman
asked if they knew what is meant by burnt
airy and he began and told a doctor
somebody who tried some experiments to
determine whether heated iron gives out
any thing unwholesome to air that passes
over it or whether it takes any thing away
from it so as to make it in short unfit for
our breathing
so he took a bird i suppose said
lucy
stay stay first he took a small cube
 iron and heated it to a great heat i
am sorry i forget the degree said harry
never mind said lucy get on to
the bird
and he put it into an exhausted receiver
said harry
dr defaulters
the bird said lucy
no my dear the cube iron i
wish i had never told you about the
bird
well well i will not be birdwitted
said lucy papa you know told me i
was birdwitted once but harry i beg
your pardon now tell me he took a
small cube iron and he put it into an
exhausted receiver
yes said harry he placed the
cube iron so that whenever he let in
air it should all pass through a hole in the
hot iron
you never told me any hole in the
hot iron said lucy
there i was wrong said harry i
should have told you that he had made a
hole through the iron cube then he let
the air into the receiver and it passed
through and over the heated iron and
when this receiver was filled with this air
he put a little bird into it and it breathed
the air without seeming to be in the least
hurt or showing that he felt any difference
between it and fresh air
but the bird could not speak said
lucy and we are not sure it liked it
not sure certainly said harry but
now listen to the next experiment and you
will find what happened the man made
the same experiment with a cube the
same size heated brass and put the
same bird in the same receiver after it had
been again exhausted and filled with air
which had passed through and over heated
brass
well said lucy and what happened

the bird died said harry in a few
minutes
poor bird said lucy the man
was very cruel i mean the experiment
was cruel
no said harry because he tried
the experiment for a good purpose to save
the lives and health human creatures
that was good said lucy but i
think he might have tried the experiment
as well without killing the bird he should
have taken it out when he saw it gasping
for breath as i am sure he did before it
died and he should have let it recover
in the fresh air
certainly said harry it was cruel
as you say to kill the bird because it was
unnecessary but except that mistake
was not it a good experiment
she admitted that it was a good experiment
but she observed that the lungs 
birds and human creatures are different
and she thought it not quite a certain proof
that because a bird cannot live in such or
such air that therefore it must necessarily
be unwholesome for human creatures her
mother to whom she appealed thought
this was true and so did harry
 how much we have had to say and
think from what passed today said
lucy and how many curious facts and
entertaining stories we heard in conversation
though we were so vexed at being
interrupted when the visitors first came
in
yes said harry i thought that
and thought how right my father was in
telling me that we may often learn as much
from conversation as from books
a boating party was proposed by mr
frankland on the third and last day 
their visit and harry and lucy were invited
to be this party at which they
much rejoiced they had never been in
any boat this had not a sail it was to
be rowed with oars they walked down
to the side the river which ran through
the grounds and they found the boat in a
little creek moored to a post in the bank
lucy thought it a little dangerous to walk
over the board that was laid from the land
to the edge the boat one the boatmen
would have taken her by the arm but
as she saw harry walk on fearlessly she followed
without assistance they were desired
to sit down as soon as they were in
vol e
the boat and something was said about
trimming it how or why a boat was to
be trimmed lucy could not guess and she
was curious to see what would happen
nothing happened but that every body sat
still in their places except one the
men who was to row and who sticking
his oar against the ground pushed off
from the shore then crossing over lucy's
head with his oar and bluntly saying
 by your leave miss he succeeded in
getting the boat out the little creek in
which it had been moored
now they were fairly out in the river
and all the boatmen began to row excepting
one who sat at the the
boat watching the way it was going and
guiding it by means the rudder or helm
 which he held the great handle under
his arm
after they had rowed a little way this
man made one his companions change
places with another who was much
heavier and then seeming satisfied said
 she is well trimmed now lucy perceived
that she meant the boat and now
understood that by trimmed he meant
that the weight on each side the boat
was balanced
all was new and amusing to lucy she
listened to the sound the oars and
watched the sparkling drops hanging
from their edges as the men lifted them
from the water they raised them out 
the water not edgeways but with the flat
part or blade horizontal as you would
raise a spoonful any liquid the use
 this as harry perceived was to diminish
the resistance the air against
the oars as they were moved forward in
order to plunge them in the water
his father told him that this motion is
called feathering the oars
now i understand said lucy that
verse in the song the jolly young waterman
which you used to sing papa 
did you not hear a jolly young waterman
who at blacksmiths used for to ply 
he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexterity
winning each heart and delighting each eye
e 
as they rowed along they saw a pretty
villa on the banks the river lucy suddenly
started up in the boat and asked
harry if he should not like to live in that
beautiful place with the gay veranda
sit still my dear said her mother
 for if you overturn the boat you will
never live anywhere
effectually quieted by this suggestion
lucy sat down instantly and quite still
silently enjoying the fineness the day
and the pretty prospect houses gardens
parks and woods as they rowed on and
observing the reflection the trees and
buildings in the clear river a bird with
white out spread wings was skimming
over the water which lucy wanted harry
to see but he close at his father's elbow
was intent on hearing what mr frankland
was saying some foreigners who
had lately been at his house in the
course a tour they were making
through england he had taken them
out boating and in going down this part
 the river they had been particularly
struck not merely with the picturesque
beauty the scenery but with the appearance
 wealth comfort cheerfulness and
elegance in the residences our english
gentry the great territories and palaces
 they called them our high nobility
did not surprise them so much as the vast
number and variety the lawns and pleasure
grounds and parks our country
gentlemen one these foreigners was
french the other italian in italy there are
fine places and fine gardens belonging to
the nobility but none these comfortable
habitations fit for persons in the middle
ranks life the frenchman said that
these country houses were amazingly different
from the comfortless chateaux in
france they had paid visits to several
 our country gentlemen and liked their
mode living so much that even the
frenchman protested that if he had not had
the honour being born a parisian he
should prefer the lot an english country
gentleman to that any other being in
the universe the italian was further
struck by the liberty enjoyed and the
equal justice done to all as far as he could
see in england he found that many 
our most distinguished men have made
their own fortunes many risen by their
own talents and exertions from the lower
ranks life he found that in this country
though birth has great advantages
education does more and industry and
genius have the road to fame and wealth
and honours open to them he vrould
therefore as he declared rather have been
bon in england even in a lower rank
than in the highest class in any country
where such equal laws and liberty and
such strong motives for exertion are not to
be found
harry understood all this though it
might seem a little above his years and
liked it the better perhaps on that account
besides he enjoyed the praises 
dear old england
there was in the boat a sailor who was
now called upon to sing for them as he
had a good voice and knew many sailor s
songs and there was a boy who played on
the flute this boy was scotch and sang
for them several pretty scotch boat songs
the singing was interrupted by the man
at the helm calling out rather unceremoniously
to the boy with the flute bidding
him have done with his noise for they had
something else to mind now they were
coming as he said fast upon the weir and
the men who had been resting upon their
oars letting the boat float with the current
while they listened to the music
now began to row across the stream which
was carrying them forward with increased
velocity lucy imagined there was some
danger but what it was she did not know
for she had never seen a weir nor had
harry nor if he had known was it anytime
for talking all were silent the
man who steered seemed intent on passing
quickly through the current and all
hands joining in the pull they reached
and brought the boat safely into a little
creek where they moored her by throwing
a rope from her round the stump a
tree
when they were all safely lodged on the
bank and while the boatmen were wiping
their foreheads harry inquired if there
had been any danger and asked what was
meant by the weir mr frankland said
he would show it to him soon but they
could not see it from the place where they
were standing they walked on a little
way on the shore and presently heard a
sound as waters falling but still could
not see from whence the sound came it
became louder and louder as they advanced
till having passed the overhanging
branches a willow which interrupted
the view they saw what caused the noise
 falling waters the stream was rushing
down a step formed by a long ridge or
dam which lay obliquely across the river
this ridge was the weir and there might
have been some danger if the boat had
been carried too near it by the force 
the current
they were now to walk on to a place
where they were to get into another boat
on a canal as they passed along the
bank opposite to the weir they had a full
view it as the waters arching over its
rounding brim formed a length low
white and greenish cascade sparkling in
the sun and by its fall indented with
changing lights and shades while lucy
watched and admired these harry inquired
what was the use this ridge or weir
which he saw was not a natural step in
the bed the river but which seemed to
be built masonwork for some particular
purpose
mr frankland directed his eyes to a
mill on the bank and told him that the
use this weir was to dam up the river
so as to secure a constant supply water
and to give a fall sufficient to keep the
wheel this mill in motion harry
wished exceedingly to have a nearer view 
the waterwheel and the mill windmills
he had seen and examined but he
had seen waterfalls only from the road
mr frankland said it would not take
them above half an hour to walk to the
mill and back again and was willing to
grant harry's request mrs frankland did
not like to refuse him yet she seemed
e
doubtful she looked at her watch fearing
that they should scarcely have time she
said that she was anxious to be home in
good time for dinner because she did not
like to keep an old friend waiting however
if the mill could be seen in half an
hour there would be time she promised to
wait for harry and his mother said that
she would sit down on the stump a tree
and make a sketch the pretty situation
 the mill while he went to look at it
no sooner was permission granted than
harry darted off and was sure he should
be back again in less than half an hour
but time passes quickly when we are
amused and when we are following our
own particular tastes first the great
waterwheel was to be seen with all its
vanes and he stood observing how the
water turned it it was as the millwright
who came out to them said an overshot
wheel then it was to be explained to
harry what is meant by an overshot wheel
and the difference between this and an
undershot wheel this was a mill for
grinding corn he had seen flour mills
turned by wind and as the construction 
the mill work was as his father told him
nearly the same in this as in those which
he had seen there was no occasion to go
over it indeed he would have returned
directly but that he wanted to look at a
crane which was used for lifting up the
sacks corn from out the boats to the
granary in the upper part the mill and
for letting down the sacks meal when
ground harry thought he had been buta
few minutes looking at this and a few
more minutes were spent in seeing a sack
drawn up and five minutes more in examining
the motions a certain bolting
or sifting machine the operation which
when explained by the overseer particularly
delighted him
the overseer showed him that though
the wheat when it had passed through the
mill stones came out crushed or ground
yet that the finer parts were mixed with
the coarse flour as well as with the bran
or outer coat the grain in this state it
was first spread out on a loft in order to
cool and then it was poured down through
a wooden funnel or hopper y into the upper
 the bolting machine this was a
long hollow cylinder surrounded with a
sort net work wire resembling gauze
but three different degrees fineness
it was fixed in a sloping direction and the
overseer having kindly stopped the motion
 the machinery showed harry that within
the cylinder there was a frame work 
brushes attached to a small iron axis which
passed through its whole length the
overseer by pulling a cord set this iron
axis again in motion and harry perceived
that the flour when rapidly whisked round
by the brushes was forced out through the
meshes the wire the finest flour passing
through the upper and closest division 
the gauze and so on till nothing remained
but the bran which fell out at the lowest 
 the cylinder each species flour was
received in separate boxes from whence
they were taken away in sacks according
to the various uses to which they were to
be applied the finest flour being employed
in making the whitest sort bread
or in pastry the coarser in household
bread and the bran in a variety domestic
purposes
highly interested with what he had seen
because the patient overseer had made him
comprehend it thoroughly harry hastened
back to his mother and was not a little
astonished to find that they had been away
an hour instead half an hour
mrs frankland however who always
hoped the best said that they could makeup
for lost time by walking quickly to the
place where they were again to get into a
boat
quick time march said mr frankland
and on they marched in as quick
time as they could till they reached the
canal a long level stripe still water
which as lucy said to harry looked no
better than a broad ditch full water
she saw many large boats on this canal
loaded with coals others with goods 
various sorts and some crowded with
people to her mortification they were
to go on in one the canal boats and
slowly they now went nor was there any
pleasant sound oars instead being
by men this boat was drawn on by
a horse who was fastened to it by a long
rope and who walking on a path on the
bank the trackway as they called it
tugged on with his head down and as
slowly as his feet could step lucy
thought he looked quite stupefied and as
if he was walking in his sleep
why do people make canals papa
said she
he explained to her that canals are
made to supply the want rivers where
they cease to be navigable or in places
where they do not naturally flow he said
that canals are extremely useful for carrying
easily and cheaply heavy goods and
numbers passengers
harry supposed that canals could be
made only through flat countries and in
ground that was quite level but his
father told him that they can be carried
through ground that is not level
and how do they manage said
harry when they come to hills because
water cannot go up hill we could
not i think go safely in a boat down hill
or down steps you know we were obliged
this morning to get out before we came
to that ridge that little step in the river
the weir
 yes said lucy one the boatmen
said and my own sense showed
me that it would have been very dangerous
to attempt it the boat would have
pitched forward and filled with water
and we should all have been drowned
then how do people manage when
they come to uneven ground repeated
harry perhaps they do as we have
done today get out and walk till they
have passed over the hill and then take
to the water again
that was the case formerly said
his father and is still practised in some
places for instance in america and even
in this country in some the fens 
lincolnshire they not only are obliged
to get out their boats harry and walk
but must carry their boats along with
them over land or over marsh from one
place where the canal stops to another
where the ground being nearly level it
can go on but this is inconvenient
harry even to passengers and consider
what it must be where heavy loads are to
be carried
very inconvenient said harry then
i suppose people take great care in the
first place to choose the most level parts
 the country for their canals and to go
round the hills instead going over them
 true said his father but sometimes
they cannot go round them what is
to be done then harry
i see nothing that can be done but
to cut through them as we saw one 
the hills we passed over in our journey
where from the height the banks it
appeared to have been cut doom several
feet to let the road go through the same
must be done i suppose for canals and
where great stones or rocks come in the
way these must be blown up with gunpowder
as we saw men blasting away a
rock where they were making a new
road then the rubbish and stones and
earth must be carried away and a level
bed left for the canal
must is a word easily said harry
observed his father but all this digging
and blasting and carrying away 
stones and earth is extremely tedious
and expensive so much so that it would
be impracticable to have carried canals
across parts the country where they
now go if it had been necessary to make
the whole bottom or bed the canal
upon one level the difficulty is obviated
by means an ingenious contrivance
called a lock we shall come to one
on this canal soon and then you will see
how it is managed that we pass over
inequalities ground without being
obliged to gi out the boat and without
danger its being overset
 that is the best it said lucy
is it quite safe papa
 quite safe my dear if your eyes
and your ears were shut you would not
perhaps know that you were passing
through a lock
harry determined however to keep his
ears and eyes well open presently they
came to two large wooden doors which
would have stopped the way across the
canal had they been shut but they were
open and flung quite back their boat
passed on between the doors without
their feeling any difference in the motion
or perceiving any change in their position
the doors were then closed behind
them and they found themselves in a sort
 box or reservoir filled with water
just large enough to hold their boat without
striking against the stone work on
each side or the wooden doors at each
 there were two doors opposite to
those through which they had entered 
these they found shut but a sluice or
sliding door was immediately after their
entrance drawn up and this gradually
let off the water that was in this basin
or reservoir and the surface the water
gently sunk sunk sunk down with the
boat upon it with an imperceptible motion
lucy could as she said only know
that they had moved by seeing the height
above and observing on the stone sides 
the lock the marks where the vaterhad
been on their entrance the continued
thus gently sinking till they came to the
level the water in the canal at the
other side the gates through which
they were now to pass when it came
to this level the men opened the gates
and the boat was drawn out and went
on without difficulty on the canal his
father bid harry look up to the part 
the canal where they had been before
they entered the lock that he might
see the height from which they had
sunk
now harry said he tell me how
it happened that when we first came into
the lock we found the water in it upon
a level with the water in the canal above
on which we had been going
harry answered that he supposed that
before they had come up to the lock
men had opened the great gates and had
let the water from the canal rush into the
reservoir till it rose to a level
not the great gates harry said his
father the rush the whole body 
water from the canal would be too violent
think again
harry thought again and said he supposed
there were small sluices on the
side the lock next the upper part 
the canal similar to those next the lower
which he had seen opened and he supposed
that these sluices had been opened
before they came up to the lock and had
gradually let the water in
his father told him that this was exactly
what had happened and reminded him
 a whistle which he had heard from
one their boatmen some time before
they came to the lock which was the
signal for the man at the sluice to open
it and get ready the water for the coming
boat
harry was much pleased with this
most ingenious contrivance it seemed
so easy he said that he thought even
he might have invented it
this is the case with almost all good
inventions said his father
how nicely and gently we sunk down
doom in the boat said lucy on the
level water in the lock while it was flowing
out as my father said i am sure if
my eyes had been shut i should not have
perceived that we were going down what
a depth we sunk what a step that would
have been harry for a boat to comedown
 impossible without a lock but if
you can go up and down stairs in canals 
 stairs i do not know that said
harry but one step certainly
her father told lucy that he had
seen in scotland on the caledonian canal
seven or eight locks immediately
following each other and the people
 the country called these neptune's
stairs
mr frankland was glad to see that
harry and lucy had been so much pleased
with the lock as it was for the purpose 
showing it to them that he had come home
by the canal soon after passing through
the lock they landed by the side a road
where their carriage had been appointed to
meet them mrs frankland rejoiced to
see it ready waiting for them and again
she looked at her watch as if afraid they
should be late
late they certainly were and very late 
and cross and very cross was the old gentleman
who had been kept waiting and
starving as he said an hour and a half beyond
the regular dinner time mrs frankland
bore all he said and all he looked
with such gentleness and goodhumour
that lucy wondered how he could continue
angry she thought however that
he must be terribly hungry and that when
dinner came and when he had satisfied
his hunger he would grow goodhumoured
again no at dinner he grew worse
and worse every thing was wrong the
fish was overdone and the venison was
overroasted and some fault he found
with every one the many good things
which mrs frankland with persuasive
words recommended
 try this my dear sir or try that
but nothing he tried would do mrs
frankland looked sorry and still kindly
soothed him but at last he said something
very provoking about ladies never
being punctual and seldom thinking 
their absent friends harry could not bear
this and his natural bashfulness quite
conquered by indignation he called out ina
loud voice
 that is very unjust 
the old gentleman looked up from his
plate at harry whose face was red allover

well done my little turkeycock 
said he half laughing what have you
to say or to do with the business
only that it was all my fault said
harry
he explained and said that he had
staid too long looking at a mill and talking
about an undershot and overshot
wheel
mighty well for you and your mill
said the old gentleman in a tone between
pleasantry and reproach but pray
young gentleman what was that you said
about very unjust 
it was unjust to say that ladies never
think their absent friends sir replied
harry because mrs frankland who is
a lady did think her absent friends and
 you in particular for she was very anxious
to get home in time lest you should
be kept waiting for dinner which she said
sir that you do not like
who does sir said the old gentleman
now joining in a laugh but since
it was all your fault i must be satisfied
and must be obliged to mrs frankland for
her anxiety about me this hare is very
tender and not overroasted which considering
all things is wonderful mrs
frankland let us make up our quarrel by
drinking a glass wine together
mrs frankland's good temper and
sweet smile conquered him his forehead
un wrinkled and he became quite goodhumoured
and talked old neighbours
and his good old friend mr wedgwood
again and the staffordshire
canal the grand trunk as he called it
 which the late mr wedgwood was
the first proposer and which has enriched
so many individuals who had shares in
the original undertaking
after dinner when the ladies left the
room harry followed them for he did
not understand what was saying about
shares in navigation and the interest paid
upon them while the ladies were drinking
coffee the conversation turned upon
the cross old gentleman and bore rather
hardly upon him one lady in company
declaring that she thought mrs frankland
had been too kind to him that for
her part she should not had she been in
mrs frankland's place have thought herself
bound to submit to his rudeness or to
bear his illhumour she went on to laugh
at him for his epicurism
vol f
but mrs frankland stopped her she
said that she was much attached to this
gentleman that he was an old friend 
her husband's and his family and had
long shown them kindness for which she
felt grateful and that the only way in
which she could prove her gratitude was
by trying to make him comfortable and
happy in his declining years which could
not be done without bearing with his
little foibles his real benevolence and
excellent sense and information made
amends for them his pettishness was
soon over and his kindness heart
always remained
lucy admired and liked mrs frankland
for speaking in this manner she resolved
that when she grew up she would
be equally goodtempered and would
bear with the foibles old friends even
if they happened to be a little cross
above all she resolved that she would
be as steady as mrs frankland in defending
them in their absence
in the evening after the old gentleman
had taken his nap and was sitting
in his arm chair by the fire side he
caught hold harry's arm as he was
passing and said to him in a gruff but
goodnatured tone 
 tell me little man why you are so
curious about mills are you to be a
miller or a millwright pray or what
are you to be 
harry who generally understood what
was said to him quite literally answered
gravely that he believed he was not to
be either a millwright or a miller that
he did not yet know what he was to be 
but whatever he was to be it could do
him no harm to get all the knowledge
he could and he wished to
learn all about mills because it entertained
him
and what do you know about them
said the gentleman can you tell me
what keeps a mill going
wind keeps a windmill going replied
harry and water a waterfall
there are other kinds mills which
fare
kept going by horses and some are
moved by men and many by steam
upon my word you know a vast
deal said the gentleman
no sir i know very little said
harry bluntly and looking ashamed and
not well pleased
well i will not affront you any more
by flattering you since i find you do not
like it said the old gentleman come
added he drawing harry towards him
we shall be good friends yet you will
see i saw you playing with my grandson
at marbles yesterday do you know
how marbles are made 
no sir said harry taking one out
 his pocket and looking at it i should
like to know how they are made so very
round and smooth i should think it must
be difficult
it is my friend mr wedgwood told
me that he had found it one the most
difficult things he had ever attempted
and when i was on the continent i inquired
how they were made
 and how are they made sir said
harry
 first they cut a certain sort stone
into bits any irregular shapes no
matter what nearly the size a common
marble these they throw into an iron
mill in which there is a number partitions
and to each partition strong rasps
are fixed in a slanting direction the mill is
worked by water and is turned with great
swiftness the rubbing the stones
against the rough rasps and against each
other rounds them and by degrees smooths
and polishes them in the same manner as
the gravel becomes rounded in the bed 
a river when they are formed to the proper
shape they fall through circular holes
made in the bottom the mill the right
size to let them through from nuremberg
the town where they are made they
are brought down the river rhine to rotterdam
and thence sent all over europe to all
countries and places where boys play at
marbles and where do they not and now
you know more about marbles than nine
in ten the hundreds boys your age
who have their pockets filled with them
the backgammon table was now set
for the old gentleman usually played a
game with mrs frankland about this
time every evening but instead going
to it he staid talking to harry and telling
him various things which he had
seen when he was in holland
 when first i went to amsterdam
said he i remember as i approached
the city counting fortysix windmills all
in motion the dutch have long been
famous millwrights and many the contrivances
now in common use in our mills
in england were brought from holland 
for instance one which you may have seen
in your journey here did you take notice
that on some windmills there is a very
small sort fan wheel which stands out
a little from the top
 yes i know what you mean sir
said harry
so do i said lucy when first
i saw it i thought it was a little windmill
to frighten away birds from the corn
and do you now know the use it
 i do said harry for my father
showed me one and explained it to me 
the use that little wheel is to turn the
great sailwheel towards the wind by
means the wind itself so that whichever
way it blows the mill continues to work
in those which have not this ingenious
contrivance the mill must stand still
every time the wind changes and the
miller cannot set it in motion again without
a great deal trouble he must haul
round the whole top the mill in an
awkward way
why how said lucy do
harry explain the two ways in which these
different windmills turn or are turned
i have some idea but still i forget exactly
how it is
oh i am sure you know said
harry
perhaps i did know but go on as
if i did not begin from the beginning
first if you please with the awkward way
with that windmill which has no little
fanwheel
that common mill said harry is
called a post windmill because it is supported
upon a post which is fixed firmly
at bottom and which goes up through
the middle the inside the wooden
body or towerpart the mill this
tower is separate from the mason work
and from the grinding wheels underneath 
it hangs on the top the post and can
be turned round upon it
 this way do you mean like this
said lucy holding her pencil upright and
hanging her thimble on its point
something like it said harry but
the great sailwheel is fastened to the
wooden tower and one cannot be moved
round horizontally without turning them
both suppose the wind changes from
north to south then the tower itself must be
turned so as to bring the front the
sails to the side opposite to that on
which they had stood
how inconvenient and how does the
miller do this for that tower and the
sails and all must be a great weight
said lucy
he could not do it without the
help a lever said harry there is
a huofe ladder which is fastened to the
upper part the tower and which
reaches from that to the ground sloping
outwards so as to be a prop and stay
to keep the mill fixed in the position in
which it is to stand with the sails facing
the wind but the wind changes and
the mill must turn then the miller lifts
up from the ground the lower this
great ladder which he then uses as a long
handle or lever by which he turns round
the mill till the sails are again properly
placed
 so much for the post windmill now
for the other said lucy that with
the little fzin wheel as you call it
f 
that does the business cleverly and
without any trouble to miller or man
only the top not the whole body this
kind windmill is moveable the axis
 the great sail wheel goes through this
moveable top and therefore can be shifted
round horizontally along with it this top
rests on rollers so that it can move easily
on the top the solid stone wall the
tower now for the little wheel
aye the little ingenious wheel said
lucy
that is so placed at first that its
vanes catch the wind whenever it does not
blow upon the sails the great wheel
so as soon as great wheel stops little wheel
sets agoing and it sets in motion a train
 wheel work all which i need not describe
to you i need only say that it
has the power gradually to turn the moveable
top round till it brings great wheel
with its sails facing the wind then great
wheel sets agoing and little wheel by
this time having worked away from the
wind stops its business is done and
it rests till it is wanted when the
wind again changes so as to blow on its
vanes then it sets off again and works
the great wheel round to the right point
and so on continually
very well you understand it i see
said the old gentleman if i may say that
much without your thinking that i mean
to flatter you
harry smiled but said he there is
a thing i do not at all understand about
windmills i saw some standing still
while others nearly in the same situation
were going with the same wind i was
thinking what the reason this could be
and i suppose that there must be something
different in the way in which the
vanes or sails themselves are sloped or set
 believe i should call it
 you think rightly i believe said the
old gentleman i have a friend in france
a scientific man who made a windmill
which continued working when all the
other windmills in the neighbourhood
remained motionless the common people
used to gather round and stare at
it and say that it went by enchantment
for they could not conceive how it could
ofo with less wind than their own but
this arose from the judicious position 
the vanes which had been placed so that
the wind should act upon them with the
greatest possible force
i wish i knew that judicious position
said harry i have often tried to discover
it in making little windmills but i
could only place the sails by guess i
should like to know the rule and the reason
and the best possible way
and i should be very glad if i could
tell you all this my dear but that is beyond
me learned men have thought and
written much upon this very question but
i am not a man science or a mathematician
therefore i cannot explain it to you
i can describe only the things which i
have seen and which i understand
he then gave harry an account several
things he had seen in amsterdam
harry knew that this city is built upon
piles lucy said lie recollected reading
the number these piles which was
prodigious
harry asked whether any them had
given way or whether the houses stood
upright upon them
no said the old gentlemanthe
first idea i had when i entered amsterdam
was that many the houses were tumbling
down they were so much out the perpendicular
line but still they do not
fall
harry was going to ask the reason 
this but another question occurred to his
mind which he was afraid he should forget
if he did not ask it first pray sir
said he do you know if the dutch are
acquainted with the use steam engines
oh yes certainly
then why said harry do not they
use steam instead wind to keep their
mills at work
why should they said the old gentleman

 because said harrv wind is uncertain
they cannot have it when they
please and if they have not wind their
mills must stand still if there is a
storm they cannot make the wind less or
more just as they want more or less force
or quickness but we can manage steam as
we please at all times the year and in
all weather
very true my little mechanic said
the gentleman the dutch are now beginning
to use steam engines and what is
more 
what more he said lucy was in no
condition at this moment to hear for on
the scattering the snuff which he threw
from his fingers she was seized with a fit
 sneezing that seemed as if it would
never when she recovered she heard
the old gentleman speaking the embankments
or high and broad banks which the
dutch have been obliged to raise to protect
the country from inundations these embankments
are secured chiefly by mats
fastened downy willows which are twisted
together and which remain after the
ill
mats decay and thus form the best barrier
against the force the sea
willows said she such yielding
things which i can bend with the least
touch can they withstand the whole force
 the sea 
yes exactly for that reason said the
old gentleman because they do not resist
just as you may have seen the most
yielding manner do best against the torrent
 anger and the gentlest women subdue
the most violenttempered men
lucy smiled she was always ready fora
simile but she liked this extremely and
was pleased with its particular application
harry's heart now opened he drew close
to the elbow the arm chair from which
he had before kept at a certain distance
and he began to use his privilege asking
questions freely which he had till now
done only with great reserve his mother
soon called him away and advised him and
lucy to go to bed as they were to set off
early the next morning to pursue their
journey they were sorry to go and everybody
seemed sorry that they were going
the old gentleman asked which road they
intended to take and when harry's father
answered by coalbrook dale he said that
he was very glad that for the sake 
his young friends
perhaps i shall not be up when you set
off in the morning said he so shake
hands young gentleman and fare you well
it is happy for you that so early in life
you have acquired such a desire for knowledge
tomorrow you will see 
mr frankland interrupted him my
dear sir do not tell him what he will see
leave him the pleasure surprise
goodbye it was come to that melancholy
word and as lucy put her head out
 the carriage window to say the last
goodbye to mr and mrs frankland who
were on the steps at the halldoor shutters
opened in a bedchamber above the sash
was thrown up and the old gentleman put
out his head and repeated goodbye
goodbye and a good journey to you
 thank you thank you sir and pray
shut the window or you will catch cold
said lucy he was very kind to you
harry after all continued she as they
drove away and told you a great many
entertaining and useful things and at last
i liked him very well though he did take
so much snuff and though he was a little
crass yesterday at dinner he made up for
it afterwards i do believe harry that he
loves mrs frankland in his heart
who can help it said harry
i wish said lucy that when i grow
up i may be such a woman
i wish you may said harry in a tone
that sounded gruff because it was as much
as he could do to command his voice to
speak at all he was so sorry to part with
these kind friends lucy indulged him in
his taciturnity and began to examine a
little red morocco memorandum 
which mrs frankland had put into her
hand at parting and which she had held
till now unopened on turning over the
leaves this she found some the
pages filled with close writing
dear good mrs frankland exclaimed
lucy look mamma she has
written all this for us with her own hand 
and what do you think it is
 the juvenile gardener's calendar
dedicated to harry and lucy by their since
friend e frankland
 spring summer autumn winter
all in four little pages said lucy
i am always puzzled with the long directions
in gardening books about heaps 
things too which i have not but here i see
are only such flowers and plants as we have
or ought to have in our gardens any
and continued she after looking over the
calendar it tells me exactly all i
wanted to know about the times and seasons
for planting and transplanting and
sowing seeds and how to have successions
 pretty flowers i must read it to you
any she read and when she had
finished he joined in her delight at finding
that it contained all and no more than
they wanted
and you read it much better lucy
than you sometimes read writing said
harry
because said lucy this is much
plainer than writing is sometimes do you
recollect harry how i stumbled in trying
to read to mamma your translation
yes i knew you wanted to read it
particularly well said harry but you
boggled terribly it made me very hot
not hotter than i was said lucy i
wanted to read it particularly well indeed
that was the very reason you could
not said harry you were too anxious
and frightened
 but what frightened me was that i
could not make out the writing i knew i
was making nonsense what i was reading
and i could not help it since you
have set up to write a running hand like
papa's you run all your letters into one another
so that at last in some your
words there is not a single plain letter
ah my dear i can show you in that
very translation several 
possibly but then you make three
kinds rs and when i have learned to
know one them then comes the other
quite different and all your ws and ns
and us and vs are so alike no human
creature in a hurry can tell them asunder 
and you never cross your s so how can i
tell them from s
 but i do dot my fs said harry
yes you do but you never put the
dots over the right letter i can never guess
to what heads the hats belong and then
worse than all you half scratch out and
half write over and half turn one letter
into another and then repent and leave it
no letter at all but all this i could bear
if you did not make vulgar flourishes
oh lucy be just i have left off
flourishing you must acknowledge ever
since you told me it was vulgar i have
never flourished since that day
but that day was only last tuesday
said lucy
 i do not know whether it wa tuesday
or wednesday replied harry but i
know it was the day you read or could not
read my writing to mamma and i have
never flourished since
poor harry i beg your pardon for
reading your translation so badly said
lucy the next i well read better if i
can
 the next i will write better if i can
said harry let me look again how
does mrs frankland make her writing so
plain 
 and so pretty too said lucy tt
looks pretty because it is so even and
straight audit ig distinct because let
me see she always makes the same letters
the same way that is one good thing 
for then i know them aoain when i meet
with them and she leaves a little space
between her words so that we may see
they are separate words and she finishes
each letter and does not make her ms and
ais so very much alike that people cannot
tell the difference the little es too are a
little different from the zs
very little said harry if i hide
the other letters i defy you mrs lucy to
tell even mrs frankland's i from her e
but look at the difference harry thee
is a little open at top or at worst i
know the i by the dot over it look
the hat is always on the right head and i
know the head by the hat
a woman's way indeed knowing a
head said harry laughing
oh harry when you come to laughing
at women said lucy i know you
have nothing else to say
yes i have replied harry since
you are so fond reading mrs frankland's
writing here is a little bit more for
you here is a page in your which
you have not read
lucy took the but was disappointed
when she saw this page was only a catalogue
 the botanical names the flowers
and shrubs mentioned in the juvenile
gardener's calendar she did not know
the use she said calling flowers and
shrubs by latin names when they have
goodenough english names by which all
people may know them if they please she
confessed that the only thing she had not
liked in all that mrs frankland ever did or
said was her having that day in the garden
always told the latin names the
flowers after the english
 harry i know you think as i do that
you thought so at the time that made
me dislike it the more because i was afraid
you would think it was you know what
i know said harry and i did not
like it i own
we will ask mamma said lucy
they had been all this time talking to
one another on their own side the carriage
and their father and mother on theirs
were conversing on something perhaps as
interesting to themselves it was necessary
to wait for a pause at the first
which occurred the case was laid before
them lucy stating it with some hesitation
and ending by saying
am i wrong father to think it was
pedantic am i wrong mamma to say
any thing about it 
not at all wrong to speak your opinion
freely to us my dear said her mother
you would be foolish said her father
if you blamed without inquiring whether
you were right or wrong but you would
be wrong if you spoke to any stranger a
fault that you saw or thought you saw in
those who had been kind to you
you do not think it was pedantic then
mamma
no my dear i do not but before we
can understand one another we must settle
what we mean by pedantic what do you
mean 
lucy said she knew what she meant but
she could not exactly describe it she
turned to harry first he said that it was
talking greek or latin in the wrong place 
he added that it was trying to show that
we had any sort learning that other people
had not but this lucy thought was
rather vanity or ostentation than pedantry
they had heard people call things pedantic
which they did not think were so 
for instance a boy had once said that harry
himself was a pedant for talking the
siege syracuse and the machines used
there because the boy knew nothing about
them and disliked reading
then you perceive said his mother
that the meaning the word varies with
the different degrees knowledge those
who use it i remember when it was
thought pedantic for a woman to talk 
some books which are now the subject 
common conversation sometimes oldfashioned
learning and sometimes useless
learning is called pedantry and it is
generally thought pedantic to produce any
kind learning that is so unusual that it
is not likely that the company is acquainted
with it or can be pleased by it
in short pedantry may be said to be an
illtimed parade knowledge
vol ji g
to go back to mrs frankland mammas
said lucy she knew that we were
not acquainted with those latin names
yes but she did not consider you as
company she did not display her knowledge
to excite your admiration she used
those names in speaking to you because
she thought it might be useful to you to
learn them the knowledge the botanical
names plants is not now unusual 
most people we meet with are acquainted
with them
i did not know that said lucy and
now i recollect mamma when mrs frankland
was talking plants to the artificialflower
woman who did not seem to know
any thing about the matter she called them
only by their common english names 
therefore i am sure she told the latin
names to us because as you say she
thought it would be use to us if she
had wanted to be admired for her learning
she would have displayed it in company
so it is proved harry that she was not
pedantic and i am very glad it
but still said harry who did not seem
quite satisfied remember what mamma
said that useless learning is pedantry
then the question is whether this be
useless learning or not said hisfather
that is the very bottom the question
to which i want to get said harry
what is the use knowing all those long
latin names when people may know the
plants they are talking as well by
their own english names 
they may know them and describe
them as well to english people but not to
foreigners said his father most well
educated foreigners french spaniards
germans italians danes or swedes understand
latin therefore it is a sort universal
language in which botanists and
persons science can make themselves
understood by each other in all books 
botany the latin is given along with the
common name and then the description 
the plant to which this name refers can be
applied by people in different countries
g
i have a friend at paris who could not understand
what was meant by a cowslip because
in french there is no distinguishing
name for cowslip it goes under the
general word for primroses primeverej
 yet a cowslip and a primrose are very
different said lucy
but said her father if this french
lady had been acquainted with the botanic
name she would have known the difference
the moment it was mentioned and the deficiency
in the french vocabulary would
have been rectified i remember hearing
a french lady talking to a gentleman
about the beautiful laurier rose the
gentleman understood french but he happened
never to have seen a laurier rose
in france therefore he could not understand
what she meant she described it
but still he mistook it for a rhododendron 
at last somebody mentioned its botanic
name nerium oleander and the moment
the gentleman heard this latin name he
understood what was meant and he knew
it was the common oleander which he had
often seen in english greenhouses
harry now understood the use learning
the latin botanic names and he was
satisfied
remember my dear harry added
his mother that i mean no more than
that it is useful as a lanouaoe and as a
means acquiring knowledge
lucy said that she would learn by heart
all the botanic names the common
flowers in the garden calendar which
mrs frankland had been so kind as to
write in her pocketbook and she begged
harry to tell her whether many them
had any particular meaning like those two
which she had been told hindrance the
water lover or acanthus the beautiful
because she thought she could then learn
them more quickly by heart and remember
them better
harry said that he would if he could
but that he would rather do it at another
time he wanted to look at a broadwheeled
waggon which was coming down
the hill and while he watched the shape
and motion the wheels and asked his
father some questions concerning them
lucy was pitying the poor dog who
was chained underneath the waggon and
who as he waddled along apparently
half dragged by the neck looked very
mournful she was told that his use was
to guard the waggon and that his being
chained to it secured his always being near
it she wished very much that the man
could be persuaded to loose him a faithful
dog she thought would guard his master's
goods without being chained her mother
observed that it would be useless to talk
sentiment to an english waggoner lucy
wished that she had some money that she
might give it to buy this dog from his master
and set him free her mother told
her that even supposing she could buy this
dog the man would get another and this
dog would not perhaps be better ois as he
night not find anybody to feed him you
know my dear lucy we could not take
him with us what should we do for the
next dog we meet under the next waggon
lucy saw the impossibility freeing
them all and sighed her mother was glad
to see that she had such humane feelings
for animals but said there is much we
must bear to see in this life that we cannot
remedy all we can do is to take as good
care as possible those creatures which
we have the charge
lucy blushed i will take care not to
forget to give poor dash water when i have
him again mamma i recollect one day 
here she was interrupted by harry exclaiming
 father pray look out the
window this instant do you see that
streak black powder in the track the
waggon papa i saw it dribbling from a
barrel is it not gunpowder may i get
out and look
he spoke as fast as he could utter the
words and his father instantly called to
the waggoner stopped the carriage and
jumped out harry following him it was
gunpowder they ran after the waggoner
who either did not hear or would not stop
when they overtook him and showed him
the gunpowder running out the barrel
he being a sulky fellow was very angry
with the barrel and with the man who
packed it and with the man to whom
it was going and with every body but
himself he had no clear idea the
danger he had run till harry's father told
him that he had some years before known
a waggon to have been blown to pieces and
men and horses killed by just such an accident
some gunpowder had been shaken
out a barrel in the waggon and had
taken fire as it is supposed from a spark
struck from a flint in the road this communicating
with the gunpowder had blown
up the whole the waggoner scarcely
credited the story till he heard the name
 the hill down which the waggon had
been going and then as harry observed
without any further question he believed
it to be true so it is that ignorant people
believe or disbelieve without any reasonable
grounds they staid to see the
barrel well packed and safely stowed
some the passengers who were sitting
within the canvas roof the waggon and
who had looked out and listened now expressed
much gratitude and said they
mioht have lost their lives but for this
timely discovery danger the waggoner
then grew warmer in his thanks and as he
was repacking the barrel said in his 
tone to harry
 master you've done uz a mortal good
turn i finds and if zo be it was in my power
to give you a lift any ways fd not be
behind you'd zee but the likes i can
do little for the likes you gem'men
harry thanked him he wanted nothing
he said but he was glad that he and his
waggon were safe
 how well it was father said harry
as they walked back together to the carriage
 that i saw the gunpowder running
gout
and recollected what you had told me
about the blowing up the waggon
yes said his father you see how
useful it is to observe what passes before
your eyes and to recollect what you know
at the right time
when lucy heard what had passed
after rejoicing that waggon and waggoner
were safe she regretted that when the man
offered to do harry a good turn he had not
said a word for the dog
i forgot the dog cried harry father
will you stay for me three minutes
i will run and speak for the dog
his father smiled and back he ran
what he said or in what words the waggoner
replied we cannot tell for harry
never could remember either the words he
used or those said to him but the result
was as he informed lucy that the dog
lion was unchained that the waggoner
promised that lion should have liberty to
run after him by day and that he should
be chained only by night
lucy was proud her brother's share 
this affair and as was ever her custom when
she was happy she went on talking 
every thing she could think and all
that she saw upon the road while harry
according to his custom when he was well
pleased with himself and particularly happy
was quite silent after lucy had exhausted
every thing she could say she
perceived harry's silence
what are you thinking harry are
you still thinking lion and the waggoner
said she
 not i for there is nothing more to be
done about them said harry i am considering
what that very bright thing can be
which i see out yonder sparkling in the
sunshine
i see it said lucy it looks like a
monstrous diamond twinkling between
the trees what is it papa look at
it
her father thought it was the reflection
 light from some weathercock or polished
globe on the top a building as they
approached nearer they saw it was from
the glass roof a conservatory
reflection light said lucy what
do you mean papa by the reflection 
light and what is the difference between
reflection and refraction which i have
heard
her father answered when the rays
 light are thrown back from the surface
 any polished substance on which they
strike for instance from a polished piece
 metal or glass they are said to be
reflected when the rays pass through any
transparent body and in doing so are
turned from their direct course they are
said to be refracted and this light is called
infracted light
do you recollect lucy said harry
yesterday in the boat you observed that
the oar in the water looked as if it was
broken that was because you saw it
through the water mr frankland told
you that was the effect refraction
i remember said lucy that he told
me so and that i did not understand at the
time what he meant i was ashamed to ask
him more about it and afterwards i forgot
it but you harry can explain it to me
cannot you
indeed i cannot said harry
but papa will you be so good as to
make us understand it
my dear i cannot be so good as to
make you understand it yet till you have
more knowledge i am glad however
lucy that you observed the appearance 
the oar in the water and that you wish to
know the reason what you saw seemingly
slight observations this sort lead to
important discoveries
do they indeed papa said lucy
yes but often observations such as
these though they might lead to great discoveries
if pursued remain hundreds 
years useless because people do not try to
find out the reason what they have seen
as long ago as the time aristotle
which is above two thousand years among
other questions in his works on natural
history he asks why a stick appears
bent when it is held obliquely in water
this question was never rightly answered
till about four hundred years afterwards by
ptolemy the fame several great philosophers
among the moderns rests upon
their discoveries the rules or laws for
measuring that refraction light on which
the appearance the bent stick in water
depends and not till the time our
great newton was the whole satisfactorily
explained or all the knowledge obtained
to which it has led he by pursuing this
and other seemingly slight observations
and by trying experiments carefully to find
out the cause what he had observed made
his great discoveries those properties
and laws liorht which we call the laws
 reflection and refraction even from
considering the colours on a soap bubble
which many others had observed before
him but which they had made no use
he was led to some the most important
conclusions respecting vision and colours
but here all philosophical conversation
ceased interrupted by the sound the horn
 a mail coach harry and lucy quickly
darted their heads out the window 
for though oftentimes seen lucy never
willingly missed the passing a coach
stage or mail this was as harry guessed
the royal mail with its guard behind the
scarlet man with the gold laced hat blowing
the authoritative trumpet to clear the
road proud as a king on his throne
sat the manycaped manycravatted coachman
on his box with his four fine horses
even in hand who kept on in full trot
regardless the load behind the whip
idle in the master's hand except that once
he flung out the long lash with a light
touch to remind one careless horse that he
must draw fairly and to bring him into
true trotting time as they passed lucy
admired the horses much but the harness
more
nice said she and nicer than any
gentleman's harness bright brass rings
standing upon the horses foreheads with
twinkling mammals glittering in the sun
regardless the harness and the twinkling
mammals harry had eyes only for the
horses
what fine creatures and how they
go oh father look how they turn the
corner cried harry leaning out the
carriage to watch them till they were quite
out sight
the road for the rest this stage was
as lucy observed a stupid straight line
she could find nothing to do but to count
the carriages they met in the last five
miles her father told her that on the
bath road he had once met eleven stage
coaches in five miles but on this road
she met in five miles only one heavy
laden waggon and twelve coal carts
harry wondered that she continued still
looking out the window when there
was nothing to be seen but coal carts 
she said she had a reason for this and
he left her to take her own time to tell
it which did not happen this stage
harry do you remember that the
old gentleman told us last nioht said
lucy that we should be surprised before
this day's journey should be over
so he did said harry but i have
been so happy all day that i never
thought it till this minute
 i have been very happy too said
lucy but i have thought it sometimes
and now that dinner is over and
that evening is coming on it is time to
think about it i wonder harry what it
can be
lucy was standing in the parlour 
the inn where they had dined and she
looked all round the room and then out
 the window as she spoke
there is nothing surprising here i
am sure said she but i heard papa
order that the horses should not be put
to yet not for two hours what can bethe
reason that harry
we are to walk through some park
near this town i believe said harry
and the carriage is to meet us at the
farthest gate and we are to see some
house come come lucy papa is
calling to us to follow him
lucy followed with great alacrity certain
that they were now going to be surprised
but they walked up an avenue
 beech trees and reached the house
without meeting with any thing surprising
and lucy was disappointed when
she found that her father and mother
came to this house only to look at some
pictures neither harry nor lucy had
yet any taste for pictures and their mother
therefore advised them to divert
themselves by running about the pleasure
grounds which amusement they
were permitted to enjoy upon her answering
for them that they would not touch
any the flowers or shrubs first they
went through all the flower gardens then
through the park and by the river side and
up again through a wood on the banks till
the red light sunset which they saw on
the stems the trees warned them to return
from whence they came they were afraid
 being too late and keeping their father
and mother waiting but luckily they met
the woodranger going home from his
work and he showed them a path which
took them the shortest way to the house
instead being too late they found that
they need not have run so fast for their
father and mother had not yet finished
looking at the pictures
 let us sit down then and cool ourselves
quietly said lucy harry only
think papa and mamma having been all
this long time looking at pictures how
tired i should have been if i had been
standing all this while with my neck bent
back staring up at them harry do you
think that when we grow up and set out
upon our travels that we shall ever be so
fond pictures as to stand looking at
them so long 
perhaps we may said harry
though we do not care about them now
i remember some time ago i never
thought looking at prints except 
machines but ever since the day i saw
the prints in don quixote i have grown
fond them
yes and how happy we were together
said lucy looking over the prints
in pine's microcosm
true i forgot them said harry i
always liked those because they are so
like things and people we see everyday

and the prints in the arabian tales
said lucy though they are not like
things we see every day or any day or
that we can ever see in reality you like
those do not you harry 
 i do said harry some them
some them repeated lucy very
right so do i those that are like my ideas
 what the sultans and viziers and fatima
and their turbans and come hassan
might be but some others i do not
like such as aladdin's genius the lamp
and the african magician because they do
not come up to my imagination them
harry do describe to me your image 
the african magician
it was a difficult task and harry was
glad to be relieved from it by his father's
calling to him to desire he would see if
the carriage was come to the parkgate
it was there waiting and by the time they
got into it the sun was set and it was
growing dusk by the time that they
reached the the next stage and had
drank tea it was quite dark they were
however to go on another stage this night
lucy who did not much like travelling
in the dark observed as her mother was
getting into the carriage that the coach
lamps were not lighted
 never mind my dear said her father
 we shall have light enough soon
soon oh no papa begging your
pardon cried lucy there drill be no
moonlight these two hours i can show
you when the moon will rise by my new
pocketbook papa
very likely my dear said her father 
but lucy do not stand talking on the
step the carriage
at the moment when her father was
giving her this advice one the horses
was startled by a light and giving a sudden
jerk to the carriage lucy was thrown
from the step backward and must have
fallen under the wheel but that her father
caught her in his arms and set her
upright again into the carriage she
went directly and while yet trembling
with the fright her father repeated his
advice
while you live child never again
stand in that manner on the step a carriage
without holding by something i
assure you that you put yourself into much
greater danger at that moment than any
you are likely to meet with from the darkness
 this night
lucy hoped that her father did not think
that she was a coward and after some minutes
silent submission she expressed this
hope and began to defend her character for
courage by reminding harry all the instances
she could recollect her never
having been afraid in a carriage harry
said nothing i cannot see your face
harry i hope you are agreeing with
me
no i am laughing for i think you area
little afraid at this minute i feel you
squeezing close to me because we are
going down the hill
think and talk then something
else said her mother and do not tell
lucy she is a coward or you will make her
one lucy my dear there is no danger 
but if there were ever so much you cannot
alter it
 no mamma only i wish he would
not go quite so fast said lucy would
you speak to him 
 no t cannot teach the postillion to
drive can you lucy 
no indeed mamma said lucy
laughing or trying to laugh
 then we had better let him follow his
own business which he understands and
which we do not
very well mamma i know you are
right and that there is no danger now
we are down the hill i feel and it is allover
nicely but mamma suppose there
was danger and that the horses were
really what is called running away what
would you do 
 sit still the only thing which
would not increase my danger answered
her mother
 could not you get out mamma said
lucy
i could perhaps but i would not attempt
it because know it is the most hazardous
thing that could be done said her
mother
yes said lucy's father i believe
that more lives have been lost and more
limbs broken by persons attempting to get
out carriages when horses were running
than ever were lost by overturns
all who have had experience can tell you
that the best thing you can do is to stay
quietly in the carriage till the horses stop
or are stopped if you make any noise or
scream or call to the person who is driving
you endanger yourself more because you
distract his attention and you may be sure
that he is doing the best he can because
he is probably as fond his life as
you are yours and as to driving probably
his best is better than your best
certainly papa but if said lucy
and there she paused
 if what
i am not sure whether it is right to
say it papa but i have heard that coachmen
and postillions are sometimes drunk
vol h
and if he was drunk he would not know
how to drive
and do you think that his being
drunk would make you know how to
drive said her father
lucy laughed again because harry
laughed
but papa i should know better than
he did if he had lost all sense
 true but i would not advise you asa
little girl or even if you were a woman
i should not advise you to attempt to direct
or argue with a drunken man for
besides the danger his giving some rude
answer either the coachman would be
too drunk to understand any thing or he
would not as long as he could understand
any thing it is probable he would
understand what he habitually knows best
how to drive if he be so far intoxicated
as not to know how to do that he would be
still less able to comprehend your reasons or
directions supposing them to be ever so
good
a
very true said lucy she declared
that she never should think talking to a
drunken coachman or postillion but she
hoped that she never should be driven by
one
in which hope her mother joined her
lucy my dear said she vrhen i vias
young i was afraid in a carriage and i will
tell you how i was cured
how mamma
 i was cured my fear for myself by
a greater fear for another person i used
to be sent out airing with a lady who had
lost the use her limbs and i was so
much afraid for her that it took my attention
away from myself she was very
cowardly i was taken up in quieting her
apprehensions and i saw that nine times
in ten when she was alarmed there was no
cause for fear this encouraged me the
next time and so on besides the feeling
that if there were any danger i must act
for her was a motive to me to keep my
senses and presence mind
h 
as to that last said lucy i think
at least i fear that it would have had a
contrary effect upon me and that i should
have been ten times more afraid with the
helpless person in the carriage
no said harry i think i should
have felt as my mother did
 what stops us what is the matter
said lucy
matter nothing in the world my
dear said harry laughing only weare
stopping till the turnpike gate is opened
and till this old man with a lantern has
fumbled the key into the lock
lucy joined in his laugh and said afterwards
 laughing is very good for
curing people being afraid foolishly for
when you laugh harry i know that there
is no danger or you could not be so
merry and now it is very extraordinary
 but i am no more afraid than you
are harry i will prove it to you i will
think any thing you please i can cap
verses with you if you will
 no thank you not yet i do not know
enough to cap with you yet my dear the
little that i know is from shakspeare and
that is blank verse which will not do for
capping
but it will do for repeating said
lucy and i wish you would repeat some
 the quarrel brutus and cassias which
we read together
i will try said harry where shall
i begin
begin said lucy with brutus's
speech
what shall one us
that struck the foremost man all this world
but for supporting robbers shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes 
harry repeated this as if he liked it and
went on through all brutus's part the
quarrel he said he could not forget any
 this because he felt it he admired
brutus and lucy pitied cassius his mother
observed that he liked dramatic poetry
better than descriptive lucy however
thought some descriptive poetry was beautiful
and repeated to him the description 
queen mab and her chariot the hazelnut
made by the joiner squirrel time
out mind the fairies coachman this
harry liked well also some the fairies
in the midsummer night's dream
who light their tapers at the fiery
glowworms eyes and harry admired
ariel in the tempest whose business
it is 
to tread the ooze the salt deep 
to run upon the sharp wind the north 
to dive into the fire or ride on the curled clouds
or put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes
and he could conceive delicate ariel's
pleasure in killing the canker in the rosebuds
flying on the bat's back or lying in a
cowslip's bell but for pope's elegant ariel
and the fifty chosen nymphs special
note he cared but little he well knew
that his mother admired them but he was
too sturdily honest to affect admiration which
he did not feel he thought it was his fault
his mother told him that perhaps he would
like them hereafter and that in the meanwhile
he need not despair his own taste
for poetry
harry observed how much more easy he
found it to learn lines which he understood
than to get by heart lists names
he said that he recollected having read in
baron trenck's life that when the king 
prussia wanted to try trenck's memory he
gave him to learn by rote a list fifty
strange names soldiers in a regiment
trenck learned them quickly
i am glad said harry that i was
not in his place for his majesty would
have thought me quite a dunce and would
have decided that i had no memory it is
much more difficult to learn nonsense than
sense continued harry there is something
in sense to help one out
unless it be droll nonsense said
lucy but when it is droll the diversion
helps me to remember
harry doubted even this
their father said he would if they liked
it try the experiment by repeating for
them some sentences droll nonsense
which were put together by mr foote a
humorous writer for the purpose trying
the memory a man who boasted that
he could learn any thing by rote on once
hearing it
 oh do let us hear it cried lucy 
and try us
let us hear it said harry but
i am sure i shall not be able to learn
it
it will be no great loss if you do not
said his father
now lucy pray sit still and listen
said harry
but harry's power attention which
he had prepared himself to exert to the
utmost was set completely at defiance
when his father as fast as he could utter
the words repeated the following nonsense
abruptly beginning with 
 so she went into the garden to cut a cabbage
leaf to make an apple pie and at the same time a
great shebear coming up the street pops its head
into the shop what no soap so he died and
she very imprudently married the barber and there
were present the picninnies and the joblillies and
the garyulies and the grand panjandrum himself
with the little round button at top and they all
fell to playing the game catch as catch can
till the gunpowder ran out at the heels their
boots
gunpowder at the heels their boots 
horrible nonsense cried harry while
lucy rolling with laughter and laughing
the more at harry's indignation only
wished it was not dark that she might see
his face
well can either you remember or
repeat any this said their mother
lucy said that if it had not been for
the grand panjandrum she was almost sure
she should have been able to say it but
she was so much surprised by meeting the
grand panjandrum himself again and so
diverted by his little round button at top
that she could think nothing else 

sides laughing hindered her from hearing
the names all the company who were
present at the barber's marriage but she
perfectly well remembered the picking
 and she knew why she did because
their name was something like piccanini 
and this word had been fixed in her head
by a droll anecdote she had heard a
negro boy who when he was to tell his
master that mr gosling had called upon
him one morning and could not recollect
his name said he knew the gentleman was
a mr goosepiccanii
 so you see lucy said her father
that even with you who seem to be yourself
one the numerous family the piccannes
or the goosepiccaninies there is
always some connection ideas or sounds
which helps to fix even nonsense in the
memory
 papa will you be so very good as to
repeat it once more now harry once
more let us try
i would rather learn a greek verb
said harry there is some sense in that
papa could you repeat one 
 i could son but i will not now said
his father let your sister divert herself
with the grand panjandrum and do not
be too grand yourself harry it is sweet
to talk nonsense in season always sense
would make jack a dull boy
the grand panjandrum was repeated
once more and this time harry did his
best and remembered what she went into
the garden to cut for an apple pie and
he mastered the great shebear and the
no soap but for want knowing who
died he never got cleverly to the marriage
with the barber but lucy less troubled
concerning the nominative case went on
merrily and she very impatiently married
the barber but just as lucy was
triumphantly naming the company present
future commentators will observe that this als
lules to the ancient british adage
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
all play and no work makes jack a mere toy
and had got to the joblillies harry whose
attention was not so wholly absorbed as
to have no eves for outward nature exclaimed

father father look look out
 this window a fire a fire a terrible
fire it must be the whole sky yonder
red with it
terrible said lucy looking out
it must be a town on fire
father repeated harry much astonished
by his father's silence and composure
 do not you see it
 do said his father but it is not a
town on fire you will see what it is presently

a dead silence ensued and the grand
panjandrum was forgotten as though he
had never existed they drove on harry
stretching out one window and lucy
leaning out the other while her mother
held her fast lest the door should
open
harry what do you see i see fires
flames great sparks flying up against
the sky now i see i do see mamma
a house burning there there mamma
at a distance flames coming out at the
top 
 on my side i see flames coming out
 the ground said harry
lucy rushed tumbling over to her brother's
side the carriage bidding him lookout
at her house burning
 fires indeed the whole country is on
fire said lucy
 i suppose they are burning the grass
or a wood said harry endeavouring to
regain his wonted composure and to make
sense it but certainly there is a house
on fire father flames red as blood bursting
from the top 
and we are coming nearer and nearer
every instant cried lucy the road i see
is going through the middle these fires 
oh father mother will you call to the
man he must be going wrong
he is going quite right my dear said
her mother keep yourself quiet there is
no danger as you may see by our not
being alarmed for you or for ourselves
these words calmly pronounced tranquillized
lucy and harry determined to
wait the event and not utter another word
whatever he might see he was quite
certain by his father's composure that
there was no danger either for themselves
or for other people but this security left
his mind more at liberty to feel curiosity
and very curious he was to know what was
coming how it would and above all
how it would be accounted for
they were driving now along a raised
road with fires on each side them
flames seemed to burst from the ground at
intervals a few yards their deep
red colour and pointed shape appeared
against the dark night far and wide as the
eye could reach the fires near the road
made it as light as day
my father might well say we should
have light enough thought harry
i wonder the horses are not frightened
by the fires thought lucy she had been
for some time breathing short in dread
every instant that the horses would start
off the raised road and overturn the
carriage or plunge and throw the manor
set off full gallop when none 
these things came to pass and when
she saw the postillion so inconceivably
at his ease as to lean over and pat his
horses and then to take off his hat and
tighten the band and try it again and
again on his head till it fitted lucy began
to breathe more freely and she observed
how plainly they could see the man and
horses and the black shadow the carriage
upon the road
then exerting herself to find something
to say to show she was not afraid she
looked for the burning tower but it was
concealed by a turn in the road or it was
confounded with other distant flames
it is like the country the fireworshippers
in the arabian tales said she 
and there they are pointing to a group
 figures she saw by one the fires nearest
the road figures with pale faces like
spectres the light shining strongly on them
she could see the man's bare arms and
his shovel as he shovelled up the burning
mass and the boy standing by
and the woman with the child in her
arms quite like a picture i have seen
somewhere
but never anywhere said harry
did you see such a real sight as this
all those lone fires for miles round
bumino how or for what i cannot 


it is like the infernal regions is not
it harry said lucy
i never saw them said harry nor
any thing like this it is very wonderful
what can the fires be for signal fires 
no thought harry there are too many
and on flat ground
signal fires are always on hills are
not they father i see these fires near us
are from little heaps or hillocks earth 
but whether they were artificial or natural
made by men's hands or thrown up
by subterranean fires harry could not
divine he wished to find out he desired
not to be told and yet he almost despaired
 discovering
 father i have read in some 
travels fires that burst out the ground
 themselves and i have heard 
some lake pitch or some what do you
call it
 bitumen do you mean
the very thing i wanted father are
these fires that sort from bitumen ordo
they burst out the ground themselves

not exactly either said his father
but those are both good guesses
the fiery tower again brother cried
lucy they came near enough to it now
to see its dark form and even to hear the
roaring the fire the body flame undiminished
diminishing kept spouting
up from the top the black tower blown
to and fro by the wind nobody near or
heeding it when the road brought them
to the other side the tower they saw an
open red arch underneath which seemed
to be filled with a sloping bed fire
harry had often seen a limekiln burning
in the night it is a lime kiln i do
believe only a different shape from what
i have seen
no said his father but that is a
sensible guess
then it is a founder i have it now
i remember the picture in the encyclopaedia
it is a founder for melting iron or brass
now i begin to understand it all
and there are others the same sort
said lucy coming in view and what
is that black shadowy form moving up
and down regularly and continually like
the outline a steam engine 
like the great beam it is a steam
engine cried harry i see others
there they are going on all night long
working working working always doing
their duty by themselves and themselves
 how very 
sublime said lucy
his father told harry that he was quite
right in supposing that these were founders
as to the fires he said most 
them were low ridges coal which were
burning into coke for the use the forges
the process was very simple after the
coals were set on fire a man was employed
to cover them with ashes through
which the smoke could escape till they
were sufficiently burned coke he told
them gave out a more steady and intense
heat after the gas and smoke were driven
off some the fires he added might
perhaps proceed from the refuse small
coal which were known occasionally to ignite
spontaneously and were suffered to
burn as there w as no danger their doing
any mischief in this waste land
when this explanation was given lucy's
interest a little diminished with the mystery
 but harrv s increased when lie considered
the wonderful reality
 i shall like to see this country by daylight
said harry and to learn what
those numbers steam engines are doinof
that must be for tomorrow said his
father
when they visited the fiers moor bv daylight
they saw only a black dreamt waste
with half burning half smothering heaps 
dross coal and cinders clouds smoke
 all colours white yellow and black
from the chimneys founders and forces
darkening the air the prospect they could
not see for there was none it was a dead
flat the atmosphere laden with the smell 
coal and smoke the rass the heroes
the trees all blackened the hands and
faces expiry man woman and child they
met begrimed with soot the very sheep
blackened not a lamb even with a lock 
white wool or a clean face lucy said
that it was the most frightful country she
had ever beheld harry acknowledged
that there was nothing beautiful here to be
seen but it was wonderful it was a sort 
sublime he could not help feeling a great
respect for the place where steam engines
seemed to abound and in truth to have the
world almost to themselves these laboured
continually in vast and various
works blowing the huge bellows the
furnaces smelting houses forges and
founders raising tune water each minute
to drain the depths the coal mines
the strokes the beams the steam engines
were heard at regular intervals and
the sound the blast the furnaces at a
distance as they approached the founders
the noises grew louder and louder till
as they entered the buildings the roaring 
the draft was tremendous lucy involuntarily
holding her breath looked up to her
father she saw his lips move but she could
not hear what he said she held fast by
his hand and stood still she saw an immense
furnace full as she thought liquid
fire but it was redhot liquid metal one
man with brawny arms bare up to the
shoulders and a face shining with perspiration
was carrying this fiery liquid in a
large ladle another poured it out into
moulds sand some men with white
caps on their heads and pale firelighted
visages were hurrying to and fro carrying
in longhandled tongs masses redhot
metal others seen in the forge at a distance
were dragging out redhot bars
while two were standing with huge hammers
raised waiting the moment to give
their alternate blows lucy tried to make
harry understand that she thought the
men were like cyclops but she could not
make him hear the words in this place
it seemed in vain for human creatures to
attempt to make use their voices here
wind and fire the hammer the bellows the
machinery seemed to engross the privilege
 being heard the men went on
with their business in silence only making
signs when they wanted you to stand out
 the way
while they were seeing the founder
they were met by mr watson the master
 the works to whom harry's father had
a letter introduction he apologized
for not having been able to attend them
himself but now he said he was at
leisure for some hours he hospitably
invited them to his house which was at a
little distance there he introduced them
to his wife and sisters lucy and her
mother staid with these ladies while mr
watson took harry and his father to see
his colliery they were one by one to be
let down in a bucket into the shaft the
coal mine which was like a deep well
mr watson turning his eyes upon harry
asked his father if the boy would be afraid
to go down harry colouring highly
answered for himself no sir i am not
afraid to go wherever my father goes
his father went down first with one 
the colliers in the bucket it was let down
by the rope from a steam engine in a few
seconds harry lost sight him and soon
the bucket reappeared with only the collier
in it
now you may go down or not just as
you will said mr watson
i will go down said harry
then do not be in a hurry let me
put you into the bucket
he took him by the arm and lifted him
in and the collier bid him be quite still
and he was so the bucket was let down
and it grew darker and darker as they descended
till at last he could see only a little
speck at the opening at top like a star 
lipht he could but just distinguish the
mans hand and arm like a shadow as he
pushed against the sides the shaft to keep
the bucket from striking they landed safely
at the bottom where there was lamplight
and harry sprung out the bucket
with the assistance his father's hand
and he was very glad that he had had the
courage to go down as soon as mr watson
had descended and joined them
he took them through the galleries and
passages the coal mines and showed
harry where and how the men were at
work harry was surprised to see the
numbers workmen and carriages that
were conveying the coal and here he
had the pleasure seeing what he had
long wished for the manner in which a
steam engine was employed in pumping
out the water that collects in a mine before
steam engines had been brought into
general use the master told him that it
was the labour years to do what is now
perhaps done in a few days
his father stopped to look at a kind
 lamp which has been used for sometime
in lighting mines and which from
its peculiar construction is called the
safety lamp as it completely prevents
the fatal accidents that formerly occurred
from the explosion inflammable vapours
when ignited by the unprotected flame
 a candle harry wished to understand
it but his father told him he would
vol i
explain it to him at another opportunity
that they must not delay now for mr watson's
time was precious which mr watson
did not deny however he did not
hurry them he only spoke shortly passed
on quickly and called to the man at the
windlass to let down they were
drawn up in the same manner by which
they had descended and harry was glad
to see the daylight again though it dazzled
him and to feel the fresh air next they
saw the iron rail roads on which small
carts loaded with coal were easily pushed
along by one man sometimes by one child
guiding or following them and presently
they came to what mr watson called
the inclined plane harry saw two
roads railway placed beside each other
up and down a steep slope on one them
there were several empty coal carts linked
together and on the other a cart loaded
with coal which as it ran down the slope
dragged the empty carts up this was effected
by means a chain which was fastened
by one to the loaded cart and
by the other to the empty carts and which
passed round a large pulley at tee top the
slope or inclined plane so that the loaded
cart descending by its own weight on one
road made those on the other road ascend
 little man you may take a ride up
and down if you will said mr watson 
safe enough and i see you are no flincher
and not bred too daintily to sit in a coal
cart a slave to a coat or a jacket
harry jumped upon one the empty
carts
 throw him a truss that hay to
sit on there hold fast now for your life
keep an eye on him up with you
and up he went and from the top
looked down upon his father and for a
moment he felt afraid to go back again it
looked so steep a collier's boy who was
standing by grinning told him he went up
and down the same way ever so many times
a day and no harm never harry said to
himself if it does not hurt others why
should it hurt me and thus conquering
his fear by his reason he took his seat
and down he went 
father cried harry as soon as he
i 
had one leg out the cart i am glad
lucy was not with us she would have
been frightened out her wits at seeing
me coming down
look to yourself now and take your
other leg out the cart said mr watson
for we want the cart to go up again
it was lucky i drew my leg out the
way in time or i should have been thrown
out the cart along with that mountain 
coal said harry
yes people must take care their
own legs and arms in these places said
mr watson and in all places it is no
bad thing to do
bluff and rough as he was harry
liked mr watson who was very goodnatured
and whenever he had time to
think the boy pointed out what was
worth his seeing but once nearly threw
him into a ditch by swinging him too far
with one arm over a stile at the next
stile harry said
 i would rather get over by myself
sir if you please
do so if you can and i see that you
can so i need not trouble myself more
about you
it was dinner time when they reached
mr watson's house here they dined at
an earlier hour than harry and lucy were
used to but they were quite ready to eat
harry especially after all the exercise he
had taken the dinner was plentiful
though plain and there were creams and
sweet things in abundance for the master
loved them and his wife and sisters were
skilled in confectionary arts as soon as
the cloth was removed mr watson swallowed
a glass wine and pushing the
bottle to his guests rose from table saying
i must leave you now to take care 
yourselves i must go to my business
harry jumped up directly and followed
him to the door his mother called him
back saying she was afraid he would be
troublesome mr watson did not ask you
to go with him did he 
i did not think the boy said
mr watson looking back from the door
 i am going only to see my workmen paid
this saturday evening this would be no
diversion to you my boy would it
yes it would said harry if i should
not be troublesome he was going to say
but mr watson went on
follow then and welcome you will
not be any trouble to me i shall not think
 you more than if you were not with
me
so much the better thought harry who
liked to stand by and see and hear without
any body's minding him mr watson
hastily swinging round his great coat as he
spoke flung the flaps into harry's eyes
but harry not minding that ran after him 
mr watson strode across the court yard and
up the office stairs three steps at a time
the room was full men who made way
directly for their master but the crowd
closed again before harry could pass
however he squeezed in under the elbows
 the great men till he got to a corner
beside the desk the clerk who was sitting
with a great open and a bag 
money before him harry knew he was
not to interrupt so he asked no questions
but got up on a tall mushroomtopped leather
stool which stood beside the clerks
seat and watched all that went on he
was amused with the countenances the
men who each in turn came to the desk
he observed that mr watson was in the
first place very exact to see that they were
rightly paid once when there was some
difficulty with a deaf stupid old man
about the balance his account he
looked into the books himself to see whether
the old man or the clerk was right 
and harry looking and listening tried to
learn what was meant by this balance 
account mr watson was better than his
word for he found time between the going
away one class workmen and the
coming another to explain it to harry
whom he saw poring over the clerk's
shoulder and who once ventured to saw
where is the balance that he is talking
af
look here the whole mystery is this
look at the top these pages and all
the pages in the d and c that
is debtor and creditor debtor on the
left hand page creditor on the right
hand page all that this man owes to me
is put on the debtor or left hand side 
the all that is due to him is to be
put on the creditor or right hand side
then add together all the sums that belong
to the debtor side and all the sums
that belong to the creditor side and see
which is the heaviest or largest and deduct
the least or lightest sum from it the
difference whatever it may be is called
the balance you may consider an account
as a pair scales and the surat
put on either side as weights the
two sides are at last to be made to
balance each other as the weights in the
opposite scales now for example look
here at john smith's account debtor
side two pounds creditor side four
pounds eight shillings you my boy may
make out what the balance is which i
am to pay him write your answer down
when you know it but take your head
out my way i must go on with my
business
harry wrote his answer with a pencil
and put it on the desk before mr watson
but it was long before it was seen or
thought 
two pounds eight shillings is the balance
due to john smith
right said mr watson the same
method is observed in keeping all accounts 
the money paid by the person who keeps
the account is put on the debtor side and
the money received by him on the creditor
side
is that all said harry
 all in simple accounts said mr watson
but bookkeeping though on the same
principle is much more complicated
harry was interested in listening to what
was said to the people mr watson inquired
how they were going on at home
and they told him all about their wants
and their hopes and their fears
several the workmen left part 
their money in his hands to be put into
the savings bank harry understood
i 
that by so doing the men obtained a provision
for the time when they might be
sick or must grow old there was one
slovenly man in rags illpatched when
he came up to be paid mr watson
looked displeased and said what a
shame giles to see you in such rags
when you earn so much if you would
put less your money into your cup
you would have more on your back
harry understood what he meant the
ragged man walked away ashamed while
his companions laughed at him mr watson
was steady as well as goodnatured
to the people the industrious and frugal
he encouraged the idle and drunken he
reproved and he took pains to see that
justice was done to them all
while harry had been seeing these
workmen paid and learning what is
meant by the balance an account
lucy had been learning something
equally interesting to her concerning
sugar plums and sugarcandy one 
mr watson's sisters was well informed
both in the practice and theory confectionary
as soon as harry came in
lucy ran to him to tell him what she
was intent upon and he was obliged
for the present to keep his debtor and
creditor accounts to himself 
 harry my dear you know those
little tiny sugarplums which are no
larger than the head a minnikin pin
 i think i know the sugarplums you
mean said harry but i do not know
a minnikin pin nor the size its head
then never mind said lucy i
forgot that you being a man could not
know minnikin pins as well as i do but
as to the sugarplums you saw some this
very day at dinner on the top the trifle
 i remember said harry well
 well my dear harry you can have
no idea what hard work it is to make
those little comfits miss watson was
telling me how she made qinofer swear 
and afterwards i asked her if she could
tell me or show me how those little
sugarplums are made she said that
she could not show me for that she
could not make them herself not being
able to bear the heat in which they
must be made she told me that the
pan in which they are boiled must beset
over a great fire and that the sugar
 which they are made must be stirred
continually in that heat a man with a
longhandled shovel keeps stirring stirring
stirring and sometimes strong men
faint in doing this
harry wondered that some way stirring
the sugar in these pans by machinery
jiad not been contrived and he was going
to question lucy farther upon the
subject but she was in a great hurry to
go on to sugar candy
 harry do you know how sugarcandy
is made i will tell you for i
have just learned when sugar is dissolved
it is poured into pots across
which sometimes thin rods and sometimes
threads at a little distance from
each other are stretched these moulds
and the liquid sugar in them must all
be covered up and kept in a great
heat for a certain time and nobody must
disturb them they are placed in a
room which is one great stove care is
taken that no wind should be admitted
for they say that the least disturbance
spoils the whole and prevents the sugar
from forming into those regularshaped
crystals which you have seen in sugarcandy
if the vessels are not disturbed
they form on the little rods i mentioned
to you or on the strings i dare say you
remember often finding strings in sugarcandy
 and now we understand the use 
them
 but what do you mean by crystals
said harry will you explain
i remember i once thought said
lucy that crystals meant only bits 
that white substance which looks like
glass but miss watson has explained
to me that there are crystals various
sorts and substances sugar for instance
and sugarcandy and i do not know
how many kinds salts in short all
substances that can be crystallised those
were her words as well as i can remember

very likely said harry but still
i do not know exactly what is meant by
what you call crystallising
turning into crystals said lucy
what more would you have here is
what they call a crystal sugarcandy
here are its regular sides crystals you
know have always regular sides and a
regular number them look at it and
touch it and taste it if you will
harry looked and touched and tasted 
but still not quite satisfied he said i
want to know what difference there is
in things before and after what you call
crystallisation
the difference in this tji'mg is very
plain said lucy before it was crystallised
it was syrup that is sugar and
water and now you see it has become
solid
 very well so far i understand said
harry but how or why do fluids crystallise

lucy did not know she confessed and
was well satisfied to let the matter rest
there for the present some time afterwards
she took notice an ornament on
the chimneypiece a small basket which
looked as if it were composed crystals
 glass or white spar
miss watson told her that it was not
made either glass or spar i made
it said she
you made it how could you make
it said lucy and what is it
made it looks something like white
sugar candy perhaps it is made in the
same way perhaps it is a sort sugarcandy

 the taste would soon decide that
said harry may i just try the experiment
with the tip my tongue
miss watson gave him leave to taste
it but she warned him that he might perhaps
not like the taste
 then i guess what it is said harry
after having applied the tip his tongue
to one the crystals he added by the
taste i am sure it is alum
it was alum lucy had seen large
pieces alum but none large enough
to be hollowed out into a basket such
a size and it would have been difficult
to have carved it into such regular shapes
she recurred to her first idea the resemblance
to sugarcandy and she continued
to think that it was made by the same
means miss watson told her that she
was so far right in her guess that it was
made in the same manner as sugarcandy
that is by crystallisation she showed
her the whole process which is very simple
in the first place she put some
water into an earthen pipkin with as much
alum as could be dissolved in that quantity
 water she boiled it till the alum
was dissolved by these means she told
lucy that she had obtained a saturated
solution alum that is that as much 
the alum had been dissolved as the water
could hold then miss watson took a
little wicker basket and suspended it
by its handle on a stick laid across the
mouth the pipkin so that the basket
handle and all were totally immersed in
the dissolved alum the basket did not
touch the bottom the pipkin as it was
very light it would not have sunk in the
water had not a little weight been put
into it the whole was then covered with
a coarse cotton cloth and put aside in a
cool place where it was not likely to be
disturbed she advised lucy to let it
alone during a day and night to give
time for the crystallisation to go on slowly
so as to form perfect crystals which can
be obtained only by the slow and regular
evaporation the water
there still seemed to be some difficulty
in lucy's mind after she had heard this
and looking at harry she said
i know what you are thinking 
harry and i am thinking the same
thing that i wish i knew exactly what
is meant by crxjstallisationr
 that was what i was thinking said
harry and i was wishing that i could
get at a which we have at home in
which i know that there is an explanation
 it
miss watson asked if the was
conversations on chemistry
the very how quickly you
guessed it and you have it how very
lucky said lucy as miss watson took
the from her bookcase she found
for harry the passage that he wanted it
begins with emily's saying
 i do not quite understand the meaning
 the word crifstall'isatlon t
 that is exactly what i felt said
harry
 and what i ought to have felt said
lucy but i really did not know that
i did not understand it till you asked me
to explain it harry now let us read
on
after readings a few lines she came to
conversations on chemistry vol i p 
eighth edition
the word caloric and asked if caloric
meant the same as heat
not exactly miss watson said in
this the difference is defined
she turned to another part the 
and showed lucy the passage vhieh drfines
the difference between heat and caloric
 the subject was new to lucy
and almost at every lineije wanted explanations
she stopped and whispered to
harry that she was not sure she knew
what was meant by the integral arts 
a body miss watson turned to the beginnings
 the volume and showed her a
perfect clear explanation integral
parts f
how well you know all this i said
lucy you know where to find everything
in this 
miss watson said that was not surprising
for that she had read it more than
once
conversations on chemistry vol i p 
eighth edition
t ibid p 
the first time you read it did you find
it difficult said lucy
no she said she had not found it difficult
but very easy and clear
ah because you did not read it till
you were grown up i suppose said lucy
miss watson said that she did not think
this was the reason as she had seen readers
not older than lucy understand it perfectly
well
it is very odd then said lucy
that i am obliged to stop you see two
or three times before i have read a single
page to ask the meaning the words
because you have begun in the
middle you have not read the from
the beginning said miss watson or
else you would have found all the terms
explained as you went on
but even so i am afraid i should
have forgotten them said lucy sighing
you must have a very good memory to
remember them all
miss watson said that besides having
read the from the beginning she had
often looked back to the definitions the
words and to the explanations whenever
she found herself not clear as to what was
meant
the conversation afterwards turned upon
different subjects in which lucy had no
concern therefore she followed harry
who took the conversations on chemistry
to a comfortable nook in the room where
he could be quiet and after his slow but
sure manner he made himself understand
thoroughly what he was reading lucy
read more quickly and when her mother
and miss watson were passing by them
she caught hold the skirt her mother's
gown and said
i understand this passage about crystallisation
now mamma i think it is very
clear
 i do not in the least doubt that it
is very clear my dear said her mother
but are you very clear 
 here mamma if you will just look at
the at this passage mamma which
begins crystallisation is simply 
 i do not want to read it my dear
said her mother or to hear you read it
bit tell me the sense it in your own
words
but mamma though i do understand
its said lucy you know it is impossible
that i could put it in such good words
 i am well aware that lucy said
her mother but explain it in any words
that will express what you mean then
you will be certain what you know ordo
not know
well mamma in the first place suppose
a body that is a substance 
what kind a body what kind 
a substance said her mother
 it must be a fluid said lucy yes
mamma before it can be crystallised it
must be a fluid therefore begin by supposing
a fluid no i believe that first 
all before it becomes fluid the body should
be a solid hey harry which shall i
tell mamma to suppose a fluid or a
solid
settle it for yourself lucy my dear
said her mother it cannot depend upon
what harry thinks but upon what really is
the fact
i recollect it all now mamma said
lucy after a short pause and i will begin
again with a solid body mamma suppose
a solid body sugar for instance or
alum mamma is dissolved either by
heat or by water and suppose that none
 its original parts that is the parts 
which it was originally composed are
lost by being dissolved but only separated
as it were by the water or by the
heat by which they are dissolved then
mamma if you could again take away the
heat or the water the original parts the
substance the alum for instance would
come together again and adhere when
what separated them is gone this is
crystallisation you may take away the
heat by cooling it and then the first parts
come together again in a solid form or
you may evaporate the water which separated
the parts by heat and then they
will come together again crystallised
whatever way you do it whether by heat
or cold if it is not disturbed but allowed
to go into its regular forms it is called
crystallisation
 you have laboured through your explanation
lucy tolerably well said her
mother
but there is one other thing more you
should say lucy said harry
 say it for me said lucy
 that different substances form into
crystals different shapes crystals 
substances different sorts as i have just
been learning continued harry have
always a certain regular number sides 
so that when you see the crystal after
counting the sides you can tell what
it is composed or you can tell beforehand
the number sides and the shape 
the crystals that will be formed from any
known salt or substance which you have
dissolved and left to crystallise
for instance alum cried lucy the
alum which was dissolved in the hot water
and which miss watson has left there to
crystallise we know will be in the same
shaped crystals as these in this first
basket i will count and tell you the
number sides
harry said he thought that miss watson
could if she pleased tell the number 
sides without counting them and so she
did
 how difficult it must be said lucy
to get by heart and to keep in the memory
the number sides which belong to
all the different kinds crystals 
you need not do that said miss
watson lists them are to be found
in many books to which you can refer
when you want them
but you knew alum without looking
at any said lucy
yes because i had been accustomed
to see its crystals said miss watson
as i told you before many the facts
in chemistry or mineralogy which it would
be difficult to remember separately or
merely from having read or heard an acvol
 k
count them are easily fixed in the
mind by trying experiments and by connecting
those facts with others
miss watson told lucy that she had become
particularly fond this study because
her father was a chemist and she
had often been in his laboratory while he
was at work unless i had seen the
actual things i should not have remembered
the descriptions them i am sure
said she and besides i was so much
interested in my father's experiments and
so curious to know whether they would
turn out as he had previously expected
that the whole was fixed in my memory
unless i had had somebody with whose
pursuits i could sympathise and in whose
discoveries i felt an interest i should
soon have forgotten even the little i had
learned
 but does not it make you happy
lucy asked
are you or are you not happier than
if you had not this pursuit said harry
miss watson smiled at the earnestness
with which they questioned her and answered
that she thought she was much
happier for having this taste and this occupation
she said it never prevented her
from doing other things which were more
necessary to this her brother added his
testimony
her beinsr something a chemist has
not spoiled her hand for being a good confectioner
said he on the contrary it
has improved it for she knows the reasons
for what she is doing all confectioners
and cooks must be chemists for so much
but they do not know the reasons why
they succeed one time and fail another
with them it is all knack and haphazard
or what we call iwactke at best now
continued mr watson here is an old
receipt which belonged to the greatgrandmother
 a noble family famous in
her day no doubt for her cakes and puddings
and confectionaries and cures
for all manner sprains and aches and
k 
bruises look at any these and you will
see what nonsense half them are how
many useless ingredients are put into the
receipt either on purpose to puzzle other
people or from ignorance and a sort superstitious
belief that there was a viistoy
in doing these things
harry and lucy amused themselves by
looking at some these old receipts
which however were hard to decipher
the ink being yellow and the spelling old
and incorrect
the next day was sunday harry and
lucy went with their father and mother
and mr watson and his family to church
the church was in the village near the
house as they were walking home mr
watson asked if they would like to see
some the houses in the village where
his workmen lived and the cottages in the
neighbourhood harry and lucy were
glad to take this walk and harry kept
close to mr watson wherever he went
in one cottage the master the house
a great fat man was sitting at his dinner
hot roasted duck and cauliflowers were on
the table before him while his wife a
pale starvedlooking soul was standing
behind his chair waiting upon him and
his children were huddled together in a
corner at a distance he never let any
 them eat with him he laid down his
knife and fork as the company came in
trying as much as he could to soften his
sulky look mr watson spoke kindly to his
wife and children but took no notice 
the man as he went out the house he
said loud enough for him to hear
 i should have no appetite for my roast
duck if i were forced to eat it by myself
without my good wife to take a share
lucy wondered that mr watson did not
insist upon the husband's letting the wife
and the poor children sit down with him
but mr watson replied that he had no
right to do this every man had liberty to
do as he pleased in his own house and in
his own affairs he could not interfere
between man and wife farther than he had
done by laughing at the surly husband
and shaming him before company he
said he had known this man buy for his
own eating the first green peas the season
when they were expensive rarities 
even when his children had not clothes to
cover them
the selfish creature said lucy
 the brute said harry
in the evening as they were walking in a
pretty lane near mr watson's house they
met a man who was endeavouring to come
up the lane but he could not by any
efforts he could make walk in a straight
line he was so much intoxicated that he
scarcely knew what he was doing when
he met mr watson he started stammered
tried to take ojqfhis hat and to stand out 
the way but he could not accomplish it
lucy was very much shocked mr watson
called at his clerk's house and ordered
that this man john giles should be struck
ois the list workmen and should not be
admitted to the founder for the next
week and that markham who was a sober
fellow should come m his place
harry thought this was very right till
some time afterwards when the drunken
man's wife came to mr watson to beg him
to pardon her husband and to readmit him
to the work she said that if he did not
she and her children must suffer for it
that her husband would beat her and only
drink the more if he was vexed the
tears rolled down her face as she finished
speaking harry wondered how mr watson
could refuse her for it was not her
fault that her husband was drunken
at night when harry was in his father's
room he talked to him about this
and asked whether he thought mr watson
was right or wrong right his father
said he did not think his refusal was hardhearted
but steady because it was his
duty to do what was just for a great number
 people as well as for this one man
if he were to employ a drunken workman
in preference to a sober man this would
encourage the drunken and be unjust to the
sober
 i would not encourage the drunken
and idle upon any account said harry
i thought mr watson was quite right at
first in ordering that he should not be admitted
to the works for a week but
might not mr watson have forgiven him
for the sake the woman 
then any other workman might drink
and might hope that his wife would beg
him off and obtain his pardon said
harry's father
father said harry after a long silence
and looking very serious i thought
that a great mechanic was only a person
who invented machines and kept them
going to earn money and to make things
cheaply but now i perceive that there is
a great deal more to be done and if ever i
grow up to be a man and have to manage
any great works i hope i shall be as good
to my workmen as mr watson is i will
be as just and steady too if lean but
father i see it is not so very easy to be
just as i should have thought it was
there is a great deal to be considered as
i find from all you say about forgiving or
not forgiving the drunken man for his
wife's sake i feel that i have much more
than i knew before to learn
 harry i wish you would go to bed
and to sleep said his mother for i am
sure you must be tired after all you have
seen and heard and thought this day
not in the least mother i never was
wider awake said harry however
i will go to bed to please you
our travellers were to set out before
breakfast and very early in the morning
the family promised that they would not
get up to see them off lest they should delay
them on their journey lucy did not
forget to inquire for the alum basket when
she wished miss watson good night and
goodbye
if it has succeeded you will see it in
k
the hall as you pass through in the morning
said miss watson but yesterday
one the servants shook the vessel containing
it and by that means prevented
the crystals from forming rightly i was
forced to begin the whole operation again
this time i locked the door to secure its
being undisturbed
as soon as she was dressed in the morning
lucy ran down to the hall to see whether
the basket was there and there it
was standing beside her bonnet the
wicker skeleton was no longer visible 
every part it handle and all being
covered with crystals alum apparently
perfectly formed she did not however
stay to examine exactly or to count their
sides which is always a tedious business 
but seeing a note directed to herself tied
to the handle she tore it open immediately
it told her that this basket was hers if she
liked it
if to be sure i do said she
miss watson suggested that if lucy
should ever attempt to make such a one
she might put into the solution alum a
little gamboge which would give to the
crystals a pretty yellow tint or she might
mix with it any other colour she preferred

within the basket nicely placed lucy
found several little paper cornucopias
filled with sugarplums and rose and
lemon and barberry drops with receipts
for making each written within the
papers in which they were contained
she was so much delighted with her
cornucopias and their sweet contents
and with the pretty crystallised alum
basket and with the goodnatured maker
and giver these good things that she
could think nothing else during the
first hour the morning's journey
now mamma will you taste the barberry
drops excellent are not they and
the lemon better still oh mamma cannot
you taste any more here are seven
other kinds
before breakfast it was impossible to
taste all the seven even to oblige lucy
and in honour miss watson but
harry was an indefatigable taster he
went on without resistance but without
giving what lucy deemed sufficient tribute
 praise to each at last when
much urged by the repetition is not
it excellent harry
he confessed that the tastes different
drops were now all so mixed in his
mouth that he could not tell one from
the other lucy shut up her cornucopias
and reserved her plenty for time need
but mamma said she when all
these are gone now that i have the
receipts i can make the same whenever i
please
it is not quite certain her mother
said that because you have the receipts
you can make others equally good whenever
you please
piqued a little by this observation and
by a smile harry's lucy began to form
various schemes trying experiments in
making rose and barberry drops and
sweetmeats like those which she had
tasted miss watson's and which everybody
had liked she enumerated such
numbers things which she intended to
make that harry at last laughed and
said
my dear you will then turn cook and
confectioner quite and forget every thing
else
her mother observed that it was useful
to know how these things should be done 
but that the propriety making or not
making them ourselves depends upon the
circumstances in which we are placed
and on our rank life those who have
servants that can make them would act
foolishly in wasting on such work their own
time which they may employ more advan
dangerously miss watson who perhaps
had no servants that could make these
things did wisely and kindly in making
them herself for her friends who like
them and it was particularly obliging
and amiable her to condescend to do
so because she has other pursuits and a
cultivated understanding lucy's mother
told her that if she persevered in her wish
to learn how these things were made she
should at the proper season the year
see and assist the housekeeper in making
sweetmeats this satisfied her and she
was at leisure to listen to harry who
for his part was anxious to become a
chemist and who had been struck with
the idea the happiness the person
who possessed a laboratory and could try
chemical experiments his father told
him that it was not necessary to have a
laboratory and a great apparatus for this
purpose as one the most ingenious
and successful chemists and philosophers
has observed many most useful
and excellent experiments can be tried
in an easy and simple manner
here his father was interrupted by an
exclamation from lucy at the sight a
tall finger post on one the arms 
which she observed to birmingham
harry and lucy anxiously watched to
see whether the driver turned down this
road as they had both an ardent desire to
go to birmingham to see some the manufactures
 which they had heard most
interesting accounts lucy's astonishment
had been excited by some scissors which
mr frankland had shoti her which she
had tried and which though not the
most beautiful polish cut sufficiently well
for all common purposes and yet oh wonderful
 mr frankland told her that this
pair was one a dozen which he had
bought for one shilling 
harry's curiosity had been raised by
hearing a knife with five hundred blades
which he had been told was to be seen at
birmingham
the knife came first to his recollection
an instant afterwards however he said
but there are things there a thousand
times better worth seeing than that

 oh father cried he turning to his
father i hope we shall go to birmingham
that we may see the grand works
at soho mr bolton's i read an account
 them while we were at mr
frankland's in one the notes to that
botanic garden when you were looking
for the bartering vase lucy it said
that there is a magnificent apparatus for
coining all worked by one steam engine
which cuts halfpence out sheets 
copper and at one stroke stamps both the
faces and edge the money
yes i remember your reading it tome
said lucy and it was said that
four boys ten or twelve years old no
bigger mamma than harry could by the
help this machinery worked by that
great giant enchanter the steam engine
make how many guineas do you think
in one hour thirty thousand mamma
was not it harry
 yes thirty thousand repeated
harry and besides this it is said
that the machine keeps an exact account

an unerring account was the very
word said lucy it keeps an unerring
account all the money it coins papa
i do hope you are going to birmingham
oh mamma i hope we shall see all that
was described in those lines do you recollect
 i hope we may see
 hard dies steel the cupreous circles cramp
and with quick fall the massy hammers stamp
her father told her that he believed
that these massy hammers are no longer
at work at soho but that a far more magnificent
apparatus for coining is now
established at the mint in london he
hoped he said to show them all these
wonders mechanism which they had
read in prose and poetry at some future
time for the present however he must
disappoint them he could not go to
birmingham he must pursue the road
to bristol even on their account he
added addressing himself to their mother
he did not choose now to go to
birmingham the general principles 
a few great inventions he hoped had
been clearly understood and fixed in their
minds by what they had already seen
he was glad to find that they had taken
pleasure in following the history the
progress and consequences those noble
discoveries he would therefore take care
not to confuse their minds by showing
them the details small ingenious
contrivances in the birmingham workshops
and manufactories or by dazzling
their eyes with the sight more
than arabian tale magnificence in the
show rooms the great toyshop 
europe
harry and lucy had not been so much
spoiled by their father's and mother's indulgence
that they could not bear disappointment
one sigh lucy was heard
to give for the great toyshop europe
harry suppressed his rising sigh for since
the steam engine coiner was not to be seen
he cared little for the rest they both
agreed that papa knew best
and this was not with them a mere
phrase said with a look hypocrisy but
with honest faces and hearts and firm
belief from experience the truth 
what they said
what is the name the town to which
we are to come next mamma said lucy
bridgenorth my dear
bridgenorth repeated lucy i am
sure there is something i have heard about
bridgenorth but i cannot remember what
it is
i know what it is i believe said
harry a famous leaning tower
 yes said lucy that is the very
thing i recollect reading about it in
my history england which said that
this tower bridgenorth was not always

leaning formerly a great while ago it
was upright and like any other tower but
it was shaken from the foundation when
it was bombarded during some siege
in the time the civil wars was not it
mamma i read it to you and it has
hung over in the same leaning state ever
since looking as if it would fall and yet
not falling i am glad we are to pass
through bridgenorth that we may see it
with our own eyes
 yes i shall like very much to see it
said harry
their father desired the postillion to
drive slowly when he came into the town
and harry and lucy's heads were first out
 one window and then out the other
eager for the first sight the hanging
tower
there it is cried harry
 red brick said lucy i see it
i had fancied that it was grey old stone
i expected to see a fine venerable ivy mantled
tower
 i cannot help it said harry but
my dear take your head out my way
for i cannot see what i want to see
there you may have it all to yourself
my dear harry said lucy i think it
is very ugly
 nobody ever said it was pretty did
they said harry but it is a curious
thin 
 not nearly so curious as i expected
said lucy not nearly so dangerous
looking as i fancied it must be i had
hoped that it would quite take away my
breath to look at it and that we could not
drive by without fearing that it would fall
upon our heads
harry had no such fears or hopes because
he recollected distinctly having read
an account it he knew that at pisa
there is a tower which overhangs feet
much more than this bridgenorth his
father asked him if he could tell why these
sloping towers continue to stand what
prevents them from falling harry do you
know
harry said he believed he knew because
he had read in scientific dialogues
an account them and an explanation 
the principle on which they stand
 know you did said his father and
you understood it at the time you read
it but let me see if you understand it
now
 father it is very difficult to express it
in words as lucy says but if i had my
little bricks i could easily show the thing
to you
yes said lucy very often we
built towers which leaned over and yet
stood and we used to try how much we
could venture to make them overhang
vrithout their falling i recollect that perfectly
though i do not know the reason
why they did not fall
if i had the little bricks i could show
and explain it said harry
but as you have them not and as you
cannot always carry a hod little bricks
about with you harry said his father
 try what you can do to explain yourself
by words those you may always have at
command
may i wish i had said harry
begin harry by thinking what you
wish to express till you are quite clear that
you know what you mean and depend
upon it you will then easily find words
said his father people often imagine
that their difficulty is in finding words
when the real difficulty is in having clear
ideas things
then you must if you please father
give me time said harry
as much time as you please said his
father and that i may not hurry you i
will go on reading this 
thank you father said lucy for
harry
harry looked back at the hanging tower
which was yet in view and after he had
thought till he was clear what he meant
to say without considering about the words
which came when he began to speak he
went on fluently after the first word father
had made his father look up and lay
aside his 
suppose that a plumbline was let
down from the centre gravity the
whole mass that leaning tower the
bob the plumbline would fall within
the base or foundations the plumbline
could not hang outside the base or else
the tower must tumble down as long as
the centre gravity is supported any part
may lean over or may hang out the perpendicular
line and yet provided the materials
stick together the tower will not fall
i think i understand that said lucy
 but i am not quite clear
if you do not understand what is
meant by the centre gravity said her
father you cannot be quite clear indeed
you cannot comprehend it at all
lucy said she remembered seeing harry
when he was a little boy standing upon
her father's knees and leaning his body so
much to one side that she was afraid he
must have fallen and papa you then
explained to me how far he might have
leaned over without any risk tumbling
down you also told me something about
the centre gravity but that i do not recollect
exactly
and course i cannot remember it at
all said harry but my father has often
shown us that the motions our tumbler
toy depended on the situation the
centre gravity by the bye there is
a way finding out where the centre
 gravity is in a body or figure any
shape
is there said lucy i do not remember
papa's showing us that how did
you learn it and if it is not very difficult
can you teach it to me who taught
it to you
a said harry my own good
scientific dialogues and if i had buta
bit card and a bit thread and a
pin and a pencil and if we were not in
the carriage i think i could show it to
you now
vol l
but as all these ifs stood in the way
the matter was put off for the present and
like many good things that are put oifwas
forgotten nor can we much wonder that
this was driven from the recollection even
 the philosophic harry by the bustle he
saw in the next town through which they
passed it happened that there was a
otcat fair in this town and it was filled
with such crowds people and so many
stalls and booths covered with canvas
lined the streets that it at first seemed impossible
that way for their carriage and
horses could be made through them without
trampling on some the people or
overturning some the tents the postillion
stopped and called civilly to the people
to make way red cloaks and greatcoats
yielded on each side and those in
front got from under the horses noses as
they advanced step by step lucy had
let down the glasses and was looking outwith
great interest not unmixed with apprehension
and listening to the 
universal hubbub wild
 stunning sounds and voices all confused
and as little by little the carriage made
its way through the dense multitude she
saw many hairbreadth escapes which made
her shrink and cry oh and ah 
many a time for those who were all unheedful
 their danger in the ardour 
bargaining the pleasure gossiping the
vehemence scolding the stupidity 
staring or the anxiety maternal affection
here was seen a mother crossing before
the very pole the carriage which nearly
ran into her ear in so much haste was
she to snatch out the way two children
standing unconscious the one with
an apple the other with a whistle in his
mouth and close to the wheel the
carriage at one time there was a young
with pink cheeks bargaining so
earnestly for a pink ribbon with an old
woman in her booth that the wheel must
as lucy thought have gone over her outstretched
foot but that just in time looking
l 
up she drew it in and still holding the
dear ribbon in her hand continued her
bargaining next there was a group 
old women leaning on their sticks with
their bonnets close to each other telling
and listening to something so eagerly that
they never heard the carriage coming till
the wheel went over the point one 
their sticks and begrimed the scarlet
cloak the speaker before she would
move her shoulder out the way
then came an awkward clown on horseback
with elbows out lugging at the hard
mouth his shagmaned colt who knew
no more than his rider the way he should
go but who with glassy eyes starting out
 his frightened head seemed to have a
mighty mind to run straight in at the
carriage window seeing which lucy
ducked directly how they passed she
knew not but when she looked up again
they were gone and harry's body was far out
 the window watching the operations 
man and horse at the farther the
street there was the colt floundering
and struggling with his rider at the corner
 the street where both vanished
before it was settled which would be victorious

but now lucy saw before them in a
new street a huge wooden house or caravan
on wheels on the outside which inlarge
letters were written the names the
wild beasts who lodged within and who
were all to be seen for the sum one
shilling across this part the street hung
flapping furious portraits coloured to the
life a lion rampant a hyena a tiger
and a mountain cat with enormous whiskers
lucy began to be a little afraid that the
poor horses would be very much frightened
but either they did not think the portraits
striking likenesses or they were not sufficiently
acquainted with the originals and
their private histories to be as much afraid
as lucy thought they ought to be they
went by quite quiet yet were as lucy
observed most foolishly frightened soon
afterwards by a poor little boy popping
out from under the long skirts a puppetshow
one reared the other shed but
their driver being a temperate whip patted
them into good humour and brought them
on safely to the inn turning under the
archway they knew where they were
lowered their prickedup ears and stood
perfectly still at the bardoor neighing
by turns to their acquaintance in the yard
who answered from their inmost stalls
lucy found on the chimney piece the
room where they were to dine an advertisement
informing the public that 
 there is now in this town a new fairy
infinitely surpassing the old corsican fairy
who appeared in england in the last century
and who was honoured with the approbation
 the nobility and gentry but the
new fairy is full an inch less than the old
fairy and can speak three languages
french english and italian dances to
admiration and waltzes inimitably if required

while lucy was reading this card
harry was perusing another which he
had found on the table and which informed
the public that this evening at six
o'clock a company tumblers would at
the theatre in this town exhibit for the
amusement the public several curious
feats in tumbling and rope dancing one
man promised to carry a ladder poised on
his chin and another to balance a table
on the rope and even a chair on which
he was himself to be seated with his bottle
before him and quite at his ease
harry was curious to see these sights 
he told lacy that here would be fine examples
 all they had been saying about
the centre gravity these wonderful
things must be done from understanding
how to manage that properly he wished
more and more the longer he thought 
this to see these tumblers lucy it must
be confessed was not so curious on this
subject and she would much rather had
she been to choose see the new corsican
fairy
their father and mother had determined
to sleep at the inn where they now were
and they told harry and lucy that they
would in the evening let them see either
the corsican fairy or the tumblers but to
both they could not take them as they were
in opposite parts the town the tumblers
at the theatre the corsican fairy to be
seen at the court house between the acts 
a concert lucy was fond music
harry did not care for it
well harry and lucy which do you
choose said their father take five
minutes to consider but then you must
decide that we may engage our places or
buy our tickets in time
lucy recollected the resolution she had
made when first she set out upon this
journey that she would imitate her mother's
kindness which she had seen so many
examples she therefore gave up generously
her own wish to hear the concert
and see the fairy she did this in so kind a
manner that she put her brother quite at
ease she was very happy with him
seeing the tumblers and when it was allover
she was quite content with them and
with herself
at the the next day's journey our
travellers arrived at clifton harry and
lucy were delighted with the place and
were glad to learn that they were to spend
some days here in order that their mother
might rest herself the next morning
after their arrival they walked with their
father on the downs from the top 
which they looked down a steep cliff
and saw the river avon below they
descended to the river down the cliff by a
new road which a number workmen were
then making the workmen were breaking
some hollow stones which had fallen
out the bank by the side the road
the hollows these stones were lined
with shining crystals lucy picked up
bits this stone and added them to the
collection which she had made at matlock
the stone that sparkled with crystals was
called she was told bristol stone and the
l 
crystals themselves were called bristol diamonds
lucy afterwards saw at the house
 a lady in clifton a cross these bristol
diamonds and another cross real diamonds
and on laying the two side by side
she could scarcely tell the difference
they had now descended to the bank 
the river where they stood some time to
admire the cliff called st vincent's rock
they then walked to view an extensive
quarry where some miners were blasting
the rocks with gunpowder they inquired
 the head workman to what use the stone
was applied he showed them some 
it which had been hewn into blocks and
was intended for paving the streets bath
and bristol the chipping he informed
them were not thrown away as useless
but were after being broken very small
employed to mend the roads the rock
was limestone harry saw some it burning
in a kiln and he was informed that it
was hard and when cut and polished
formed a handsome marble some it
was a reddish colour some grey and
some black but all might be converted
by burning into white lime
 the lime burnt at our kilns said
their conductor is very much sought
after not only in this neighbourhood but
also in foreign parts we send it in casks
to the west indies
do you know said their father to
what use lime is applied in the west indies

harry and lucy replied that they supposed
that lime served there as it did in
england to make mortar and to manure
land
it is also employed in making sugar
said their father
harry and lucy begged to be informed
in what manner
i am glad he replied that our visit
to the lime quarry has turned our attention
towards sugarmaking for on that subject
during our stay at clifton we shall
have the best opportunity informing
ourselves in the port bristol we shall
see ships from the west indies unloading
their cargoes sugar and on board 
those ships if we are fortunate we shall
find some stems the sugar cane in the
manufactories here we shall meet with the
apparatus required for making sugar which
apparatus is to be exported to the west indies
 here too are extensive refining houses
where they extract from brown sugar that
pure white substance that you see every
morning on the breakfast table let us
walk at once to bristol and try to satisfy
ouj curiosity but tell me children
whether you already possess any information
on the subject sugar making
harry and lucy replied that they had
read in edwards's west indies an account
 the sugar plantations in jamaica the
sugar canes and sugar mills
lucy was asked what she remembered 
this she recollected that the sugar cane is
a sort strawcoloured jointed reed about
the thickness the handle an umbrella
it grows in general to about the height 
a man and at its top are leaves like flags
the canes are cut in autumn and the
sugarmaking time is a season gladness
and festivity to man and beast especially
to the poor negroes who work in the plantations

here lucy was near going off far away
from the sugarmaking to talk the poor
negroes but her father called her back
again by the question what is to be
done to the sugar canes after they are cut
they are tied in small bundles said
lucy and carried to the mill where the
sugar juice is to be squeezed out them
lucy looked to harry for assistance when
she came to the mill
it consists said harry three large
iron rollers turned by wind or water or
horses or oxen or perhaps now the people
may have learned to work them with
steam the bundles cane are passed
between the rollers and squeezed again
and again till all the juice is pressed out
it is caught in a wooden gutter lined with
lead and runs into the house where it is
to be boiled it is said to be great
consequence to boil it as quickly as they
can but i do not know the reason
the reason is lest it should ferment
said his father do you know for what
purpose it is boiled lucy
that the water which is in the juice
may evaporate replied lucy and that
on cooling the liquor the sugar may crystallised
there not being water enough to
keep it dissolved just as we saw the
crystallising the alum for my basket
the boiling is also necessary said
her father to cause the other vegetable
matters contained in the juice to separate
in the form scum when they are removed
by the skimmer and here it is
that lime is so serviceable in rendering the
separation this scum complete it also
renders the liquid thinner and less viscid
so that the particles sugar can move
freely and crystallise more readily do
you remember harry by what name they
call that ropy portion the liquor that
will not crystallise
molasses answered harry when
the sugar has crystallised it is put into
casks with holes in the bottom the molasses
drains to the bottom the casks and
runs out at the holes
harry lucy and their father were still
engaged in talking about sugar when they
found themselves arrived at the wet docks
 bristol the wet docks are a basin 
water formed by throwing floodgates
across the ancient bed the avon the
river itself being turned into an artificial
channel the water within the basin was
prevented by the floodgates from falling
with the tide so that the ships were kept
constantly afloat even at low water
our party found the basin crowded with
ships they distinguished the ships arrived
from the west indies by the hogsheads
 sugar that the crews were hoisting
out and by the black sailors whom
they saw on board on the decks 
these vessels they observed some the
sailors and boys sucking some pieces 
the sugar cane on account their sweetness
harry noticed in a warehouse ashe
walked along the parts a rolling
mill for squeezing the canes and pans 
iron and copper for boiling the juice
men were employed in packing these for
exportation our party continued their
walk until they arrived at the the
basin and then turned homewards towards
clifton highly delighted with all that they
had seen on their ramble
on the following morning as they sat
at breakfast the subject sugarmaking
was resumed
the art as practised in the west
indies is still very imperfect said their
father much the sugar existing in
the juice is lost by injudicious management
two sweet substances are contained
in the juice sugar which crystallises
easily and molasses which is incapable
 doing so the planter should
endeavour to obtain from the juice all the
sugar that it contains when first expressed
with as little the molasses adhering to
the sugar as possible but sugar by being
overheated loses its power crystallising
and is converted into a substance
resembling the molasses much sugar is
therefore destroyed in boiling the juice
rapidly and the quantity thus destroyed
increases the proportion molasses
i have often burnt a piece sugar
in a candle said harry when burnt
it remains sweet but it becomes brown
soft and sticky
 the same change takes place said
his father when a strong solution sugar
is heated in a vessel over the fire
when only a little hotter than boiling
water it begins to undergo this change so
that a part it loses the property crystallising
on cooling
harry and lucy were sorry to learn that
so much the sugar raised by the hard
toil the poor negro was spoilt and expressed
their hopes that some remedy
might be devised for the evil
 much the sugar brought to this
country used formerly to be wasted in the
same manner said their father but inconsequence
 late improvements that is
no longer the case
 and what are those improvements
said harry which you now speak
that is what i propose to show you this
very morning said his father for i
mean that we should see the new process
 refining in one the sugar houses at
bristol so now let us talk about refining
that you may understand what you seethe
people doing have either you
heard or read any thing concerning sugarrefining

harry said that he had heard that bullock's
blood was made use at the sugar
houses but in what manner and for what
purpose it was applied he did not know
when brown sugar has been dissolved
in water said his father the blood is
employed to clarify the solution that is
to remove the impurities the blood is
mixed in a liquid state with the cold solution
 sugar it coagulates on the application
 a moderate heat and rises in the
form scum which is then removed from
the surface but in the suoar house that weare
going to see this clarifying process is
dispensed with it being found that much
sugar is wasted by being mixed with the
scum from which it cannot afterwards be
separated
do not you remember harry said
lucy a story concerning a process called
claying by what an accident it was first
found out that clay was good for sugar 
good for whitening sugar i mean
 i do not recollect said harry
 so much the better said lucy for
i shall have the pleasure telling it to
you it is a very curious thing about a hen
 tell it to us my dear lucy i advise
you said her mother without raising
our expectations lest it should disappoint
us afterwards
then you must know mamma that
one day a hen who had been walking in
some wet clayey place and had clay sticking
to the bottom her feet happened
to tread on the top a pot sugar
it was soon afterwards observed that
the sugar beneath the marks the hen's
footsteps was whiter than elsewhere and
from observing this and considering how
it had happened people thought using
clay to whiten sugar
 very ingenious said harry and
lucy remembered it well just at the right
time for us did not she mamma i had
quite forgotten it but i recollect it all
now the sugar is put into a vessel 
the shape a sugarloaf which is placed
on its narrow then clay moistened
with water is put over the top the sugar
and the water by slow degrees quits
the clay and oozes very slowly down
through the sugar the water mixes with
and dilutes the molasses and carries it
down to the bottom i forgot to tell you
that there is a hole at the bottom the
vessel this hole is stopped at first by a
plug but afterwards a man takes out the
plug and lets the stuff run off that had
been oozing to the bottom
so men learned from the hen to clay
sugar said lucy we are very much
obliged to the hen are not we mamma
when next i see very white sugar i
shall say to myself thank you for that
mrs hen
you will be doings mrs hen far
more honour than she deserves replied
her father for in the sugar house that
we are about to visit the operation claying
is laid aside the art refining as
now practised is a new discovery and
has arisen not from mere lucky accident
but from judiciously combining sound scientific
principles with accurate observation

 how is that said harry drawing
closer and listening with great eagerness

 this continued his father is one
 the happy applications science to the
common purposes life in improving the
manufacture a substance so agreeable
and almost necessary we learnt yesterday
how to extract brown sugar from raw cane
juice we are now to be taught how to obtain
from brown sugar the pure saccharine
matter as white and as hard and as crystalline
as that which you see daily on the
teatable we should know the nature
and properties the foreign ingredients
in brown sugar to be able to produce
pure sugar completely separated from them
besides various impurities brown sugar
as i have already told you consists two
sweet substances sugar forming small
crystals and molasses which remains in a
semi fluid state the latter being combined
with a dark colouring matter which renders
the sugar brown molasses differs
from sugar in remaining semi fluid whereas
sugar remains solid now if a small
quantity water be added to a mixture
 molasses and sugar the whole the
molasses will be rendered fluid and only
a small portion the sugar so that by
means water the constituent parts 
brown sugar may be separated
i see plainly said harry that by
mixing a little water with brown sugar
and by putting the mixture into a mould
such as they use in claying i should be
able to free the sugar from a large portion
 the molasses
very well said his father i see
that by stating to you a few facts and by
putting to you a few questions we shall
lead you to invent the new improvements
yourself
 there is nothing i like better than to
be taught in that way said harry
it is a good exercise for you and for
everybody said his father
pray help us when we cannot get on
said lucy
 to help you then to get on said her
father some previous explanations are
necessary it is only the small crystals
 brown sugar that we have learnt
to free from molasses to come at the
matter within the large crystals we must
dissolve them completely in water and
before they are crystallised the syrup
must be freed from the colouring matter
and from all impurities but how is the
colouring matter to be separated from the
syrup 
 i know that alum is used by the
dyers to separate colours from liquids
said lucy
that property depends on the earth
which alum contains said her father
and this earth being mixed with the
syrup attracts the brown colour to itself
charcoal made bones is sometimes
employed for the same purpose
when added to the deepestcoloured wines
it is able to deprive them their redness

when the process discharging the
colour is completed the earth alum or
the charcoal together with all the impurities
are to be separated by means the
filter and when the liquor has run through
it then requires to be evaporated
 i know papa said lucy from
what you before told us that the syrup
must not be heated in a vessel over a
naked fire yet in what manner to boil
away the water if not over a fire i cannot
imagine
i told you said her father that the
sugar would be injured if made hotter than
boiling water
 i think then i know how to contrive
it said lucy i would boil it as they
sometimes do things in the kitchen by
steam i have heard you say papa that
some great buildings are heated by steam
i do not know exactly how to set about
it but i think the sugar might be boiled
by steam
 that is well thought said harry
vol m
i would conduct steam through pipes
under the pan that holds the sugar
you are both you on the right road
to the principal improvement in sugar boiling
said their father but yet you have
not fully mastered the difficulty by the niethou
that you have suggested one might be
able to heat the sugar but certainly not
to boil it for you knows that a solution 
sugar if in an open vessel requires a
stronger heat to make it boil than water
does
but i should think said harry that
by confining steam it could be made much
hotter than boiling water and in that case
with compressed steam i might be able
to boil syrup
you might so said his father and
some persons do boil sugar in that way 
but highpressure steam as it is called
is hazardous to deal with and by this
method also we risk the overheating 
the sugar turn your thoughts therefore
another way and instead raising the
temperature the steam consider whether
there are not means making syrup
or any other fluid boil at a lower temperature
than when exposed to the common
atmosphere
harry considered for some time and at
length said i am not certain whether i
could succeed with syrup but i have seen
water made to boil when only moderately
warm by putting it under the receiver 
an air pump
how did that happen said his father

because there was a vacuum said
harry there was no pressure the atmosphere
if we could place the sugar
pan under the receiver an air pump that
perhaps might do but the quantity 
sugar to be boiled puzzles me father the
sugar vessels are very large i believe i
could only boil a very small quantity in
an air pump so that after all it would
not do i suppose
why will not it do said his father
m 
do not give up your ideas too hastily 
till you are sure that they will not answer
never fly off to any thing else do not fix
your imagination upon the particular receiver
 the air pump you have seen
to be sure you could not conjure a sugar
boiler into that small receiver
no to be sure said harry laughing
then becoming quite grave again he went
on thinking how shall i manage it
it is impossible to blow a glass large enough
for the receiver
why do you stick to the notion a
glass receiver harry said his father
do you think it essential to the having
a vacuum that it should be produced in
glass 
certainly not said harry it is not
necessary by any means i only thought
 the glass one because that was the only
receiver i had seen but i perceive that
any other substance that is airtight will do
as well as glass how foolish i am i
remember now the pump and the steam
engine where the vacuum is large enough 
or a vessel might be made as large as could
be required for the purpose
 now you have it harry the sugar
is boiled in a vacuum and that vacuum is
produced by means an air pump the
exact details i do not knows having never
seen it done myself but i hope we shall
see it today and so now let us set out
the sugar house which harry and lucy
went to see was a large building eight
stories high the first circumstance which
struck them on entering it was that in several
spacious rooms through which they
passed and in which the work seemed to be
going on there were not many workmen
lucy supposed that it was the
hour dinner as had happened in some
other manufactories which they had seen 
but she was told that this was not the case 
and that all the men who were ever employed
in this sugar house were now
there few only were necessary because
so much was done by machinery in truth
the men seemed little importance it
appeared as if they were employed only as
underservants to the machines and to do
trifling things which the mechanic and the
chemist had not thought it worth their
while to invent the means affection in
any other way
the large rooms and passages through
which they passed were all warm as lucy
observed and yet she could not anywhere
perceive any fire she asked how they
were warmed and was told that she would
soon see as they were going to the
place from whence the warmth came
their guide the gentleman who was so
kind as to show them these works took
them to a building separate from the rest
in which there was a steam engine the
fire under its boilers was the only fire used
in these works all the rooms were heated
by steam that passed through pipes in the
walls or under the floors
harry was here perfectly satisfied and
he looked delighted and proud when he
heard how much was performed by one
steam engine it sent over this vast
building equable warmth and supplied
all the water that was wanted in every
part the works it put in motion a mill
for crushing the sugar and other substances
used in refining it and it kept in
unremitting action the pistons a huge
air pump
after having seen or heard what was
done by this steam engine the great
moving power on which all the rest depended
they followed their guide into a
sort outhouse in which the earth 
alum was prepared by adding quicklime
to a solution it
they then entered that part the
building where the preparatory operations
 cleansing the sugar were performed
they saw in the first place a
few workmen with naked arms and in
light clothing suited to their hot work
stirring with huge shovels in a great pan
the raw brown sugar such as it is when
brought from the west indies they were
stirring it up with a small quantity 
water not sufficient to dissolve it it looked
like treacle this was afterwards poured
into earthen moulds which there were
great numbers in the shape sugar
loaves such as those which they had
read a description with a hole at the
point which was turned downwards and
in these moulds it was to be left twentyfour
hours to filter in the course that time
the molasses would pass through into jars
beneath the sugar loaf moulds and the
sugar left behind would be in solid lumps
 a light brown colour some the
sugar thus purified was put into lucy's
hand she felt that it was soft enough to
be readily crushed it was now to be
dissolved in water which was heated by
having steam passed through it the
earth alum which they called finings
was then added to this solution and thoroughly
stirred about by passing currents
 steam through it
this was performed in a great square
cistern which had a double bottom and
sides with a space left between sufficient
to introduce the steam the inner bottom
and sides were perforated with minute
holes and through these holes the steam
passed up into the liquid sugar they
heard a rapid succession explosions
occasioned by the sudden condensation 
the steam and when the solution became
hot they saw immense volumes steam
rising through it after this treatment
the syrup was allowed to run into the filter
the filter appeared on the outside like a
great square chest and the inside was
divided into parallel compartments by
coarse linen cloth which was stretched
over frames copper the liquor was
admitted into every alternate cell and was
thus filtered in passing into the contiguous
cells on either side which were empty the
syrup flowed out from the filter a transparent
fluid a pale straw colour
they were now conducted to the most
remarkable part the new apparatus the
evaporating pans in which the water was
driven off from the syrup they were
m 
made with double bottoms so as to admit
steam between the two for heating the
syrup and the pans were covered with
domes copper these domes communicated
with the air pump the great pistons
 which were kept at work by the
steam engine these served to pump out
the air so as to preserve as far as possible
a vacuum over the liquid the perfection
 the vacuum was shewn by a barometer
the master the sugar house
informed them that it required one hundred
degrees less heat to boil sugar in
vacuo than in the ordinary method and
that it was accomplished in less than onefifth
 the time formerly requisite
after having been evaporated the heat
 the sugar was brought to a certain
temperature at which it was found most
disposed to crystallise it was then poured
into earthen moulds the form a sugar
loaf such as were before described and
in these it was allowed to consolidate
it is then a tolerably white colour
and is finally purified by being washed
o 
with a solution the finest white sugar
which is suffered to filter through it the
top and the bottom the loaves as being
less pure are then pared off in a 
and the loaves are afterwards
dried in a stove
lucy said that before she came to
the sugar house she had a general idea
from what she had read and heard that
suoar went through several processes 
filtering and boiling and cooling and
crystallising before it could be white and
fit for the teatable but still she was surprised
by seeing the number the different
operations the size the vessels and
the power and time necessary she had
not been tired by what she had seen because
she knew beforehand the general
purpose and she had not been puzzled or
anxious
harry was delighted at seeing that principle
which he had before so clearly understood
carried into practice with success
in such great works
 i hope you will now acknowledge
said he to lucy that the air pump is 
some use in common life and i hope you
are convinced now that the air pump is almost
as useful as the water pump
lucy acknowledged this and said that
harry might well triumph for the air
pump
think said harry its being applied
to such different things as makingsugar
and making ice and not only employed
for boiling quickly but for freezing
quickly i do not think that otto garrick
or mr boyle himself could have foreseen
all the uses that were to be made 
their own inventions i wish they could
see all we have been shown this morning
 so do i said lucy wish they
could
all goes back to that one great principle
 the vacuum said harry
the gentleman who had shown them
this establishment and who had with the
greatest patience and politeness explained
every part the business was glad to perceive
that he had given pleasure to the young
people and that they had attended to and
understood what they had seen and heard
he begged that they would rest themselves
before they went away and showed them
into a room where they found refreshments
were prepared he gave a cup chocolate
to lucy and another to harry
you must said he taste some 
the sugar which has been refined by the
process you have just seen
it was in a black wedgwood ware basin
which showed its whiteness
 but father cried harry eagerly
 can you tell me who invented the method
 applying the air pump so beautifully to
this use 
i can tell you said his father it
was the invention edward howard
brother to the duke norfolk he was
an honour to his family and i hope
addressing himself to the master the
sugar house that he has been amply rewarded
for his ingenuity by the gentlemen
 your profession
 the fruits have been ample said the
master but he did not himself reap them
they are enjoyed by his family he only
just lived to perfect his invention
the master the sugar house then entered
into a statement the prodigious
quantity sugar saved by adopting the new
process eight pounds sugar he said
were saved in each hundred weight and
he helped harry to make a calculation 
what that amounted to every year upon
the total quantity sugar refined in great
britain
our party having finished their chocolate
thanked their host for his attention
and took their leave him
as you go down the hill from clifton
to bristol you may see in the city below
a number very high blacklooking
buildings in the shape huge
cones from which still darker coloured
smoke in thick black billows is continually
issuing these conicalshaped
buildings are glasshouses lucy remembered
her father's having showed her and
told her what glass is made she
recollected the taste the alkali the
ashes weeds and the touch and sight
 the sand she recollected also the
story the accident by which it is said
the making olass was first discovered 
and above all she remembered the pleasure
that harry and she had had in seeing
the thermometer man blowing tubes
and bulbs glass with his blowpipe
she wished very much to see some more
olassblowino her father took her and
her brother one day to a glassblower's her
first feeling on entering the glasshouse
was alarm on seeing a number men
with ladles full redhot liquid fire as
it appeared running past her and every
minute crossing each other with these
burning masses with which they seemed
in imminent danger scalding one
another to death but when she observed
their dexterity and their fearlessness
and saw how much they were at
ease as to the danger she by degrees was
reassured and able to be amused she
saw in the first place furnaces from
which were taken earthen pots filled with
redhot liquid glass she was puzzled
at first by the workmen calling the
contents these pots jiietal but that
was only their name for what was in
reality as harry said glass she was
much amused by seeing the operations
 the glassblower first the blowing
 a glass bottle and a wine glass
one circumstance in the finishing the
wine glass struck her particularly when
he cut its rim round with a pair shears
the glass being as yet soft yielded under
the pressure the shears so that the wineglass
was no longer quite circular nor was
the rim even the workman then heated
the wine glass again and dextrously twirling
it round it was brought back to the
circular shape and its rim was even
harry's father asked him why this happened

he said he thought that it was turned
into a circular shape by the pressure 
the air as it was whirled round while soft
as any other substance is made circular
by the pressure the tool when turning
round in a lathe and he thought that
the air with inside the glass prevented
its being driven in and squeezed together
by the motion
his father told him that he was partly
right in his supposition but there was one
reason one cause to which he had not adverted
and which he had not yet perceived
he would say no more because
perhaps by observing further he would discover
it for himself in attending to another
operation the blowing window glass
or crown glass as it is called first a
great pearshaped bubble glass about a
foot in diameter was blown at the 
an iron tube to which being soft and hot
it adhered then by rolling the pearshaped
bulb upon a smooth marble table
and blowing into it and by repeating these
operations alternately several times and by
whirling it rapidly round near a hot fire
the bulb was brought from its pear shape
into that a globe the globe was then
cut open opposite to the iron tube and
after being whirled again with great swiftness
the parts spread out still more till
by continuing this operation it became a
large circular plate flat glass
harry now perceived what he had
omitted in the case the drinking glass
the centrifugal force or that force which
arises from the tendency the pails 
bodies have to fly from their centre when
turned round rapidly
as he left the glass house he continued
his explanation
i suppose father that the parts 
the soft glass as they are whirled round
endeavoured to fly from the centre and by
so doing the globe became a larger globe
and the circular plates became larger
circles and all the parts flying off equally
from the centre the rim the drinking
glass became quite circular
it is said lucy not exactly but
something like a mop yes harry a
mop when the maid twirls it round
fast the threads the mop all fly out as
far as they can go from the centre and
if it was a wet mop out fly circles beyond
circles drops
 well said harry you have made
out your likeness to a mop better than i
thought you could
i remember continued lucy the
first day i ever heard centrifugal force
or had any idea what it meant it was
from you harry when i was making a
pancake papa
 a pancake my dear i do not remember
your ever making a pancake
perhaps it was a cheese said lucy
some people i believe call it a cheese
not a cheese or a pancake to eat papa 
but i will show you as soon as we are in
mammas room
lucy kept her word and whirling herself
round the moment she was in her
mother's room the skirts her petticoats
flew out and as she popped downwards
while they swelled out she ex
claimed
there is a pancake papa or a cheese
whichever you please and it is made
harry by centrifugal force is not it
i have been very much amused continued
lucy seeing the glassblowing
were not you harry
 very much indeed and it has left a
great deal to think and to inquire more
about said harry
what more said lucy
 a great deal repeated harry for
one thing annealing i do not understand
that
i recollect said lucy that when
the man had twirled the wine glass round
and finished it a boy came with a long pair
 tongs and seizing the glass ran away with
it as our man said to the annealing furnace
to be annealed and when i asked
what that was and what was to be done
more to it the man showed me a pan in
an oven and i saw our wine glass with
many others put into it to be heated again
and then to be left to cool slowly the
man told me they ought to take several
days to cool this was done to make the
glass less brittle he said and this is annealing
what more harry would you
know about it
a great deal more if i could said
harry in the first place i do not in
the least know icy annealing makes glassless
brittle
 why oh that is another affair
why nor i said lucy
and i heard papa and the masterman
in the glass house talking a curious
fact he said that when a glass vessel
 a particular shape is allowed to cool
immediately after being made it will often
sustain the shock a pistol bullet or any
other blunt body falling into it from a considerable
height but a small splinter 
flint dropped gently into it makes it fly to
pieces with great violence
indeed said lucy that is very
curious
so papa said and they went off to
talk about prince rupert drops oh
my dear there are a great many many
more curious things to be known about
glass and all the whys more than in my
life perhaps i shall ever know
 but you need not know all the ivhys
said lucy
 but as many as i can said harry
there was a man came in while we were
in the glass house did you see him
lucy
i did a gentleman you mean
i do not know whether he was a
gentleman or not said harry he was
a man
but i know he was a gentleman said
lucy
 by his coat or his waistcoat or his
hat said harry smiling
by neither by none those said
lucy by something better by the way
he spoke by his tone his language i
knew he was a gentleman
and i by what he said knew him to
be a man sense said harry he
came to inquire for a person who grinds
glasses for telescopes
then he must be a man sense to be
sure said lucy smiling in her turn
 my dear you have not heard all he
was trying experiments to improve the
making those glasses i did not understand
all he said but it made me very
curious to know more
papa seemed to like him said lucy
yes said harry papa and he
talked what a fine useful discovery glass
is and how long before people thought 
making all the uses that are now made 
it
it happened that the next day harry
went with his father to the house a physician
who had a good library and while
his father and the physician were busy he
asked leave to look for something he
wanted in some the books the physician
gave him leave and to work he
went searching for a chemical dictionary
or encyclopedia in which he might find
aymealmg and glass the volume containing
annealing was missing he
thought this very provoking but like
many things which we think very provoking
it was really fortunate and well
for him had he found it he would not
have understood the article he had not
the previous knowledge necessary and he
would have lost his labour if not his
patience he went in search glass and
there he found much that he could not
but some that he could comprehend as he
was both enthusiastic and indefatigable he
searched all through it and had the great
pleasure picking out several entertaining
things seizing on all that was suited to
the present state his knowledge he left
the rest for another time one passage
delighted him so much from describing
exactly what they had seen and what he
would have found it difficult to explain
that he scribbled a copy it for lucy
scribbled truth compels us to say for it
was scarcely legible when he came to
read it to lucy he could hardly make it
out even with her best assistance and she
could read his running hand better than he
could himself but as she observed this
hand had run almost quite away
 my dear i wrote it in a desperate
hurry and on a crumpled back a letter
with a pencil that wanted cutting and
my father was standing up with his hat
and his gloves in his hands i thought
he was going every instant while i was
writing the three last lines scribble
scribble scribble as fast as ever my pencil
could go
 thank you said lucy for doing
it for me but what is this about a cham 
 saw no chain at the glass house
 chain my dear lucy it is chair
said harry
chair oh now i understand it all
said lucy it is the description what
we saw the men making the drinking
glass the man sitting in the armchair
and blowing through his long iron tube 
then rolling it on the arm the chair 
and the other man sticking on the foot 
the glass and then taking the chair oh
vol n
i see it all again it is very well described
 
 i am glad you think so said harry
it is more than the man who wrote it
expected
 expected did he ever think me
said lucy opening her eyes very wide
 no no my dear said harry laughing
 you may let your eyebrows down
asrain the author never thought you
in particular i meant only his readers in
general
yes said lucy mis young readers
i suppose he said as people often do in
books is that what you mean harry 
i mean nothing replied harry but
that the w river says he could hardly expect
by any description his to make glass
blowing intelligible now that is all goon
to something else
with all my heart cried lucy here
are some more scribbled notes yours
harry what does this mean
brave man and quick hands
edinburgh encyclopedia
throuoli flames covered with wet
skins eyes glass
 what can this mean v
 do you remember said harry seeing
a great furnace at the glass house 
you saw only the outside they could not
uncover it to show the inside to any body
lest they should have let in the cold air
into that furnace they put the earthen pots
full glass which had been annealed
and they left them there to set as they
called it if one these pots happen to
break it is a terrible difficulty to get it out
and put another in its place the getting
out the broken one can be done well
enough by a man at arms length from the
fire with a long iron hook or a fork but
the man who is to put in the new pot can
have no use hook or fork he must put
the new pot into its place with his hands
passing them through the flames
then indeed said lucy you mioht
well call him brave man and quick he
must do it as quick as lightning
 but he could not do it as quick as
n
lightning or do it at all said harry
v without precautions he must be
dressed my dear in skins which are all as
wet as possible and they must cover him
all over all but his eyes two holes are left
for him to see through but these are
defended with thick glasses
i am sure i am very much obliged to
you harry said lucy for bringing me
home such entertaining things that man
brave and quick as you called him was
worth reading all glass through to get at
how many pages did you hunt through to
find him 
i came upon him by accident said
harry but i met with several other
things which interested me and i thought
i would bring them away in my head for
you and i have them somewhere there
if i could but recollect them but i cannot
when i try in a hurry
do not try then said lucy when
i try too hard to remember i never can
recollect what i want but then it comes
all back aofain when i am thinking 
something else so now harry look at
this nice little glass tumbler which papa
bought for mamma's dressing box in
place that which i broke it is prettier
than the old one look at its prettywhite
leafy border that is ground glass
papa said and this part below like crystals
is cut glass and papa told me how
this was done
two the very things i was trying
to recollect said harry then i need
not tell you about that
no said lucy what a beautiful
transparent clear clean thing glass is
continued she and how very useful
and in how many different ways drinking
glasses and lookingglasses you may
smile harry but men use lookingglasses
as well as women
 yes said harry and for better purpose
too than looking at themselves they
use lookingglasses you know for some
astronomical instruments
yes and for shaving too said lucy
 or they would cut their throats mighty
grand you were about the astronomical
instruments added she laughing but
let me go on my own way in honour 
glass to tell you all that i know besides
lookingglasses there are magnifying
and diminishing glasses both very useful
and entertaining and then spectacles 
oh harry what would grand mamma do
without them and how happy she is
with them reading and working as well
as i can at eightysix what a wonderful
invention spectacles are by which people
can see so many years longer than they
could in former times spectacles i think
harry are the most ingenious things people
ever made glass
do not forget telescopes my dear
said harry the most wonderful man's
inventions
how curious it is said lucy that
all these things spectacles and telescopes
would never have been thought but
for that first bit glass which the shipwrecked
sailors observed when they were
boiling their kettle on the sand with the
the fire made sea weed do you remember
harry my father's telling us that
story
i do said harry and now that
puts me in mind what i wanted to say
to you it was about that story it is
told in the i was reading today and
i was glad to meet with it there was a
little difference the sailors supported their
kettles on the sand with pieces fossil
alkali nitre with which their ship had been
loaded
and in our old story said lucy the
fire was made weeds and the alkali
came from their ashes which burned with
the sand and made glass there is very
little difference in the stories it all comes
to the same things
 i know it does said harry but
i was going to say something quite different

say it then my dear said lucy
 what time did you think that story
happened said harry
 t do not know said lucy i hardly
ever think about time in stories i think
it was in former times a great while ago
in the time pliny or before said
harry he tells the story
very likely said lucy i do not
care who tells it
but my dear said harry what i want
you to care for is the wonder that it should
be so long since glass and the way 
making it were first discovered by that
lucky accident and yet that it should be
hundreds years before it was brought
into common use you know the ancients
the greeks and romans had not glass as
we have
 i thought that they had glass bottles
in old roman times said lucy i remember
something about a bottle glass
in the roman history which a man brought
to the emperor tiberius i think and he
dashed it to pieces when he was provoked
and the emperor put him to death for it do
not you remember harry my reading it
loud to mamma and your being so angry
with that tyrant 
i remember that perfectly well said
harry but that was only one particular
bottle
but besides that particular bottle
said lucy i recollect hearing mrs frankland
tell mamma that there were plates 
glass found in the ruins herculaneum
did he said harry
yes said lucy and from that it
is supposed that glass windows were used
bv the ancients
 perhaps so said harry but my
dear lucy to go no farther than england
my says that the english had not
glass windows for many hundred years after
that the windows houses and churches
were covered with linen cloth till towards
the the tenth century
 you mean till about the year 
said lucy
 it was not till after the days queen
elizabeth said harry that it was quite
common for houses to have glass windows
 how very stupid people must have
been in those former days then said lucy
n 
so it seems said harry and yet i
suppose they were not naturally more stupid
than we are now recollect virgil
and homer my dear but then the ancients
had not many men science
and then came the dark ages as our
history calls them said lucy and in
the dark ages i suppose people fell asleep
and could not think glass or any thing
else even when they wakened there
were not many that could write or read
you know harry
they had very few books to read
said harry except the ancient greek
and roman books over again and they
had scarcely any books experiments i
believe
they had only manuscripts said
lucy written on parchment or on papyrus
i remember papa once showed mea
papyrus manuscript in a museum and
i saw parchment rolls too which the ancients
called books
and what work there must have been
making copies enough those manuscript
books said harry for people to read
and how few copies books a man could
make after all and be could do nothing
else
no wonder the people were stupefied
said lucy
but then happily was invented the
grand art printing said harry
yes i remember said lucy seeing
it in capital letters in the memorable
events and when i first read it i did
not know why so much was said about its
being such a grand invention now i
beoin to understand better by the bve
harry you have seen a printingpress
i never saw one and i should like to see
how they print i think that my father
was asking something about printingpresses
in bristol
yes said harry he told me that he
will take you to see one if he has time
i wish it may be tomorrow said
lucy we have very few days more to
stay at clifton i hope papa will have
time to show me the printingpress butin
the mean time harry will you play at
cup and ball with me look what a pretty
ivory cup and ball mamma has given me
i thought it several times while you
were talking glass but i would not interrupt
you now let us have a trial on
the spike which will catch it the oftenest
will you spin the ball for me
what is the use spinning it
a question easily asked very difficult
to answer
mamma i am sorry that you could not
go with us to see the printingpress to day
for it was very entertaining and look
said lucy i am not covered with printer s
ink as you said i should be
if you did not take care my dear i
said did not i
 yes mamma but i did take care you
see for i have not a single spot and yet i
saw every thing perfectly mamma you
have seen printing so often i suppose that
it would be tiresome to describe it to you
and i shall only tell you that it was done
almost exactly as is explained in our 
 trades in the chapter the printer
do you remember my reading it to you
mamma and the picture the letterpress
printer and at the it was said that
after reading this young people should endeavour
to go through a printing office
i asked you directly mamma to take me
to see one and you said that you could
not then but that you would some time or
other and now the sometimeorother
which i thought never would arrive has
come to day i saw the letters or the
types all in their square divisions in their
cases which lay sloping within reach 
the compositor who with his composing
stick in his hand picked out the letters
and placed them in the form then another
man inked their faces with a black
puffball and afterwards the wet paper
was pressed down on them i knew and understood
almost every thing he was going
to do mamma from recollections description
this was very pleasant there
was one thing though which i had mistaken
 when i took up one the types i
saw that the letter stands out from the face
 the metal it projects now i had always
fancied that the letters were hollowed out
cut into the types as the letters for instance
 your name mamma are cut into this
seal
how could you think so lucy said
harry you know that would be engraving
that is the way engravings are
made
yes now i recollect i know that is
the way engraving is done but i thought
in printing books it was the same and i
know now what led me into the mistake
it was our little ivory letters which we put
together so as to spell out words they are
all cut into the ivory and filled up with
ink
but does not your trades
lucy describe how the letters are made
said her mother
 no mamma not that i recollect
said lucy i dare say the author supposed
every body must know it but i did
not
 that is my fault i am afraid said her
mother
 not yours mamma but the fault the
man the author the trades if
it is any body's fault but indeed it
must be very difficult for great grownup
old authors to recollect the time when
they did not know every thing or anything
themselves and very tiresome to
them to explain every little particular from
the very beginning it must be difficult
too for wise authors to guess or conceive
the odd sort little foolish mistakes that
children make
harry waited till lucy had done speaking
and then told her that the manner in
which letters are made is described in the
 trades under the head typefounder

is it indeed said lucy then i read
very carelessly but i remember the calico
printer perfectly well and how his
types or his blocks and patterns are made
i know the pattern is first drawn on the
block wood a leaf and flower for instance
such as there is on this curtain
then with a very sharp knife or a little
chisel they cut away the wood all round
the pattern and between every part it so
as to leave it standing up and standing out
in relief said her mother
 then they rub colours on this pattern
said lucy
as the other printer rubs ink on his
types said harry
and the calico printer stamps it down
on the calico
just as the letterpress printer did the
paper on the types said harry
how comes it lucy said her mother
that you remember so accurately all this
calico printer's business
oh mamma for an excellent reason
which harry knows do not you harry
i do said harry smiling
mamma harry was a calico printer
once and printed a blue starred gown for
my doll said lucy
and a pretty blotted blurred gown it
was said harry
i liked it the best all her crowns
and so did she said lucy and we
were so happy doing it mamma except
when harry cut his finger hacking at the
block added lucy shrinking at the recollection

 what signified a cut said harry 
 but i broke the point my knife and
that was the reason the star was but a
botch at last
 the worst it was said lucy that
the stars all came out the first time it was
washed but that was not your fault
harry but the washerwoman's
more probably the fault the colours
you used said her mother or else
why did not the colours wash out your
own gowns the same person washed them
that is an unanswerable argument
said harry
therefore i will not attempt to answer
it said lucy
i am glad it said harry i want
to qfo on to sonietliinof else mother it is
very extraordinary that printing should
not have been invented for so many hundreds
 years
the same thing we said about glass
cried lucy
it is surprising that the ancients should
not have invented printing harry said
his mother because they had in common
use contrivances vshich might with a little
more thought and ingenuity have led them
to the invention
what do you mean mamma said
lucy
i think my mother means their seals
and their medals said harry their
seals were made like ours with letters
cut in
yes in intaglioy said his mother
but how did you know that harry 
i knew it mother from one the
large books prints which you used to
lend me to look at at night when i was at
home
montauban
eyes mamma there were in that 
figures and descriptions several very
large roman seals in which there were
names in capital letters i brought you
the one night mamma when it was
so large and heavy i could hardly hold it
i remember and asked you to tell me
something those seals and to read and
translate a bit the description to me for
it was french and you were so good as
to do it mamma
 i am very glad i was since you remember
it and that it is useful to you so
long afterwards my dear boy said his
mother
it said that those great seals were
used for marking some large earthen vessels
in which the romans kept their wine
they stamped them down on the clay vessels
while the clay was soft and then it
hardened and the letters remained
just like our seals on wax said lucy
i think mother continued harry
that all those great seals had the letters
a
to
cut in and not in relief
yes and all which he gives representations
i think he never found any with
the letters in relief but we are sure that
there were such in use among the ancients
for i recollect it is said that some the
names on those wine vessels were cut in to
the clay that is in intaglio which you
know is a proof that they were made by a
seal or type that was in relief in the
ruins pompeii loaves bread have been
found with letters stamped upon them and
virgil mentions the branding cattle
then said lucy they actually did
know how to print without knowing it
 wonder when they had such trouble in
copying writing that they never invented
a printing press how stupid when they
saw the letters on the jars standing before
their eyes continued lucy but i suppose
that from only seeing one name or a
few letters at a time it never came into
their heads
were there any roman seals ever
found do you know mother said harry
 the rare kind with the letters in relief
in which there was more than one word 
yes i believe said his mother that
the duke richmond has in his collection
a seal on which there are four words
the four names the roman to whom it
belonged and this seal belonged it is
thought not to any emperor or great man
but to some private individual therefore
it is believed that such seals were in common
use amoncr the romans
 and they never invented printing after
all said lucy the germans or the
dutch i believe invented it
and how did they come to it at last
do you know mother said harry
that is disputed and not yet settled
my dear said his mother some say
the hint was taken from these roman seals 
others from the seeing the names saints
cut on blocks wood under their images
other people think that the idea was suggested
by the seeing the manner in which
cards were stamped
indeed said lucy but those
were from wooden blocks not metal letters
or types
true and the first books were printed
from wooden blocks said her mother
 some these are still preserved in public
libraries as curiosities
i should like to see one said lucy
you would see how coarse they were
and how inferior to our improved printing
to be sure from these clumsy wooden
blocks said harry but i suppose they
soon got rid those
the chinese use wooden blocks still i
believe said his mother and it is said
they had the art printing long before it
was known in europe
more shame then for them said lucy
since they have not improved it all this
time what use wooden blocks still
what blockheads
gently gently said her mother
there may be some reasons for this
which you do not know they have not our
alphabet
but without going oft to defend or
attack the chinese let us go on with our
own affairs said harry what came
next mamma and how did the people get
to the printing press 
the first improvement made after
the printing whole words with wooden
blocks was the making moveable letters 
then the same letters could be used over
and over again and as many made as they
pleased these were first wood afterwards
they tried metal and when they had
moveable types metal they next found
the readiest way fixing these in frames
and inking and stamping a heavy weight
down upon the paper which was laid over
them there was the printing press
what was the name the man who
first made a printing press said lucy
that is disputed too said her mother
some say a man the name schemer
a servant a dr faustus and some say
faustus poor dr faustus should be allowed
the glory the invention as it
brought him into some difficulties
difficulties how mamma such a
great convenience as the art printing
said lucy
 when he carried a parcel his printed
bibles from germany to paris and offered
them for sale as manuscripts had formerly
been sold the french considering the
number copies he had made and finding
them all to a letter the same which was a
degree exactness beyond what any
the best copyist could have accomplished
suspected that he was a wicked magician
and by threatening to pursue him as such
and to burn him they extorted his secret
from him
how cruel cried lucy
how unjust exclaimed harry i
would never have told it to them
i would rather have told it than have
been burnt alive said lucy
it is very happy for us that we do not
live in those days ignorance said their
mother men are honoured for inventions
now not persecuted or burned
that is a blessing said harry but
mother how much you know about printing
and printers and printing presses and
all the history the invention how could
you remember it all and have it ready for
us the very moment we wanted 
very easily my dear said his mother
smiling shall i tell you how and why
when you went with your father this
morning to see the printing press as i
could not go with you lying on my sofa
here i read an account printing for i
was determined to be as wise as you by
the time you came back
and a great deal wiser mammas said
lucy
a great deal because you picked out
all the things i did not know and wanted
to know said harry thank you
mother
his mother asked harry if he had found
out whether there was in bristol any printing
press moved by a steam engine harry
answered that he did not know
you do not know but did not you
vol o
put your father in mind to inquire said
his mother
no i did not said harry
that is very odd said lucy you
who never forget any thing that sort
it was unlike you indeed harry
said his mother you were so intent upon
it yesterday i recollect your surprise and
admiration when your father told you 
the double printing press moved by a
steam engine which he had seen in london
where without hands the types are
pressed against the paper and the ink
spread just in the quantity required over
the letters and which can in one hour
print sheets on both sides my dear
harry is it possible you can have forgotten
this
 no mother i never said i had forgotten
it answered harry
then why did not you put your father
in mind to inquire whether there was any
such printing press in bristol when you
left me your head seemed quite full it
yes mother but 
but what pray tell me for i cannot
understand your silence my dear said his
mother
only i thought mother that lucy
would like better to see the plain common
printing press first because she said that
she should like so very much to see exactly
what is described in the trades
therefore i did not ask papa about the
steam double printing press because i
thought that would puzzle and hurry her
and that she would not see the thing just
as she wished and you knows i can see
what i want another time perhaps
how very kind harry said lucy
so that was your reason and you did
not forget but you never told me that
you gave it all up for me if mamma had
not by accident asked i should never have
known oh harry why did not you tell
me
what signifies telling or talking about
it said harry it was nothing but
jvist what you would do for me i do not
o 
forget the fairy you gave up for me lucy
the other day the new corsican fairy
a steamboat will set off from bristol
tomorrow morning oh father cried
harry can you take me to see it
i can harry and will with pleasure
said his father
 and lucy said harry in a tone
which showed that his joy great as it
was could not be complete without her
 and lucy said her father if the
day be fine but i cannot take her if it
should rain
next morning harry was up by daybreak
peeping out to see what kind a
day it was likely to be a cloudy morning
it was at five o'clock threatening
rain desperately between six and seven 
raining downright between eight and
nine and presently it not only rained
but it poured so that all hope was over for
lucy splash splash harry trudged
after his father through the dirty streets
scarcely hearing not at all heeding the
rattling carriages rumbling carts
rolling barrels jarring and jangling
 iron bars dragged upon diays without
wheels over rough pavements with all
the indescribable clatter and clangor and
clamor and stunning din this most
noisy noisy cities nor did he feel the
rain which poured over him but when
the heavy shower ceased and when dripping
umbrellas closed and the sun through
the clouds gave promise a better day
harry entreated his father to let him run
back for lucy if his father would but
wait for him five minutes in a shop 
this bookseller's shop papa i will be
back in less than five minutes and i will
bring her very quickly and as safe as possible
through the streets may i papa
 no his father said he could not wait
for the vessel would set off punctually at
the appointed hour and if they delayed
five minutes they should be too late
then harry thought they could never
walk fast enough on he kept before
his father the rest the way till they
came to a great crowd people not
only the lower class idlers but persons
 all ranks assembled to see the departure
 the steamboat harry darted
quickly after his father while heads and
elbows closed over him he could not
see farther than the backs and legs 
the people before him for some time but
he pierced through the darkness the
dense crowd tall bodies and emerged
at last from under the elbow a 
seacaptain into full daylight he
found himself standing on the stonepier
 a large dock at the very edge the
water in the front row a multitude 
spectators who covered the quay through
the buzz voices the first thing he distinctly
heard was 
 she will not get out this quarter 
an hour she will not get out till the
tide lets them open the dockgates
she as harry knew meant the steam
vessel he rejoiced to find that they
were in such good time now he had
leisure to breathe and to look about
him close beneath the stone pier on
which he was standing were several vessels
among which he first distinguished
the steamboat by the faint grey smoke
which he saw rising from a black iron
chimney that stood in the middle its
deck the boat had sails but they were
not spread they were close furled as unnecessary
for the voyage it appeared as
if there were fewer sailors on board than
in the other vessels but all was in motion
on her deck and on the adjoining pier
two men were rolling a chariot over
planks laid from the pier to the edge 
the vessel others were dragging to its
right place on the deck another carriage 
others held horses on the quay who were
to go into the boat and who with ears
pointed forward and expanded nostrils
drew back and yet in a few instants patiently
submitted to their fate while the
gentlemen to whom they belonged or their
servants anxiously called out giving directions
about their valuable and their favourite
horses groups people with bundles
baskets boxes bags and umbrellas in their
hands stood by waiting impatiently till
the horses and carriages were disposed 
and then they stretched their necks and
their hands and gave in their goods with
eager directions to a sailor who balanced
on a board scarcely appearing even to
listen to them handed the packages as
fast as he received them to another sailor
behind him repeating continually to the
anxious proprietors 
 they will all be safe all will betaken
good care sir or madam as
the case might be
harry was astonished by the vast weight
number and bulk things animate and
inanimate which were stowed on board
loads boxes and parcels and baskets
trunks chests or packingcases besides the
carriages and horses and after all passengers
crowding in innumerable all
these to be carried by steam full against
the wind which was now rising there
was a man in a blue jacket with a large

straw hat on standing near harry he
was a sailor belonging to one the 
which lay in the dock and
which was not likely to sail this day wind
not permitting he eyed with no friendly
eye these preparations going forward with
such alacrity his brow darkened and
with a sulky look he began to whistle
one belonoirip to the steamboat who
heard him smiled and said 
 no need to whistle for a fair wind
we can oo without a wind or against it
provoked beyond endurance by this
boast the old sailor swore yes i am
sorry to say he did swear that for his
part he would not go on board a steamboat
for both the indies and a puncheon
 rum into the bargain not he he
would rather in the roughest gale be out
at sea in an honest sailing packet with
a gale in his teeth than go on board
such a thing as this the finest day the
year
this speech making little impression
upon the bysanders he added that ito

was well for her it was fair weather for
she would never stand a gale
then shutting one eye and looking upwards
with the other he observed that if
he was not more mistaken than ever he
was in his days the wind that was rising
would soon blow a storm which would
bring as he prophesied evil to all who
were going on board her
among the intended passengers who
were standing by was a poor decent looking
woman in a black bonnet and cloak
with many bundles in one hand and
holding by the other a sickly looking
little girl the woman listened with
great anxiety and the child looked exceedingly
frightened whilst this sailor
was speaking and grew paler and paler
when he went on telling the dangerous
accidents he had heard happening
on board steamboats boilers that
had burst and scalded some to death or
blown all on board and the vessel to
pieces the child on hearing this let go
a cocoanut which she had been hugging
close to her bosom and clung with both
her hands to her mother the cocoanut
would have rolled into the water if harry
had not stopped it but he picked it up
and returned it to the little girl offering
to put it into a bag which her mother tried
to open but her hands trembled so much
that she could not untie the strings harry
disentangled them for her and begged her
not to be alarmed the sailor persisted
in saying that she had good reason to be
afraid adding that as her child was so
much frightened and as her own heart
failed her she wouldst much better not
to go in the steamboat but to wait till
the next day and take her place and a
comfortable birth in the sailingpacket
which would be off early in the morning
the poor woman said that she could
not wait for the morrow and though she
still trembled she tried to speak steadily
saying that her heart did not fail her that
she was determined to go now and in the
steampacket for it was the cheapest and
the quickest way she could go to her
mother who was lying dangerously ill in
dublin and if she missed this day she
might never see her mother alive
the tears rolled down her cheeks as
she spoke the sailor still urged her not to
go and risk drowning her child harry
called to his father who was talking to
some gentlemen and had not heard what
passed harry begged his father would
come and tell this poor woman whether he
thought she might safely go in the steamboat
or not not only his father but the
gentlemen who had been talking to him
came immediately and assured the poor
woman that in their opinion she might
go with perfect safety one these gentlemen
was an american he told her
that he had in his own country been
hundreds times and many thousand
miles in steamboats and had never seen
any accident happen
harry's father added further to encourage
the poor woman that the two gentlemen
who were speaking to her had themselves
taken their passage on board this
very packet she thanked them and
wiping away her tears said she had been
determined to go at all hazards but now
she had no fears the sailor sulkily turned
away and walked off
a call now came for all to go on board
as the tide served and they were just
opening the dock gates all hastened onboard
except the poor woman but the
moment she began to move her child
screamed and clinging round her legs
cried i know it will burst i know it
will burst it will scald me to death it
will kill us oh mother mother do not
go oh mother mother the poor
avoman did all she could to soothe her
but in vain the child was so terrified that
it listened to nothing and when its hands
were loosened from round its mother's
knees and when she tried to lift it up the
little girl caught fast hold harry's arm
struggling with all her might a messenger
came saying that the captain would
not wait the woman again trembled excessively
and grew pale
perhaps father said harry if i
offer to go on board the little girl will
come with me when she sees that i am
not afraid
try said his father
harry spoke very gently to the child
who stopped crying and listened to him
and let him lead her on when she saw
that he was not afraid he thus got her
into the boat to the woman's satisfaction
the child still held fast hold his hand
saying do not leave me do not go
i must go said harry and i am
very sorry for it for i should like to stay
very much
his father who had followed him and
who had learnt that they could go a few
miles down the river and be put on shore
at a landing place told harry that since
he wished so much to go he might and
that he would accompany him harry
thanked him and was delighted the
crates were now opened and they were
slowly towed out the dock and between
the narrow piers while the swing bridges
turned back were covered with spectators
a band music stationed on the deck
played the sun shone bright and all
looked happy yet harry was a little disappointed
by their being towed he told
his lather that he had thought it was all to
be done by steam
wait a few minutes and you will see
that it will be so said the captain smiling
as soon as the vessel had reached the
river and passed the place where a ferryboat
was crossing the smoke from the
chimney issued thicker and thicker and
spread like a gigantic pennon over their
heads the towing had ceased the paddle
wheels were set in motion and
now my boy said the captain we are
going by steam and easily and swiftly
they went gliding rapidly on between high
hills and rocks on both sides them
the lofty crescents terraces and hanging
gardens clifton seemed to fly back as
they passed in a few seconds the ferryboat
lessened and vanished they passed
the majestic rock st vincent crowned
with specks human figures birds hovered
round their nests in the rock as
they passed on the captain pointed to
leigh woods and nightingale valley 
but scarcely had he named them when
new scenes were before them harry
felt afraid that they were going too
swiftly and that his pleasure would too
soon be at an he had never
stirred from the spot where he stood
when he had first entered the boat the
child having fast hold his fore finger
had by this time lulled by the music and
the easy motion fallen fast asleep with her
head in her mother's lap harry longed
to go to his father who was walking up
and down the deck with the captain
and the american gentleman talking ashe
heard every now and then as they
passed him something entertaining about
steam boats but he thought he could
not draw his finger away from the child
without wakening it and the mother looked
up piteously in his face once when he
offered to move saying 
this is the first sleep she has had these
three nights she has been very ill
try if you can put in your finger instead
 mine whispered harry and gently
unclosing the hand the sleeping
child he drew out his and the mother
slipped in hers the hand closed again
the child did not waken the mother smiled
and harry set free ran off joyfully to his
father he found the gentlemen were
eagerly claiming for their several nations
the honour bringing into general use
the invention the steam vessel
the captain who was a scotchman
claimed it for the men glasgow the
american maintained that the number 
steam boats in america and the years they
had been there in use proved that they had
first felt the value the invention this
could not be denied the scotchman admitted
but it must never be forgotten that
the first was sent out to america from glasgow
and that a scotchman went out with
it and that the engine was one bolton
and watt's without this it could never
have been set agoing
an irish gentleman here begged leave
to remark that the experiment the last
winter's trial them between dublin and
holyhead had been undeniably the most
fair and satisfactory ever made and had
established steam vessels in the three kingdoms
an englishman who was present
and who was silent till the last said only
that he was content since none could doubt
the original invention was english and the
whole establishment this glorious and
useful discovery in europe was exclusively
british harry's father to whom he appealed
had the candour to mention a
french gentleman who many years ago
tried an experiment with a steam boat on
the rhone at lyons by listening to all
that was said harry learned in short the
history this invention it was first
thought nearly a hundred years ago by
a mr hull for towing vessels in and out
the marquis de jouflfroy
i
 harbours but he only made the proposal
not the attempt and he had no idea 
using it in any other manner the first
person who actually placed a steam engine
in a boat and tried the experiment was a
mr patrick miller at glasgow the remains
 the boat are yet in being and the
scotch gentleman said he had lately seen
them several persons in scotland and
england about this time proposed to employ
steam vessels but they did not come
into general use till a model one was
carried from glasgow to america its
successful establishment in that country
on the prodigiously extensive lakes and
rivers the new world proved its practicability
and brought it at last into use in
scotland england and ireland
harry was surprised to hear that a hundred
years should have passed between the
first invention and its beings brought into
general use and asked why it had not succeeded
at first as well as at last several
reasons were given the scotch captain
said that vessels were not originally made
strong enough that the improvements
lately adopted in ship building had rendered
it possible to employ a greater power
 steam than they could formerly without
danger destroying the vessel the
englishman observed that people had been
for many years too much occupied in applying
the steam engine to other purposes
in england to think adapting it to
boats and indeed it was scarcely necessary
till now that commerce has increased
so rapidly and the goods and people to
be carried on canals rivers and sea are
so numerous
harry was much obliged to the gentlemen
who took the trouble to give these explanations
in reply to the question he had
asked and felt a little proud being
treated so much like a reasonable person
he took care not to interrupt them with
more questions though there vivere many
he wished to ask but at the first pause
he whispered to his father and asked whether
it was possible for him to see the
machinery this steam vessel he could
not see the paddlewheels which he had
heard the captain speaking he wished
very much to understand how these were
moved by the steam engine and how they
worked the ship forward so rapidly and
powerfully against the wind which now
blew strong his father told him that he
could not show him the machinery while
they were going on but he would ask the
captain to show it to him whenever they
stopped which they were soon to do at a
place called lamplighter's hall this
was now in sight and in a few minutes
they reached it and harry heard an increased
sound the rushing the steam
which was let out before the vessel could
be stopped the noise the working 
the machinery ceased the vessel stood still
and a rope was made fast to the shore some
 the passengers were to be set down here
and others taken up and during the delay
this occasioned the captain had time to
attend to harry's request he was a goodnatured
man and took pleasure in gratifying
as he said the boy's laudable curiosity
he showed him how the engine is connected
with the paddlewheels they
looked something like the waterwheels 
a mill and as they turned and as each
vane struck upon the water he perceived
that it urged on the boat like the oars 
the boatmen whom he had seen rowing
he asked at what rate they had been moving
today and was told about eight
miles and a half an hour they had
been going against the wind but with the
stream he asked what is the fastest rate
at which steam vessels can go and was
told by the american gentleman eleven
miles an hour but in england as the english
gentleman said ten miles an hour
the irish gentleman asserted that during
the last two years the passage from dublin
to holyhead had always been performed
at an average rate about seven miles an
hour and that the mail which was carried
by the steam packets had scarcely
missed a day even in the most stormy
weather he asked harry if he had
suffered from sea sickness harry had

never been in a ship and had never been
sick in a boat the river had been so
calm to day that they had scarcely felt the
motion the vessel
well some time or other you will feel
what it is and then you will be thankful to
the steam packet which at least lessens
the time the suffering and affords the
certainty that it will be over in a given
number hours
harry listened to his father and these
gentlemen who spoke the great advantages
to commerce and to society from this
quick communication between distant countries
enlarged views opened upon his
young intelligent mind and he exclaimed
 what a grand invention i am glad it
was made by 
efigiishmeji he was going to saps britons
he did say which word satisfying the
scotch the irish and the englishman
they all smiled upon him
 pray young gentleman what do you
think us americans said the american
we have done more than any you i
guess recollect that we have at the
least three hundred steam boats in constant
use
 three hundred said harry with a
tone admiration but recollect
added he that it is by our help that you
have all these you know we sent the
first model to america
we scotch interposed the scotchman
in a low voice
that model helped i acknowledge
said the american
then added harry if we helped
you in the beginning you that have a whole
new world to yourselves will help us in
the i hope
all fair and i hope we shall so shake
hands said the american shaking harry
heartily by the hand for one i promise
you if ever you come to america
my little man i will make you heartily
welcome and if you please you shall go
in a steam boat on the mississipi and
missouri and on the ohio some thousands
 miles that would please you
i guess 
i am sure it would said harry
gratitude to these kind gentlemen and
the enthusiasm which had been excited in
harry's mind quite overcoming his habitual
taciturnity he went on talking this
glorious invention after a hundred
years working at it it is at last said he
 brought to perfection
perfection repeated his father
harry that is saying too much
too much for any human invention
sir said the scotchman and as we
know even at present there is much more
to be done for these steam vessels
and much is doing continued harry's
father men science and genius are
going on continually making improvements

just before i left london said the
englishman i heard a number capital
improvements preparing for our steam
vol p
boats which will make them more durable
and safer than they are at present
the american nodded with an air 
great satisfaction and some mystery
can the steam boats be made safer
than they are said harry
since accidents have happened said the
captain they may happen again but
many that have will hardly occur again
we shall guard against them in future
may i ask sir said harry very respectfully
 might i ask what was the
cause those accidents and how you
guard against them now
you may ask and welcome my eager
little man said the captain with a goodhumoured
smile but i cannot undertake
to answer you all this at once or at
any time certainly not now my dear
little fellow added he looking at his
watch for i must be off so goodbye
to you
the poor woman with her child stood
close to the place where harry must pass
when he was to land with a grateful
smile she said to him as he came near
master my child here is a deal the
better for that sweet sleep she had thanks
to you for it
pleased yet ashamed to have this said
to him in the hearing several people
who were standing by harry coloured upto
the ears and answered in a blunt manner
and in a rude tone 
do not thank me for nothings i did
nothing at all
the child running before him so as
to stop him as he would have pushed on
held up her cocoa nut and said
 i will give you this take it do
oh no i cannot take it from you
said harry but thank you thank you
the child still held up the cocoa nut
and harry seeing that she looked vexed
by his refusal took it from her hands and
turning back rolled it along the deck
p 
 run after it run said he and
thank you as much as if i had it goodbye

the child ran after the rolling ball and
harry sprung from the boat on shore
a chaise was procured at lamplighter's
hall an inn near the landing place and
his father and he were now to go in it
back to clifton harry's head was so
full the steam boat that he could
think and talk nothing else all the
way
 father among other advantages which
steam boats have over carriages with horses
and men there is this great one that the
steam engines neither eat nor drink nor
sleep and steam never grows tired but
horses and men must rest sometimes
i wish you would rest now harry a
little said his father and do not kick
my shins in your transports
i beg your pardon said harry
but father i do not see why a steamboat
should not go on for weeks and
months just as well as for hours and days
surely it can go as long as there is fire and
as lonof as there is water cannot it
surely as long as we can supply the
engine with fuel and the boiler with water
and as long as the machinery does not
break
then if they make the whole strong
enough said harry why should not
people cross the great ocean from england
to america as well as the little sea from
england to ireland why not father 
what is the difficulty you look as if
there were some impossibility
 no harry not an impossibility but
there is a difficulty and a great difficulty
said his father and if you consider you
will perceive what it is
harry considered but he did not find
it out his mind was too much exalted 
he was too full the noble steam boat to
be able to think with his usual degree 
attention
his father helped him a little to settle
his thoughts and brought him to consider
the time which would be requisite for this
voyage to america
it takes about three weeks harry
what would be absolutely necessary to
the steam boat to enable it to stay out
at sea all that time and to perform its
voyage
fire water men that is all said
harry except provisions the usual
things which are carried for long voyages
we may take for granted are carried
true but there is something which
you have not yet named that is essential
said his father by essential i mean that
without which the thing cannot be
fire water men men fire water
repeated harry i can think nothing
else which you could say is essential i
heed not say men even one man could
regulate the engine i believe
what do you mean by regulate the
engine said his father
 i mean said harry he can supply
the boiler with water and the fire with
fuel fuel aye now i see what novi
mean father fuel there must be to keep
up the fire to boil the water to make the
steam so coals must be carried or wood
and great quantities but their weight we
need not mind on the water and with that
power steam you know father
 i know son but what will you do
about the bulk coals or wood or whatever
fuel be put on board your steam boat
must take up space calculate how
much
after o'oino through a calculation which
need not be here repeated harry groaned 
and acknowledged that unless the steamboat
were many times larger than any
that had ever been made it could not
afford space for the necessary quantity 
fuel
but why argued he should not a
vessel be made several times larger than
any we have seen 
a moment's reflection showed iii
that such increased bulk would require increased
strength to keep it together and
that again must bring increase weight
and difficulty managing the whole
still said harry though there is
this great difficulty about carrying the
fuel we should not give it up should we
father perhaps some those ingenious
men who first thought steam boats a
hundred years ago or even fifty years
ago imagined they should never succeed
and they were laughed at were not
they because they did not succeed at first
yet now oh if they were alive now 
and could see what their invention has
come to the admiration the whole
world therefore father i think people
should not mind being laughed at when
they know they are right and they should
not be stopped in their great discoveries by
little difficulties or great difficulties or any
sort difficulties but still go on trying
experiments and inventing till they come
to some impossibility and then they must
be quiet but not till then they need not
give up and they should not cried harry
right right my dear boy said his
father i am glad to see this spirit
rising in you 
harry was silent for a mile or two
and then exclaimed 
 father i am so glad you have no
 this morning to read in the carriage
because you have time to talk to me tell
me what accidents happened formerly in
the steam boats and how do people
prevent them now as the captain said they
can f
the principal accidents and the most
dangerous replied his father have been
the bursting the boilers if i recollect
rightly one which burst in an american
vessel killed several people and blew the
boat to pieces another which burst in
england scalded to death the persons in
the cabin who were near it
the sailor spoke truth then said
harry to that poor woman this morning
though i did not believe him he advised
her not to go on board the steam boat because
he said that many such accidents
have happened and happen very often
p 
 there he was wrong said harry's
father because he exaggerated but
few have occurred we have accounts 
them all and can therefore judge and
speak positively
i am glad it very very glad
cried harry now father about the
ways preventing them in future will
you tell me that
first lei me harry do you know the
difference between what is called malleable
or ivroueht iion and cast iron you saw
both and the difference was explained to
you when we were at the founder
i recollect it father replied harry
 cast iron is i believe that which has
been melted and made to run into the form
in which it is to be used malleable or
brought iron is that which is hammered
when it is heated into the shape whatever
it may be that is required
since you know this much harry i
can ofo on said his father it has been
found by many trials that hammered or
wrought iron is stronger than cast iron 
and better able to resist the expansive force
 steam those boilers steam engines
which burst were in almost all instances
made cast iron others wrought
iron have also in some cases given
way but even when they have they have
not exploded violently so as to do mischief
they have rent asunder and
opened so as to let out the steam inconsequence
 this experience boilers are
now generally made wrought iron this
is one cause increased safety
and a great one said harry
another step in improvement and
safety has been made continued his father
 by experience having proved to us
that though copper is rapidly destroyed by
alternate heating and cooling it is more
durable than iron for boilers steam vessels
at sea
copper stronger than iron father
cried harry i should never have thought
it was
 you do not repeat with your usual exactness
what i told you said his father
i did not assert that copper is in all circumstances
and for all purposes stronger
and more durable than iron i said that
it has been found to be more durable
when used as the boiler a steam engine
at sea
at sea repeated harry father
i know that you have some particular reason
for being so careful in the words 
what you say and in that emphasis you
laid upon sea
 find out my reason then said his father
perhaps said harry there may be
something in sea water which rusts iron
and so destroys it and perhaps that whatever
it may be does not rust and destroy
copper
just so harry but what is that
something you are acquainted with it
said his father
is it sea salt said harry which is
in the water 
yes harry a chemist has lately tried
experiments which have ascertained this
fact and in consequence these experiments
it has been decided that in
future the boilers should be made 
copper
how useful it is to try experiments 
said harry that settles what is truth
and there is no more doubting or disputing
that chemist was a sensible
man
and here is another large instance
harry said his father in which chemistry
has assisted the mechanic
true father said harry but there
is another question i want to ask you about
the paddle wheels what were the improvements
in them which those gentlemen
were talking 
i cannot explain them to you harry
said his father because you do not
know distinctly the difficulties and the
faults in the present construction and these
i cannot now describe to you you should
first see them in action in the water
and how and when can i do that 
said harry
not now when we are going in a
carriage on land said his father laughing
but some time or other we may be in a
boat within view a steam vessel
harry sighing repeated some time
or other is there any other great improvement
you could explain to me
his father yawned and said he began
to be weary his questions
only one thing more i have to say
said harry and you need not answer
the steam engine i saw this morning in
the boat takes up a great deal room if
it could be made to do as well in a smaller
compass what a great improvement how
comfortable it would be said harry
true said his father and how
comfortable it would be to me if you would
let me rest now
 poor father so i will thank you
i have quite tired you
 no harry but i did not sleep well
last night i drank too strong tea or
coffee
his father went to sleep and harry sat
as still as a mouse lest he should waken
him how tea or coffee could keep people
awake he did not know he pondered long
on that subject but was never the wiser 
he had never yet been kept awake by
either when the carriage stopped and
not till then his father wakened quite refreshed

when they got out their postillion begged
harry to stay a minute while he
fumbled for something in the side pockets
and then in the front pocket the carriage
it was here it should be here they
told me it was here muttered the postillion
while he continued his search with
his legs out and his body in the chaise 
at last in the sword case he found what he
had been told was there and he brought
out the cocoa nut which he put into
harry's hands telling him that a sailor
charged him not to forget it he said
that a mother and child sent it to him 
and the message was that it might
make him a cup some time or other and
had good milk in it if he could get it
out
the postillion was anxious to deliver
this message correctly for he said he
knew the woman who had been always
very kind to him
lucy who had been looking out the
window the inn watching for their return
heard what passed and saw the
cocoa nut with joy she ran to meet
harry and to learn from him who gave it
to him and to hear an account his adventures
these he told with all the details
she desired till he came to the moment
 the woman's crossing his passage
as he left the boat then pausing and
turning his cocoa nut about in every direction
he said he was ashamed to tell her
how crossly he had spoken
his father added yes harry you are
riofht to be ashamed i was ashamed for
you
i wonder you did not tell me so at the
time father said harry
i knew it would not do you any good
at the moment i thought you would recollect
it afterwards yourself as i find you
do and i hope the pain you now feel will
prevent you from doing the same sort 
thing again
 i hope it will said harry but when
that kind feeling comes over me it is so
disagreeable i do not know what i am doing
or saying and i am angry with myself
and with the people who speak tome
and with every body but the pain
 reproaching myself afterwards with
having been illnatured is worse still as i
feel now and i shall remember this and i
will try and conquer myself next time
 i am sure you will try and i am sure
you will do it said lucy
take the cocoa nut said harry putting
it into her hands we will not
open it yet pack it up somewhere forme

 men always talk packing up a thing
somewheres thought lucy and women
are to find where
it required lucy's best powers packing
to find a somewhere for the cocoa nut 
but she did at last stow it into the carpetbag
contrary to the prophecies all beholders

when they were leaving bristol they
stopped at a bookseller's to buy some 
or books to read in the carriage several
works were spread upon the counter in the
bookseller's shop for them to take their
choice harry and lucy read the title
pages some which their father and mother
allowed them to look over
we will dip here and there in the
books said harry and see whether they
look entertaining may we papa
 may we cut the leaves said lucy
peeping between two uncut pages
the showman with some hesitation
presented an ivory cutter to her telling her
that she was welcome to cut the leaves if
she would be so good as to take care not to
tear them he became at ease when he
saw her set about the operation perceivingshe
was used to it and dextrous but
care sat on the bookseller's brow considerate
when harry took up the ivory
knife he thought that he would tear away

like most other boys that he had seen
without heeding what mischief they did
if i make the least jag i will stop
and show it you sir you may depend
upon that said harry proudly
 you may trust to our honour whoever
jags first stops
very well said their father looking
up from the he was reading upon
that condition you may cut away
they were glad to see their father and
mother both caught by some new 
sitting down to read we shall have
good time said they to cut and dip
after each cutting half a volume they
showed the adores the books not the
slightest indenture appeared that could
by the most exact bookseller's eye be accounted
ajv all was smooth and fair
even to the inmost recess the dangerous
corner the quadruple page
 now we have cut enough said lucy
 let us dip three times harry and catch
what we may
harry seized upon one the books and
opened upon this passage which he read
aloud 
as the gloomy habitation my grandfather was
in was not to be long endured but from necessity
they were contriving other places safety for him
particularly one under a bed which drew out in a
ground floor in a room which my mother kept the
key she and the same man worked in the night
making a hole in the earth after lifting up the boards
which they did by scratching it up with their hands
not to make any noise till she left not a nail upon her
fingers she helping the man to carry the earth as
they dug it in a sheet on his back out at the window
into the garden he then made a box at his own
house large enough for her father to lie with bed
and bed clothes and bored holes in the boards for
air alien all this was finished for it was long
about she thought herself the happiest creature
alive
i have heard that before cried lucy
the lady grisell bailie mamma i
heard you reading it last winter to papa
oh mamma do you remember the diverting
part about the sheep's head i will
show it to you harry lend me the for
one minute but this is not the same 
you had continued she that was a
poem and there were notes to it here
is no poetry and i am very sorry i wish
i could see again that pretty description 
all that grisell did when she was a young
girl i am sure harry would like that
though it is poetry
shall i try said her mother i
think i can remember the lines you mean 
and well with ready hand and heart
each task toilsome duty taking
did one dear inmate take her part
the last asleep the earliest waking
her hands each nightly couch prepared
and frugal meal on which they fared 
unfolding spread the serve white
and deck'd the board with tankard bright
through fretted hose and garment rent
her tiny needle deftly went
till hateful penury so graced
was scarcely in their dwelling traced
with rev'rence to the old she clung
with sweet affection to the young
to her was crabbed lesson said
to her the sly petition made
to her was told each petty care 
to her was lisp'd the tardy prayer
metrical legends by joanna bailie
what time the urchin half undress
and half asleep was put to rest
thank you mamma i do like it
said harry
i am glad to see there is something
new in these memoirs grisell bailies
resumed lucy who had been looking over
the here is more than we had
in the notes to the poem pray mamma
pray buy this for the carriage
no my dear i will not buy it for
the carriage said her mother laughing 
but i will buy it for myself if you please
and i will read to you whatever can entertain
you
thank you mamma harry are not
you glad we are to have this said
lucy hey harry 
bnt harry made no answer he was intent
upon a passage in another 
which he had just opened
 what is it said lucy looking over
his shoulder oh i see the word steam
engine that is enough for him but now
harry do not choose a stupid 
no danger that miss this is
one the scotch novels said the shopman

 a novel harry said lucy how
did a steam engine get into it 
 i do not know said harry but i
know that i have found a fine character
 i will not tell you but you shall hear
it father would you be so kind as to
read it out to my mother and lucy
 why should not you be so kind
harry as to read it to them yourself
said his father
because father i cannot do justice toit
said harry and it is so good that i
could not bear to spoil it pray father
read it here is the 
his father read the following character
 the great inventor the steam enfine
 
 amidst this company stood mr watt the man
whose genius discovered the means multiplying our
national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond
his own stupendous powers calculation and combination
 bringing the treasures the abyss to the
summit the earth giving the feeble arm man
the momentum the afrite commanding manufactures
to arise as the rod the prophet produced
water in the desert affording the means dispensing
with that time and tide which wait for no man and
 sailing without that wind which defied the commands
and threats xerxes himself this potent commander
 the elements this abridger time and
space this magician whose cloudy machinery has
produced a change in the world the effects which
extraordinary as they are perhaps are only now beginning
to be felt was not only the most refined
man science the most successful combined 
powers and calculator numbers as adapted to
practical purposes was not only one the most
generally well informed but one the best and
kindest human beings
 
several gentlemen who had been reading
laid down their books to listen to this
eloquent and just eulogium when it
was finished and when the reader's voice
stopped there was silence for a moment
then a general burst admiration
who wrote it where is it whose
is it
all crowded round harry to look at the
 harry felt proud having found
out ybr himself and by himself what was

 
good it is scarcely necessary to say that
his father bought the work the parcel
was made up put into the carriage and
they drove on as soon as they were out
 the noisy streets harry and lucy seized
again upon this eager to know if there
was any thing more in it about mr watt
they found an account his powers 
pleasing in conversation and his great
variety knowledge
this struck harry with fresh admiration

 how i wish papa had known him 
cried lucy oh harry if you had
but seen him should not you have liked
it very much 
 i should not have cared for merely
seeing him said harry unless i could
have heard him and known him
they now began to question each other
which all the great people whom
they had ever heard or read they should
most wish to have seen and known and
then which they should have liked only
just to see which to have for acquaintvol
 q
once which for friends and which they
should like to live with always 
these questions brought on a great deal
 interesting and diverting discussion
during which papa and mamma were often
appealed to and in which they took their
share much to harry and lucy's delight
the number those with whom they
should choose to live which at first was
prodigious on lucy's part especially was
gradually reduced till at last it came down
to very few indeed not above five or
six
it was observed that harry who informer
times desired to see only great
mechanics now desired to know great
chemists too and all sorts sensible and
inventing people as he said
this was one good consequence as lucy
remarked their having lately travelled
so much but tomorrow harry continued
she is to be the last day's travelling
are you glad or sorry harry i do
not know which i am myself partly glad
partly sorry t feel sorry that the journey
will be at an because i like travelling
very much and seeing every day some
new and entertaining things and people
but i shall be glad for one great reason to
come to the our journey that we
may see the cottage by the seaside i
long to know what sort a looking cottage
it is do not you harry
yes said harry but above all i
wish to sea the ocean
and the sea shore cried lucy
 where i may pick up hundreds 
shells 
 and i hope i shall see ships said
harry
 and a boat with sails in which we
may sail sometimes said lucy
yes i should like that very much
said harrv i want to know more about
sails
 shoulder mutton sails especially
cried lucy which i remember reading
about in robinson crusoe i wonder what
they are 
her father sketched for her a shoulder
 mutton sail and she was rather disappointed
when she learned that the name
arose merely from the shape
the conversation was interrupted by the
sight a boat on a river but it had no
sails it was a ferry boat
at harry and lucy's age it was a real pleasure
to cross a ferry though to travellers
more advanced in years it may sometimes
be a pain or at least a trouble they
are apt to prefer a bridge

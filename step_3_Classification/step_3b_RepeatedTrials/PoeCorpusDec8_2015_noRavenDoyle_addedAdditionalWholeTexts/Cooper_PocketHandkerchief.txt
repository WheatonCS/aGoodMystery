autobiography of a pocket-handkerchief

certain moral philosophers with a due disdain of the flimsy
foundations of human pride have shown that every man is equally
descended from a million of ancestors within a given number of
generations thereby demonstrating that no prince exists who does not
participate in the blood of some beggar or any beggar who does not
share in the blood of princes although favored by a strictly vegetable
descent myself the laws of nature have not permitted me to escape from
the influence of this common rule the earliest accounts i possess of
my progenitors represent them as a goodly growth of the linum
usitatissimum divided into a thousand cotemporaneous plants
singularly well conditioned and remarkable for an equality that
renders the production valuable in this particular then i may be
said to enjoy a precedency over the bourbons themselves who now
govern no less than four different states of europe and who have sat
on thrones these thousand years

while our family has followed the general human law in the matter just
mentioned it forms a marked exception to the rule that so absolutely
controls all of white blood on this continent in what relates to
immigration and territorial origin when the american enters on the
history of his ancestors he is driven after some ten or twelve
generations at most to seek refuge in a country in europe whereas
exactly the reverse is the case with us our most remote extraction
being american while our more recent construction and education have
taken place in europe when i speak of the earliest accounts i possess
of my progenitors authentic information is meant only for like
other races we have certain dark legends that might possibly carry us
back again to the old world in quest of our estates and privileges
but in writing this history it has been my determination from the
first to record nothing but settled truths and to reject everything
in the shape of vague report or unauthenticated anecdote under these
limitations i have ever considered my family as american by origin
european by emigration and restored to its paternal soil by the
mutations and calculations of industry and trade

the glorious family of cotemporaneous plants from which i derive my
being grew in a lovely vale of connecticut and quite near to the
banks of the celebrated river of the same name this renders us
strictly yankee in our origin an extraction of which i find all who
enjoy it fond of boasting it is the only subject of self-felicitation
with which i am acquainted that men can indulge in without awakening
the envy of their fellow-creatures from which i infer it is at least
innocent if not commendable

we have traditions among us of the enjoyments of our predecessors as
they rioted in the fertility of their cis-atlantic field a happy
company of thriving and luxuriant plants still i shall pass them
over merely remarking that a bountiful nature has made such provision
for the happiness of all created things as enables each to rejoice in
its existence and to praise after its fashion and kind the divine
being to which it owes its creation

in due time the field in which my forefathers grew was gathered the
seed winnowed from the chaff and collected in casks when the whole
company was shipped for ireland now occurred one of those chances
which decide the fortunes of plants as well as those of men giving me
a claim to norman instead of milesian descent the embarkation or
shipment of my progenitors whichever may be the proper expression
occurred in the height of the last general war and for a novelty it
occurred in an english ship a french privateer captured the vessel on
her passage home the flaxseed was condemned and sold my ancestors
being transferred in a body to the ownership of a certain agriculturist
in the neighborhood of evreux who dealt largely in such articles
there have been evil disposed vegetables that have seen fit to reproach
us with this sale as a stigma on our family history but i have ever
considered it myself as a circumstance of which one has no more reason
to be ashamed than a d'uzes has to blush for the robberies of a baron
of the middle ages each is an incident in the progress of
civilization the man and the vegetable alike taking the direction
pointed out by providence for the fulfilment of his or its destiny


plants have sensation as well as animals the latter however have no
consciousness anterior to their physical births and very little
indeed for some time afterwards whereas a different law prevails as
respects us our mental conformation being such as to enable us to
refer our moral existence to a period that embraces the experience
reasoning and sentiments of several generations as respects logical
inductions for instance the linum usitatissimum draws as largely on
the intellectual acquisitions of the various epochas that belonged to
the three or four parent stems which preceded it as on its own in a
word that accumulated knowledge which man inherits by means of books
imparted and transmitted information schools colleges and
universities we obtain through more subtle agencies that are
incorporated with our organic construction and which form a species of
hereditary mesmerism a vegetable clairvoyance that enables us to see
with the eyes hear with the ears and digest with the understandings
of our predecessors



some of the happiest moments of my moral existence were thus obtained
while our family was growing in the fields of normandy it happened
that a distinguished astronomer selected a beautiful seat that was
placed on the very margin of our position as a favorite spot for his
observations and discourses from a recollection of the latter of
which in particular i still derive indescribable satisfaction it
seems as only yesterday   it is in fact fourteen long long years   that
i heard him thus holding forth to his pupils explaining the marvels of
the illimitable void and rendering clear to my understanding the vast
distance that exists between the being that created all things and the
works of his hands to those who live in the narrow circle of human
interests and human feelings there ever exists unheeded almost
unnoticed before their very eyes the most humbling proofs of their
own comparative insignificance in the scale of creation which in the
midst of their admitted mastery over the earth and all it contains it
would be well for them to consider if they would obtain just views of
what they are and what they were intended to be

i think i can still hear this learned and devout man   for his soul was
filled with devotion to the dread being that could hold a universe in
subjection to his will   dwelling with delight on all the discoveries
among the heavenly bodies that the recent improvements in science and
mechanics have enabled the astronomers to make fortunately he gave
his discourses somewhat of the progressive character of lectures
leading his listeners on as it might be step by step in a way to
render all easy to the commonest understanding thus it was i first
got accurate notions of the almost inconceivable magnitude of space to
which indeed it is probable there are no more positive limits than
there are a beginning and an end to eternity can these wonders be i
thought   and how pitiful in those who affect to reduce all things to
the level of their own powers of comprehension and their own
experience in practice let them exercise their sublime and boasted
reason i said to myself in endeavoring to comprehend infinity in any
thing and we will note the result if it be in space we shall find
them setting bounds to their illimitable void until ashamed of the
feebleness of their first effort it is renewed again and again only
to furnish new proofs of the insufficiency of any of earth even to
bring within the compass of their imaginations truths that all their
experiments inductions evidence and revelations compel them to admit

the moon has no atmosphere said our astronomer one day and if
inhabited at all it must be by beings constructed altogether
differently from ourselves nothing that has life either animal or
vegetable as we know them can exist without air and it follows that
nothing having life according to our views of it can exist in the
moon   or if any thing having life do exist there it must be under
such modifications of all our known facts as to amount to something
like other principles of being one side of that planet feels the
genial warmth of the sun for a fortnight while the other is for the
same period without it he continued that which feels the sun must
be a day of a heat so intense as to render it insupportable to us
while the opposite side on which the rays of the sun do not fall must
be masses of ice if water exist there to be congealed but the moon
has no seas so far as we can ascertain its surface representing one
of strictly volcanic origin the mountains being numerous to a
wonderful degree our instruments enable us to perceive craters with
the inner cones so common to all our own volcanoes giving reason to
believe in the activity of innumerable burning hills at some remote
period it is scarcely necessary to say that nothing we know could
live in the moon under these rapid and extreme transitions of heat and
cold to say nothing of the want of atmospheric air i listened to
this with wonder and learned to be satisfied with my station of what
moment was it to me in filling the destiny of the linum usitatissimum
whether i grew in a soil a little more or a little less fertile
whether my fibres attained the extremest fineness known to the
manufacturer or fell a little short of this excellence i was but a
speck among a myriad of other things produced by the hand of the
creator and all to conduce to his own wise ends and unequaled glory
it was my duty to live my time to be content and to proclaim the
praise of god within the sphere assigned to me could men or plants but
once elevate their thoughts to the vast scale of creation it would
teach them their own insignificance so plainly would so unerringly
make manifest the futility of complaints and the immense disparity
between time and eternity as to render the useful lesson of
contentment as inevitable as it is important

i remember that our astronomer one day spoke of the nature and
magnitude of the sun the manner that he chose to render clear to the
imagination of his hearers some just notions of its size though so
familiar to astronomers produced a deep and unexpected impression on
me our instruments he said are now so perfect and powerful as to
enable us to ascertain many facts of the deepest interest with near
approaches to positive accuracy the moon being the heavenly body much
the nearest to us of course we see farther into its secrets than into
those of any other planet we have calculated its distance from us at
 miles of course by doubling this distance and adding to it
the diameter of the earth we get the diameter of the circle or orbit
in which the moon moves around the earth in other words the diameter
of this orbit is about miles now could the sun be brought in
contact with this orbit and had the latter solidity to mark its
circumference it would be found that this circumference would include
but a little more than half the surface of one side of the sun the
diameter of which orb is calculated to be miles the sun is one
million three hundred and eighty-four thousand four hundred and
seventy-two times larger than the earth of the substance of the sun it
is not so easy to speak still it is thought though it is not certain
that we occasionally see the actual surface of this orb an advantage
we do not possess as respects any other of the heavenly bodies with
the exception of the moon and mars the light and warmth of the sun
probably exist in its atmosphere and the spots which are so often seen
on this bright orb are supposed to be glimpses of the solid mass of
the sun itself that are occasionally obtained through openings in this
atmosphere at all events this is the more consistent way of
accounting for the appearance of these spots you will get a better
idea of the magnitude of the sidereal system however by remembering
that in comparison with it the distances of our entire solar system
are as mere specks thus while our own change of positions is known to
embrace an orbit of about of miles it is nevertheless so
trifling as to produce no apparent change of position in thousands of
the fixed stars that are believed to be the suns of other systems some
conjecture even that all these suns with their several systems our
own included revolve around a common centre that is invisible to us
but which is the actual throne of god the comets that we note and
measure being heavenly messengers as it might be constantly passing
from one of these families of worlds to another

i remember that one of the astronomer's pupils asked certain
explanations here touching the planets that it was thought or rather
known that we could actually see and those of which the true surfaces
were believed to be concealed from us i have told you answered the
man of science that they are the moon mars and the sun both venus
and mercury are nearer to us than mars but their relative proximities
to the sun have some such effect on their surfaces as placing an
object near a strong light is known to have on its appearance we are
dazzled to speak popularly and cannot distinguish minutely with mars
it is different if this planet has any atmosphere at all it is one of
no great density and its orbit being without our own we can easily
trace on its surface the outlines of seas and continents it is even
supposed that the tinge of the latter is that of reddish sand-stone
like much of that known in our own world but more decided in tint
while two brilliant white spots at its poles are thought to be light
reflected from the snows of those regions rendered more conspicuous
or disappearing as they first emerge from a twelvemonths winter or
melt in a summer of equal duration

i could have listened forever to this astronomer whose lectures so
profoundly taught lessons of humility to the created and which were so
replete with silent eulogies on the power of the creator what was it
to me whether i were a modest plant of half a cubit in stature or the
proudest oak of the forest   man or vegetable my duty was clearly to
glorify the dread being who had produced all these marvels and to
fulfil my time in worship praise and contentment it mattered not
whether my impressions were derived through organs called ears and
were communicated by others called those of speech or whether each
function was performed by means of sensations and agencies too subtle
to be detected by ordinary means it was enough for me that i heard and
understood and felt the goodness and glory of god i may say that my
first great lessons in true philosophy were obtained in these lectures
where i learned to distinguish between the finite and infinite ceasing
to envy any while i inclined to worship one the benevolence of
providence is extended to all its creatures each receiving it in a
mode adapted to its own powers of improvement my destiny being toward
a communion with man   or rather with woman   i have ever looked upon
these silent communications with the astronomer as so much preparatory
schooling in order that my mind might be prepared for its own avenir
and not be blinded by an undue appreciation of the importance of its
future associates i know there are those who will sneer at the
supposition of a pocket-handkerchief possessing any mind or esprit at
all but let such have patience and read on when i hope it will be in
my power to demonstrate their error

it is scarcely necessary to dwell on the scenes which occurred between
the time i first sprang from the earth and that in which i was
pulled the latter was a melancholy day for me however arriving
prematurely as regarded my vegetable state since it was early
determined that i was to be spun into threads of unusual fineness i
will only say here that my youth was a period of innocent pleasures
during which my chief delight was to exhibit my simple but beautiful
flowers in honor of the hand that gave them birth

at the proper season the whole field was laid low when a scene of
hurry and confusion succeeded to which i find it exceedingly painful
to turn in memory the rotting was the most humiliating part of the
process which followed though in our case this was done in clear
running water and the crackling the most uncomfortable happily we
were spared the anguish which ordinarily accompanies breaking on the
wheel though we could not be said to have entirely escaped from all
its parade innocence was our shield and while we endured some of the
disgrace that attaches to mere forms we had that consolation of which
no cruelty or device can deprive the unoffending our sorrows were not
heightened by the consciousness of undeserving

there is a period which occurred between the time of being hatcheled
and that of being woven that it exceeds my powers to delineate all
around me seemed to be in a state of inextricable confusion out of
which order finally appeared in the shape of a piece of cambric of a
quality that brought the workmen far and near to visit it we were a
single family of only twelve in this rare fabric among which i
remember that i occupied the seventh place in the order of arrangement
and of course in the order of seniority also when properly folded and
bestowed in a comfortable covering our time passed pleasantly enough
being removed from all disagreeable sights and smells and lodged in a
place of great security and indeed of honor men seldom failing to
bestow this attention on their valuables


it is out of my power to say precisely how long we remained in this
passive state in the hands of the manufacturer it was some weeks
however if not months during which our chief communications were on
the chances of our future fortunes some of our number were ambitious
and would hear to nothing but the probability nay the certainty of
our being purchased as soon as our arrival in paris should be made
known by the king in person and presented to the dauphine then the
first lady in france the virtues of the duchesse d'angouleme were
properly appreciated by some of us while i discovered that others
entertained for her any feelings but those of veneration and respect
this diversity of opinion on a subject of which one would think none
of us very well qualified to be judges was owing to a circumstance of
such every-day occurrence as almost to supersede the necessity of
telling it though the narrative would be rendered more complete by an
explanation

it happened while we lay in the bleaching grounds that one half of
the piece extended into a part of the field that came under the
management of a legitimist while the other invaded the dominions of a
liberal neither of these persons had any concern with us we being
under the special superintendence of the head workman but it was
impossible altogether impossible to escape the consequences of our
locales while the legitimist read nothing but the moniteur the
liberal read nothing but le temps a journal then recently established
in the supposed interests of human freedom each of these individuals
got a paper at a certain hour which he read with as much manner as he
could command and with singular perseverance as related to the
difficulties to be overcome to a clientele of bleachers who reasoned
as he reasoned swore by his oaths and finally arrived at all his
conclusions the liberals had the best of it as to numbers and
possibly as to wit the moniteur possessing all the dullness of
official dignity under all the dynasties and ministries that have
governed france since its establishment my business however is with
the effect produced on the pocket-handkerchiefs and not with that
produced on the laborers the two extremes were regular cotes gauches
and cotes droits in other words all at the right end of the piece
became devoted bourbonists devoutly believing that princes who were
daily mentioned with so much reverence and respect could be nothing
else but perfect while the opposite extreme were disposed to think
that nothing good could come of nazareth in this way four of our
number became decided politicians not only entertaining a sovereign
contempt for the sides they respectively opposed but beginning to feel
sensations approaching to hatred for each other


the reader will readily understand that these feelings lessened toward
the centre of the piece acquiring most intensity at the extremes i
may be said myself to have belonged to the centre gauche that being
my accidental position in the fabric when it was a natural consequence
to obtain sentiments of this shade it will be seen in the end how
prominent were these early impressions and how far it is worth while
for mere pocket-handkerchiefs to throw away their time and permit
their feelings to become excited concerning interests that they are
certainly not destined to control and about which under the most
favorable circumstances they seldom obtain other than very
questionable information

it followed from this state of feeling that the notion we were about
to fall into the hands of the unfortunate daughter of louis xvi excited
considerable commotion and disgust among us though very moderate in my
political antipathies and predilections i confess to some excitement
in my own case declaring that if royalty was to be my lot i would
prefer not to ascend any higher on the scale than to become the
property of that excellent princess amelie who then presided in the
palais royal the daughter and sister of a king but with as little
prospects as desires of becoming a queen in her own person this wish
of mine was treated as groveling and even worse than republican by
the cote droit of our piece while the cote gauche sneered at it as
manifesting a sneaking regard for station without the spirit to avow
it both were mistaken however no unworthy sentiments entering into
my decision accident had made me acquainted with the virtues of this
estimable woman and i felt assured that she would treat even a
pocket-handkerchief kindly this early opinion has been confirmed by
her deportment under very trying and unexpected events i wish as i
believe she wishes herself she had never been a queen


all our family did not aspire as high as royalty some looked forward
to the glories of a banker's daughter's trousseau   we all understood
that our price would be too high for any of the old nobility   while
some even fancied that the happiness of traveling in company was
reserved for us before we should be called regularly to enter on the
duties of life as we were so closely connected and on the whole were
affectionate as became brothers and sisters it was the common wish
that we might not be separated but go together into the same wardrobe
let it be foreign or domestic that of prince or plebeian there were a
few among us who spoke of the duchesse de berri as our future mistress
but the notion prevailed that we should so soon pass into the hands of
a femme de chambre as to render the selection little desirable in the
end we wisely and philosophically determined to await the result with
patience well knowing that we were altogether in the hands of caprice
and fashion

at length the happy moment arrived when we were to quit the warehouse
of the manufacturer let what would happen this was a source of joy
inasmuch as we all knew that we could only vegetate while we continued
where we then were and that too without experiencing the delights of
our former position with good roots in the earth a genial sun
shedding its warmth upon our bosom and balmy airs fanning our cheeks
we loved change too like other people and had probably seen enough
of vegetation whether figurative or real to satisfy us our departure
from picardie took place in june and we reached paris on the
first day of the succeeding month we went through the formalities of
the custom-houses or barrieres the same day and the next morning we
were all transferred to a celebrated shop that dealt in articles of our
genus most of the goods were sent on drays to the magazin but our
reputation having preceded us we were honored with a fiacre making
the journey between the douane and the shop on the knee of a
confidential commissionaire


great was the satisfaction of our little party as we first drove down
through the streets of this capital of europe   the centre of fashion
and the abode of elegance our natures had adapted themselves to
circumstances and we no longer pined for the luxuries of the linum
usitatissimum but were ready to enter into all the pleasures of our
new existence which we well understood was to be one of pure parade
for no handkerchief of our quality was ever employed on any of the more
menial offices of the profession we might occasionally brush a lady's
cheek or conceal a blush or a smile but the usitatissimum had been
left behind us in the fields the fiacre stopped at the door of a
celebrated perfumer and the commissionaire deeming us of too much
value to be left on a carriage seat took us in her hand while she
negotiated a small affair with its mistress this was our introduction
to the pleasant association of sweet odors of which it was to be our
fortune to enjoy in future the most delicate and judicious communion
we knew very well that things of this sort were considered vulgar
unless of the purest quality and used with the tact of good society
but still it was permitted to sprinkle a very little lavender or
exquisite eau de cologne on a pocket-handkerchief the odor of these
two scents therefore appeared quite natural to us and as madame
savon never allowed any perfume or articles as these things are
technically termed of inferior quality to pollute her shop we had no
scruples about inhaling the delightful fragrance that breathed in the
place desiree the commissionaire could not depart without permitting
her friend madame savon to feast her eyes on the treasure in her own
hands the handkerchiefs were unfolded amidst a hundred dieux ciels
and dames our fineness and beauty were extolled in a manner that was
perfectly gratifying to the self-esteem of the whole family madame
savon imagined that even her perfumes would be more fragrant in such
company and she insisted on letting one drop   a single drop   of her
eau de cologne fall on the beautiful texture i was the happy
handkerchief that was thus favored and long did i riot in that
delightful odor which was just strong enough to fill the air with
sensations rather than impressions of all that is sweet and womanly in
the female wardrobe


notwithstanding this accidental introduction to one of the nicest
distinctions of good society and the general exhilaration that
prevailed in our party i was far from being perfectly happy to own
the truth i had left my heart in picardie i do not say i was in love
i am far from certain that there is any precedent for a
pocket-handkerchief's being in love at all and i am quite sure that
the sensations i experienced were different from those i have since had
frequent occasion to hear described the circumstances which called
them forth were as follows

the manufactory in which our family was fabricated was formerly known
as the chateau de la rocheaimard and had been the property of the
vicomte de la rocheaimard previously to the revolution that overturned
the throne of louis xvi the vicomte and his wife joined the royalists
at coblentz and the former with his only son adrien de la
rocheaimard or the chevalier de la rocheaimard as he was usually
termed had joined the allies in their attempted invasion on the soil
of france the vicomte a marechal du camp had fallen in battle but
the son escaped and passed his youth in exile marrying a few years
later a cousin whose fortunes were at as low an ebb as his own one
child adrienne was the sole issue of this marriage having been born
in the year both the parents died before the restoration leaving
the little girl to the care of her pious grandmother la vicomtesse
who survived in a feeble old age to descant on the former grandeur of
her house and to sigh in common with so many others for le bon vieux
temps at the restoration there was some difficulty in establishing
the right of the de la rocheaimards to their share of the indemnity a
difficulty i never heard explained but which was probably owing to the
circumstance that there was no one in particular to interest themselves
in the matter but an old woman of sixty-five and a little girl of
four such appellants unsupported by money interest or power seldom
make out a very strong case for reparation of any sort in this
righteous world of ours and had it not been for the goodness of the
dauphine it is probable that the vicomtesse and her grand-daughter
would have been reduced to downright beggary but the daughter of the
late king got intelligence of the necessities of the two descendants of
crusaders and a pension of two thousand francs a year was granted en
attendant


four hundred dollars a year does not appear a large sum even to the
nouveaux riches of america but it sufficed to give adrienne and her
grandmother a comfortable and even a respectable subsistence in the
provinces it was impossible for them to inhabit the chateau now
converted into a workshop and filled with machinery but lodgings were
procured in its immediate vicinity here madame de la rocheaimard
whiled away the close of a varied and troubled life if not in absolute
peace still not in absolute misery while her grand-daughter grew into
young womanhood a miracle of goodness and pious devotion to her sole
surviving parent the strength of the family tie in france and its
comparative weakness in america has been the subject of frequent
comment among travelers i do not know that all which has been said is
rigidly just but i am inclined to think that much of it is and as i
am now writing to americans and of french people i see no particular
reason why the fact should be concealed respect for years deference
to the authors of their being and submission to parental authority are
inculcated equally by the morals and the laws of france the conseilles
de famille is a beautiful and wise provision of the national code and
aids greatly in maintaining that system of patriarchal rule which lies
at the foundation of the whole social structure alas in the case of
the excellent adrienne this conseille de famille was easily assembled
and possessed perfect unanimity the wars the guillotine and exile had
reduced it to two one of which was despotic in her government so far
as theory was concerned at least possibly at times a little so in
practice still adrienne on the whole grew up tolerably happy she was
taught most that is suitable for a gentlewoman without being crammed
with superfluous accomplishments and aided by the good cure a man
who remembered her grandfather had both polished and stored her mind
her manners were of the excellent tone that distinguished the good
society of paris before the revolution being natural quiet simple
and considerate she seldom laughed i fear but her smiles were
sweetness and benevolence itself


the bleaching grounds of our manufactory were in the old park of the
chateau thither mad de la rocheaimard was fond of coming in the fine
mornings of june for many of the roses and lovely persian lilacs that
once abounded there still remained i first saw adrienne in one of
these visits the quality of our little family circle attracting her
attention one of the bleachers indeed was an old servant of the
vicomte's and it was a source of pleasure to him to point out any
thing to the ladies that he thought might prove interesting this was
the man who so diligently read the moniteur giving a religious
credence to all it contained he fancied no hand so worthy to hold
fabrics of such exquisite fineness as that of mademoiselle adrienne
and it was through his assiduity that i had the honor of being first
placed within the gentle pressure of her beautiful little fingers this
occurred about a month before our departure for paris

adrienne de la rocheaimard was then just twenty her beauty was of a
character that is not common in france but which when it does exist
is nowhere surpassed she was slight and delicate in person of fair
hair and complexion and with the meekest and most dove-like blue eyes
i ever saw in a female face her smile too was of so winning and
gentle a nature as to announce a disposition pregnant with all the
affections still it was well understood that adrienne was not likely
to marry her birth raising her above all intentions of connecting her
ancient name with mere gold while her poverty placed an almost
insuperable barrier between her and most of the impoverished young men
of rank whom she occasionally saw even the power of the dauphine was
not sufficient to provide adrienne de la rocheaimard with a suitable
husband but of this the charming girl never thought she lived more
for her grandmother than for herself and so long as that venerated
relative almost the only one that remained to her on earth did not
suffer or repine she herself could be comparatively happy

dans le bon vieux temps said the vicomtesse examining me through
her spectacles and addressing georges who stood hat in hand to
hearken to her wisdom dans le bon vieux temps mon ami the ladies of
the chateau did not want for these things there were six dozen in my
corbeille that were almost as fine as this as for the trousseau i
believe it had twice the number but very little inferior

i remember that madame georges always gave his old mistress this
title of honor kept many of the beautiful garments of her trousseau
untouched down to the melancholy period of the revolution

it has been a mine of wealth to me georges in behalf of that dear
child you may remember that this trousseau was kept in the old
armoire on the right hand side of the little door of my
dressing-room   

madame la vicomtesse will have the goodness to pardon me   it was on
the left hand side of the room   monsieur's medals were kept in the
opposite armoire

our good georges is right adrienne   he has a memory your
grandfather insisted on keeping his medals in my dressing-room as he
says well monsieur georges left or right there i left the remains
of my trousseau when i fled from france and there i found it untouched
on my return the manufactory had saved the chateau and the
manufacturers had spared my wardrobe its sale and its materials have
done much toward rendering that dear child respectable and well clad
since our return

i thought the slight color which usually adorned the fair oval cheeks
of adrienne deepened a little at this remark and i certainly felt a
little tremor in the hand which held me but it could not have been
shame as the sweet girl often alluded to her poverty in a way so
simple and natural as to prove that she had no false feelings on that
subject and why should she poverty ordinarily causes no such
sensations to those who are conscious of possessing advantages of an
order superior to wealth and surely a well-educated well-born
virtuous girl need not have blushed because estates were torn from her
parents by a political convulsion that had overturned an ancient and
powerful throne





from this time the charming adrienne frequently visited the bleaching
grounds always accompanied by her grandmother the presence of georges
was an excuse but to watch the improvement in our appearance was the
reason never before had adrienne seen a fabric as beautiful as our
own and as i afterwards discovered she was laying by a few francs
with the intention of purchasing the piece and of working and
ornamenting the handkerchiefs in order to present them to her
benefactress the dauphine mad de la rocheaimard was pleased with
this project it was becoming in a de la rocheaimard and they soon
began to speak of it openly in their visits fifteen or twenty
napoleons might do it and the remains of the recovered trousseau would
still produce that sum it is probable this intention would have been
carried out but for a severe illness that attacked the dear girl
during which her life was even despaired of i had the happiness of
hearing of her gradual recovery however before we commenced our
journey though no more was said of the purchase perhaps it was as
well as it was for by this time such a feeling existed in our
extreme cote gauche that it may be questioned if the handkerchiefs of
that end of the piece would have behaved themselves in the wardrobe of
the dauphine with the discretion and prudence that are expected from
every thing around the person of a princess of her exalted rank and
excellent character it is true none of us understood the questions at
issue but that only made the matter worse the violence of all
dissensions being very generally in proportion to the ignorance and
consequent confidence of the disputants


i could not but remember adrienne as the commissionaire laid us down
before the eyes of the wife of the head of the firm in the rue de
     we were carefully examined and pronounced parfaits still it
was not in the sweet tones and with the sweeter smiles of the polished
and gentle girl we had left in picardie there was a sentiment in her
admiration that touched all our hearts even to the most exaggerated
republican among us for she seemed to go deeper in her examination of
merits than the mere texture and price she saw her offering in our
beauty the benevolence of the dauphine in our softness her own
gratitude in our exquisite fineness and princely munificence in our
delicacy in a word she could enter into the sentiment of a
pocket-handkerchief alas how different was the estimation in which we
were held by desiree and her employers with them it was purely a
question of francs and we had not been in the magazin five minutes
when there was a lively dispute whether we were to be put at a certain
number of napoleons or one napoleon more a good deal was said about
mad la duchesse and i found that it was expected that a certain lady
of that rank one who had enjoyed the extraordinary luck of retaining
her fortune being of an old and historical family and who was at the
head of fashion in the faubourg would become the purchaser at all
events it was determined no one should see us until this lady returned
to town she being at the moment at rosny with madame whence she was
expected to accompany that princess to dieppe to come back to her
hotel in the rue de bourbon about the last of october here then
were we doomed to three months of total seclusion in the heart of the
gayest capital of europe it was useless to repine and we determined
among ourselves to exercise patience in the best manner we could


accordingly we were safely deposited in a particular drawer along
with a few other favorite articles that like our family were
reserved for the eyes of certain distinguished but absent customers
these specialites in trade are of frequent occurrence in paris and
form a pleasant bond of union between the buyer and seller which gives
a particular zest to this sort of commerce and not unfrequently a
particular value to goods to see that which no one else has seen and
to own that which no one else can own are equally agreeable and
delightfully exclusive all minds that do not possess the natural
sources of exclusion are fond of creating them by means of a
subordinate and more artificial character

on the whole i think we enjoyed our new situation rather than
otherwise the drawer was never opened it is true but that next it
was in constant use and certain crevices beneath the counter enabled
us to see a little and to hear more of what passed in the magazin we
were in a part of the shop most frequented by ladies and we overheard
a few tete-a-tetes that were not without amusement these generally
related to cancans paris is a town in which cancans do not usually
flourish their proper theatre being provincial and trading places
beyond a question still there are cancans at paris for all sorts of
persons frequent that centre of civilization the only difference is
that in the social pictures offered by what are called cities the
cancans are in the strongest light and in the most conspicuous of the
grouping whereas in paris they are kept in shadow and in the
background still there are cancans at paris and cancans we overheard
and precisely in the manner i have related did pretty ladies remember
that pocket-handkerchiefs have ears they might possibly have more
reserve in the indulgence of this extraordinary propensity


we had been near a month in the drawer when i recognized a female
voice near us that i had often heard of late speaking in a confident
and decided tone and making allusions that showed she belonged to the
court i presume her position there was not of the most exalted kind
yet it was sufficiently so to qualify her in her own estimation to
talk politics les ordonnances were in her mouth constantly and it
was easy to perceive that she attached the greatest importance to these
ordinances whatever they were and fancied a political millennium was
near the shop was frequented less than usual that day the next it was
worse still in the way of business and the clerks began to talk loud
also about les ordonnances the following morning neither windows nor
doors were opened and we passed a gloomy time of uncertainty and
conjecture there were ominous sounds in the streets some of us
thought we heard the roar of distant artillery at length the master
and mistress appeared by themselves in the shop money and papers were
secured and the female was just retiring to an inner room when she
suddenly came back to the counter opened our drawer seized us with no
very reverent hands and the next thing we knew the whole twelve of
us were thrust into a trunk upstairs and buried in egyptian darkness
from that moment all traces of what was occurring in the streets of
paris were lost to us after all it is not so very disagreeable to be
only a pocket-handkerchief in a revolution


our imprisonment lasted until the following december as our feelings
had become excited on the questions of the day as well as those of
other irrational beings around us we might have passed a most
uncomfortable time in the trunk but for one circumstance so great had
been the hurry of our mistress in thus shutting us up that we had been
crammed in in a way to leave it impossible to say which was the cote
droit and which the cote gauche thus completely deranged as parties
we took to discussing philosophical matters in general an occupation
well adapted to a situation that required so great an exercise of
discretion

one day when we least expected so great a change our mistress came in
person searched several chests trunks and drawers and finally
discovered us where she had laid us with her own hands near four
months before it seems that in her hurry and fright she had actually
forgotten in what nook we had been concealed we were smoothed with
care our political order reestablished and then we were taken below
and restored to the dignity of the select circle in the drawer already
mentioned this was like removing to a fashionable square or living in
a beau quartier of a capital it was even better than removing from
east broadway into bona fide real unequaled league-long eighty feet
wide broadway



we now had an opportunity of learning some of the great events that had
recently occurred in france and which still troubled europe the
bourbons were again dethroned as it was termed and another bourbon
seated in their place it would seem il y a bourbon et bourbon the
result has since shown that what is bred in the bone will break out in
the flesh commerce was at a standstill our master passed half his
time under arms as a national guard in order to keep the
revolutionists from revolutionizing the revolution the great families
had laid aside their liveries some of them their coaches most of them
their arms pocket-handkerchiefs of our calibre would be thought
decidedly aristocratic and aristocracy in paris just at that moment
was almost in as bad odor as it is in america where it ranks as an
eighth deadly sin though no one seems to know precisely what it means
in the latter country an honest development of democracy is certain to
be stigmatized as tainted with this crime no governor would dare to
pardon it


the groans over the state of trade were loud and deep among those who
lived by its innocent arts still the holidays were near and hope
revived if revolutionized paris would not buy as the jour de l'an
approached paris must have a new dynasty the police foresaw this
and it ceased to agitate in order to bring the republicans into
discredit men must eat and trade was permitted to revive a little
alas how little do they who vote know why they vote or they who dye
their hands in the blood of their kind why the deed has been done


the duchesse had not returned to paris neither had she emigrated like
most of the high nobility who rightly enough believed that
primogeniture and birth were of the last importance to them she
preferred to show her distaste for the present order of things by
which the youngest prince of a numerous family had been put upon the
throne of the oldest by remaining at her chateau all expectations of
selling us to her were abandoned and we were thrown fairly into the
market on the great principle of liberty and equality this was as
became a republican reign

our prospects were varied daily the dauphine madame and all the de
rochefoucaulds de la tremouilles de grammonts de rohans de
crillons c c were out of the question the royal family were in
england the orleans branch excepted and the high nobility were very
generally on their high ropes or a bouder as for the bankers
their reign had not yet fairly commenced previously to july 
this estimable class of citizens had not dared to indulge their native
tastes for extravagance and parade the grave dignity and high breeding
of a very ancient but impoverished nobility holding them in some
restraint and then their fortunes were still uncertain the funds
were not firm and even the honorable and worthy jacques lafitte a man
to ennoble any calling was shaking in credit had we been brought into
the market a twelvemonth later there is no question that we should
have been caught up within a week by the wife or daughter of some of
the operatives at the bourse


as it was however we enjoyed ample leisure for observation and
thought again and again were we shown to those who it was thought
could not fail to yield to our beauty but no one would purchase all
appeared to eschew aristocracy even in their pocket-handkerchiefs the
day the fleurs de lys were cut out of the medallions of the treasury
and the king laid down his arms i thought our mistress would have had
the hysterics on our account little did she understand human nature
for the nouveaux riches who are as certain to succeed an old and
displaced class of superiors as hungry flies to follow flies with full
bellies would have been much more apt to run into extravagance and
folly than persons always accustomed to money and who did not depend
on its exhibition for their importance a day of deliverance
notwithstanding was at hand which to me seemed like the bridal of a
girl dying to rush into the dissipations of society


the holidays were over without there being any material revival of
trade when my deliverance unexpectedly occurred it was in february
and i do believe our mistress had abandoned the expectation of
disposing of us that season when i heard a gentle voice speaking near
the counter one day in tones which struck me as familiar it was a
female of course and her inquiries were about a piece of cambric
handkerchiefs which she said had been sent to this shop from a
manufactory in picardie there was nothing of the customary alertness
in the manner of our mistress and to my surprise she even showed the
customer one or two pieces of much inferior quality before we were
produced the moment i got into the light however i recognized the
beautifully turned form and sweet face of adrienne de la rocheaimard
the poor girl was paler and thinner than when i had last seen her
doubtless i thought the effects of her late illness but i could not
conceal from myself the unpleasant fact that she was much less
expensively clad i say less expensively clad though the expression is
scarcely just for i had never seen her in attire that could properly
be called expensive at all and yet the term mean would be equally
inapplicable to her present appearance it might be better to say that
relieved by a faultless even a fastidious neatness and grace there
was an air of severe perhaps of pinched economy in her present attire
this it was that had prevented our mistress from showing her fabrics as
fine as we on the first demand still i thought there was a slight
flush on the cheek of the poor girl and a faint smile on her features
as she instantly recognized us for old acquaintances for one i own i
was delighted at finding her soft fingers again brushing over my own
exquisite surface feeling as if one had been expressly designed for
the other then adrienne hesitated she appeared desirous of speaking
and yet abashed her color went and came until a deep rosy blush
settled on each cheek and her tongue found utterance

would it suit you madame she asked as if dreading a repulse to
part with one of these

your pardon mademoiselle handkerchiefs of this quality are seldom
sold singly

i feared as much   and yet i have occasion for only one it is to be
worked   if it   

the words came slowly and they were spoken with difficulty at that
last uttered the sound of the sweet girl's voice died entirely away i
fear it was the dullness of trade rather than any considerations of
benevolence that induced our mistress to depart from her rule

the price of each handkerchief is five and twenty francs
mademoiselle   she had offered the day before to sell us to the wife
of one of the richest agents de change in paris at a napoleon a
piece   the price is five and twenty francs if you take the dozen but
as you appear to wish only one rather than not oblige you it may be
had for eight and twenty


there was a strange mixture of sorrow and delight in the countenance of
adrienne but she did not hesitate and attracted by the odor of the
eau de cologne she instantly pointed me out as the handkerchief she
selected our mistress passed her scissors between me and my neighbor
of the cote gauche and then she seemed instantly to regret her own
precipitation before making the final separation from the piece she
delivered herself of her doubts

it is worth another franc mademoiselle she said to cut a
handkerchief from the centre of the piece

the pain of adrienne was now too manifest for concealment that she
ardently desired the handkerchief was beyond dispute and yet there
existed some evident obstacle to her wishes

i fear i have not so much money with me madame she said pale as
death for all sense of shame was lost in intense apprehension still
her trembling hands did their duty and her purse was produced a gold
napoleon promised well but it had no fellow seven more francs
appeared in single pieces then two ten-sous were produced after which
nothing remained but copper the purse was emptied and the reticule
rummaged the whole amounting to just twenty-eight francs seven sous



i have no more madame said adrienne in a faint voice

the woman who had been trained in the school of suspicion looked
intently at the other for an instant and then she swept the money
into her drawer content with having extorted from this poor girl more
than she would have dared to ask of the wife of the agent de change
adrienne took me up and glided from the shop as if she feared her dear
bought prize would yet be torn from her i confess my own delight was
so great that i did not fully appreciate at the time all the hardship
of the case it was enough to be liberated to get into the fresh air
to be about to fulfill my proper destiny i was tired of that sort of
vegetation in which i neither grew nor was watered by tears nor could
i see those stars on which i so much doated and from which i had
learned a wisdom so profound the politics too were rendering our
family unpleasant the cote droit was becoming supercilious   it had
always been illogical while the cote gauche was just beginning to
discover that it had made a revolution for other people then it was
happiness itself to be with adrienne and when i felt the dear girl
pressing me to her heart by an act of volition of which
pocket-handkerchiefs are little suspected i threw up a fold of my
gossamer-like texture as if the air wafted me and brushed the first
tear of happiness from her eye that she had shed in months


the reader may be certain that my imagination was all alive to
conjecture the circumstances which had brought adrienne de la
rocheaimard to paris and why she had been so assiduous in searching me
out in particular could it be that the grateful girl still intended
to make her offering to the duchesse de d'angouleme ah no   that
princess was in exile while her sister was forming weak plots in
behalf of her son which a double treachery was about to defeat i have
already hinted that pocket-handkerchiefs do not receive and communicate
ideas by means of the organs in use among human beings they possess a
clairvoyance that is always available under favorable circumstances in
their case the mesmeritic trance may be said to be ever in existence
while in the performance of their proper functions it is only while
crowded into bales or thrust into drawers for the vulgar purposes of
trade that this instinct is dormant a beneficent nature scorning to
exercise her benevolence for any but legitimate objects i now mean
legitimacy as connected with cause and effect and nothing political or
dynastic


by virtue of this power i had not long been held in the soft hand of
adrienne or pressed against her beating heart without becoming the
master of all her thoughts as well as her various causes of hope and
fear this knowledge did not burst upon me at once it is true as is
pretended to be the case with certain somnambules for with me there is
no empiricism   every thing proceeds from cause to effect and a little
time with some progressive steps was necessary to make me fully
acquainted with the whole the simplest things became the first
apparent and others followed by a species of magnetic induction which
i cannot now stop to explain when this tale is told i propose to
lecture on the subject to which all the editors in the country will
receive the usual free tickets when the world cannot fail of knowing
quite as much at least as these meritorious public servants


the first fact that i learned was the very important one that the
vicomtesse had lost all her usual means of support by the late
revolution and the consequent exile of the dauphine this blow so
terrible to the grandmother and her dependent child had occurred too
most inopportunely as to time a half year's pension was nearly due at
the moment the great change occurred and the day of payment arrived
and passed leaving these two females literally without twenty francs
had it not been for the remains of the trousseau both must have
begged or perished of want the crisis called for decision and
fortunately the old lady who had already witnessed so many
vicissitudes had still sufficient energy to direct their proceedings
paris was the best place in which to dispose of her effects and
thither she and adrienne came without a moment's delay the shops were
first tried but the shops in the autumn of offered indifferent
resources for the seller valuable effects were there daily sold for a
twentieth part of their original cost and the vicomtesse saw her
little stores diminish daily for the mont de piete was obliged to
regulate its own proceedings by the received current values of the day
old age vexation and this last most cruel blow did not fail of
effecting that which might have been foreseen the vicomtesse sunk
under this accumulation of misfortunes and became bed-ridden
helpless and querulous every thing now devolved on the timid gentle
unpracticed adrienne all females of her condition in countries
advanced in civilization like france look to the resource of imparting
a portion of what they themselves have acquired to others of their own
sex in moments of urgent necessity the possibility of adrienne's
being compelled to become a governess or a companion had long been
kept in view but the situation of mad de la rocheaimard forbade any
attempt of the sort for the moment had the state of the country
rendered it at all probable that a situation could have been procured
on this fearful exigency adrienne had aroused all her energies and
gone deliberately into the consideration of her circumstances


poverty had compelled mad de la rocheaimard to seek the cheapest
respectable lodgings she could find on reaching town in anticipation
of a long residence and for the consideration of a considerable
abatement in price she had fortunately paid six months rent in
advance thus removing from adrienne the apprehension of having no
place in which to cover her head for some time to come these lodgings
were in an entresol of the place royale a perfectly reputable and
private part of the town and in many respects were highly eligible
many of the menial offices too were to be performed by the wife of
the porter according to the bargain leaving to poor adrienne
however all the care of her grandmother whose room she seldom
quitted the duties of nurse and cook and the still more important
task of finding the means of subsistence

for quite a month the poor desolate girl contrived to provide for her
grandmother's necessities by disposing of the different articles of
the trousseau this store was now nearly exhausted and she had found a
milliner who gave her a miserable pittance for toiling with her needle
eight or ten hours each day adrienne had not lost a moment but had
begun this system of ill-requited industry long before her money was
exhausted she foresaw that her grandmother must die and the great
object of her present existence was to provide for the few remaining
wants of this only relative during the brief time she had yet to live
and to give her decent and christian burial of her own future lot the
poor girl thought as little as possible though fearful glimpses would
obtrude themselves on her uneasy imagination at first she had employed
a physician but her means could not pay for his visits nor did the
situation of her grandmother render them very necessary he promised to
call occasionally without fee and for a short time he kept his word
but his benevolence soon wearied of performing offices that really were
not required by the end of a month adrienne saw him no more

as long as her daily toil seemed to supply her own little wants
adrienne was content to watch on weep on pray on in waiting for the
moment she so much dreaded that which was to sever the last tie she
appeared to possess on earth it is true she had a few very distant
relatives but they had emigrated to america at the commencement of
the revolution of and all trace of them had long been lost in
point of fact the men were dead and the females were grandmothers
with english names and were almost ignorant of any such persons as the
de la rocheaimards from these adrienne had nothing to expect to her
they were as beings in another planet but the trousseau was nearly
exhausted and the stock of ready money was reduced to a single
napoleon and a little change it was absolutely necessary to decide on
some new scheme for a temporary subsistence and that without delay

among the valuables of the trousseau was a piece of exquisite lace
that had never been even worn the vicomtesse had a pride in looking at
it for it showed the traces of her former wealth and magnificence and
she would never consent to part with it adrienne had carried it once
to her employer the milliner with the intention of disposing of it
but the price offered was so greatly below what she knew to be the true
value that she would not sell it her own wardrobe however was going
fast nothing disposable remained of her grandmother's and this piece
of lace must be turned to account in some way while reflecting on
these dire necessities adrienne remembered our family she knew to
what shop we had been sent in paris and she now determined to purchase
one of us to bestow on the handkerchief selected some of her own
beautiful needle work to trim it with this lace and by the sale to
raise a sum sufficient for all her grandmother's earthly wants

generous souls are usually ardent their hopes keep pace with their
wishes and as adrienne had heard that twenty napoleons were sometimes
paid by the wealthy for a single pocket-handkerchief when thus
decorated she saw a little treasure in reserve before her mind's eye

i can do the work in two months she said to herself by taking the
time i have used for exercise and by severe economy by eating less
myself and working harder we can make out to live that time on what
we have

this was the secret of my purchase and the true reason why this lovely
girl had literally expended her last sou in making it the cost had
materially exceeded her expectations and she could not return home
without disposing of some article she had in her reticule to supply
the vacuum left in her purse there would be nothing ready for the
milliner under two or three days and there was little in the lodgings
to meet the necessities of her grandmother adrienne had taken her way
along the quays delighted with her acquisition and was far from the
mont de piete before this indispensable duty occurred to her mind she
then began to look about her for a shop in which she might dispose of
something for the moment luckily she was the mistress of a gold
thimble that had been presented to her by her grandmother as her very
last birth-day present it was painful for her to part with it but as
it was to supply the wants of that very parent the sacrifice cost her
less than might otherwise have been the case its price had been a
napoleon and a napoleon just then was a mint of money in her eyes
besides she had a silver thimble at home and a brass one would do for
her work

adrienne's necessities had made her acquainted with several jewellers
shops to one of these she now proceeded and first observing through
the window that no person was in but one of her own sex the
silversmith's wife she entered with the greater confidence and
alacrity

madame she said in timid tones for want had not yet made adrienne
bold or coarse i have a thimble to dispose of   could you be induced
to buy it

the woman took the thimble and examined it weighed it and submitted
its metal to the test of the touchstone it was a pretty thimble
though small or it would not have fitted adrienne's finger this fact
struck the woman of the shop and she cast a suspicious glance at
adrienne's hand the whiteness and size of which however satisfied
her that the thimble had not been stolen


what do you expect to receive for this thimble mademoiselle asked
the woman coldly

it cost a napoleon madame and was made expressly for myself

you do not expect to sell it at what it cost was the dry answer

perhaps not madame   i suppose you will look for a profit in selling
it again i wish you to name the price

this was said because the delicate ever shrink from affixing a value to
the time and services of others adrienne was afraid she might
unintentionally deprive the other of a portion of her just gains the
woman understood by the timidity and undecided manner of the applicant
that she had a very unpracticed being to deal with and she was
emboldened to act accordingly first taking another look at the pretty
little hand and fingers to make certain the thimble might not be
reclaimed when satisfied that it really belonged to her who wished to
dispose of it she ventured to answer

in such times as we had before these vile republicans drove all the
strangers from paris and when our commerce was good she said i
might have offered seven francs and a half for that thimble but as
things are now the last sou i can think of giving is five francs

the gold is very good madame adrienne observed in a voice
half-choked they told my grandmother the metal alone was worth
thirteen

perhaps mademoiselle they might give that much at the mint for
there they coin money but in this shop no one will give more than
five francs for that thimble

had adrienne been longer in communion with a cold and heartless world
she would not have submitted to this piece of selfish extortion but
inexperienced and half frightened by the woman's manner she begged
the pittance offered as a boon dropped her thimble and made a hasty
retreat when the poor girl reached the street she began to reflect on
what she had done five francs would scarcely support her grandmother a
week with even the wood and wine she had on hand and she had no more
gold thimbles to sacrifice a heavy sigh broke from her bosom and
tears stood in her eyes but she was wanted at home and had not the
leisure to reflect on her own mistake





occupation is a blessed relief to the miserable of all the ingenious
modes of torture that have ever been invented that of solitary
confinement is probably the most cruel   the mind feeding on itself with
the rapacity of a cormorant when the conscience quickens its activity
and feeds its longings happily for adrienne she had too many positive
cares to be enabled to waste many minutes either in retrospection or
in endeavors to conjecture the future far   far more happily for
herself her conscience was clear for never had a purer mind or a
gentler spirit dwelt in female breast still she could blame her own
oversight and it was days before her self-upbraidings for thus
trifling with what she conceived to be the resources of her beloved
grandmother were driven from her thoughts by the pressure of other and
greater ills

were i to last a thousand years and rise to the dignity of being the
handkerchief that the grand turk is said to toss toward his favorite i
could not forget the interest with which i accompanied adrienne to the
door of her little apartment in the entresol she was in the habit of
hiring little nathalie the porter's daughter to remain with her
grandmother during her own necessary but brief absences and this girl
was found at the entrance eager to be relieved

has my grandmother asked for me nathalie demanded adrienne
anxiously the moment they met

non mademoiselle madame has done nothing but sleep and i was
getting so tired

the sou was given and the porter's daughter disappeared leaving
adrienne alone in the ante-chamber the furniture of this little
apartment was very respectable for madame de la rocheaimard besides
paying a pretty fair rent had hired it just after the revolution when
the prices had fallen quite half and the place had by no means the
appearance of that poverty which actually reigned within adrienne went
through the ante-chamber which served also as a salle a manger and
passed a small saloon into the bed-chamber of her parent here her
mind was relieved by finding all right she gave her grandmother some
nourishment inquired tenderly as to her wishes executed several
little necessary offices and then sat down to work for her own daily
bread every moment being precious to one so situated i expected to be
examined   perhaps caressed fondled or praised but no such attention
awaited me adrienne had arranged every thing in her own mind and i
was to be produced only at those extra hours in the morning when she
had been accustomed to take exercise in the open air for the moment i
was laid aside though in a place that enabled me to be a witness of
all that occurred the day passed in patient toil on the part of the
poor girl the only relief she enjoyed being those moments when she was
called on to attend to the wants of her grandmother a light potage
with a few grapes and bread composed her dinner even of these i
observed that she laid aside nearly half for the succeeding day doubts
of her having the means of supporting her parent until the handkerchief
was completed beginning to beset her mind it was these painful and
obtrusive doubts that most distressed the dear girl now for the
expectation of reaping a reward comparatively brilliant from the
ingenious device to repair her means on which she had fallen was
strong within her poor child her misgivings were the overflowings of
a tender heart while her hopes partook of the sanguine character of
youth and inexperience


my turn came the following morning it was now spring and this is a
season of natural delights at paris we were already in april and the
flowers had begun to shed their fragrance on the air and to brighten
the aspect of the public gardens mad de la rocheaimard usually slept
the soundest at this hour and hitherto adrienne had not hesitated to
leave her while she went herself to the nearest public promenade to
breathe the pure air and to gain strength for the day in future she
was to deny herself this sweet gratification it was such a sacrifice
as the innocent and virtuous and i may add the tasteful who are
cooped up amid the unnatural restraints of a town will best know how
to appreciate still it was made without a murmur though not without a
sigh

when adrienne laid me on the frame where i was to be ornamented by her
own pretty hands she regarded me with a look of delight nay even of
affection that i shall never forget as yet she felt none of the
malign consequences of the self-denial she was about to exert if not
blooming her cheeks still retained some of their native color and her
eye thoughtful and even sad was not yet anxious and sunken she was
pleased with her purchase and she contemplated prodigies in the way of
results adrienne was unusually skillful with the needle and her taste
had been so highly cultivated as to make her a perfect mistress of all
the proprieties of patterns at the time it was thought of making an
offering of all our family to the dauphine the idea of working the
handkerchiefs was entertained and some designs of exquisite beauty and
neatness had been prepared they were not simple vulgar unmeaning
ornaments such as the uncultivated seize upon with avidity on account
of their florid appearance but well devised drawings that were
replete with taste and thought and afforded some apology for the
otherwise senseless luxury contemplated by aiding in refining the
imagination and cultivating the intellect she had chosen one of the
simplest and most beautiful of these designs intending to transfer it
to my face by means of the needle

the first stitch was made just as the clocks were striking the hour of
five on the morning of the fourteenth of april the last was
drawn that day two months precisely as the same clocks struck twelve
for four hours adrienne sat bending over her toil deeply engrossed in
the occupation and flattering herself with the fruits of her success
i learned much of the excellent child's true character in these brief
hours her mind wandered over her hopes and fears recurring to her
other labors and the prices she received for occupations so wearying
and slavish by the milliner she was paid merely as a common
sewing-girl though her neatness skill and taste might well have
entitled her to double wages a franc a day was the usual price for
girls of an inferior caste and out of this they were expected to find
their own lodgings and food but the poor revolution had still a great
deal of private misery to answer for in the way of reduced wages
those who live on the frivolities of mankind or what is the same
thing their luxuries have two sets of victims to plunder   the
consumer and the real producer or the operative this is true where
men are employed but much truer in the case of females the last are
usually so helpless that they often cling to oppression and wrong
rather than submit to be cast entirely upon the world the marchande de
mode who employed adrienne was as rusee as a politician who had
followed all the tergiversations of gallic policy since the year 
she was fully aware of what a prize she possessed in the unpracticed
girl and she felt the importance of keeping her in ignorance of her
own value by paying the franc it might give her assistant premature
notions of her own importance but by bringing her down to fifteen
sous humility could be inculcated and the chance of keeping her
doubled this which would have defeated a bargain with any common
couturiere succeeded perfectly with adrienne she received her fifteen
sous with humble thankfulness in constant apprehension of losing even
that miserable pittance nor would her employer consent to let her work
by the piece at which the dear child might have earned at least thirty
sous for she discovered that she had to deal with a person of
conscience and that in no mode could as much be possibly extracted
from the assistant as by confiding to her own honor at nine each day
she was to breakfast at a quarter past nine precisely to commence
work for her employer at one she had a remission of half an hour and
at six she became her own mistress


i put confidence in you mademoiselle said the marchande de mode
and leave you to yourself entirely you will bring home the work as it
is finished and your money will be always ready should your
grandmother occupy more of your time than common on any occasion you
can make it up of yourself by working a little earlier or a little
later or once in a while you can throw in a day to make up for lost
time you would not do as well at piecework and i wish to deal
generously by you when certain things are wanted in a hurry you will
not mind working an hour or two beyond time and i will always find
lights with the greatest pleasure permit me to advise you to take the
intermissions as much as possible for your attentions to your
grandmother who must be attended to properly si   the care of our
parents is one of our most solemn duties adieu mademoiselle au
revoir


this was one of the speeches of the marchande de mode to adrienne and
the dear girl repeated it in her mind as she sat at work on me
without the slightest distrust of the heartless selfishness it so ill
concealed on fifteen sous she found she could live without encroaching
on the little stock set apart for the support of her grandmother and
she was content alas the poor girl had not entered into any
calculation of the expense of lodgings of fuel of clothes of health
impaired and as for any resources for illness or accidents she was
totally without them still adrienne thought herself the obliged party
in times as critical as those which then hung over france in being
permitted to toil for a sum that would barely supply a grisette
accustomed all her life to privations with the coarsest necessaries


i have little to say of the succeeding fortnight mad de la
rocheaimard gradually grew feebler but she might still live months no
one could tell and adrienne hoped she would never die happily her
real wants were few though her appetite was capricious and her temper
querulous love for her grandchild however shone in all she said and
did and so long as she was loved by this the only being on earth she
had ever been taught to love herself adrienne would not think an
instant of the ills caused by the infirmities of age she husbanded her
money with the utmost frugality and contrived to save even a few sous
daily out of her own wages to add to her grandmother's stock this
she could not have done but for the circumstance of there being so
much in the house of their early stores to help eke out the supplies
of the moment but at the end of a fortnight adrienne found herself
reduced to her last franc including all her own savings something
must be done and that without delay or madame de la rocheaimard would
be without the means of support

by this time adrienne had little to dispose of except the lace this
exquisite piece of human ingenuity had originally cost five louis d'or
and adrienne had once shown it to her employer who had generously
offered to give two napoleons for it but the lace must be kept for my
gala dress and it was hoped that it would bring at least its original
cost when properly bestowed as an ornament on a fabric of my quality
there was the silver thimble and that had cost five francs adrienne
sent for the porter's daughter and she went forth to dispose of this
almost the only article of luxury that remained to her

un de ma bonne demoiselle exclaimed the woman to whom the thimble
was offered for sale this is so common an article as scarcely to
command any price i will give thirty sous notwithstanding



adrienne had made her calculations as she fancied with some attention
to the ways of the world bitter experience was teaching her severe
lessons and she felt the necessity of paying more attention than had
been her wont to the practices of men she had hoped to receive three
francs for her thimble which was quite new and which being pretty
was cheap at five as sold in the shops she ventured therefore to
express as much to the woman in question

three francs mademoiselle exclaimed the other   jamais since the
three days all our commerce was then destroyed and no one would think
of giving such a price if i get three for it myself i shall be too
happy cependant as the thimble is pretty and the metal looks good
we will say five and thirty sous and have no more words about it


adrienne sighed and then she received the money and returned home two
hours later the woman of the shop met with an idle customer who had
more money than discretion and she sold this very thimble for six
francs under the plea that it was a new fashion that had sprung out of
the revolution of july that illustrious event however produced other
results that were quite as hard to be reduced to the known connection
between cause and effect as this

adrienne found that by using the wine which still remained as well as
some sugar and arrowroot her grandmother could be made comfortable for
just ten sous a day she had been able to save of her own wages three
and here then were the means of maintaining madame de la rocheaimard
including the franc on hand for just a week longer to do this
however some little extra economy would be necessary adrienne had
conscientiously taken the time used to sell the thimble from her
morning's work on me as she sat down on her return she went over
these calculations in her mind and when they were ended she cast a
look at her work as if to calculate its duration by what she had so
far finished her eye assured her that not more than one fourth of her
labor was as yet completed could she get over the next six weeks
however she would be comparatively rich and as her lease would be
out in two months she determined to get cheaper lodgings in the
country remove her grandmother purchase another handkerchief   if
possible one of my family   and while she lived on the fruits of her
present labors to earn the means for a still more remote day it is
true she had no more lace with which to decorate another handkerchief
but the sale of this would supply the money to purchase anew and in
this way the simple minded girl saw no reason why she might not
continue on as long as health and strength would allow   at least as
long as her grandmother lived

hope is as blessed a provision for the poor and unhappy as occupation
while oppressed with present ills they struggle to obtain a fancied
existence under happier auspices furnishing a healthful and important
lesson to man that never ceases to remind him of a future that is to
repair every wrong apply a balm to every wound if he will only make a
timely provision for its wants

again did adrienne resume her customary round of duties four hours
each morning were devoted to me then followed the frugal breakfast
when her commoner toil for the milliner succeeded the rest of the day
was occupied with this latter work for which she received the
customary fifteen sous when she retired at night which the ailings
and complaints of her grandmother seldom permitted before eleven it
was with a sense of weariness that began to destroy sleep still the
dear girl thought herself happy for i more than equaled her
expectations and she had latterly worked on me with so much zeal as to
have literally thrown the fruits of two weeks work into one

but the few francs adrienne possessed diminished with alarming
rapidity she began to calculate her ways and means once more and this
was no longer done as readily as before her own wardrobe would not
bear any drain upon it early in the indisposition of her grandmother
all of that had been sold which she could spare for with the
disinterestedness of her nature when sacrifices became necessary her
first thoughts were of her own little stock of clothes of jewelry she
never had been the mistress of much though the vicomtesse had managed
to save a few relics of her own ancient magnificence nevertheless
they were articles of but little value the days of her exile having
made many demands on all such resources

it happened one evening when adrienne was receiving her wages from the
milliner that the poor girl overheard a discourse that proved she was
not paid at the rate at which others were remunerated her eyes told
her that her own work was the neatest in the shop and she also saw
that she did more than any other girl employed by the same person as
she knew her own expertness with the needle this did not surprise her
but she felt some wonder that more and better work should produce the
least reward little did she understand the artifices of the selfish
and calculating one of the most familiar of their frauds being to
conceal from the skillful their own success lest it should command a
price in proportion to its claims the milliner heard adrienne's
lady-like and gentle remonstrance with alarm and she felt that she was
in danger of losing a prize but two expedients suggested themselves
to offer a higher price or to undervalue the services she was so
fearful of losing her practiced policy as well as her selfishness
counseled her to try the latter expedient first

you amaze me mademoiselle she answered when adrienne trembling at
her own resolution ceased speaking i was thinking myself whether i
could afford to pay you fifteen sous when so many young women who have
been regularly brought up to the business are willing to work for less
i am afraid we must part unless you can consent to receive twelve sous
in future

adrienne stood aghast the very mirror of truth herself she could not
imagine that any one   least of all any woman   could be so false and
cruel as to practice the artifice to which the milliner had resorted
and here just as she saw a way opened by which she might support both
her grandmother and herself until the handkerchief was completed a
change threatened her by which she was to be left altogether without
food still her conscience was so tender that she even doubted the
propriety of accepting her old wages were she really incompetent to
earn them

i had hoped madame she said the color coming and going on cheeks
that were now usually pale   i had hoped madame that you found my
work profitable surely surely i bring home as much at night as any
other demoiselle you employ

in that there is not much difference i allow mademoiselle but you
can imagine that work done by one accustomed to the art is more likely
to please customers than work done by one who has been educated as a
lady cependant i will not throw you off as i know that your poor
dear grandmother   

si   si eagerly interrupted adrienne trembling from head to foot
with apprehension

i know it all mademoiselle and the dear old lady shall not suffer
you shall both be made happy again on fifteen to ease your mind
mademoiselle i am willing to make a written contract for a year at
that rate too to put your heart at ease

non   non   non murmured adrienne happy and grateful for the moment
but unwilling to defeat her own plans for the future thank you thank
you madame to-morrow you shall see what i can do

and adrienne toiled the succeeding day not only until her fingers and
body ached but until her very heart ached poor child little did she
think that she was establishing precedents against herself by which
further and destructive exertions might be required but the
apprehension of losing the pittance she actually received and thereby
blasting all hopes from me was constantly before her mind quickening
her hand and sustaining her body

during all this time madame de la rocheaimard continued slowly to sink
old age disappointments and poverty were working out their usual
results and death was near to close the scene so gradual were the
changes however that adrienne did not note them and accustomed as
she had been to the existence the presence the love of this one
being and of this being only to her the final separation scarce
seemed within the bounds of possibility surely every thing around the
human family inculcates the doctrine of the mysterious future and the
necessity of living principally that they be prepared to die all they
produce perishes all they imagine perishes as does all they love the
union of two beings may be so engrossing in their eyes have lasted so
long and embraced so many ties as to seem indissoluble it is all
seeming the hour will infallibly come when the past becomes as
nothing except as it has opened the way to the future

adrienne at length by dint of excessive toil by working deep into the
nights by stinting herself of food and by means of having disposed of
the last article with which she could possibly part had managed to
support her grandmother and herself until she saw me so far done as to
be within another day's work of completion at such a moment as this
all feeling of vanity is out of the question i was certainly very
beautiful a neater a more tasteful a finer or a more exquisitely
laced handkerchief did not exist within the walls of paris in all
that she figured to herself as related to my appearance the end
justified her brightest expectations but as that end drew near she
felt how insufficient were human results to meet the desires of human
hopes now that her painful and exhausting toil was nearly over she
did not experience the happiness she had anticipated the fault was not
in me but in herself hope had exhausted her spirit and as if merely
to teach the vanity of the wishes of men a near approach to the object
that had seemed so desirable in the distance had stripped off the mask
and left the real countenance exposed there was nothing unusual in
this it was merely following out a known law of nature





the morning of the th june arrived paris is then at its loveliest
season the gardens in particular are worthy of the capital of europe
and they are open to all who can manage to make a decent appearance
adrienne's hotel had a little garden in the rear and she sat at her
window endeavoring to breathe the balmy odors that arose from it enter
it she could not it was the property or devoted to the uses of the
occupant of the rez de chaussee still she might look at it as often as
she dared to raise her eyes from her needle the poor girl was not what
she had been two months before the handkerchief wanted but a few hours
of being finished it is true but the pale cheeks the hollow eyes and
the anxious look proved at what a sacrifice of health and physical
force i had become what i was as i had grown in beauty the hand that
ornamented me had wasted and when i looked up to catch the smile of
approbation it was found to be care worn and melancholy still the
birds did not sing the less sweetly for paris is full of birds the
roses were as fragrant and the verdure was as deep as ever nature
does not stop to lament over any single victim of human society when
misery is the deepest there is something awful in this perpetual and
smiling round of natural movements it teaches profoundly the
insignificance of the atoms of creation



adrienne had risen earlier than common even this morning determined
to get through with her task by noon for she was actually sewing on
the lace and her impatience would not permit her to resume the work of
the milliner that day at least for the last month she had literally
lived on dry bread herself at first with a few grapes to give her
appetite a little gratification but toward the last on nothing but
bread and water she had not suffered so much from a want of food
however as from a want of air and exercise from unremitting wasting
toil at a sedentary occupation from hope deferred and from sleepless
nights then she wanted the cheering association of sympathy she was
strictly alone with the exception of her short interviews with the
milliner she conversed with no one her grandmother slept most of the
time and when she did speak it was with the querulousness of disease
and not in the tones of affection this was hardest of all to bear but
adrienne did bear up under all flattering herself that when she could
remove mad de la rocheaimard into the country her grandmother would
revive and become as fond of her as ever she toiled on therefore
though she could not altogether suppress her tears under her painful
and pressing circumstances the poor girl felt her deepest affliction
to be that she had not time to pray her work now that she had nothing
to expect from the milliner could not be laid aside for a moment
though her soul did pour out its longings as she sat plying her needle

fortunately madame de la rocheaimard was easy and tranquil the whole
of the last morning although nearly exhausted by her toil and the want
of food for adrienne had eaten her last morsel half a roll at
breakfast she continued to toil but the work was nearly done and the
dear girl's needle fairly flew of a sudden she dropped me in her lap
and burst into a flood of tears her sobs were hysterical and i felt
afraid she would faint a glass of water however restored her and
then this outpouring of an exhausted nature was suppressed i was
completed at that instant if not the richest i was probably the
neatest and most tasteful handkerchief in paris at this critical
moment desiree the commissionaire entered the room

from the moment that adrienne had purchased me this artful woman had
never lost sight of the intended victim by means of an occasional
bribe to little nathalie she ascertained the precise progress of the
work and learning that i should probably be ready for sale that very
morning under the pretence of hiring the apartment she was shown into
my important presence a brief apology explained all and adrienne
civilly showed her little rooms

when does your lease end mademoiselle demanded desiree carelessly

next week madame i intend to remove to the country with my
grandmother the beginning of the week

you will do very right no one that has the means should stay in paris
after june dieu what a beautiful handkerchief surely   surely   this
is not your work mademoiselle

adrienne simply answered in the affirmative and then the
commissionaire's admiration was redoubled glancing her eye round the
room as if to ascertain the probabilities the woman inquired if the
handkerchief was ordered adrienne blushed but shaking off the
transient feeling of shame she stated that it was for sale

i know a lady who would buy this   a marchande de mode a friend of
mine who gives the highest prices that are ever paid for such
articles   for to tell you the truth certain russian princesses employ
her in all these little matters have you thought of your price
mademoiselle

adrienne's bloom had actually returned with this unexpected gleam of
hope for the affair of disposing of me had always appeared awful in
her imagination she owned the truth frankly and said that she had not
made herself acquainted with the prices of such things except as she
had understood what affluent ladies paid for them

ah that is a different matter said desiree coldly these ladies
pay far more than a thing is worth now you paid ten francs for the
handkerchief itself

twenty-eight answered adrienne trembling

twenty-eight mademoiselle they deceived you shamefully ten would
have been dear in the present absence of strangers from paris no call
that ten this lace would probably bring a napoleon   yes i think it
might bring a napoleon

adrienne's heart sunk within her she had supposed it to be worth at
least five times as much

that makes thirty francs continued desiree coldly and now for the
work you must have been a fortnight doing all this pretty work

two months madame said adrienne faintly

two months ah you are not accustomed to this sort of work and are
not adroit perhaps

i worked only in the mornings and late at night but still think i
worked full hours

yes you worked when sleepy call it a month then thirty days at ten
sous a day make fifteen francs ten for the handkerchief twenty for
the lace and fifteen for the work make forty-five francs   parole
d'honneur it does come to a pretty price for a handkerchief si we
must ask forty-five francs for it and then we can always abate the
five francs and take two napoleons



adrienne felt sick at heart want of nourishment had lessened her
energies and here came a blow to all her golden visions that was near
overcoming her she knew that handkerchiefs similar to this frequently
sold for twenty napoleons in the shops but she did not know how much
the cupidity of trade extracted from the silly and vain in the way of
sheer contributions to avarice it is probable the unfortunate young
lady would have lost her consciousness under the weight of this blow
had it not been for the sound of her grandmother's feeble voice calling
her to the bedside this was a summons that adrienne never disregarded
and for the moment she forgot her causes of grief

my poor adrienne whispered madame de la rocheaimard in a tone of
tenderness that her granddaughter had not heard for some weeks my
poor adrienne the hour is near when we must part   

grand-mamma   dearest grand-mamma

nay love god wills it i am old and i feel death upon me it is
happy that he comes so gently and when i am so well prepared to meet
him the grave has views that no other scene offers adrienne noble
blood and ancient renown are as nothing compared to god's mercy and
forgiveness pardon me if i have ever taught thy simple heart to dwell
on vanities but it was a fault of the age this world is all vanity
and i can now see it when it is too late do not let my fault be thy
fault child of my love kiss me adrienne pray for my soul when all
is over

yes dearest dearest grand-mamma thou know'st i will

thou must part with the rest of the trousseau to make thyself
comfortable when i am gone

i will do as thou wishest dearest grand-mamma

perhaps it will raise enough to purchase thee four or five hundred
francs of rentes on which thou may'st live with frugality



perhaps it will grand-mamma

thou wilt not sell the thimble   that thou wilt keep to remember me

adrienne bowed her head and groaned then her grandmother desired her
to send for a priest and her thoughts took another direction it was
fortunate they did for the spirit of the girl could not have endured
more

that night madame de la rocheaimard died the wife of the porter the
bon cure and adrienne alone being present her last words were a
benediction on the fair and gentle being who had so faithfully and
tenderly nursed her in old age when all was over and the body was
laid out adrienne asked to be left alone with it living or dead her
grandmother could never be an object of dread to her and there were
few disposed to watch in the course of the night adrienne even caught
a little sleep a tribute that nature imperiously demanded of her
weakness



the following day was one of anguish and embarrassment the physician
who always inspects the dead in france came to make his report the
arrangements were to be ordered for the funeral fortunately as
adrienne then thought desiree appeared in the course of the morning
as one who came in consequence of having been present at so much of the
scene of the preceding day in her character of a commissionaire she
offered her services and adrienne unaccustomed to act for herself in
such offices was fain to accept them she received an order or rather
an answer to a suggestion of her own and hurried off to give the
necessary directions adrienne was now left alone again with the body
of her deceased grandmother as soon as the excitement ceased she
began to feel languid and she became sensible of her own bodily wants
food of no sort had passed her lips in more than thirty hours and her
last meal had been a scanty breakfast of dry bread as the faintness of
hunger came over her adrienne felt for her purse with the intention of
sending nathalie to a neighboring baker's when the truth flashed upon
her in its dreadful reality she had not a liard her last sou had
furnished the breakfast of the preceding day a sickness like that of
death came over her when casting her eyes around her in despair they
fell on the little table that usually held the nourishment prepared for
her grandmother a little arrowroot and a light potage that contained
bread still remained although it was all that seemed to separate the
girl from death she hesitated about using it there was an appearance
of sacrilege in her eyes in the act of appropriating these things to
herself a moment's reflection however brought her to a truer state
of mind and then she felt it to be a duty to that dear parent herself
to renew her own strength in order to discharge her duty to the dead
she ate therefore though it was with a species of holy reverence her
strength was renewed and she was enabled to relieve her soul by prayer



mademoiselle will have the goodness to give me ten francs said
desiree on her return i have ordered every thing that is proper but
money is wanting to pay for some little articles that will soon come

i have no money desiree   not even a sou

no money mademoiselle in the name of heaven how are we to bury your
grandmother

the handkerchief   

desiree shook her head and saw that she must countermand most of the
orders still she was human and she was a female she could not
altogether desert one so helpless in a moment of such extreme
distress she reflected on the matter for a minute or two and opened
her mind

this handkerchief might sell for forty-five francs mademoiselle she
said and i will pay that much for it myself and will charge nothing
for my services to-day your dear grandmother must have christian
burial that is certain and poor enough will that be which is had for
two napoleons what say you mademoiselle   will you accept the forty
five francs or would you prefer seeing the marchande de mode

i can see no one now desiree give me the money and do honor to the
remains of my dear dear grandmother

adrienne said this with her hands resting on her lap in quiescent
despair her eyes were hollow and vacant her cheeks bloodless her
mind almost as helpless as that of an infant desiree laid down two
napoleons keeping the five francs to pay for some necessaries and
then she took me in her hands as if to ascertain whether she had done
too much satisfied on this head i was carefully replaced in the
basket when the commissionaire went out again on her errands
honorably disposed to be useful still she did not deem it necessary to
conceal her employer's poverty which was soon divulged to the
porteress and by her to the bourgeois



adrienne had now the means of purchasing food but ignorant how much
might be demanded on behalf of the approaching ceremony she
religiously adhered to the use of dry bread when desiree returned in
the evening she told the poor girl that the convoi was arranged for
the following morning that she had ordered all in the most economical
way but that thirty-five francs were the lowest sou for which the
funeral could be had adrienne counted out the money and then found
herself the mistress of just four francs ten sous when desiree took
her leave for the night she placed me in her basket and carried me to
her own lodgings in virtue of her purchase



i was laid upon a table where i could look through an open window up
at the void of heaven it was glittering with those bright stars which
the astronomers tell us are suns of other systems and the scene
gradually drew me to reflections on that eternity which is before us
my feelings got to be gradually soothed as i remembered the moment of
time that all are required to endure injustice and wrongs on earth
some such reflections are necessary to induce us to submit to the
mysterious reign of providence whose decrees so often seem unequal
and whose designs are so inscrutable by remembering what a speck is
time as compared with eternity and that god chasteneth those he
loveth the ills of life may be borne even with joy

the manner in which desiree disposed of me shall be related in another
number


the reader is not to infer that desiree was unusually mercenary that
she was a little addicted to this weakness is true   who ever knew a
commissionaire that was not but she had her moments of benevolence as
well as others and had really made some sacrifice of her time and
consequently of her interests in order to serve adrienne in her
distress as for the purchase of myself that was in the way of her
commerce and it is seldom indeed that philanthropy can overcome the
habits of trade

desiree was not wholly without means and she was in no hurry to reap
the benefit of her purchase i remained in her possession according to
my calculation some two or three years before she ever took me out of
the drawer in which i had been deposited for safe keeping i was
considered a species of corps de reserve at the end of that period
however her thoughts recurred to her treasure and an occasion soon
offered for turning me to account i was put into the reticule and
carried about in readiness for any suitable bargain that might turn up



one day desiree and i were on the boulevards italiens together when a
figure caught the commissionaire's eye that sent her across the street
in a great hurry i scarcely know how to describe this person who to
my simple eyes had the appearance of a colonel of the late royal
guards or at least of an attache of one of the northern legations
he was dressed in the height of the latest fashion as well as he knew
how to be wore terrible moustaches and had a rare provision of rings
eye-glasses watch-guards chains c


bon jour monsieur exclaimed desiree in haste parole d honneur
i scarcely knew you i have been waiting for your return from lyons
with the most lively impatience for to tell you the truth i have the
greatest bijou for your american ladies that ever came out of a
bleaching ground   un mouchoir de poche

doucement   doucement ma bonne interrupted the other observing that
the woman was about to exhibit me on the open boulevards an expose for
which he had no longings you can bring it to my lodgings   

rue de clery numero cent vingt   

not at all my good desiree you must know i have transacted all my
ordinary business   made my purchases and am off for new york in the
next packet   

mais le malle monsieur

yes the trunk will have a corner in it for any thing particular as
you say i shall go to court this evening to a great ball madame la
marquise de dolomien and the aide de camp de service having just
notified me that i am invited to be frank with you desiree i am
lodging in la rue de la paix and appear just now as a mere traveler
you will inquire for le colonel silky when you call

le colonel silky repeated desiree with a look of admiration a
little mingled with contempt

de la garde nationale americaine answered mr silky smiling he
then gave the woman his new address and appointed an hour to see her

desiree was punctual to a minute the porter the garcons the
bourgeois all knew le colonel silky who was now a great man wore
moustaches and went to court   as the court was in a minute the
commissionaire was in the colonel's ante-chamber this distinguished
officer had a method in his madness he was not accustomed to keeping a
body servant and as his aim was to make a fortune will ye nill ye
he managed even now in his hours of pride and self-indulgence to get
along without one it was not many moments therefore before he came
out and ushered desiree himself into his salon a room of ten feet by
fourteen with a carpet that covered just eight feet by six in its
centre now that they were alone in this snuggery which seemed barely
large enough to contain so great a man's moustaches the parties
understood each other without unnecessary phrases and i was at once
produced


colonel silky was evidently struck with my appearance an officer of
his readiness and practice saw at once that i might be made to diminish
no small part of the ways and means of his present campaign and
precisely in proportion as he admired me he began to look cold and
indifferent this management could not deceive me my clairvoyance
defying any such artifices but it had a sensible effect on desiree
who happening very much to want money for a particular object just at
that moment determined on the spot to abate no less than fifty
francs from the price she had intended to ask this was deducting five
francs more than poor adrienne got for the money she had expended for
her beautiful lace and for all her toil sleepless nights and tears
a proof of the commissionaire's scale of doing business the bargain
was now commenced in earnest offering an instructive scene of french
protestations assertions contradictions and volubility on one side
and of cold seemingly phlegmatic but wily yankee calculation on the
other desiree had set her price at one hundred and fifty francs after
abating the fifty mentioned and colonel silky had early made up his
mind to give only one hundred after making suitable allowances for my
true value before i was embellished the cost of the lace and of the
work desiree was not far from the mark but the colonel saw that she
wanted money and he knew that two napoleons and a half with his
management would carry him from paris to havre it is true he had
spent the difference that morning on an eye-glass that he never used
or when he did it was only to obscure his vision but the money was not
lost as it aided in persuading the world he was a colonel and was
afflicted with that genteel defect an imperfect vision these extremes
of extravagance and meanness were not unusual in his practice the one
in truth being a consequence of the other



you forget the duty desiree observed the military trader this
compromise law is a thousand times worse than any law we have ever had
in america


the duty repeated the woman with an incredulous smile monsieur
you are not so young as to pay any duty on a pocket-handkerchief ma
foi i will bring twenty   oui a thousand from england itself and the
douaniers shall not stop one

ay but we don't smuggle in america returned the colonel with an
aplomb that might have done credit to vidocq himself in our
republican country the laws are all in all


why do so many of your good republicans dress so that the rue de clery
don't know them and then go to the chateau demanded the
commissionaire very innocently as to appearance at least

bah there are the five napoleons   if you want them take them   if
not i care little about it my invoice being all closed

desiree never accepted money more reluctantly instead of making one
hundred and fifty-five francs out of the toil and privations and
self-denial of poor adrienne she found her own advantages unexpectedly
lessened to fifty-five or only a trifle more than one hundred per
cent but the colonel was firm and for once her cupidity was
compelled to succumb the money was paid and i became the vassal of
colonel silky a titular soldier but a traveling trader who never
lost sight of the main chance either in his campaigns his journeys or
his pleasures

to own the truth colonel silky was delighted with me no girl could be
a better judge of the article and all his cultivated taste ran into
the admiration of goods i was examined with the closest scrutiny my
merits were inwardly applauded and my demerits pronounced to be
absolutely none in short i was flattered for it must be confessed
the commendation of even a fool is grateful so far from placing me in
a trunk or a drawer the colonel actually put me in his pocket though
duly enveloped and with great care and for some time i trembled in
every delicate fibre lest in a moment of forgetfulness he might use
me but my new master had no such intention his object in taking me
out was to consult a sort of court commissionaire with whom he had
established certain relations and that too at some little cost on
the propriety of using me himself that evening at the chateau of the
king of the french fortunately his monitress though by no means of
the purest water knew better than to suffer her eleve to commit so
gross a blunder and i escaped the calamity of making my first
appearance at court under the auspices of such a patron

there was a moment too when the colonel thought of presenting me to
madame de dolomien by the way of assuring his favor in the royal
circle but when he came to count up the money he should lose in the
way of profits this idea became painful and it was abandoned as
often happened with this gentleman he reasoned so long in all his acts
of liberality that he supposed a sufficient sacrifice had been made in
the mental discussions and he never got beyond what surgeons call the
first intention of his moral cures the evening he went to court
therefore i was carefully consigned to a carton in the colonel's
trunk whence i did not again issue until my arrival in america of the
voyage therefore i have little to say not having had a sight of the
ocean at all i cannot affirm that i was absolutely sea-sick but on
the other hand i cannot add that i was perfectly well during any part
of the passage the pent air of the state-room and a certain heaviness
about the brain quite incapacitated me from enjoying any thing that
passed and that was a happy moment when our trunk was taken on deck to
be examined the custom-house officers at new york were not men likely
to pick out a pocket-handkerchief from a gentleman's   i beg pardon
from a colonel's   wardrobe and i passed unnoticed among sundry other
of my employers speculations i call the colonel my employer though
this was not strictly true for heaven be praised he never did employ
me but ever since my arrival in america my gorge has so risen against
the word master that i cannot make up my mind to write it i know
there is an ingenious substitute as the following little dialogue will
show but my early education under the astronomer and the delicate
minded adrienne has rendered me averse to false taste and i find the
substitute as disagreeable as the original the conversation to which i
allude occurred between me and a very respectable looking shirt that
i happened to be hanging next to on a line a few days after my
arrival the colonel having judged it prudent to get me washed and
properly ironed before he carried me into the market

who is your boss pocket-handkerchief demanded the shirt a perfect
stranger to me by the way for i had never seen him before the
accidents of the wash-tub brought us in collision who is your boss
pocket-handkerchief i say   you are so very fine i should like to
know something of your history

from all i had heard and read i was satisfied my neighbor was a yankee
shirt both from his curiosity and from his abrupt manner of asking
questions still i was at a loss to know the meaning of the word boss
my clairvoyance being totally at fault it belongs to no language known
to the savans or academicians


i am not certain sir i answered that i understand your meaning
what is a boss


oh that's only a republican word for master now judge latitat is
my boss and a very good one he is with the exception of his sitting
so late at night at his infernal circuits by the light of miserable
tallow candles but all the judges are alike for that keeping a poor
shirt up sometimes until midnight listening to cursed dull lawyers
and prosy caviling witnesses


i beg you to recollect sir that i am a female pocket-handkerchief
and persons of your sex are bound to use temperate and proper language
in the presence of ladies

yes i see you are feminine by your ornaments   still you might tell
a fellow who is your boss

i belong at present to colonel silky if that is what you mean but
i presume some fair lady will soon do me the honor of transferring me
to her own wardrobe no doubt my future employer   is not that the
word   will be one of the most beautiful and distinguished ladies of
new york

no question of that as money makes both beauty and distinction in
this part of the world and it's not a dollar that will buy you
colonel silky i don't remember the name   which of our editors is he


i don't think he is an editor at all at least i never heard he was
employed about any publication and to own the truth he does not
appear to me to be particularly qualified for such a duty either by
native capacity or its substitute education

oh that makes no great difference   half the corps is exactly in the
same predicament i'fegs if we waited for colonels or editors either
in this country until we got such as were qualified we should get no
news and be altogether without politics and the militia would soon be
in an awful state


this is very extraordinary so you do not wait but take them as they
come and what state is your militia actually in

awful it is what my boss the judge sometimes calls a statu quo


and the newspapers   and the news   and the politics

why they are not in statu quo   but in a semper eadem   i beg
pardon do you understand latin

no sir   ladies do not often study the dead languages

if they did they would soon bring em to life semper eadem is latin
for worse and worse the militia is drilling into a statu quo and
the press is enlightening mankind with a semper eadem



after properly thanking my neighbor for these useful explanations we
naturally fell into discourse about matters and things in general the
weather in america being uniformly too fine to admit of discussion

pray sir said i trembling lest my boss might be a colonel of the
editorial corps after all   pray sir said i is it expected in
this country that the wardrobe should entertain the political
sentiments of its boss

i rather think not unless it might be in high party times or in the
case of editors and such extreme patriots i have several relatives
that belong to the corps and they all tell me that while their bosses
very frequently change their coats they are by no means so particular
about changing their shirts but you are of foreign birth ma'am i
should think by your dress and appearance


yes sir i came quite recently from france though my employer being
american i suppose i am entitled to the rights of citizenship are you
european also

no ma'am i am native and to the manor born as the modern
shakspeare has it is louis philippe likely to maintain the throne in
france



that is not so certain sir by what i learn as that the throne is
likely to maintain louis philippe to own the truth to you i am a
carlist as all genteel articles are and i enter but little into the
subject of louis philippe's reign


this remark made me melancholy by reviving the recollection of
adrienne and the conversation ceased an hour or two later i was
removed from the line properly ironed and returned to my boss the
same day i was placed in a shop in broadway belonging to a firm of
which i now understood the colonel was a sleeping partner a suitable
entry was made against me in a private memorandum book which as i
once had an opportunity of seeing it i will give here

super-extraordinary pocket-handkerchief french cambric trimmed and
worked in account with bobbinet gull

 dr
 to money paid first cost   francs at   
 to interest on same for   
 to portion of passage money   
 to porterage   
 to washing and making up   
 mem   see if a deduction cannot be made from this charge

 cr
 by cash for allowing miss thimble to copy pattern   not to be worked
 until our article is sold   
 by cash for sale c   



thus the account stood the day i was first offered to the admiration of
the fair of new york mr bobbinet however was in no hurry to exhibit
me having several articles of less beauty that he was anxious to get
off first for my part i was as desirous of being produced as ever a
young lady was to come out and then my companions in the drawer were
not of the most agreeable character we were all pocket-handkerchiefs
together and all of french birth of the whole party i was the only
one that had been worked by a real lady and consequently my education
was manifestly superior to those of my companions they could scarcely
be called comme il faut at all though to own the truth i am afraid
there is tant soit peu de vulgarity about all worked
pocket-handkerchiefs i remember that one day when madame de la
rocheaimard and adrienne were discussing the expediency of buying our
whole piece with a view of offering us to their benefactress the
former who had a fine tact in matters of this sort expressed a doubt
whether the dauphine would be pleased with such an offering



her royal highness like all cultivated minds looks for fitness in
her ornaments and tastes what fitness is there ma chere in
converting an article of real use and which should not be paraded to
one's associates into an article of senseless luxury i know there are
two doctrines on this important point   

but as i shall have occasion soon to go into the whole philosophy of
this matter when i come to relate the manner of my next purchase i
will not stop here to relate all that madame de la rocheaimard said it
is sufficient that she a woman of tact in such matters at least had
strong doubts concerning the taste and propriety of using worked
pocket-handkerchiefs at all

my principal objection to my companions in the drawer was their
incessant senseless repinings about france and their abuse of the
country in which they were to pass their lives i could see enough in
america to find fault with through the creaks of the drawer and if an
american i might have indulged a little in the same way myself for i
am not one of those who think fault-finding belongs properly to the
stranger and not to the native it is the proper office of the latter
as it is his duty to amend these faults the traveler being bound in
justice to look at the good as well as the evil but according to my
companions there was nothing good in america   the climate the people
the food the morals the laws the dress the manners and the tastes
were all infinitely worse than those they had been accustomed to even
the physical proportions of the population were condemned without
mercy i confess i was surprised at hearing the size of the americans
sneered at by pocket-handkerchiefs as i remember to have read that the
noses of the new yorkers in particular were materially larger than
common when the supercilious and vapid point out faults they ever run
into contradictions and folly it is only under the lash of the
discerning and the experienced that we betray by our writhings the
power of the blow we receive






i might have been a fortnight in the shop when i heard a voice as
gentle and lady-like as that of adrienne inquiring for
pocket-handkerchiefs my heart fairly beat for joy for to own the
truth i was getting to be wearied to death with the garrulous folly of
my companions they had so much of the couturieres about them not one
of the whole party ever having been a regular employee in genteel life
their niaisiries were endless and there was just as much of the low
bred anticipation as to their future purchases as one sees at the
balls of the champs elysee on the subject of partners the word
pocket-handkerchief and that so sweetly pronounced drew open our
drawer as it might be instinctively two or three dozen of us all of
exquisite fineness were laid upon the counter myself and two or three
more of the better class being kept a little in the back ground as a
skillful general holds his best troops in reserve


the customers were sisters that was visible at a glance both were
pretty almost beautiful   and there was an air of simplicity about
their dress a quiet and unobtrusive dignity in their manners which at
once announced them to be real ladies even the tones of their voices
were polished a circumstance that i think one is a little apt to
notice in new york i discovered in the course of the conversation
that they were the daughters of a gentleman of very large estate and
belonged to the true elite of the country the manner in which the
clerks received them indeed proclaimed this for though their other
claims might not have so promptly extracted this homage their known
wealth would

mr bobbinet attended these customers in person practiced in all that
portion of human knowledge which appertains to a salesman he let the
sweet girls select two or three dozen handkerchiefs of great beauty
but totally without ornament and even pay for them before he said a
word on the subject of the claims of his reserved corps when he
thought the proper moment had arrived however one of the least
decorated of our party was offered to the consideration of the young
ladies the sisters were named anne and maria and i could see by the
pleasure that beamed in the soft blue eyes of the former that she was
quite enchanted with the beauty of the article laid before her so
unexpectedly i believe it is in female human nature to admire every
thing that is graceful and handsome and especially when it takes the
form of needle-work the sweet girls praised handkerchief after
handkerchief until i was laid before them when their pleasure
extracted exclamations of delight all was done so quietly however
and in so lady-like a manner that the attention of no person in the
shop was drawn to them by this natural indulgence of surprise still i
observed that neither of the young lades inquired the prices these
being considerations that had no influence on the intrinsic value in
their eyes while the circumstance caused my heart to sink within me
as it clearly proved they did not intend to purchase and i longed to
become the property of the gentle serene-eyed anne after thanking mr
bobbinet for the trouble he had taken they ordered their purchases
sent home and were about to quit the shop

can't i persuade you to take this demanded bobbinet as they were
turning away there is not its equal in america indeed one of the
house our colonel silky who has just returned from paris says it was
worked expressly for the dauphine who was prevented from getting it by
the late revolution

it is a pity so much lace and such exquisite work should be put on a
pocket-handkerchief said anne almost involuntarily i fear if they
were on something more suitable i might buy them

a smile a slight blush and curtsy concluded the interview and the
young ladies hastily left the shop mr bobbinet was disappointed as
indeed was col silky who was present en amateur but the matter
could not be helped as these were customers who acted and thought for
themselves and all the oily persuasion of shop-eloquence could not
influence them



it is quite surprising colonel observed mr bobbinet when his
customers were properly out of hearing that these young ladies should
let such an article slip through their fingers their father is one of
the richest men we have and yet they never even asked the price

i fancy it was not so much the price that held em back observed the
colonel in his elegant way as something else there are a sort of
customers that don't buy promiscuously they do every thing by rule
they don't believe that a nightcap is intended for a bed-quilt

bobbinet co did not exactly understand his more sophisticated
partner but before he had time to ask an explanation the appearance
of another customer caused his face to brighten and changed the
current of his thoughts the person who now entered was an exceedingly
brilliant looking girl of twenty dressed in the height of fashion and
extremely well though a severe critic might have thought she was over
dressed for the streets still she had alighted from a carriage her
face was decidedly handsome and her person exquisitely proportioned
as a whole i had scarcely ever seen a young creature that could lay
claim to more of the loveliness of her sex both the young ladies who
had just left us were pleasing and pretty and to own the truth there
was an air of modest refinement about them that was not so apparent in
this new visiter but the dazzling appearance of the latter at first
blinded me to her faults and i saw nothing but her perfection the
interest manifested by the master   i beg his pardon the boss of the
store   and the agitation among the clerks very plainly proved that
much was expected from the visit of this young lady who was addressed
with a certain air of shop-familiarity as miss halfacre   a familiarity
that showed she was an habituee of the place and considered a good
customer

luckily for the views of bobbinet co we were all still lying on the
counter this is deemed a fortunate circumstance in the contingencies
of this species of trade since it enables the dealer to offer his
uncalled-for wares in the least suspicious and most natural manner it
was fortunate also that i lay at the bottom of the little pile   a
climax being quite as essential in sustaining an extortionate price as
in terminating with due effect a poem a tragedy or a romance

good morning miss halfacre said mr bobbinet bowing and smiling
if his face had been half as honest as it professed to be it would
have grinned i am glad you have come in at this moment as we are
about to put on sale some of the rarest articles in the way of
pocket-handkerchiefs that have ever come to this market the misses
burton have just seen them and they pronounce them the most beautiful
articles of the sort they have ever seen and i believe they have been
over half the world

and did they take any mr bobbinet the miss burtons are thought to
have taste

they have not exactly purchased but i believe each of them has a
particular article in her eye here is one ma'am that is rather
prettier than any you have yet seen in new york the price is sixty
dollars

the word sixty was emphasized in a way to show the importance that was
attached to price   that being a test of more than common importance
with the present customer i sighed when i remembered that poor
adrienne had received but about ten dollars for me   an article worth so
much more than that there exhibited

it is really very pretty mr bobbinet very pretty but miss monson
bought one not quite as pretty at lace's and she payed sixty-five if
i am not mistaken

i dare say we have them at much higher prices i showed you this only
that you might see that our sixties are as handsome as mr lace's
sixty-fives what do you think of this

that is a jewel what is the price mr bobbinet

why we will let you have it for seventy though i do think it ought
to bring five more

surely you do not abate on pocket-handkerchiefs one doesn't like to
have such a thing too low

ah i may as well come to the point at once with such a customer as
yourself miss halfacre here is the article on which i pride myself
that article never was equalled in this market and never will be

i cannot repeat half the exclamations of delight which escaped the fair
eudosia when i first burst on her entranced eye she turned me over
and over examined me with palpitating bosom and once i thought she
was about to kiss me then in a trembling voice she demanded the
price

one hundred dollars ma'am answered bobbinet solemnly not a cent
more on my honor

no surely exclaimed eudosia with delight instead of alarm not a
hundred

one hundred miss eudosia to the last cent then we scarcely make a
living profit

why mr bobbinet this is the highest priced handkerchief that was
ever sold in new york this was said with a sort of rapture the fair
creature feeling all the advantage of having so good an opportunity of
purchasing so dear an article

in america ma'am it is the highest priced handkerchief by twenty
dollars that ever crossed the atlantic the celebrated miss jewel's
of boston only cost seventy-nine

only oh mr bobbinet i must have it it is a perfect treasure

shall i send it miss eudosia or don't you like to trust it out of
your sight

not yet sir to own the truth i have not so much money i only came
out to buy a few trifles and brought but fifty dollars with me and pa
insists on having no bills i never knew any body as particular as pa
but i will go instantly home and show him the importance of this
purchase you will not let the handkerchief be seen for one hour   only
one hour   and then you shall hear from me

to this bobbinet assented the young lady tripped into her carriage
and was instantly whirled from the door in precisely forty-three
minutes a maid entered half out of breath and laid a note on the
counter the latter contained mr halfacre's check for one hundred
dollars and a request from the fair eudosia that i might be delivered
to her messenger every thing was done as she had desired and in five
minutes i was going up broadway as fast as honor o'flagherty's for
such was the name of the messenger little dumpy legs could carry me





mr henry half acre was a speculator in town-lots   a profession that
was just then in high repute in the city of new york for farms and
all the more vulgar aspects of real estate he had a sovereign
contempt but offer him a bit of land that could be measured by feet
and inches and he was your man mr halfacre inherited nothing but he
was a man of what are called energy and enterprise in other words he
had a spirit for running in debt and never shrunk from jeoparding
property that in truth belonged to his creditors the very morning
that his eldest child eudosia made her valuable acquisition in my
person henry halfacre esq was the owner of several hundred lots on
the island of manhattan of one hundred and twenty-three in the city of
brooklyn of nearly as many in williamsburg of large undivided
interests in milwaukie chicago rock river moonville and other
similar places besides owning a considerable part of a place called
coney island in a word the landed estate of henry halfacre esq
inventoried as he expressed it just two millions six hundred and
twelve thousand dollars a handsome sum it must be confessed for a
man who when he began his beneficent and energetic career in this
branch of business was just twenty-three thousand four hundred and
seventeen dollars worse than nothing it is true that there was some
drawback on all this prosperity mr halfacre's bonds notes
mortgages and other liabilities making a sum total that amounted to
the odd six hundred thousand dollars this still left him however a
handsome paper balance of two millions

notwithstanding the amount of his bills payable mr halfacre
considered himself a very prudent man first because he insisted on
having no book debts second because he always took another man's
paper for a larger amount than he had given of his own for any
specific lot or lots thirdly and lastly because he was careful to
extend himself at the risk of other persons there is no question
had all his lots been sold as he had inventoried them had his debts
been paid and had he not spent his money a little faster than it was
bona fide made that henry halfacre esq would have been a very rich
man as he managed however by means of getting portions of the paper
he received discounted to maintain a fine figure account in the bank
and to pay all current demands he began to be known as the rich mr
halfacre but one of his children the fair eudosia was out and as
she had some distance to make in the better society of the town ere
she could pass for aristocratic it was wisely determined that a golden
bridge should be thrown across the dividing chasm a hundred-dollar
pocket-handkerchief it was hoped would serve for the key-stone and
then all the ends of life would be attained as to a husband a pretty
girl like eudosia and the daughter of a man of four figure lots
might get one any day



honor o'flagherty was both short-legged and short-breathed she felt
the full importance of her mission and having an extensive
acquaintance among the other milesians of the town and of her class
she stopped no less than eleven times to communicate the magnitude of
miss dosie's purchase to two particular favorites she actually showed
me under solemn promise of secrecy and to four others she promised a
peep some day after her bossee had fairly worn me in this manner my
arrival was circulated prematurely in certain coteries the pretty
mouths and fine voices that spoke of my marvels being quite
unconscious that they were circulating news that had reached their ears
via honor o'flagherty biddy noon and kathleen brady


mr halfacre occupied a very genteel residence in broadway where he
and his enjoyed the full benefit of all the dust noise and commotion
of that great thoroughfare this house had been purchased and
mortgaged generally simultaneous operations with this great operator
as soon as he had inventoried half a million it was a sort of patent
of nobility to live in broadway and the acquisition of such a
residence was like the purchase of a marquiseta in italy when eudosia
was fairly in possession of a hundred-dollar pocket-handkerchief the
great seal might be said to be attached to the document that was to
elevate the halfacres throughout all future time

now the beautiful eudosia   for beautiful and even lovely this
glorious-looking creature was in spite of a very badly modulated
voice certain inroads upon the fitness of things in the way of
expression and a want of a knowledge of the finesse of fine life   now
the beautiful eudosia had an intimate friend named clara caverly who
was as unlike her as possible in character education habits and
appearance and yet who was firmly her friend the attachment was one
of childhood and accident   the two girls having been neighbors and
school-fellows until they had got to like each other after the manner
in which young people form such friendships to wear away under the
friction of the world and the pressure of time mr caverly was a
lawyer of good practice fair reputation and respectable family his
wife happened to be a lady from her cradle and the daughter had
experienced the advantage of as great a blessing still mr caverly was
what the world of new york in called poor that is to say he
had no known bank-stock did not own a lot on the island was director
of neither bank nor insurance company and lived in a modest two-story
house in white street it is true his practice supported his family
and enabled him to invest in bonds and mortgages two or three thousand
a-year and he owned the fee of some fifteen or eighteen farms in
orange county that were falling in from three-lives leases and which
had been in his family ever since the seventeenth century but at a
period of prosperity like that which prevailed in and 
the hereditary dollar was not worth more than twelve and a half cents
as compared with the inventoried dollar as there is something after
all in a historical name and the caverleys sic still had the best
of it in the way of society eudosia was permitted to continue the
visits in white street even after her own family were in full
possession in broadway and henry halfacre esq had got to be
enumerated among the manhattan nabobs clara caverly was in broadway
when honor o'flagherty arrived with me out of breath in consequence
of the shortness of her legs and the necessity of making up for lost
time


there miss dosie cried the exulting housemaid for such was honor's
domestic rank though preferred to so honorable and confidential a
mission   there miss dosie there it is and it's a jewel

what has honor brought you now asked clara caverly in her quiet way
for she saw by the brilliant eyes and flushed cheeks of her friend that
it was something the other would have pleasure in conversing about
you make so many purchases dear eudosia that i should think you
would weary of them

what weary of beautiful dresses never clara never that might do
for white street but in broadway one is never tired of such
things   see laying me out at full length in her lap this is a
pocket-handkerchief   i wish your opinion of it

clara examined me very closely and in spite of something like a
frown and an expression of dissatisfaction that gathered about her
pretty face   for clara was pretty too   i could detect some of the
latent feelings of the sex as she gazed at my exquisite lace perfect
ornamental work and unequaled fineness still her education and
habits triumphed and she would not commend what she regarded as
ingenuity misspent and tasteless because senseless luxury

this handkerchief cost one hundred dollars clara said eudosia
deliberately and with emphasis imitating as near as possible the
tone of bobbinet co

is it possible eudosia what a sum to pay for so useless a thing

useless do you call a pocket-handkerchief useless

quite so when it is made in a way to render it out of the question to
put it to the uses for which it was designed i should as soon think of
trimming gum shoes with satin as to trim a handkerchief in that style

style yes i flatter myself it is style to have a handkerchief that
cost a hundred dollars why clara caverly the highest priced thing of
this sort that was ever before sold in new york only came to
seventy-nine dollars mine is superior to all by twenty-one dollars

clara caverly sighed it was not with regret or envy or any unworthy
feeling however it was a fair honest moral sigh that had its birth
in the thought of how much good a hundred dollars might have done
properly applied it was under the influence of this feeling too that
she said somewhat inopportunely it must be confessed though quite
innocently   

well eudosia i am glad you can afford such a luxury at all events
now is a good time to get your subscription to the widows and orphans
society mrs thoughtful has desired me to ask for it half a dozen
times i dare say it has escaped you that you are quite a twelvemonth
in arrear

now a good time to ask for three dollars what just when i've paid a
hundred dollars for a pocket-handkerchief that was not said with your
usual good sense my dear people must be made of money to pay out so
much at one time

when may i tell mrs thoughtful then that you will send it to her

i am sure that is more than i can say pa will be in no hurry to give
me more money soon and i want at this moment near a hundred dollars
worth of articles of dress to make a decent appearance the society can
be in no such hurry for its subscriptions they must amount to a good
deal

not if never paid shall i lend you the money   my mother gave me ten
dollars this morning to make a few purchases which i can very well do
without until you can pay me

do dear girl   you are always one of the best creatures in the world
how much is it three dollars i believe

six if you pay the past and present year i will pay mrs thoughtful
before i go home but dear eudosia i wish you had not bought that
foolish pocket-handkerchief

foolish do you call a handkerchief with such lace and all this
magnificent work on it and which cost a hundred dollars foolish is
it foolish to have money or to be thought rich

certainly not the first though it may be better not to be thought
rich i wish to see you always dressed with propriety for you do
credit to your dress but this handkerchief is out of place

out of place now hear me clara though it is to be a great secret
what do you think pa is worth

bless me these are things i never think of i do not even know how
much my own father is worth mother tells me how much i may spend and
i can want to learn no more

well mr murray dined with pa last week and they sat over their wine
until near ten i overheard them talking and got into this room to
listen for i thought i should get something new at first they said
nothing but lots   lots   up town   down town   twenty-five feet
front   dollar dollar dollar la child you never heard such stuff
in your life

one gets used to these things notwithstanding observed clara drily

yes one does hear a great deal of it i shall be glad when the
gentlemen learn to talk of something else but the best is to come at
last pa asked mr murray if he had inventoried lately

did he

yes he did of course you know what that means

it meant to fill as they call it does it not

so i thought at first but it means no such thing it means to count
up and set down how much one is worth mr murray said he did that
every month and of course he knew very well what he was worth i
forget how much it was for i didn't care you know george murray is
not as old as i am and so i listened to what pa had inventoried now
how much do you guess

really my dear i haven't the least idea answered clara slightly
gaping   a thousand dollars perhaps

a thousand dollars what for a gentleman who keeps his coach   lives
in broadway   dresses his daughter as i dress and gives her
hundred-dollar handkerchiefs two hundred million my dear two hundred
million

eudosia had interpolated the word hundred quite innocently for as
usually happens with those to whom money is new her imagination ran
ahead of her arithmetic yes she added two hundred millions
besides sixty millions of odd money

that sounds like a great deal observed clara quietly for besides
caring very little for these millions she had not a profound respect
for her friend's accuracy on such subjects

it is a great deal ma says there are not ten richer men than pa in
the state now does not this alter the matter about the
pocket-handkerchief it would be mean in me not to have a
hundred-dollar handkerchief when i could get one

it may alter the matter as to the extravagance but it does not alter
it as to the fitness of what use is a pocket-handkerchief like this a
pocket-handkerchief is made for use my dear not for show

you would not have a young lady use her pocket-handkerchief like a
snuffy old nurse clara

i would have her use it like a young lady and in no other way but it
always strikes me as a proof of ignorance and a want of refinement when
the uses of things are confounded a pocket-handkerchief at the best
is but a menial appliance and it is bad taste to make it an object of
attraction fine it may be for that conveys an idea of delicacy in
its owner but ornamented beyond reason never look what a tawdry and
vulgar thing an embroidered slipper is on a woman's foot

yes i grant you that but everybody cannot have hundred-dollar
handkerchiefs though they may have embroidered slippers i shall wear
my purchase at miss trotter's ball to-night

to this clara made no objection though she still looked disapprobation
of her purchase now the lovely eudosia had not a bad heart she had
only received a bad education her parents had given her a smattering
of the usual accomplishments but here her superior instruction ended
unable to discriminate themselves for the want of this very education
they had been obliged to trust their daughter to the care of
mercenaries who fancied their duties discharged when they had taught
their pupil to repeat like a parrot all she acquired had been for
effect and not for the purpose of every-day use in which her
instruction and her pocket-handkerchief might be said to be of a piece





and here i will digress a moment to make a single remark on a subject
of which popular feeling in america under the influence of popular
habits is apt to take an exparte view accomplishments are derided as
useless in comparison with what is considered household virtues the
accomplishment of a cook is to make good dishes of a seamstress to sew
well and of a lady to possess refined tastes a cultivated mind and
agreeable and intellectual habits the real virtues of all are the
same though subject to laws peculiar to their station but it is a
very different thing when we come to the mere accomplishments to
deride all the refined attainments of human skill denotes ignorance of
the means of human happiness nor is it any evidence of acquaintance
with the intricate machinery of social greatness and a lofty
civilization these gradations in attainments are inseparable from
civilized society and if the skill of the ingenious and laborious is
indispensable to a solid foundation without the tastes and habits of
the refined and cultivated it never can be graceful or pleasing

eudosia had some indistinct glimmerings of this fact though it was not
often that she came to sound and discriminating decisions even in
matters less complicated in the present instance she saw this truth
only by halves and that too in its most commonplace aspect as will
appear by the remark she made on the occasion

then clara as to the price i have paid for this handkerchief she
said you ought to remember what the laws of political economy lay
down on such subjects i suppose your pa makes you study political
economy my dear

indeed he does not i hardly know what it means

well that is singular for pa says in this age of the world it is
the only way to be rich now it is by means of a trade in lots and
political economy generally that he has succeeded so wonderfully
for to own the truth to you clara pa hasn't always been rich

no answered clara with a half-suppressed smile she knowing the
fact already perfectly well

oh no   far from it   but we don't speak of this publicly it being a
sort of disgrace in new york you know not to be thought worth at
least half a million i dare say your pa is worth as much as that

i have not the least idea he is worth a fourth of it though i do not
pretend to know to me half a million of dollars seems a great deal of
money and i know my father considers himself poor   poor at least for
one of his station but what were you about to say of political
economy i am curious to hear how that can have any thing to do with
your handkerchief

why my dear in this manner you know a distribution of labor is the
source of all civilization   that trade is an exchange of
equivalents   that custom-houses fetter these equivalents   that nothing
which is fettered is free   

my dear eudosia what is your tongue running on

you will not deny clara that any thing which is fettered is not
free and that freedom is the greatest blessing of this happy country
and that trade ought to be as free as any thing else

all this was gibberish to clara caverly who understood the phrases
notwithstanding quite as well as the friend who was using them
political economy is especially a science of terms and free trade as
a branch of it is called is just the portion of it which is indebted
to them the most but clara had not patience to hear any more of the
unintelligible jargon which has got possession of the world to-day
much as mr pitt's celebrated sinking-fund scheme for paying off the
national debt of great britain did half a century since and under
very much the same influences and she desired her friend to come at
once to the point as connected with the pocket-handkerchief


well then resumed eudosia it is connected in this way the
luxuries of the rich give employment to the poor and cause money to
circulate now this handkerchief of mine no doubt has given
employment to some poor french girl for four or five months and of
course food and raiment she has earned no doubt fifty of the
hundred dollars i have paid then the custom-house   ah clara if it
were not for that vile custom-house i might have had the handkerchief
for at least five-and-twenty dollars lower     

in which case you would have prized it five-and-twenty times less
answered clara smiling archly

that is true yes free trade after all does not apply to
pocket-handkerchiefs

and yet interrupted clara laughing if one can believe what one
reads it applies to hackney-coaches ferry-boats doctors lawyers
and even the clergy my father says it is     

what i am curious to know clara what as plain speaking a man as mr
caverly calls it

he is plain speaking enough to call it a     humbug said the
daughter endeavoring to mouth the word in a theatrical manner but
as othello says the handkerchief


oh fifty dollars go to the poor girl who does the work twenty-five
more to the odious custom-house some fifteen to rent fuel lights
and ten perhaps to mr bobbinet as profits now all this is very
good and very useful to society as you must own

alas poor adrienne thou didst not receive for me as many francs as
this fair calculation gave thee dollars and richer wouldst thou have
been and oh how much happier hadst thou kept the money paid for me
sold the lace even at a loss and spared thyself so many many hours of
painful and anxious toil but it is thus with human calculations the
propositions seem plausible and the reasoning fair while stern truth
lies behind all to level the pride of understanding and prove the
fallacy of the wisdom of men the reader may wish to see how closely
eudosia's account of profit and loss came to the fact and i shall
consequently make up the statement from the private books of the firm
that had the honor of once owning me viz

as clara caverly had yet to see mrs thoughtful and pay eudosia's
subscription the former now took her leave i was thus left alone with
my new employer for the first time and had an opportunity of learning
something of her true character without the interposition of third
persons for let a friend have what hold he or she may on your heart
it has a few secrets that are strictly its own if admiration of myself
could win my favor i had every reason to be satisfied with the hands
into which fortune had now thrown me there were many things to admire
in eudosia   a defective education being the great evil with which she
had to contend owing to this education if it really deserved such a
name she had superficial accomplishments superficially
acquired   principles that scarce extended beyond the retenue and morals
of her sex   tastes that had been imbibed from questionable models   and
hopes that proceeded from a false estimate of the very false position
into which she had been accidentally and suddenly thrown still eudosia
had a heart she could scarcely be a woman and escape the influence of
this portion of the female frame by means of the mesmeritic power of a
pocket-handkerchief i soon discovered that there was a certain morgan
morely in new york to whom she longed to exhibit my perfection as
second to the wish to exhibit her own

i scarcely know whether to felicitate myself or not on the
circumstance that i was brought out the very first evening i passed in
the possession of eudosia halfacre the beautiful girl was dressed and
ready for mrs trotter's ball by eight and her admiring mother thought
it impossible for the heart of morgan morely a reputed six figure
fortune to hold out any longer by some accident or other mr
halfacre did not appear   he had not dined at home and the two females
had all the joys of anticipation to themselves

i wonder what has become of your father said mrs halfacre after
inquiring for her husband for the tenth time it is so like him to
forget an engagement to a ball i believe he thinks of nothing but his
lots it is really a great trial dosie to be so rich i sometimes
wish we weren't worth more than a million for after all i suspect
true happiness is to be found in these little fortunes heigho it's
ten o'clock and we must go if we mean to be there at all for mrs
caverly once said in my presence that she thought it as vulgar to be
too late as too early

the carriage was ordered and we all three got in leaving a message
for mr halfacre to follow us as the rumor that a three-figure
pocket-handkerchief was to be at the ball had preceded my appearance
a general buzz announced my arrival in the salle a manger-salons i
have no intention of describing fashionable society in the great
emporium of the western world every body understands that it is on the
best possible footing   grace ease high breeding and common sense
being so blended together that it is exceedingly difficult to analyze
them or indeed to tell which is which it is this moral fusion that
renders the whole perfect as the harmony of fine coloring throws a
glow of glory on the pictures of claude or for that matter on those
of cole too still as envious and evil disposed persons have dared to
call in question the elegance and more especially the retenue of a
manhattanese rout i feel myself impelled if not by that high
sentiment patriotism at least by a feeling of gratitude for the great
consideration that is attached to pocket-handkerchiefs just to declare
that it is all scandal if i have any fault to find with new york
society it is on account of its formal and almost priggish quiet   the
female voice being usually quite lost in it   thus leaving a void in the
ear not to say the heart that is painful to endure could a few young
ladies too be persuaded to become a little more prominent and quit
their mother's apron-strings it would add vastly to the grouping and
relieve the stiffness of the shin-pieces of formal rows of
dark-looking men and of the flounces of pretty women these two slight
faults repaired new york society might rival that of paris especially
in the chausse d'autin more than this i do not wish to say and less
than this i cannot in honor write for i have made some of the warmest
and truest-hearted friends in new york that it ever fell to the lot of
a pocket-handkerchief to enjoy


it has been said that my arrival produced a general buzz in less than
a minute eudosia had made her curtsy and was surrounded in a corner
by a bevy of young friends all silent together and all dying to see
me to deny the deep gratification i felt at the encomiums i received
would be hypocrisy they went from my borders to my centre   from the
lace to the hem   and from the hem to the minutest fibre of my exquisite
texture in a word i was the first hundred-dollar pocket-handkerchief
that had then appeared in their circles and had i been a polish count
with two sets of moustaches i could not have been more flattered and
entertained my fame soon spread through the rooms as two little
apartments with a door between them that made each an alcove of the
other were called and even the men the young ones in particular
began to take an interest in me this latter interest it is true did
not descend to the minutiae of trimmings and work or even of fineness
but the three figure had a surprising effect an elderly lady sent to
borrow me for a moment it was a queer thing to borrow a
pocket-handkerchief some will think but i was lent to twenty people
that night and while in her hands i overheard the following little
aside between two young fashionables who were quite unconscious of
the acuteness of the senses of our family

this must be a rich old chap this halfacre to be able to give his
daughter a hundred-dollar pocket-handkerchief tom one might do well
to get introduced

if you'll take my advice ned you'll keep where you are was the
answer you've been to the surrogate's office and have seen the will
of old simonds and know that he has left his daughter seventy-eight
thousand dollars and after all this pocket-handkerchief may be only
a sign i always distrust people who throw out such lures

oh rely on it there is no sham here charley pray told me of this
girl last week when no one had ever heard of her pocket-handkerchief

why don't charley then take her himself i'm sure if i had his
imperial i could pick and choose among all the second-class heiresses
in town

ay there's the rub tom one is obliged in our business to put up
with the second class why can't we aim higher at once and get such
girls as the burtons for instance

the burtons have or have had a mother

and haven't all girls mothers who ever heard of a man or a woman
without a mother

true physically but i mean morally now this very eudosia halfacre
has no more mother in the last sense than you have a wet-nurse she
has an old woman to help her make a fool of herself but in the way of
a mother she would be better off with a pair of good gum-shoes a
creature that is just to tell a girl not to wet her feet and when to
cloak and uncloak and to help tear the check-book out of money is no
more of a mother than old simonds was of a solomon when he made that
will which every one of us knows by heart quite as well as he knows the
constitution

here a buzz in the room drew the two young men a little aside and for
a minute i heard nothing but indistinct phrases in which removal of
deposites panic general jackson and revolution were the only
words i could fairly understand presently however the young men
dropped back into their former position and the dialogue proceeded


there exclaimed ned in a voice louder than was prudent that is
what i call an escape that cursed handkerchief was very near taking me
in i call it swindling to make such false pretensions

it might be very awkward with one who was not properly on his guard
but with the right sort there is very little danger

here the two elegants led out a couple of heiresses to dance and i
heard no more of them or of their escapes lest the reader however
should be misled i wish to add that these two worthies are not to be
taken as specimens of new york morality at all   no place on earth being
more free from fortune-hunters or of a higher tone of social morals in
this delicate particular as i am writing for american readers i wish
to say that all they are told of the vices of old countries on the
other side of the atlantic is strictly true while all that is said
directly or by implication of the vices and faults of this happy
young country is just so much calumny the many excellent friends i
have made since my arrival in this hemisphere has bound my heart to
them to all eternity and i will now proceed with my philosophical and
profound disquisitions on what i have seen with a perfect confidence
that i shall receive credit and an independence of opinion that is
much too dear to me to consent to place it in question but to return
to facts

i was restored to eudosia with a cold reserved look by a lady into
whose hands i had passed that struck me as singular as shown to the
owner of such an article it was not long however before i
discovered to use a homely phrase that something had happened and i
was not altogether without curiosity to know what that something was
it was apparent enough that eudosia was the subject of general
observation and of general conversation though so long as she held
me in her hand it exceeded all my acuteness of hearing to learn what
was said the poor girl fancied her pocket-handkerchief was the common
theme and in this she was not far from right though it was in a way
she little suspected at length clara caverly drew near and borrowed
me of her friend under a pretext of showing me to her mother who was
in the room though in fact it was merely to get me out of sight for
clara was much too well-bred to render any part of another's dress the
subject of her discussions in general society as if impatient to get
me out of sight i was thrown on a sofa among a little pile of
consoeurs if there is such a word for a gathering had been made
while our pretty hostesses were dancing in order to compare our
beauty there we lay quite an hour a congress of pocket-handkerchiefs
making our comments on the company and gossiping in our own fashion
it was only the next day that i discovered the reason we were thus
neglected for to own the truth something had occurred which suddenly
brought three-figure and even two-figure people of our class into
temporary disrepute i shall explain that reason at the proper moment

the conversation among the handkerchiefs on the sofa ran principally
on the subject of our comparative market value i soon discovered that
there was a good deal of envy against me on account of my three
figures although i confess i thought i cut a poor figure lying
as i did neglected in a corner on the very first evening of my
appearance in the fashionable world but some of the opinions uttered
on this occasion   always in the mesmeritic manner be it
remembered   will be seen in the following dialogue

well exclaimed this is the first ball i have been at that i
was not thought good enough to have a place in the quadrille you see
all the canaille are in the hands of their owners while we the elite
of pocket-handkerchiefs are left here in a corner like so many
cloaks

there must be a reason for this certainly answered though you
have been flourished about these two winters in a way that ought to
satisfy one of your pretensions

an animated reply was about to set us all in commotion when who
next to myself had the highest claims of any in the party changed the
current of feeling by remarking   

it is no secret that we are out of favor for a night or two in
consequence of three figures having been paid for one of us this very
day by a bossess whose father stopped payment within three hours
after he signed the cheque that was to pay the importer i overheard
the whole story half an hour since and thus you see every one is
afraid to be seen with an aristocratic handkerchief just at this
moment but   bless you in a day or two all will be forgotten and we
shall come more into favor than ever all is always forgotten in new
york in a week

such was indeed the truth one general jackson had removed the
deposits as i afterwards learned though i never could understand
exactly what that meant but it suddenly made money scarce more
especially with those who had none and every body that was extended
began to quake in their shoes mr halfacre happened to be in this
awkward predicament and he broke down in the effort to sustain
himself his energy had over-reached itself like the tumbler who
breaks his neck in throwing seventeen hundred somersets backwards





every one is more apt to hear an unpleasant rumor than those whom it
immediately affects thus eudosia and her mother were the only persons
at mrs trotter's ball who were ignorant of what had happened one
whispering the news to another though no one could presume to
communicate the fact to the parties most interested in a commercial
town like new york the failure of a reputed millionaire could not
long remain a secret and every body stared at the wife and daughter
and me first as if they had never seen the wives and daughters of
bankrupts before and second as if they had never seen them surrounded
by the evidences of their extravagance

but the crisis was at hand and the truth could not long be concealed
eudosia was permitted to cloak and get into the carriage unaided by any
beau a thing that had not happened to her since speculation had
brought her father into notice the circumstance more than any other
attracted her attention and the carriage no sooner started than the
poor girl gave vent to her feelings

what can be the matter ma eudosia said that every person in mrs
trotter's rooms should stare so at me this evening i am sure my dress
is as well made and proper as that of any other young lady in the
rooms and as for the handkerchiefs i could see envy in fifty eyes
when their owners heard the price

that is all dear   they did envy you and no wonder they
stared   nothing makes people stare like envy i thought this
handkerchief would make a commotion oh i used to stare myself when
envious

still it was odd that morgan morely did not ask me to dance   he knows
how fond i am of dancing and for the credit of so beautiful a
handkerchief he ought to have been more than usually attentive
to-night

mrs halfacre gaped and declared that she was both tired and sleepy
which put an end to conversation until the carriage reached her own
door

both mrs halfacre and eudosia were surprised to find the husband and
father still up he was pacing the drawing-room by the light of a
single tallow candle obviously in great mental distress

bless me exclaimed the wife   you up at this hour   what can have
happened what has come to our door

nothing but beggary answered the man smiling with a bitterness
which showed he felt an inhuman joy at that fierce moment in making
others as miserable as himself yes mrs henry halfacre   yes miss
eudosia halfacre you are both beggars   i hope that at least will
satisfy you

you mean henry that you have failed for that was a word too
familiar in new york not to be understood even by the ladies tell me
the worst at once   is it true have you failed

it is true   i have failed my notes have been this day protested for
ninety-five thousand dollars and i have not ninety-five dollars in
bank to-morrow twenty-three thousand more will fall due and this
month will bring round quite a hundred and thirty thousand more that
accursed removal of the deposits and that tiger jackson have done it
all

to own the truth both the ladies were a little confounded they wept
and for some few minutes there was a dead silence but curiosity soon
caused them both to ask questions

this is very dreadful and with our large family commenced the
mother   and so the general has it all to answer for   why did you let
him give so many notes for you

no   no   it is not that   i gave the notes myself but he removed the
deposits i tell you

it's just like him the old wretch to think of his removing your
deposits just as you wanted them so much yourself but why did the
clerks at the bank let him have them   they ought to have known that you
had all this money to pay and people cannot well pay debts without
money

you are telling that my dear to one who knows it by experience that
is the very reason why i have failed i have a great many debts and i
have no money

but you have hundreds of lots   give them lots henry and that will
settle all your difficulties you must remember how all our friends
have envied us our lots

ay no fear but they'll get the lots my dear   unless indeed added
the speculator i take good care to prevent it thank god i'm not a
declared bankrupt i can yet make my own assignee

well then i wouldn't say a word about it   declare nothing and let
em find out that you have failed in the best manner they can why
tell people your distresses so that they may pity you i hate pity
above all things   and especially the pity of my own friends

oh that will be dreadful put in eudosia for heaven's sake pa
don't let any body pity us

very little fear of that i fancy muttered the father people who
shoot up like rockets in two or three years seldom lay the
foundations of much pity in readiness for their fall

well i declare dosie this is too bad in the old general after all
i'm sure it must be unconstitutional for a president to remove your
father's deposits if i were in your place mr halfacre i wouldn't
fail just to spite them you know you always said that a man of energy
can do any thing in this country and i have heard mr munny say that
he didn't know a man of greater energy than yourself

the grin with which the ruined speculator turned on his wife was nearly
sardonic

your men of energy are the very fellows to fail he said however
they shall find if i have had extraordinary energy in running into
debt that i have extraordinary energy too in getting out of it mrs
halfacre we must quit this house this very week and all this fine
furniture must be brought to the hammer i mean to preserve my
character at least

this was said loftily and with the most approved accents

surely it isn't necessary to move to do that my dear other people
fail and keep their houses and furniture and carriages and such
other things let us not make ourselves the subjects of unpleasant
remarks

i intend that as little as you do yourself we must quit this house
and bring the furniture under the hammer or part with all those lots
you so much esteem and prize

oh if the house and furniture will pay the notes i'm content
especially if you can contrive to keep the lots dosie will part with
her handkerchief too i dare say if that will do any good

by george that will be a capital idea   yes the handkerchief must be
sent back to-morrow morning that will make a famous talk i only
bought it because munny was present and i wanted to get fifty thousand
dollars out of him to meet this crisis the thing didn't succeed but
no matter the handkerchief will tell in settling up that
handkerchief dosie may be made to cover a hundred lots

in what manner i was to open so much like the tent of the arabian
nights was a profound mystery to me then as well as it was to the
ladies but the handsome eudosia placed me in her father's hand with a
frank liberality that proved she was not altogether without good
qualities as i afterwards discovered indeed these two females had
most of the excellences of a devoted wife and daughter their
frivolities being the result of vicious educations or of no educations
at all rather than of depraved hearts when mr halfacre went into
liquidation as it is called and compromised with his creditors
reserving to himself a pretty little capital of some eighty or a
hundred thousand dollars by means of judicious payments to
confidential creditors his wife and daughter saw all they most prized
taken away and the town was filled with the magnitude of their
sacrifices and with the handsome manner in which both submitted to
make them by this ingenious device the insolvent not only preserved
his character by no means an unusual circumstance in new york
however but he preserved about half of his bona fide estate also his
creditors as was customary doing the paying

it is unnecessary to dwell on the remainder of this dialogue my own
adventures so soon carrying me into an entirely different sphere the
following morning however as soon as he had breakfasted mr halfacre
put me in his pocket and walked down street with the port of an
afflicted and stricken but thoroughly honest man when he reached the
shop-door of bobbinet co he walked boldly in and laid me on the
counter with a flourish so meek that even the clerks a very
matter-of-fact caste in general afterwards commented on it

circumstances of an unpleasant nature on which i presume it is
unnecessary to dwell compel me to offer you this handkerchief back
again gentlemen he said raising his hand to his eyes in a very
affecting manner as a bargain is a bargain i feel great reluctance
to disturb its sacred obligations but i cannot suffer a child of mine
to retain such a luxury while a single individual can justly say that
i owe him a dollar

what fine sentiments said silky who was lounging in a corner of the
shop   wonderful sentiments and such as becomes a man of honesty

those around the colonel approved of his opinion and mr halfacre
raised his head like one who was not afraid to look his creditors in
the face

i approve of your motives mr halfacre returned bobbinet but you
know the character of the times and the dearness of rents that
article has been seen in private hands doubtless and can no longer be
considered fresh   we shall be forced to make a considerable abatement
if we consent to comply

name your own terms sir so they leave me a single dollar for my
creditors i shall be happy

wonderful sentiments repeated the colonel   we must send that man to
the national councils

after a short negotiation it was settled that mr halfacre was to
receive and bobbinet co were to replace me in their drawer the
next morning an article appeared in a daily paper of pre-eminent
honesty and truth and talents in the following words   

worthy of imitation   a distinguished gentleman of this city h     
h     esquire having been compelled to suspend in consequence of the
late robbery of the bank of the united states by the cold-blooded
miscreant whose hoary head disgraces the white house felt himself
bound to return an article of dress purchased as recently as yesterday
by his lovely daughter and who in every respect was entitled to wear
it as she would have adorned it receiving back the price with a view
to put it in the fund he is already collecting to meet the demands of
his creditors it is due to the very respectable firm of bobbinet co
to add that it refunded the money with the greatest liberality at the
first demand we can recommend this house to our readers as one of the
most liberal in our city by the way the editor who wrote this article
didn't own a foot of the town or of any thing else and as possessing
a very large and well selected assortment of the choicest goods

the following words   we take this occasion to thank messrs bobbinet 
co for a specimen of most beautiful gloves sent us had a line run
through in the manuscript a little reflection telling the learned
editor that it might be indiscreet to publish the fact at that precise
moment the american will know how to appreciate the importance of this
opinion in relation to the house in question when he is told that it
was written by one of those inspired moralists and profound
constitutional lawyers and ingenious political economists who daily
teach their fellow creatures how to give practical illustrations of the
mandates of the bible how to discriminate in vexed questions arising
from the national compact and how to manage their private affairs in
such a way as to escape the quicksands that have wrecked their own

as some of my readers may feel an interest in the fate of poor eudosia
i will take occasion to say before i proceed with the account of my
own fortunes that it was not half as bad as might have been supposed
mr halfacre commenced his compromises under favorable auspices the
reputation of the affair of the pocket-handkerchief was of great
service and creditors relented as they thought of the hardship of
depriving a pretty girl of so valuable an appliance long before the
public had ceased to talk about the removal of the deposits mr
halfacre had arranged every thing to his own satisfaction the lots
were particularly useful one of them paying off a debt that had been
contracted for half a dozen now and then he met an obstinate fellow
who insisted on his money and who talked of suits in chancery such
men were paid off in full litigation being the speculator's aversion
as for the fifty dollars received for me it answered to go to market
with until other funds were found this diversion of the sum from its
destined object however was apparent rather than real since food was
indispensable to enable the excellent but unfortunate man to work for
the benefit of his creditors in short every thing was settled in the
most satisfactory manner mr halfacre paying a hundred cents in the
dollar in lots however but in such a manner as balanced his books
beautifully

now thank god i owe no man a sixpence said mr to mrs halfacre
the day all was concluded and only one small mistake has been made by
me in going through so many complicated accounts and for such large
sums

i had hoped all was settled answered the good woman in alarm it is
that unreasonable man john downright who gives you the trouble i
dare say

he   oh he is paid in full i offered him at first twenty-five cents
in the dollar but that he wouldn't hear to then i found a small
error and offered forty it wouldn't do and i had to pay the scamp a
hundred i can look that fellow in the face with a perfectly clear
conscience

who else can it be then

only your brother myers my dear somehow or other we made a mistake
in our figures which made out a demand in his favor of i
paid it in property but when we came to look over the figures it was
discovered that a cypher too much had been thrown in and myers paid
back the difference like a man as he is

and to whom will that difference belong

to whom   oh   why of course to the right owner





when i found myself once more in the possession of bobbinet co i
fancied that i might anticipate a long residence in their drawers my
freshness as an article having been somewhat tarnished by the
appearance at mrs trotter's ball in this i was mistaken the next day
bringing about a release and a restoration to my proper place in
society

the very morning after i was again in the drawer a female voice was
heard asking for worked french pocket-handkerchiefs as i clearly
came within this category   alas poor adrienne   in half a minute i
found myself along with fifty fellows or fellowesses lying on the
counter the instant i heard the voice i knew that the speaker was not
mamma but my child and i now saw that she was fair julia monson
was not as brilliantly handsome as my late owner but she had more
feeling and refinement in the expression of her countenance still
there was an uneasy worldly glancing of the eye that denoted how much
she lived out of herself in the less favorable understanding of the
term an expression of countenance that i have had occasion to remark
in most of those who think a very expensive handkerchief necessary to
their happiness it is in fact the natural indication that the mind
dwells more on show than on substantial things and a proof that the
possessor of this quality is not content to rely altogether on the
higher moral feelings and attainments for her claims to deference in a
word it is some such trait as that which distinguishes the beautiful
plumage of the peacock from the motive that incites the bird to
display his feathers

in company with miss monson was another young lady of about her own
age and of a very similar appearance as to dress and station still a
first glance discovered an essential difference in character this
companion who was addressed as mary and whose family name was warren
had none of the uneasiness of demeanor that belonged to her friend and
obviously cared less what others thought of every thing she said or
did when the handkerchiefs were laid on the counter julia monson
seized on one with avidity while mary warren regarded us all with a
look of cold indifference if not one of downright displeasure

what beauties exclaimed the first the clerk at that moment quitting
them to hand some gloves to another customer   what delightful
needle-work mary do you purchase one to keep me in countenance and i
will purchase another i know your mother gave you the money this very
morning

not for that object julia my dear mother little thinks i shall do
any such thing

and why not a rich pocket-handkerchief is a stylish thing

i question if style as you call it is just the thing for a young
woman under any circumstances but to confess the truth i think a
pocket-handkerchief that is to be looked at and which is not to be
used vulgar

not in sir walter scott's signification my dear answered julia
laughing for it is not so very common every body cannot have a
worked french pocket-handkerchief

sir walter scott's definition of what is vulgar is open to criticism
i fancy the word comes from the common mind or common practices
beyond a question but it now means what is common as opposed to what
is cultivated and refined it is an absurdity too to make a thing
respectable because it is common a fib is one of the commonest things
in the world and yet it is scarcely respectable

oh every one says you are a philosopheress mary and i ought to have
expected some such answer but a handkerchief i am determined to have
and it shall be the very handsomest i can find

and the dearest well you will have a very lady-like wardrobe with
one pocket-handkerchief in it i wonder you do not purchase a single
shoe

because i have two feet replied julia with spirit though she
laughed good-naturedly   but here is the clerk and he must not hear
our quarrels have the goodness sir to show me the handsomest
pocket-handkerchief in your shop

i was drawn from beneath the pile and laid before the bright black eyes
of julia with an air of solemn dignity by the young dealer in finery

that ma'am he said is the very finest and most elegant article
not only that we have but which is to be found in america it was
brought out by our mr silky the last voyage he said paris cannot
produce its equal

this is beautiful sir one must admit what is the price

why ma'am we ought in justice to ourselves to have for that
article but to our regular customers i believe mr bobbinet has
determined to ask only 

this sounded exceedingly liberal   to ask only for that for which
there was a sort of moral obligation to ask   and julia having
come out with the intent to throw away a hundred-dollar note that her
mother had given her that morning the bargain was concluded i was
wrapped up carefully in paper put into miss monson's muff and once
more took my departure from the empire of col silky i no longer
occupied a false position

now i hope you are happy julia quietly observed mary warren as
the two girls took their seats side by side in mrs monson's chariot
the surprise to me is that you forgot to purchase this ne plus ultra
of elegance while in paris last summer


my father said he could not afford it we spent a great deal of money
as you may suppose in running about seeing sights and laying in
curiosities and when i hinted the matter to my mother she said we
must wait until another half year's rents had come round after all
mary there is one person at home to whom i shall be ashamed to show
this purchase

at home   is there indeed had you merely said in town i could have
understood you your father and mother approving of what you have done
i do not see who there is at home to alarm you

julia blushed when her friend said in town and her conscious
feelings immediately conjured up the image of a certain betts shoreham
as the person in her companion's mind's eye i detected it all easily
enough being actually within six inches of her throbbing heart at that
very moment though concealed in the muff

it is not what you suppose mary nor whom you suppose answered my
mistress i mean mademoiselle hennequin   i confess i do dread the
glance of her reproving eye

it is odd enough that you should dread reproval from the governess of
your sisters when you do not dread it from your own mother but
mademoiselle hennequin has nothing to do with you you were educated
and out before she entered your family and it is singular that a
person not older than yourself who was engaged in paris so recently
should have obtained so much influence over the mind of one who never
was her pupil

i am not afraid of her in most things rejoined julia but i confess
i am in all that relates to taste particularly in what relates to
extravagance

i have greatly misunderstood the character of mademoiselle hennequin
if she ventured to interfere with you in either a governess ought not
to push her control beyond her proper duties

nor has mademoiselle hennequin answered julia honestly still i
cannot but hear the lessons she gives my sisters and   yes   to own the
truth i dread the glance she cannot avoid throwing on my purchase it
will say of what use are all my excellent lessons in taste and
prudence if an elder sister's example is to counteract them it is
that i dread

mary was silent for fully a minute then she smiled archly as girls
will smile when certain thoughts cross their playful imaginations and
continued the discourse

and betts shoreham has nothing to do with all this dread

what is betts shoreham to me or what am i to betts shoreham i am
sure the circumstances that we happened to come from europe in the same
packet and that he continues to visit us now we are at home do not
entitle him to have a veto as they call it on my wardrobe

not yet certainly my dear still they may entitle him to have this
veto in petto



i thought a shade passed over the features of the pretty julia monson
as she answered her friend with a seriousness to show that she was now
in earnest and with a propriety that proved she had great good sense
at bottom as well as strong womanly feeling

if i have learned nothing else by visiting europe she said i have
learned to see how inconsiderate we girls are in america in talking so
much openly of this sort of thing a woman's delicacy is like that of
a tender flower and it must suffer by having her name coupled with
that of any man except him that she is to marry

julia dear i will never speak of mr shoreham again i should not
have done it now had i not thought his attentions were acceptable to
you as i am sure they are to your parents certainly they are very
marked   at least so others think as well as myself

i know it seems so to the world answered julia in a subdued
thoughtful tone but it scarcely seems so to me betts shoreham is
very agreeable every way a suitable connection for any of us and that
is the reason people are so ready to fancy him in earnest

in earnest if mr shoreham pays attentions that are pointed and is
not in earnest he is a very different person from what i took him to
be

julia's voice grew still more gentle and it was easy enough to see
that her feelings were enlisted in the subject

it is no more than justice to betts shoreham she continued to say
that he has not been pointed in his attentions to me we females are
said to be quick in discovering such matters and i am not more blind
than the rest of our sex he is a young man of good family and has
some fortune and that makes him welcome in most houses in town while
he is agreeable well-looking and thoroughly amiable he met us
abroad and it is natural for him to keep up an intimacy that recalls
pleasant recollections you will remember mary that before he can be
accused of trifling he must trifle i think him far more attentive to
my mother my father   nay to my two little sisters   than he is to me
even mademoiselle hennequin is quite as much if not more of a favorite
than i am

as mary warren saw that her friend was serious she changed the subject
soon after we were set down at mr monson's door here the friends
parted mary warren preferring to walk home while julia and i entered
the house together

well mother cried julia as she entered mrs monson's room i have
found the most beautiful thing you ever beheld and have bought it
here it is what do you think of my choice

mrs monson was a kind-hearted easy indulgent parent who had brought
her husband a good fortune and who had married rich in the bargain
accustomed all her life to a free use of money and of her own money
too for this is a country in which very many persons cast the
substance of others right and left and when her eldest daughter
expressed a wish to possess an elaborate specimen of our race she had
consented from a pure disinclination to deny her child any
gratification that might be deemed innocent still she knew that
prudence was a virtue and that julia had thrown away money that might
have been much better employed

this is certainly a very beautiful handkerchief observed the mother
after examining me carefully and with somewhat of the manner of a
connoisseur surprisingly beautiful and yet i almost wish my child
you had not purchased it a hundred dollars sounds frightfully en
prince for us poor simple people who live in nutshells of houses five
and twenty feet front and fifty-six deep to pay for a
pocket-handkerchief the jewel-box of a young lady who has such
handkerchiefs ought to cost thousands to be in keeping



but mother i have only one you will remember and so my jewels may
be limited to hundreds

one pocket-handkerchief has a mean sound too even one hat is not
very superfluous

that is so like mary warren mother if you did not wish me to make
the purchase you had only to say it i am sure your wish would have
been my law

i know it love and i am afraid it is your dutiful behavior that has
made me careless in this instance your happiness and interests are
ever uppermost in my mind and sometimes they seem to conflict what
young man will dare to choose a wife from among young ladies who expend
so much money on their pocket-handkerchiefs

this was said smilingly but there was a touch of tenderness and
natural concern in the voice and manner of the speaker that made an
impression on the daughter

i am afraid now mother you are thinking of betts shoreham said
julia blushing though she struggled powerfully to appear unconcerned
i do not know why it is but both you and mary warren appear to be
always thinking of mr shoreham

the mother smiled and she was not quite ingenuous when she said in
answer to the remark

shoreham was not in my mouth and you ought not to suppose he was in
my mind nevertheless i do not believe he would admire you or any one
else the more for being the owner of so expensive an article of dress
he is wealthy but very prudent in his opinions and habits

betts shoreham was born to an estate and his father before him said
julia firmly and such men know how to distinguish between the cant of
economy and those elegancies of life that become people of refinement

no one can better understand the difference between cant in economy as
well as cant in some other things and true taste as well as true
morals than young shoreham but there are indulgences that become
persons in no class

after all mother we are making a trifle a very serious matter it is
but a pocket-handkerchief

very true my love and it cost only one hundred dollars and so we'll
say no more about it bien entendu that you are not to purchase six
dozen at the same price



this terminated the dialogue julia retiring to her own room carrying
me with her i was thrown upon the bed and soon after my mistress
opened a door and summoned her two younger sisters who were studying
on the same floor to join her i shall not repeat all the delightful
exclamations and other signs of approbation that so naturally escaped
the two pretty little creatures to whom i may be said to have now been
introduced when my beauty came under examination i do not thus speak
of myself out of any weakness for pocket-handkerchiefs are wholly
without vanity but simply because i am impelled to utter nothing but
truth julia had too much consideration to let her young sisters into
the secret of my price   for this would have been teaching a premature
lesson in extravagance but having permitted them to gratify their
curiosity she exacted of them both promises not to speak of me to
their governess

but why not julia asked the inquisitive little jane mademoiselle
hennequin is so good and so kind that she would be glad to hear of
your good fortune

julia had an indistinct view of her own motive but she could not avow
it to any one not even to herself jealousy would be too strong
perhaps too indelicate a word but she alone had detected betts
shoreham's admiration of the governess and it was painful to her to
permit one who stood in this relation to her own weakness in favor of
the young man to be a witness of an act of extravagance to which she
had only half consented in committing it and of which she already more
than half repented from the first therefore she determined that
mademoiselle hennequin should never see me





and now comes an exhibition of my mesmeritic powers always
handkerchiefly speaking that may surprise those who have not
attended to the modern science of invisible fluids it is by this
means however that i am enabled to perceive a great deal of that
which passes under the roof where i may happen to be without
absolutely seeing it much escapes me of course   for even a
pocket-handkerchief cannot hear or see every thing but enough is
learned to enable me to furnish a very clear outline of that which
occurs near me more especially if it happen to be within walls of
brick in wooden edifices i find my powers much diminished   the fluids
doubtless escaping through the pores of the material

that evening then at the usual hour and while i lay snugly ensconced
in a most fragrant and convenient drawer among various other beings of
my species though not of my family alas the inmates of the house
assembled in the front drawing-room to take a few cups of tea mr and
mrs monson with their only son john monson their three daughters
the governess and betts shoreham were all present the latter having
dropped in with a new novel for the ladies

i do really wish one could see a little advance in the way of real
refinement and true elegance among all the vast improvements we are
making in frippery and follies cried mr monson throwing down an
evening paper in a pettish manner that sufficiently denoted
discontent we are always puffing our own progress in america without
exactly knowing whether a good deal of the road is not to be traveled
over again by way of undoing much that we have done here now is a
specimen of our march in folly in an advertisement of bobbinett's who
has pocket-handkerchiefs at 

by the dozen or by the gross sir demanded betts shoreham quickly

oh singly   seventy-five dollars each

nay that must be a mistake sir who even in this extravagant and
reckless country could be found to pay such a price one can fancy
such a thing in a princess with hundreds of thousands of income but
scarcely of any one else how could such a thing be used for instance

oh cried john monson to hide the blushes of the simpleton who had
thrown away her money on it i heard a story this very afternoon of
some person of the name of halfacre's having failed yesterday and
whose daughter purchased even a higher priced handkerchief than that
the very same day

his failure is not surprising then put in betts shoreham for
myself i do not think that i     

well what do you think mr shoreham asked mrs monson smiling
for she saw that julia was too much mortified to speak and who assumed
more than half the blame of her own daughter's extravagance you were
about to favor us with some magnificent resolution

i was about to utter an impertinence i confess ma'am but
recollected in time that young men's protestations of what they would
do by way of reforming the world is not of half the importance to
others that they so often fancy so i shall spare you the infliction
seventy-five dollars mademoiselle hennequin would be a high price for
such a thing even in paris i fancy

the answer was given in imperfect english a circumstance that rendered
the sweet round tones of the speaker very agreeable to the ear and
lent the charm of piquancy to what she said i could not distinguish
countenances from the drawer but i fancied young shoreham to be a
handsome youth the governess to be pale and slightly ugly though very
agreeable in manner and julia excessively embarrassed but determined
to defend her purchase should it become necessary

seventy-five dollars sound like a high price monsieur answered
mademoiselle hennequin but the ladies of paris do not grudge their
gold for ornaments to decorate their persons

ay put in john monson but they are consistent now i'll engage
this mrs hundredacres or halfacre or whatever her name may be
overlooked her own household work kept no housekeeper higgled about
flour and butter and lived half her time in her basement think of
such a woman's giving her daughter a hundred-dollar
pocket-handkerchief

now mrs monson did keep a housekeeper she was not a mere
upper-servant in her own family and julia was gratified that in this
instance her fastidious brother could not reproach her at least

well jack that is a queer reason of yours cried the father for
not indulging in a luxury because the good woman is careful in some
things she is not to be a little extravagant in others what do you
say to such logic mr shoreham

to own the truth sir i am much of monson's way of thinking it is as
necessary to begin at the bottom in constructing a scheme of domestic
refinement as in building a house fitness is entitled to a place in
every thing that relates to taste at all events and as a laced and
embroidered pocket-handkerchief is altogether for appearance it
becomes necessary that other things should be in keeping if the ladies
will excuse me i will say that i never yet saw a woman in america in
a sufficiently high dress to justify such an appendage as that which
monson has just mentioned the handkerchief ought not to cost more than
the rest of the toilette

it is true mr shoreham put in julia with vivacity if not with
spirit that our women do not dress as women of rank sometimes dress
in europe but on the whole i do not know that we are so much behind
them in appearance

very far from it my dear miss monson   as far as possible   i am the
last man to decry my beautiful countrywomen who are second to no
others in appearance certainly if they do not dress as richly it is
because they do not need it mademoiselle hennequin has no reason to
deprecate comparisons   and   but   

certainly answered the governess when she found the young man
hesitated about proceeding certainly i am not so bigoted or so
blind as to wish to deny that the american ladies are very
handsome   handsomer as a whole than those of my own country it would
be idle to deny it   so are those of england and italy

this is being very liberal mademoiselle hennequin and more than you
are required to admit observed mrs monson in the kindest possible
tone of voice and i make no manner of doubt with a most benevolent
smile though i could not see her some of the most brilliantly
beautiful women i have ever seen have been french   perhaps the most
brilliantly beautiful

that is true also madame but such is not the rule i think both
the english and americans seem to me handsomer as a whole than my own
countrywomen now nothing could be sweeter or softer or gentler
than the voice that made this great concession   for great it certainly
was as coming from a woman it appeared to me that the admission too
was more than commonly generous from the circumstance that the
governess was not particularly pretty in her own person it is true i
had not yet seen her but my mesmeritic impulses induced me to fancy as
much

what say the young gentlemen to this asked mr monson laughing
this is a question not to be settled altogether by ladies old or
young

betts shoreham has substantially told you what he thinks and now i
claim a right to give my opinion cried john monson like betts i
will not decry my countrywomen but i shall protest against the
doctrine of their having all the beauty in the world by jove i have
seen in one opera-house at rome more beautiful women than i ever saw
together before or since in any other place broadway never equals
the corso of a carnival


this is not sticking to the subject observed mrs monson
pocket-handkerchiefs and housekeepers are our themes and not pretty
women mademoiselle hennequin you are french enough i am sure to
like more sugar in your tea

this changed the subject which became a desultory discourse on the
news of the day i could not understand half that was said laboring
under the disadvantage of being shut up in a close drawer on another
floor and that too with six dozen of chattering french gloves lying
within a foot of me still i saw plainly enough that mademoiselle
hennequin notwithstanding she was a governess was a favorite in the
family and i may add out of it also   betts shoreham being no sort of
a connection of the monsons i thought moreover that i discovered
signs of cross-purposes as between the young people though i think a
pocket-handkerchief subject to those general laws concerning secrets
that are recognized among all honorable persons not having been
actually present on this occasion should i proceed to relate all that
passed or that i fancied passed it would be degrading myself to the
level of those newspapers which are in the habit of retailing private
conversations and which like most small dealers in such things never
retail fairly

i saw no more of my mistress for a week i have reason to think that
she had determined never to use me but female resolutions in matters
of dress are not of the most inflexible nature there was a certain
mrs leamington in new york who gave a great ball about this time
and being in the same set as the monsons the family was invited as a
matter of course it would have surpassed the powers of self-denial to
keep me in the back-ground on such an occasion and julia having first
cleared the way by owning her folly to a very indulgent father and a
very tormenting brother determined nobly to bring me out let the
effect on betts shoreham be what it might as the father had no female
friends to trouble him he was asked to join the monsons   the intimacy
fully warranting the step

julia never looked more lovely than she did that night she anticipated
much pleasure and her smiles were in proportion to her anticipations
when all was ready she took me from the drawer let a single drop of
lavender fall in my bosom and tripped down stairs toward the
drawing-room betts shoreham and mademoiselle hennequin were together
and for a novelty alone i say for a novelty because the governess
had few opportunities to see any one without the presence of a third
person and because her habits as an unmarried and well educated
french woman indisposed her to tete-a-tetes with the other sex my
mistress was lynx-eyed in all that related to betts shoreham and the
governess a single glance told her that their recent conversation had
been more than usually interesting nor could i help seeing it
myself   the face of the governess being red or in that condition
which were she aught but a governess would be called suffused with
blushes julia felt uncomfortable   she felt herself to be de trop and
making an incoherent excuse she had scarcely taken a seat on a sofa
before she arose left the room and ran up stairs again in doing so
however the poor girl left me inadvertently on the sofa she had so
suddenly quitted herself



betts shoreham manifested no concern at this movement though
mademoiselle hennequin precipitately changed her seat which had been
quite near   approximately near as one might say   to the chair occupied
by the gentleman this new evolution placed the governess close at my
side now whatever might have been the subject of discourse between
these two young persons   for mademoiselle hennequin was quite as
youthful as my mistress let her beauty be as it might   it was not
continued in my presence on the contrary the young lady turned her
eyes on me instead of looking at her companion and then she raised me
in her hand and commenced a critical examination of my person

that is a very beautiful handkerchief mademoiselle hennequin said
betts shoreham making the remark an excuse for following the young
lady to the sofa had we heard of its existence our remarks the other
night on such a luxury might have been more guarded

no answer was given the governess gazed on me intently and tears
began to course down her cheeks notwithstanding it was evident she
wished to conceal them ashamed of her weakness she endeavored to
smile them away and to appear cheerful

what is there in that pocket-handkerchief dear mademoiselle
hennequin asked betts shoreham who had a pernicious habit of calling
young ladies with whom he was on terms of tolerable intimacy
dear   a habit that sometimes misled persons as to the degree of
interest he felt in his companions   what can there be in that
pocket-handkerchief to excite tears from a mind and a heart like yours

my mind and heart mr shoreham are not as faultless perhaps as
your goodness would make them out to be envy is a very natural feeling
for a woman in matters of dress they say and certainly i am not the
owner of so beautiful a pocket-handkerchief   pardon me mr shoreham i
cannot command myself and must be guilty of the rudeness of leaving
you alone if     

mademoiselle hennequin uttered no more but rushed from the room with
an impetuosity of manner and feeling that i have often had occasion to
remark in young french women as a matter of course i was left alone
with betts shoreham

i shall conceal nothing that ought to be told betts shoreham
notwithstanding her dependent situation and his own better fortunes
loved the governess and the governess loved betts shoreham these were
facts that i discovered at a later day though i began to suspect the
truth from that moment neither however knew of the other's passion
though each hoped as an innocent and youthful love will hope and each
trembled as each hoped nothing explicit had been said that evening
but much very much in the way of sympathy and feeling had been
revealed and but for the inopportune entrance of julia and myself all
might have been told





there is no moment in the life of man when he is so keenly sensitive
on the subject of the perfection of his mistress as that in which he
completely admits her power all his jealousy is actively alive to the
smallest shade of fault although his feelings so much indispose him to
see any blemish betts shoreham felt an unpleasant pang even   yes it
amounted to a pang   for in a few moments he would have offered his
hand   and men cannot receive any drawback with indifference at such an
instant   he felt an unpleasant pang then as the idea crossed his mind
that mademoiselle hennequin could be so violently affected by a feeling
as unworthy as that of envy he had passed several years abroad and
had got the common notion about the selfishness of the french and more
particularly their women and his prejudices took the alarm but his
love was much the strongest and soon looked down the distrust however
reasonable under the circumstances the latter might have appeared to
a disinterested and cool-headed observer he had seen so much meek and
pure-spirited self-denial so much high principle in the conduct of
mademoiselle hennequin during an intimacy which had now lasted six
months that no passing feeling of doubt like the one just felt could
unsettle the confidence created by her virtues i know it may take more
credit than belongs to most pocket-handkerchiefs to maintain the
problem of the virtues of a french governess   a class of unfortunate
persons that seem doomed to condemnation by all the sages of our modern
imaginative literature an english governess or even an american
governess if indeed there be such a being in nature may be every
thing that is respectable and prudent and wise and good but the
french governess has a sort of ex-officio moral taint about her that
throws her without the pale of literary charities nevertheless one or
two of the most excellent women i have ever known have been french
governesses though i do not choose to reveal what this particular
individual of the class turned out to be in the end until the moment
for the denouement of her character shall regularly arrive

there was not much time for betts shoreham to philosophize and
speculate on female caprices and motives john monson making his
appearance in as high evening dress as well comported with what is
called republican simplicity john was a fine looking fellow six
feet and an inch with large whiskers a bushy head of hair and
particularly white teeth his friend was two inches shorter of much
less showy appearance but of a more intellectual countenance and of
juster proportions most persons at first sight would praise john
monson's person and face but all would feel the superiority of betts
shoreham's on an acquaintance the smile of the latter in particular
was as winning and amiable as that of a girl it was that smile on the
one hand and his active never dormant sympathy for her situation on
the other which united had made such an inroad on the young
governess's affections

it's deuced cold betts said john as he came near the fire this
delightful country of ours has some confounded hard winters i wonder
if it be patriotic to say our winters

it's all common property monson   but what have become of your sister
and mademoiselle hennequin they were both here a minute since and
have vanished like   

what   ghosts   no you dare not call them that lest their spirits
take it in dudgeon julie is no ghost though she is sometimes so
delicate and ethereal and as for henny   

who exclaimed betts doubting if his ears were true

henny tote and moll's governess whom do you think i could mean
else i always call her henny en famille and i look upon you as
almost one of us since our travels


i'm sure i can scarcely be grateful enough my dear fellow   but you
do not call her so to her face

why   no   perhaps not exactly in her very teeth   and beautiful teeth
she has betts   julie's won't compare with them

miss monson has fine teeth notwithstanding perhaps mademoiselle
hennequin   

yes henny has the best teeth of any girl i know they are none of
your pearls   some pearls are yellowish you know   but they are teeth
just what ought to be in a handsome girl's mouth i have no objection
to pearls in a necklace or in the pockets but teeth are what are
wanted in a mouth and henny has just the finest set i know of

betts shoreham fidgetted at the henny and he had the weakness at
the moment to wish the young governess were not in a situation to be
spoken of so unceremoniously he had not time to express this feeling
before john monson got a glimpse of me and had me under examination
beneath the light of a very powerful lamp i declare that knowing his
aversion to our species i felt a glow in all my system at the
liberties he was taking

what have we here exclaimed john monson in surprise has miss
flowergarden made a call and is this her card

i believe that pocket-handkerchief belongs to your sister answered
betts drily if that be what you mean

jule well i am sorry to hear it i did hope that no sister of mine
would run into any such foolish extravagance   do you own it jule who
entered the room at that instant   is this bit of a rag yours or is it
not more likely to be henny's

bit of a rag cried the sister snatching me dexterously out of the
spoiler's hands and henny too this is not a bit of a rag sir
but a very pretty pocket-handkerchief and you must very well know that
mademoiselle hennequin is not likely to be the owner of any thing as
costly

and what did it cost pray at least tell me that if nothing else

i shall not gratify your curiosity sir   a lady's wardrobe is not to
be dissected in this manner

pray sir may i ask mr monson now coming in did you pay for
jule's handkerchief hang me if i ever saw a more vulgar thing in my
life

the opinion is not likely to induce me to say yes answered the
father half-laughing and yet half-angry at his son's making such
allusions before betts   never mind him my dear the handkerchief is
not half as expensive as his own cigars

it shall be as thoroughly smoked nevertheless rejoined john who
was as near being spoilt and escaping as was at all necessary ah
julie julie i'm ashamed of thee

this was an inauspicious commencement for an evening from which so much
happiness had been anticipated but mrs monson coming down and the
carriages driving to the door mademoiselle hennequin was summoned and
the whole party left the house

as a matter of course it was a little out of the common way that the
governess was asked to make one in the invitations given to the
monsons but mademoiselle hennequin was a person of such perfect bon
ton had so thoroughly the manners of a lady and was generally reputed
so accomplished that most of the friends of the family felt themselves
bound to notice her there was another reason too which justice
requires i should relate though it is not so creditable to the young
lady as those already given from some quarter or other a rumor had
got abroad that miss monson's governess was of a noble family a
circumstance that i soon discovered had great influence in new york
doubtless by way of expiation for the rigid democratical notions that
so universally pervade its society and here i may remark en passant
that while nothing is considered so disreputable in america as to be
aristocratic a word of very extensive signification as it embraces
the tastes the opinions the habits the virtues and sometimes the
religion of the offending party   on the other hand nothing is so
certain to attract attention as nobility how many poor poles have i
seen dragged about and made lions of merely because they were reputed
noble though the distinction in that country is pretty much the same
as that which exists in one portion of this great republic where one
half the population is white and the other black the former making
the noble and the latter the serf


what an exceedingly aristocratic pocket-handkerchief miss monson has
this evening observed mrs g to mr w as we passed into mrs
leamington's rooms that evening i don't know when i've seen any
thing so aristocratic in society

the monsons are very aristocratic in all things i understand they
dine at six

yes put in miss f and use finger bowls every day

how aristocratic

very   they even say that since they have come back from europe the
last time matters are pushed farther than ever the ladies insist on
kneeling at prayers instead of inclining like all the rest of the
world

did one ever hear of any thing so aristocratic

they do say but i will not vouch for its truth that mr and mrs
monson insist on all their children calling them father and mother
instead of pa and ma

why mr w that is downright monarchical is it not

it's difficult to say what is and what is not monarchical
now-a-days though i think one is pretty safe in pronouncing it
anti-republican

it is patriarchal rather observed a wit who belonged to the group

into this aristocratical set i was now regularly introduced many
longing and curious eyes were drawn toward me though the company in
this house was generally too well bred to criticise articles of dress
very closely still in every country aristocracy monarchy or
democracy there are privileged classes and in all companies
privileged persons one of the latter took the liberty of asking julia
to leave me in her keeping while the other danced and i was thus
temporarily transferred to a circle in which several other
pocket-handkerchiefs had been collected with a view to compare our
several merits and demerits the reader will judge of my surprise
when the examination being ended and the judgment being rendered
altogether in my favor i found myself familiarly addressed by the name
that i bore in the family circle or as no for
pocket-handkerchiefs never speak to each other except on the principle
of decimals it was no or my relative of the extreme cote gauche
who had strangely enough found his way into this very room and was now
lying cheek by jowl with me again in old mrs eyelet's lap family
affection made us glad to meet and we had a hundred questions to put
to each other in a breath

no had commenced life a violent republican and this simply because
he read nothing but republican newspapers a sufficiently simple
reason as all know who have heard both sides of any question shortly
after i was purchased by poor dear adrienne a young american traveler
had stepped into the magasin and with the recklessness that
distinguishes the expenditures of his countrymen swept off half a
dozen of the family at one purchase accident gave him the liberal end
of the piece a circumstance to which he never would have assented had
he known the fact for being an attache of the legation of his own
country he was ex officio aristocratic my brother amused me
exceedingly with his account of the indignation he felt at finding
himself in a very hot-bed of monarchical opinions in the set at the
american legation what rendered these diplomates so much the more
aristocratic was the novelty of the thing scarcely one of them having
been accustomed to society at home after passing a few months in such
company my brother's boss who was a mere traveling diplomatist came
home and began to run a brilliant career in the circles of new york on
the faith of a european reputation alas there is in
pocket-handkerchief nature a disposition to act by contraries the
more you call the more i won't come principle was active in poor no
's mind and he had not been a month in new york society before he
came out an ultra monarchist new york society has more than one of
these sudden political conversions to answer for it is such a thorough
development of the democratic principle that the faith of few
believers is found strong enough to withstand it every body knows how
much a prospect varies by position thus you shall stand on the
aristocratic side of a room filled with company and every thing will
present a vulgar and democratic appearance or vice versa you shall
occupy a place among the oi polloi and all is aristocratic exclusive
and offensive so it had proved with my unfortunate kinsman all his
notions had changed instead of finding the perfection he had preached
and extolled so long he found nothing to admire and every thing to
condemn in a word never was a pocket-handkerchief so miserable and
that too on grounds so philosophical and profound met with on its
entrance into active life i do believe if my brother could have got
back to france he would have written a book on america which while
it overlooked many vices and foibles that deserve to be cut up without
mercy would have thrown even de tocqueville into the shade in the way
of political blunders but i forbear this latter writer being
unanswerable among those neophytes who having never thought of their
own system unless as englishmen are overwhelmed with admiration at
finding any thing of another character advanced about it at least
such are the sentiments entertained by a very high priced
pocket-handkerchief


mademoiselle hennequin i took occasion to remark occupied much of the
attention of betts shoreham at mrs leamington's ball they understood
each other perfectly though the young man could not get over the
feeling created by the governess's manner when she first met with me
throughout the evening indeed her eye seemed studiously averted from
me as if she struggled to suppress certain sentiments or sensations
that she was unwilling to betray now these sentiments if sentiments
they were or sensations as they were beyond all dispute might be
envy   repinings at another's better fortunes   or they might be excited
by philosophical and commendable reflections touching those follies
which so often lead the young and thoughtless into extravagance betts
tried hard to believe them the last though in his inmost heart he
would a thousand times rather that the woman he loved should smile on a
weakness of this sort in a girl of her own age than that she should
show herself to be prematurely wise if it was wisdom purchased at the
expense of the light-heartedness and sympathies of her years and sex
on a diminished scale i had awakened in his bosom some such uneasy
distrust as the pocket-handkerchief of desdemona is known to have
aroused in that of the moor


nor can i say that julia monson enjoyed herself as much as she had
anticipated love she did not betts shoreham for that was a passion
her temperament and training induced her to wait for some pretty
unequivocal demonstrations on the part of the gentleman before she
yielded to it but she liked him vastly and nothing would have been
easier than to have blown this smouldering preference into a flame she
was too young and to say the truth too natural and uncalculating to
be always remembering that betts owned a good old-fashioned landed
estate that was said to produce twenty and which did actually produce
eleven thousand a year nett and that his house in the country was
generally said to be one of the very best in the state for all this
she cared absolutely nothing or nothing worth mentioning there were
enough young men of as good estates and there were a vast many of no
estates at all ready and willing to take their chances in the cutting
up of old monson but there were few who were as agreeable as well
mannered as handsome or who had seen as much of the world as betts
shoreham of course she had never fancied the young man in love with
herself but previously to the impression she had quite recently
imbibed of his attachment to her mother's governess she had been
accustomed to think such a thing might come to pass and that she
should not be sorry if it did

i very well understand this is not the fashionable or possibly the
polite way of describing those incipient sentiments which form the germ
of love in the virgin affections of young ladies and that a skillful
and refined poet would use very different language on the occasion but
i began this history to represent things as they are and such is the
manner in which love's young dream appears to a pocket-handkerchief


among other things that were unpleasant miss monson was compelled to
overhear sundry remarks of betts's devotion to the governess as she
stood in the dance some of which reached me also

who is the lady to whom mr shoreham is so devoue this evening asked
miss n of miss t tis quite a new face and if one might be so
presuming quite a new manner



that is mademoiselle henny the governess of mrs monson's children
my dear they say she is all accomplishments and quite a miracle of
propriety it is also rumored that she is some way a very
distinguished person reduced by those horrid revolutions of which they
have so many in europe

noble i dare say

oh that at least some persons affirm that she is semi-royal the
country is full of broken-down royalty and nobility do you think she
has an aristocratic air

not in the least   her ears are too small

why my dear that is the very symbol of nobility when my aunt
harding was in naples she knew the duke of montecarbana intimately
and she says he had the smallest ears she ever beheld on a human being
the montecarbanas are a family as old as the ruins of paestum they
say

well to my notion nobility and teaching little girls french and
italian and their gammes have very little in common i had thought
mr shoreham an admirer of miss monson's



now unfortunately my mistress overheard this remark her feelings
were just in that agitated state to take the alarm and she determined
to flirt with a young man of the name of thurston with a view to
awaken betts's jealousy if he had any and to give vent to her own
spleen this tom thurston was one of those tall good-looking young
fellows who come from nobody knows where get into society nobody
knows how and live on nobody knows what it was pretty generally
understood that he was on the look-out for a rich wife and
encouragement from julia monson was not likely to be disregarded by
such a person to own the truth my mistress carried matters much too
far   so far indeed as to attract attention from every body but those
most concerned viz her own mother and betts shoreham although
elderly ladies play cards very little just now in american society
or indeed in any other they have their inducements for rendering the
well-known office of matron at a ball a mere sinecure mrs monson
too was an indulgent mother and seldom saw any thing very wrong in
her own children julia in the main had sufficient retenue and a
suspicion of her want of discretion on this point was one of the last
things that would cross the fond parent's mind at mrs leamington's
ball others however were less confiding

your daughter is in high spirits to-night observed a single lady of
a certain age who was sitting near mrs monson i do not remember to
have ever seen her so gay

yes dear girl she is happy   poor julia was any thing but that
just then   but youth is the time for happiness if it is ever to come
in this life

is miss monson addicted to such very high spirits continued one who
was resolute to torment and vexed that the mother could not be
sufficiently alarmed to look around

always   when in agreeable company i think it a great happiness
ma'am to possess good spirits

no doubt   yet one needn't be always fifteen as lady wortley montague
said muttered the other giving up the point and changing her seat
in order that she might speak her mind more freely into the ear of a
congenial spirit


half an hour later we were all in the carriages again on our way
home all but betts shoreham i should say for having seen the ladies
cloaked he had taken his leave at mrs leamington's door as uncertain
as ever whether or not to impute envy to a being who in all other
respects seemed to him to be faultless he had to retire to an uneasy
pillow undetermined whether to pursue his original intention of making
the poor friendless french girl independent by an offer of his hand
or whether to decide that her amiable and gentle qualities were all
seeming and that she was not what she appeared to be betts shoreham
owed his distrust to national prejudice and well was he paid for
entertaining so vile a companion had mademoiselle hennequin been an
american girl he would not have thought a second time of the emotion
she had betrayed in regarding my beauties but he had been taught to
believe all french women managing and hypocritical a notion that the
experience of a young man in paris would not be very likely to destroy


well cried john monson as the carriage drew from mrs leamington's
door this is the last ball i shall go to in new york which
declaration he repeated twenty times that season and as often broke

what is the matter now jack demanded the father i found it very
pleasant   six or seven of us old fellows made a very agreeable evening
of it

yes i dare say sir but you were not compelled to dance in a room
eighteen by twenty-four with a hundred people treading on your toes
or brushing their heads in your face

jack can find no room for dancing since the great ball of the salle de
l'opera at paris observed the mother smiling i hope you enjoyed
yourself better julia


my mistress started then she answered with a sort of hysterical glee   

oh i have found the evening delightful ma'am i could have remained
two hours longer

and you mademoiselle hennequin i hope you too were agreeably
entertained

the governess answered meekly and with a slight tremor in her voice

certainly madame she said i have enjoyed myself though dancing
always seems an amusement i have no right to share in

there was some little embarrassment and i could perceive an impulse in
julia to press nearer to her rival as if impelled by a generous wish
to manifest her sympathy but tom's protest soon silenced every thing
else and we alighted and soon went to rest

the next morning julia sent for me down to be exhibited to one or two
friends my fame having spread in consequence of my late appearance i
was praised kissed called a pretty dear and extolled like a spoiled
child though miss w did not fail to carry the intelligence far and
near that miss monson's much-talked-of pocket-handkerchief was nothing
after all but the thing miss halfacre had brought out the night of the
day her father had stopped payment some even began to nick-name me the
insolvent pocket-handkerchief

i thought julia sad after her friends had all left her i lay
neglected on a sofa and the pretty girl's brow became thoughtful of a
sudden she was aroused from a brown study   reflective mood perhaps
would be a more select phrase   by the unexpected appearance of young
thurston there was a sort of ah have i caught you alone expression
about this adventurer's eye even while he was making his bow that
struck me i looked for great events nor was i altogether
disappointed in one minute he was seated at julia's side on the same
sofa and within two feet of her in two more he had brought in play
his usual tricks of flattery my mistress listened languidly and yet
not altogether without interest she was piqued at betts shoreham's
indifference had known her present admirer several months if dancing
in the same set can be called knowing and had never been made love to
before at least in a manner so direct and unequivocal the young man
had tact enough to discover that he had an advantage and fearful that
some one might come in and interrupt the tete a tete he magnanimously
resolved to throw all on a single cast and come to the point at once

i think miss monson he continued after a very beautiful specimen
of rigmarole in the way of love-making a rigmarole that might have
very fairly figured in an editor's law and logic after he had been
beaten in a libel suit i think miss monson you cannot have
overlooked the very particular attentions i have endeavored to pay you
ever since i have been so fortunate as to have made your acquaintance

i   upon my word mr thurston i am not at all conscious of having
been the object of any such attentions

no   that is ever the way with the innocent and single-minded this is
what we sincere and diffident men have to contend with in affairs of
the heart our bosoms may be torn with ten thousand distracting cares
and yet the modesty of a truly virtuous female heart shall be so
absorbed in its own placid serenity as to be indifferent to the pangs
it is unconsciously inflicting

mr thurston your language is strong   and   a little   a little
unintelligible

i dare say   ma'am   i never expect to be intelligible again when the
heart is oppressed with unutterable anguish condemned to conceal that
passion which is at once the torment and delight of life   when his
lip the ruby harbinger of joy lies pale and cold the miserable
appendage of a mang   that is miss monson i mean to say when all
our faculties are engrossed by one dear object we are often incoherent
and mysterious as a matter of course

tom thurston came very near wrecking himself on the quicksands of the
romantic school he had begun to quote from a speech delivered by
gouverneur morris on the right of deposit at new orleans and which he
had spoken at college and was near getting into a part of the subject
that might not have been so apposite but retreated in time by way of
climax the lover laid his hand on me and raised me to his eyes in an
abstracted manner as if unconscious of what he was doing and wanted
to brush away a tear


what a confounded rich old fellow the father must be thought tom
to give her such pocket-handkerchiefs

i felt like a wren that escapes from the hawk when the rogue laid me
down

alas poor julia was the dupe of all this acting totally unpracticed
herself abandoned by the usages of the society in which she had been
educated very much to the artifices of any fortune-hunter and vexed
with betts shoreham she was in the worst possible frame of mind to
resist such eloquence and love she had seen tom at all the balls in
the best houses found no fault with his exterior and manners both of
which were fashionable and showy and now discovered that he had a most
sympathetic heart over which unknown to herself she had obtained a
very unlimited control

you do not answer me miss monson continued tom peeping out at one
side of me for i was still at his eyes   you do not answer me cruel
inexorable girl

what would you have me say mr thurston

say yes dearest loveliest most perfect being of the whole human
family

yes then if that will relieve your mind it is a relief very easily
bestowed

now tom thurston was as skilled in a fortune-hunter's wiles as
napoleon was in military strategy he saw he had obtained an immense
advantage for the future and he forbore to press the matter any
further at the moment the yes had been uttered more in pleasantry
than with any other feeling but by holding it in reserve presuming
on it gradually and using it in a crisis it might be worth   let me
see calculated tom as he went whistling down broadway that yes
may be made to yield at least a cool there are john this
girl and two little ones old monson is worth every dollar of
   none of your skyrockets but a known old fortune in
substantial houses and lands   let us suppose the old woman outlive him
and that she gets her full thirds that will leave perhaps
john may get a couple of hundred thousand and even then each of the
girls will have if one of the little things should happen to
die and there's lots of scarlet fever about why that would fetch it
up at once to a round hundred thousand i don't think the old woman
would be likely to marry again at her time of life one mustn't
calculate too confidently on that however as i would have her myself
for half of such thirds



for a week nothing material transpired all that time i lay in the
drawer gaining a knowledge of what passed in the best manner i could
betts shoreham was a constant visitor at the house and tom thurston
made his appearance with a degree of punctuality that began to attract
notice among the inmates of the house on the opposite side of the
street all this time however tom treated julia with the greatest
respect and even distance turning more of his attention toward mrs
monson he acted in this manner because he thought he had secured a
sufficient lien on the young lady by means of her yes and knew how
important it was for one who could show none of the usual inducements
for consent to the parents to obtain the good-will of the old lady

at the end of the week mrs monson opened her house to receive the
world as a matter of course i was brought out on this occasion now
betts shoreham and mademoiselle hennequin had made great progress
toward an understanding in the course of this week though the lady
becoming more and more conscious of the interest she had created in the
heart of the gentleman her own conduct got to be cautious and
reserved at length betts actually carried matters so far as to write
a letter that was as much to the point as a man could very well come
in a word he offered his hand to the excellent young french woman
assuring her in very passionate and suitable terms that she had been
mistress of his affections ever since the first month of their
acquaintance in this letter he implored her not to be so cruel as to
deny him an interview and there were a few exceedingly pretty
reproaches touching her recent coy and reserved deportment

mademoiselle hennequin was obliged to read this letter in julia's room
and she took such a position to do it as exposed every line to my
impertinent gaze as i lay on the bed among the other finery that was
got out for the evening mrs monson was present and she had summoned
the governess in order to consult her on the subject of some of the
ornaments of the supper table fortunately both julia and her mother
were too much engaged to perceive the tears that rolled down the cheeks
of the poor stranger as she read the honest declaration of a fervid
and manly love nor did either detect the manner in which the letter
was pressed to mademoiselle hennequin's heart when she had done
reading it the second time

just at this instant a servant came to announce mr shoreham's presence
in the breakfast-room this was a retired and little frequented part
of the house at that hour betts having been shown into it in
consequence of the preparations that were going on in the proper
reception-rooms

julia my dear you will have to go below   although it is at a most
inconvenient moment

no mother   let mr betts shoreham time his visits better   george say
that the ladies are engaged

that will not do interrupted the mother in some concern   we are
too intimate for such an excuse   would you mademoiselle hennequin
have the goodness to see mr shoreham for a few minutes   you must come
into our american customs sooner or later and this may be a favorable
moment to commence

mrs monson laughed pleasantly as she made this request and her
kindness and delicacy to the governess were too marked and unremitted
to permit the latter to think of hesitating she had laid her own
handkerchief down at my side to read the letter but feeling the
necessity of drying her eyes she caught me up by mistake smiled her
assent and left the apartment

mademoiselle hennequin did not venture below until she had gone into
her own room here she wept freely for a minute or two and then she
bathed her eyes in cold water and used the napkin in drying them
owing to this circumstance i was fortunately a witness of all that
passed in her interview with her lover

the instant betts shoreham saw that he was to have an interview with
the charming french girl instead of with julia monson his countenance
brightened and as if supposing the circumstance proof of his success
he seized the governess hand and carried it to his lips in a very
carnivorous fashion the lady however succeeded in retaining her
hand if she did not positively preserve it from being devoured

a thousand thousand thanks dearest mademoiselle hennequin said
betts in an incoherent half-sane manner you have read my letter
and i may interpret this interview favorably i meant to have told all
to mrs monson had she come down and asked her kind interference   but
it is much much better as it is

you will do well monsieur not to speak to madame monson on the
subject at all answered mademoiselle hennequin with an expression of
countenance that i found quite inexplicable since it was not happy
nor was it altogether the reverse this must be our last meeting and
it were better that no one knew any thing of its nature

then my vanity   my hopes have misled me and i have no interest in
your feelings

i do not say that monsieur oh non   non   i am far from saying as
much as that   poor girl her face declared a hundred times more than
her tongue that she was sincere   i do not   cannot say i have no
interest in one who so generously overlooks my poverty my utter
destitution of all worldly greatness and offers to share with me his
fortune and his honorable position   

this is not what i ask   what i had hoped to earn   gratitude is not
love

gratitude easily becomes love in a woman's heart   answered the dear
creature with a smile and a look that betts would have been a mere
dolt not to have comprehended   and it is my duty to take care that my
gratitude does not entertain this weakness

mademoiselle hennequin for mercy's sake be as frank and simple as i
know your nature prompts   do you can you love me

of course such a direct question put in a very categorical way caused
the questioned to blush if it did not induce her to smile the first
she did in a very pretty and engaging manner though i thought she
hesitated about indulging in the last

why should i say yes when it can lead to no good result

then destroy all hope at once and say no

that would be to give you   to give us both unnecessary pain besides
it might not be strictly true   i could love   oh no one can tell how my
heart could love where it was right and proper

after this i suppose it is unnecessary for me to say that betts soon
brought the category of possibilities into one of certainty to own the
truth he carried every thing by his impetuosity reducing the
governess to own that what she admitted she could do so well she had
already done in a very complete and thorough manner i enjoyed this
scene excessively nor was it over in a minute mademoiselle hennequin
used me several times to wipe away tears and it is strong proof how
much both parties were thinking of other matters that neither
discovered who was present at so interesting a tete-a-tete

at length came the denouement after confessing how much she loved
betts how happy she would be could she be his slave all the days of
her life how miserable she was in knowing that he had placed his
affections on her and how much more miserable she should be had she
learned he had not mademoiselle hennequin almost annihilated the young
man by declaring that it was utterly impossible for her to consent to
become his wife the reason was the difference in fortune and the
impossibility that she should take advantage of his passion to lead him
into a connection that he might afterwards regret against this
decision betts reasoned warmly but seriously in vain had
mademoiselle hennequin been an american instead of a french girl her
feelings would not have been so sensitive on this point for in this
great republic every body but the fortune-hunters an exceedingly
contemptible class considers a match without money quite as much a
matter of course as a match with but the governess had been educated
under a different system and it struck her imagination as very proper
that she should make both herself and her lover miserable because he
had two hundred thousand dollars and she had not as many hundreds all
this strangely conflicted with betts preconceived opinion of a french
woman's selfishness and while he was disposed to believe his adored
perfection he almost feared it was a trick of such contradictory
materials is the human mind composed

at length the eyes of betts fell on me who was still in the hand of
mademoiselle hennequin and had several times been applied to her eyes
unheeded it was evident i revived unpleasant recollections and the
young man could not avoid letting an expression escape him that
sufficiently betrayed his feelings

this handkerchief exclaimed the young governess   ah it is that of
mademoiselle julie which i must have taken by mistake but why should
this handkerchief awaken any feeling in you monsieur you are not
about to enact the moor in your days of wooing

this was said sweetly and withal a little archly for the poor girl
was glad to turn the conversation from its harassing and painful
points but betts was in no humor for pleasantry and he spoke out in a
way to give his mistress some clue to his thoughts

that cursed handkerchief   it is really indecent in young men to use
such improper language but they little heed what they say when
strongly excited   that cursed handkerchief has given me as much pain
as it appears also to have given you i wish i knew the real secret of
its connection with your feelings for i confess like that of
desdemona's it has excited distrust though for a very different
cause

the cheeks of mademoiselle hennequin were pale and her brow
thoughtful still she had a sweet smile for betts and though
ignorant of the nature of his suspicions which she would have scarcely
pardoned it was her strongest wish to leave no darker cloud between
them than the one she felt it her duty to place there herself she
answered therefore frankly and simply though not without betraying
strong emotion as she proceeded

this handkerchief is well known to me answered the young french
woman it revives the recollections of some of the most painful scenes
of a life that has never seen much sunshine you have heard me speak of
a grandmother mr shoreham who took care of my childhood and who
died in my arms that handkerchief i worked for her support in her
last illness and this lace   yes this beautiful lace was a part of
that beloved grandmother's bridal trousseau i put it where you see it
to enhance the value of my labors

i see it all exclaimed the repentant betts   feel it all dearest
dearest mademoiselle hennequin and i hope this exquisite work this
refined taste brought all the comfort and reward you had a right to
anticipate

a shade of anguish crossed the face of adrienne   for it was no
other   as she gazed at me and recalled all the scenes of her
sufferings and distress then i knew her again for time and a poor
memory with some development of person had caused me to forget the
appearance of the lovely creature who may be said to have made me what
i am but one glance at her with that expression of intense suffering
on her countenance renewed all my earlier impressions

i received as much as i merited perhaps returned the meek-minded
girl   for she was proud only in insisting on what she fancied
right   and enough to give my venerated parent christian burial they
were days of want and sorrow that succeeded during which betts i
toiled for bread like an eastern slave the trodden-on and abused
hireling of a selfish milliner accident at length placed me in a
family as a governess this family happened to be acquainted with
madame monson and an offer that was brilliant to me in my
circumstances brought me to america you see by all this how unfit i
am to be your wife monsieur you would blush to have it said you had
married a french milliner

but you are not a milliner in that sense dearest adrienne   for you
must suffer me to call you by that name   you are a lady reduced by
revolutions and misfortunes the name of hennequin i know is
respectable and what care i for money when so much worth is to be
found on your side of the scale money would only oppress me under
such circumstances

your generosity almost overcomes my scruples but it may not be the
name to which i am entitled is certainly not one to be ashamed of   it
is far more illustrious than that of hennequin respectable as is the
last but of what account is a name to one in my condition

and your family name is not hennequin asked the lover anxiously

it is not my poor grandmother assumed the name of hennequin when we
went last to paris under an apprehension that the guillotine might
follow the revolution of july as it had followed that of this
name she enjoined it on me to keep and i have never thought it prudent
to change it i am of the family of de la rocheaimard

the exclamation which burst from the lips of betts shoreham betokened
both surprise and delight he made adrienne repeat her declarations
and even desired her to explain her precise parentage the reader will
remember that there had been an american marriage in adrienne's
family and that every relative the poor girl had on earth was among
these distant connections on this side of the atlantic one of these
relatives though it was no nearer than a third cousin was betts
shoreham whose great-grandmother had been a bona fide de la
rocheaimard and who was enabled at once to point out to the poor
deserted orphan some forty or fifty persons who stood in the same
degree of affinity to her it is needless to say that this conversation
was of absorbing interest to both so much so indeed that betts
momentarily forgot his love and by the time it had ended adrienne was
disposed to overlook most of her over scrupulous objections to
rewarding that very passion but the hour admonished them of the
necessity of separating

and now my beloved cousin said betts shoreham as he rose to quit
the room seizing adrienne's unresisting hand   now my own adrienne
you will no longer urge your sublimated notions of propriety against my
suit i am your nearest male relative and have a right to your
obedience   and i command that you be the second de la rocheaimard who
became the wife of a shoreham

tell me mon cher cousin said adrienne smiling through her
tears   were your grand-parents my good uncle and aunt were they
happy was their union blessed


they were miracles of domestic felicity and their happiness has
passed down in tradition among all their descendants even religion
could not furnish them with a cause for misunderstanding that example
which they set to the last century we will endeavor to set to this

adrienne smiled kissed her hand to betts and ran out of the room
leaving me forgotten on the sofa betts shoreham seized his hat and
left the house a happy man for though he had no direct promise as
yet he felt as reasonably secure of success as circumstances required





five minutes later tom thurston entered and julia monson came down to
receive him her pique not interfering and it being rather stylish to
be disengaged on the morning of the day when the household was in all
the confusion of a premeditated rout


this is so good of you miss monson said tom as he made his bow   i
heard it all being still on the sofa   this is so good of you when
your time must have so many demands on it

not in the least mr thurston   mamma and the housekeeper have settled
every thing and i am really pleased to see you as you can give me the
history of the new play   

ah miss monson my heart   my faculties   my ideas   tom was getting
bothered and he made a desperate effort to extricate himself   in
short my judgment is so confused and monopolized that i have no
powers left to think or speak of plays in a word i was not there

that explains it then   and what has thus confused your mind mr
thurston

the approach of this awful night you will be surrounded by a host of
admirers pouring into your ears their admiration and love and then
what shall i have to support me but that yes with which you once
raised me from the depths of despair to an elevation of happiness that
was high as the highest pinnacle of the caverns of kentucky raising me
from the depths of chimborazo


tom meant to reverse this image but love is proverbially desperate in
its figures of speech and any thing was better than appearing to
hesitate nevertheless miss monson was too well instructed and had
too much real taste not to feel surprise at all this extravagance of
diction and poetry

i am not certain mr thurston that i rightly understand you she
said chimborazo is not particularly low nor are the caverns of
kentucky so strikingly elevated

ascribe it all to that fatal heart-thrilling hope-inspiring yes
loveliest of human females continued tom kneeling with some caution
lest the straps of his pantaloons should give way   impute all to your
own lucid ambiguity and to the torments of hope that i experience
repeat that yes lovely consolatory imaginative being and raise me
from the thrill of depression to the liveliest pulsations of all human
acmes

hang it thought tom if she stand that i shall presently be
ashore genius itself can invent nothing finer

but julia did stand it she admired tom for his exterior but the
admiration of no moderately sensible woman could overlook rodomontade
so exceedingly desperate it was trespassing too boldly on the
proprieties to utter such nonsense to a gentlewoman and tom who had
got his practice in a very low school was doomed to discover that he
had overreached himself

i am not certain i quite understand you mr thurston answered the
half-irritated half-amused young lady your language is so very
extraordinary   your images so unusual   

say rather that it is your own image loveliest incorporation of
perceptible incarnations interrupted tom determined to go for the
whole and recalling some rare specimens of magazine eloquence   talk
not of images obdurate maid when you are nothing but an image
yourself

i mr thurston   and of what is it your pleasure to accuse me of being
the image

o unutterable wo   yes inexorable girl your vacillating yes has
rendered me the impersonation of that oppressive sentiment of which
your beauty and excellence have become the mocking reality alas alas
that bearded men   tom's face was covered with hair   alas alas that
bearded men should be brought to weep over the contrarieties of womanly
caprice

here tom bowed his head and after a grunting sob or two he raised his
handkerchief in a very pathetic manner to his face and thought to
himself   well if she stand that the lord only knows what i shall say
next

as for julia she was amused though at first she had been a little
frightened the girl had a good deal of spirit and she had tant soit
peu of mother eve's love of mischief in her she determined to make
capital out of the affair as the americans say in shop-keeping slang


what is the yes of which you speak she inquired and on which
you seem to lay so much stress

that yes has been my bane and antidote answered tom rallying for
a new and still more desperate charge when first pronounced by your
rubicund lips it thrilled on my amazed senses like a beacon of light   

mr thurston   mr thurston   what do you mean

ah d   n it thought tom i should have said humid light   how the
deuce did i come to forget that word   it would have rounded the
sentence beautifully

what do i mean angel of humid light answered tom aloud i mean
all i say and lots of feeling besides when the heart is anguished
with unutterable emotion it speaks in accents that deaden all the
nerves and thrill the ears tom was getting to be animated and when
that was the case his ideas flowed like a torrent after a
thunder-shower or in volumes and a little muddily what do i mean
indeed i mean to have you he thought and at least eighty thousand
dollars or dictionaries webster's inclusive were made in vain

this is very extraordinary mr thurston rejoined julia whose sense
of womanly propriety began to take the alarm and i must insist on an
explanation your language would seem to infer   really i do not know
what it does not seem to infer will you have the goodness to explain
what you mean by that yes

simply loveliest and most benign of your sex that once already in
answer to a demand of your hand you deigned to reply with that
energetic and encouraging monosyllable yes   dear and categorical
affirmative   exclaimed tom going off again at half-cock highly
impressed with the notion that rhapsody instead of music was the food
of love   yes dear and categorical affirmative with what ecstasy did
not my drowsy ears drink in the melodious sounds   what extravagance of
delight my throbbing heart echo its notes on the wings of the unseen
winds   in short what considerable satisfaction your consent gave my
pulsating mind

consent   consent is a strong word mr thurston

it is indeed adorable julia and it is also a strong thing i've
known terrible consequences arise from the denial of a consent not
half as explicit as your own

consequences   may i ask sir to what consequences you allude

the consequences miss monson   that is the consequences of a violated
troth i mean   they may be divided into three parts   here tom got
up brushed his knees each in succession with his
pocket-handkerchief and began to count on his fingers like a lawyer
who is summing up an argument   yes miss julia into three parts
first come the pangs of unrequited love on these i propose to enlarge
presently next come the legal effects always supposing that the
wronged party can summon heart enough to carry on a suit with bruised
affections   hang it thought tom why did i not think of that word
bruised while on my knees it would tell like a stiletto   yes
miss julia if bruised affections would permit the soul to descend to
such preliminaries the last consequence is the despair of hope
deferred

all this is so extraordinary mr thurston that i insist on knowing
why you have presumed to address such language to me   yes sir insist
on knowing your reason

tom was dumbfounded now that he was up and looking about him he had
an opportunity of perceiving that his mistress was offended and that
he had somewhat overdone the sublime poetical and affecting with a
sudden revulsion of feeling and tactics he determined to throw
himself at once into the penitent and candid

ah miss monson he cried somewhat more naturally   i see i have
offended and alarmed you but impute it all to love the strength of
my passion is such that i became desperate and was resolved to try
any expedient that i thought might lead to success

that might be pardoned sir were it not for the extraordinary
character of the expedient surely you have never seen in me any taste
for the very extraordinary images and figures of speech you have used
on this occasion

this handkerchief   said tom taking me from the sofa   this
handkerchief must bear all the blame but for this i should not have
dreamt of running so much on the high-pressure principle but love you
know miss julia is a calculation like any other great event of life
and must be carried on consistently

and pray sir how can that handkerchief have brought about any such
result

ah miss monson you ask me to use a most killing frankness had we
not better remain under the influence of the poetical star

if you wish to ensure my respect or esteem mr thurston it is
necessary to deal with me in perfect sincerity nothing but truth will
ever be pleasing to me

hang it thought tom again who knows she is whimsical and may
really like to have the truth it's quite clear her heart is as
insensible to eloquence and poetry as a potter's field wall and it
might answer to try her with a little truth your girls get
such notions in their heads that there's no analogy as one might say
between them and the rest of the species miss julia continuing
aloud my nature is all plain-dealing and i am delighted to find a
congenial spirit you must have observed something very peculiar in my
language at the commencement of this exceedingly interesting dialogue

i will not deny it mr thurston your language was to say the least
very peculiar

lucid but ambiguous pathetic but amusing poetical but
comprehensive prosaical but full of emphasis that's my nature
plain-dealing too is my nature and i adore the same quality in
others most especially in those i could wish to marry

does this wish then extend to the plural number asked julia
smiling a little maliciously

certainly when the heart is devoted to virtuous intentions it wishes
for a union with virtue where-ever it is to be found competence and
virtue are my mottoes miss julia

this shows that you are in truth a lover of plain-dealing mr
thurston   and now as to the handkerchief

why miss julia perceiving that you are sincere i shall be equally
frank you own this handkerchief

certainly sir i should hardly use an article of dress that is the
property of another

independent and the fruit of independence well miss monson it
struck me that the mistress of such a handkerchief must like
poetry   that is flights of the imagination   that is eloquence and
pathos as it might be engrafted on passion and sentiment

i believe i understand you sir you wish to say that common sense
seemed misapplied to the owner of such a handkerchief

far from that adorable young lady but that poetry and eloquence
and flights of imagination seem well applied a very simple
calculation will demonstrate what i mean but possibly you do not
wish to hear the calculation   ladies generally dislike figures

i am an exception mr thurston i beg you will lay the whole matter
before me therefore without reserve

it is simply this ma'am this handkerchief cost every cent of   

one hundred and twenty-five said julia quickly

bless me thought tom what a rich old d   l her father must be i
will not give her up and as poetry and sentiment do not seem to be
favorites here goes for frankness   some women are furious for plain
matter-of-fact fellows and this must be one of the number one hundred
and twenty-five dollars is a great deal of money he added aloud
and the interest at per cent will come to including first
cost and washing the annual expense of this handkerchief may be set
down at but the thing will not last now five years if one
includes fashion wear and tear c and this will bring the whole
expense up to per annum we will suppose your fortune to be
 miss julia   

here tom paused and cast a curious glance at the young lady in the
hope of hearing something explicit julia could hardly keep her
countenance but she was resolved to go to the bottom of all this
plain-dealing

well sir she answered we will suppose it as you say 

the interest then would be now multiplied by   here
tom took out his pencil and began to cypher   make just or rather
more than the whole amount of the interest well when you come to
deduct taxes charges losses and other things the best invested
estate of per annum will not yield more than nett
suppose a marriage and the husband has only for his pocket
this would bring down the ways and means to per annum or less
than a hundredth part of the expense of keeping one
pocket-handkerchief and when you come to include rent fuel
marketing and other necessaries you see my dear miss monson there
is a great deal of poetry in paying so much for a pocket-handkerchief

i believe i understand you sir and shall endeavor to profit by the
lesson as i am wanted you will now excuse me mr thurston   my
father's step is in the hall   so julia in common with all other
manhattanese called a passage or entry five feet wide   and to him i
must refer you

this was said merely as an excuse for quitting the room but tom
received it literally and figuratively at the same time





accustomed to think of marrying as his means of advancement he
somewhat reasonably supposed refer you to my father meant consent so
far as the young lady was concerned and he determined to improve the
precious moments fortunately for his ideas mr monson did not enter
the room immediately which allowed the gentleman an opportunity for a
little deliberation as usual his thoughts took the direction of a
mental soliloquy much in the following form

this is getting on famously thought tom refer you to my
father   well that is compact and comprehensive at the same time i
wish her dandruff had got up when i mentioned only seriously
that is but a small sum to make one's way on if i had a footing of my
own in society might do but when a fellow has to work his
way by means of dinners horses and et ceteras it's a small
allowance it's true the monsons will give me connections and
connections are almost   not quite   as good as money to get a chap along
with   but the d   l of the matter is that connections eat and drink i
dare say the monson set will cost me a good a year though they
will save something in the way of the feed they must give in their
turns i wish i had tried her with a higher figure for after all it
may have been only modesty   some women are as modest as the d   l but
here comes old monson and i must strike while the iron is hot


good morning mr thurston said the father looking a little
surprised at seeing such a guest at three o'clock what alone with my
daughter's fine pocket-handkerchief you must find that indifferent
company

not under the circumstances sir every thing is agreeable to us that
belongs to an object we love

love that is a strong term mr thurston   one that i hope you have
uttered in pure gallantry

not at all sir cried tom falling on his knees as a school boy
reads the wrong paragraph in the confusion of not having studied his
lesson well   adorable and angelic   i beg your pardon mr
monson   rising and again brushing his knees with some care   my mind
is in such a state of confusion that i scarcely know what i say

really i should think so or you could never mistake me for a young
girl of twenty will you have the goodness to explain this matter to
me

yes sir   i'm referred

referred pray what may that mean in particular

only sir that i'm referred   i do not ask a dollar sir her lovely
mind and amiable person are all i seek and i only regret that she is
so rich i should be the happiest fellow in the world mr monson if
the angelic julia had not a cent

the angelic julia must be infinitely indebted to you mr thurston
but let us take up this affair in order what am i to understand sir
by your being referred

that miss julia in answer to my suit has referred me to you sir

then so far as she herself is concerned you wish me to understand
that she accepts you

certainly   she accepted some time since with as heavenly a yes as
ever came from the ruby lips of love

indeed this is so new to me sir that you must permit me to see my
daughter a moment ere i give a definite answer

hereupon mr monson left the room and tom began to think again

well he thought things do go on swimmingly at last this is the
first time i could ever get at a father though i've offered to
six-and-twenty girls one does something like a living business with a
father i don't know but i rather overdid it about the dollar though
it's according to rule to seem disinterested at first even if you
quarrel like furies afterwards about the stuff let me see   had i
best begin to screw him up in this interview or wait for the next a
few hints properly thrown out may be useful at once some of these
old misers hold on to every thing till they die fancying it a mighty
pleasant matter to chaps that can't support themselves to support their
daughters by industry as they call it i'm as industrious as a young
fellow can be and i owe six months board at this very moment
no   no   i'll walk into him at once and give him what napoleon used to
call a demonstration

the door opened and mr monson entered his face a little flushed and
his eye a little severe still he was calm in tone and manner julia
had told him all in ten words

now mr thurston i believe i understand this matter said the
father in a very business-like manner you wish to marry my daughter

exactly sir and she wishes to marry me   that is as far as comports
with the delicacy of the female bosom

a very timely reservation and you are referred

yes mr monson those cheering words have solaced my ears   i am
referred the old chap aside likes a little humbug as well as a
girl

and you will take her without a cent you say

did i sir i believe i didn't exactly say that   dollar was the word i
mentioned cents could hardly be named between you and me

dollar let it be then now sir you have my consent on a single
condition

name it sir name five or six at once my dear mr monson and you
shall see how i will comply

one will answer how much fortune do you think will be necessary to
make such a couple happy at starting in the world name such a sum as
will comport with your own ideas

how much sir mr monson you are a model of generosity you mean to
keep a liberal and gentlemanly establishment as would become your
son-in-law

i do   such a fortune as will make you both easy and comfortable

horses and carriages of course every thing on a genteel and liberal
scale

on such a scale as will insure the happiness of man and wife

mutual esteem   conjugal felicity   and all that i suppose you include
dinners sir and a manly competition with one's fellow citizens in
real new york form

i mean all that can properly belong to the expenses of a gentleman and
lady

yes sir   exceedingly liberal   liberal as the rosy dawn why sir
meeting your proposition in the spirit in which it is offered i should
say julia and i could get along very comfortably on yes we
could make that do provided the money were well invested   no fancy
stocks

well sir i am glad we understand each other so clearly if my
daughter really wish to marry you i will give of this sum as
soon as you can show me that you have as much more to invest along with
it

sir   mr monson

i mean that each party shall lay down dollar for dollar

i understand what you mean sir mr monson that would be degrading
lawful wedlock to the level of a bet   a game of cards   a mercenary
contemptible bargain no sir   nothing shall ever induce me to degrade
this honorable estate to such pitiful conditions

dollar for dollar mr thurston

holy wedlock it is violating the best principles of our nature

give and take

leveling the sacred condition of matrimony to that of a mere bargain
for a horse or a dog

half and half

my nature revolts at such profanation sir   i will take with
miss julia and say no more about it

equality is the foundation of wedded happiness mr thurston

say mr monson and have no more words about it take away
from the transaction the character of a bargain and even will
do

not a cent that is not covered by a cent of your own

then sir i wash my hands of the whole affair if the young lady
should die my conscience will be clear it shall never be said thomas
thurston was so lost to himself as to bargain for a wife

we must then part and the negotiation must fall through

tom rose with dignity and got as far as the door with his hand on the
latch he added   

rather than blight the prospects of so pure and lovely a creature i
will make every sacrifice short of honor   let it be mr
monson

as you please sir   so that it be covered by of your own

my nature revolts at the proposition and so   good morning sir

tom left the house and mr monson laughed heartily so heartily
indeed as to prove how much he relished the success of his scheme

talk of scylla and charybdis soliloquized the discomfited tom as he
wiped the perspiration from his face   where the d   l does he think i
am to find the he wants unless he first gives them to me i
never heard of so unreasonable an old chap here is a young fellow that
offers to marry his daughter for   half price as one may
say   and he talks about covering every cent he lays down with one of my
own i never knew what was meant by cent per cent before let me see
i've just thirty-two dollars and sixty-nine cents and had we played at
a game of coppers i couldn't have held out half an hour but i
flatter myself i touched the old scamp up with morals in a way he
wasn't used to well as this thing is over i will try old sweet the
grocer's daughter if the wardrobe and whiskers fail there i must rub
up the greek and latin and shift the ground to boston they say a chap
with a little of the classics can get or there any day in
the week i wish my parents had brought me up a schoolmaster i would
be off in the first boat blast it   i thought when i came down to
 he would have snapped at the bait like a pike he'll never
have a chance to get her off so cheap again


this ended the passage of flirtation between thomas thurston and julia
monson as for the latter she took such a distaste for me that she
presented me to mademoiselle hennequin at the first opportunity under
the pretence that she had discovered a strong wish in the latter to
possess me

adrienne accepted the present with some reluctance on account of the
price that had been paid for me and yet with strong emotion how she
wept over me the first time we were alone together i thought her
heart would break nor am i certain it would not but for the timely
interposition of julia who came and set her laughing by a humorous
narrative of what had occurred between her father and her lover

that night the rout took place it went off with eclat but i did not
make my appearance at it adrienne rightly judging that i was not a
proper companion for one in her situation it is true this is not a
very american notion every thing being suitable for every body that
get them in this land of liberty but adrienne had not been educated
in a land of liberty and fancied that her dress should bear some
relation to her means little did she know that i was a sort of patent
of nobility and that by exhibiting me she might have excited envy
even in an alderman's daughter my non-appearance however made no
difference with betts shoreham whose attentions throughout the evening
were so marked as to raise suspicion of the truth in the mind of even
mrs monson



the next day there was an eclaircissement adrienne owned who she was
gave my history acquainted mrs monson with her connection with mr
shoreham and confessed the nature of his suit i was present at this
interview and it would be unjust to say that the mother was not
disappointed still she behaved generously and like a high principled
woman adrienne was advised to accept betts and her scruples on the
score of money were gradually removed by mrs monson's arguments

what a contrast do this mr thurston and adrienne present observed
mrs monson to her husband in a tete a tete shortly after this
interview here is the gentleman wanting to get our child without a
shilling to bless himself with and the poor girl refusing to marry the
man of her heart because she is penniless

so much for education we become mercenary or self-denying very much
as we are instructed in this country it must be confessed
fortune-hunting has made giant strides within the last few years and
that too with an audacity of pretension that is unrestrained by any
of the social barriers which exist elsewhere

adrienne will marry mr shoreham i think she loves and when a girl
loves her scruples of this nature are not invincible

ay he can lay down dollar for dollar   i wish his fancy had run toward
julia

it has not and we can only regret it adrienne has half-consented
and i shall give her a handsome wedding   for married she must be in
our house

all came to pass as was predicted one month from that day betts
shoreham and adrienne de la rocheaimard became man and wife mrs
monson gave a handsome entertainment and a day or two later the
bridegroom and bride took possession of their proper home of course i
removed with the rest of the family and by these means had an
opportunity of becoming a near spectator of a honey-moon i ought
however to say that betts insisted on julia's receiving for me
accepting from julia a handsome wedding present of equal value but in
another form this was done simply that adrienne might say when i was
exhibited that she had worked me herself and that the lace with which
i was embellished was an heir-loom if there are various ways of
quieting one's conscience in the way of marriage settlements so are
there various modes of appeasing our sense of pride

pocket-handkerchiefs have their revolutions as well as states i was
now under my first restoration and perfectly happy but being french
i look forward to further changes since the temperament that has twice
ejected the bourbons from their thrones will scarce leave me in quiet
possession of mine forever

adrienne loves betts more than any thing else still she loves me
dearly scarce a week passes that i am not in her hands and it is when
her present happiness seems to be overflowing that she is most fond of
recalling the painful hours she experienced in making me what i am
then her tears flow freely and often i am held in her soft little
hand while she prays for the soul of her grandmother or offers up
praises for her own existing blessings i am no longer thought of for
balls and routs but appear to be doomed to the closet and those
moments of tender confidence that so often occur between these lovers
i complain not so far from it never was an article of my character
more highly favored passing an existence as it might be in the very
bosom of truth and innocence once only have i seen an old
acquaintance in the person of clara caverly since my change of
mistress   the idea of calling a de la rocheaimard a boss or bossess
is out of the question clara is a distant relative of betts and soon
became intimate with her new cousin one day she saw me lying on a
table and after an examination she exclaimed   

two things surprise me greatly here mrs shoreham   that you should
own one of these things   i confess i did not like the word   and that
you should own this particular handkerchief

why so chere clara   how prettily my mistress pronounces that name
so different from clarry

it is not like you to purchase so extravagant and useless a thing   and
then this looks like a handkerchief that once belonged to another
person   a poor girl who has lost her means of extravagance by the
change of the times but of course it is only a resemblance as you   

it is more clara   the handkerchief is the same but that handkerchief
is not an article of dress with me it is my friend

the reader may imagine how proud i felt this was elevation for the
species and gave a dignity to my position with which i am infinitely
satisfied nevertheless miss caverly manifested surprise

i will explain continued mrs shoreham the handkerchief is my own
work and is very precious to me on account des souvenirs


adrienne then told the whole story and i may say clara caverly became
my friend also yes she who had formerly regarded me with
indifference or dislike now kissed me and wept over me and in this
manner have i since passed from friend to friend among all of
adrienne's intimates

not so with the world however my sudden disappearance from it excited
quite as much sensation as my debut in it tom thurston's addresses to
miss monson had excited the envy and of course the attention of all
the other fortune-hunters in town causing his sudden retreat to be
noticed persons of this class are celebrated for covering their
retreats skilfully tom declared that the old chap broke down when
they got as far as the fortune   that as he liked the girl he would
have taken her with but the highest offer he could get from
him was this of course no gentleman could submit to a girl
with such a pocket-handkerchief ought to bring a clear and i
was for none of your half-way doings old monson is a humbug the
handkerchief has disappeared and now they have taken down the sign i
hope they will do business on a more reasonable scale

a month later tom got married i heard john monson laughing over the
particulars one day in betts shoreham's library where i am usually
kept to my great delight being exceedingly fond of books the facts
were as follows it seems tom had cast an eye on the daughter of a
grocer of reputed wealth who had attracted the attention of another
person of his own school to get rid of a competitor this person
pointed out to tom a girl whose father had been a butcher but had
just retired from business and was building himself a fine house
somewhere in butcherland

that's your girl said the treacherous adviser all butchers are
rich and they never build until their pockets are so crammed as to
force them to it they coin money and spend nothing look how high
beef has been of late years and then they live on the smell of their
own meats this is your girl only court the old fellow and you are
sure of half a million in the long run

tom was off on the instant he did court the old fellow got introduced
to the family was a favorite from the first offered in a fortnight
was accepted and got married within the month ten days afterward the
supplies were stopped for want of funds and the butcher failed it
seems he too was only taking a hand in the great game of brag that
most of the country had sat down to

tom was in a dilemma he had married a butcher's daughter after this
every door in broadway and bond street was shut upon him instead of
stepping into society on his wife's shoulders he was dragged out of it
by the skirts through her agency then there was not a dollar his
empty pockets were balanced by her empty pockets the future offered a
sad perspective tom consulted a lawyer about a divorce on the ground
of false pretences he was even ready to make an affidavit that he
had been slaughtered but it would not do the marriage was found to
stand all the usual tests and tom went to texas

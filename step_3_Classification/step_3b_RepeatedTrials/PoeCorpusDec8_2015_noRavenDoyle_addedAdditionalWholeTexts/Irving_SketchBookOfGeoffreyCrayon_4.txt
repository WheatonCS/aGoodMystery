offspring of society and produced by education it is honorable
because it is in fact the triumph of lofty sentiment over an instinctive
repugnance to pain and over those yearnings after personal ease and
security which society has condemned as ignoble it is kept alive by
pride and the fear of shame and thus the dread of real evil is overcome
by the superior dread of an evil which exists but in the imagination it
has been cherished and stimulated also by various means it has been
the theme of spirit-stirring song and chivalrous story the poet and
minstrel have delighted to shed round it the splendors of fiction and
even the historian has forgotten the sober gravity of narration and
broken forth into enthusiasm and rhapsody in its praise triumphs and
gorgeous pageants have been its reward monuments on which art has
exhausted its skill and opulence its treasures have been erected
to perpetuate a nation's gratitude and admiration thus artificially
excited courage has risen to an extraordinary and factitious degree
of heroism and arrayed in all the glorious pomp and circumstance of
war this turbulent quality has even been able to eclipse many of those
quiet but invaluable virtues which silently ennoble the human character
and swell the tide of human happiness

but if courage intrinsically consists in the defiance of danger and
pain the life of the indian is a continual exhibition of it he lives
in a state of perpetual hostility and risk peril and adventure
are congenial to his nature or rather seem necessary to arouse his
faculties and to give an interest to his existence surrounded by
hostile tribes whose mode of warfare is by ambush and surprisal he is
always prepared for fight and lives with his weapons in his hands as
the ship careers in fearful singleness through the solitudes of ocean
as the bird mingles among clouds and storms and wings its way a
mere speck across the pathless fields of air so the indian holds his
course silent solitary but undaunted through the boundless bosom of
the wilderness his expeditions may vie in distance and danger with
the pilgrimage of the devotee or the crusade of the knight-errant he
traverses vast forests exposed to the hazards of lonely sickness of
lurking enemies and pining famine stormy lakes those great inland
seas are no obstacles to his wanderings in his light canoe of bark he
sports like a feather on their waves and darts with the swiftness of
an arrow down the roaring rapids of the rivers his very subsistence
is snatched from the midst of toil and peril he gains his food by the
hardships and dangers of the chase he wraps himself in the spoils of
the bear the panther and the buffalo and sleeps among the thunders of
the cataract

no hero of ancient or modern days can surpass the indian in his lofty
contempt of death and the fortitude with which he sustains his cruelest
affliction indeed we here behold him rising superior to the white man
in consequence of his peculiar education the latter rushes to glorious
death at the cannon's mouth the former calmly contemplates its
approach and triumphantly endures it amidst the varied torments of
surrounding foes and the protracted agonies of fire he even takes
a pride in taunting his persecutors and provoking their ingenuity of
torture and as the devouring flames prey on his very vitals and the
flesh shrinks from the sinews he raises his last song of triumph
breathing the defiance of an unconquered heart and invoking the spirits
of his fathers to witness that he dies without a groan

notwithstanding the obloquy with which the early historians have
overshadowed the characters of the unfortunate natives some bright
gleams occasionally break through which throw a degree of melancholy
lustre on their memories facts are occasionally to be met with in the
rude annals of the eastern provinces which though recorded with the
coloring of prejudice and bigotry yet speak for themselves and will
be dwelt on with applause and sympathy when prejudice shall have passed
away

in one of the homely narratives of the indian wars in new england there
is a touching account of the desolation carried into the tribe of
the pequod indians humanity shrinks from the cold-blooded detail of
indiscriminate butchery in one place we read of the surprisal of an
indian fort in the night when the wigwams were wrapped in flames and
the miserable inhabitants shot down and slain in attempting to escape
all being despatched and ended in the course of an hour after a
series of similar transactions our soldiers as the historian
piously observes being resolved by god's assistance to make a final
destruction of them the unhappy savages being hunted from their homes
and fortresses and pursued with fire and sword a scanty but gallant
band the sad remnant of the pequod warriors with their wives and
children took refuge in a swamp

burning with indignation and rendered sullen by despair with hearts
bursting with grief at the destruction of their tribe and spirits
galled and sore at the fancied ignominy of their defeat they refused to
ask their lives at the hands of an insulting foe and preferred death to
submission

as the night drew on they were surrounded in their dismal retreat so as
to render escape impracticable thus situated their enemy plied them
with shot all the time by which means many were killed and buried in
the mire in the darkness and fog that preceded the dawn of day some
few broke through the besiegers and escaped into the woods the rest
were left to the conquerors of which many were killed in the swamp
like sullen dogs who would rather in their self-willedness and madness
sit still and be shot through or cut to pieces than implore for mercy
when the day broke upon this handful of forlorn but dauntless spirits
the soldiers we are told entering the swamp saw several heaps of
them sitting close together upon whom they discharged their pieces
laden with ten or twelve pistol bullets at a time putting the muzzles
of the pieces under the boughs within a few yards of them so as
besides those that were found dead many more were killed and sunk into
the mire and never were minded more by friend or foe

can any one read this plain unvarnished tale without admiring the stern
resolution the unbending pride the loftiness of spirit that seemed to
nerve the hearts of these self-taught heroes and to raise them above the
instinctive feelings of human nature when the gauls laid waste the city
of rome they found the senators clothed in their robes and seated with
stern tranquillity in their curule chairs in this manner they suffered
death without resistance or even supplication such conduct was in them
applauded as noble and magnanimous in the hapless indian it was
reviled as obstinate and sullen how truly are we the dupes of show and
circumstance how different is virtue clothed in purple and enthroned
in state from virtue naked and destitute and perishing obscurely in a
wilderness

but i forbear to dwell on these gloomy pictures the eastern tribes have
long since disappeared the forests that sheltered them have been laid
low and scarce any traces remain of them in the thickly-settled states
of new england excepting here and there the indian name of a village
or a stream and such must sooner or later be the fate of those other
tribes which skirt the frontiers and have occasionally been inveigled
from their forests to mingle in the wars of white men in a little
while and they will go the way that their brethren have gone before
the few hordes which still linger about the shores of huron and superior
and the tributary streams of the mississippi will share the fate of
those tribes that once spread over massachusetts and connecticut and
lorded it along the proud banks of the hudson of that gigantic race
said to have existed on the borders of the susquehanna and of those
various nations that flourished about the potomac and the rappahannock
and that peopled the forests of the vast valley of shenandoah they will
vanish like a vapor from the face of the earth their very history will
be lost in forgetfulness and the places that now know them will know
them no more forever or if perchance some dubious memorial of them
should survive it may be in the romantic dreams of the poet to people
in imagination his glades and groves like the fauns and satyrs and
sylvan deities of antiquity but should he venture upon the dark story
of their wrongs and wretchedness should he tell how they were invaded
corrupted despoiled driven from their native abodes and the sepulchres
of their fathers hunted like wild beasts about the earth and sent down
with violence and butchery to the grave posterity will either turn with
horror and incredulity from the tale or blush with indignation at the
inhumanity of their forefathers we are driven back said an old
warrior until we can retreat no farther our hatchets are broken our
bows are snapped our fires are nearly extinguished a little longer and
the white man will cease to persecute us for we shall cease to exist




philip of pokanoket

an indian memoir

 as monumental bronze unchanged his look
 a soul that pity touch'd but never shook
 train'd from his tree-rock'd cradle to his bier
 the fierce extremes of good and ill to brook
 impassive fearing but the shame of fear 
 stoic of the woods a man without a tear
 campbell

it is to be regretted that those early writers who treated of the
discovery and settlement of america have not given us more particular
and candid accounts of the remarkable characters that flourished in
savage life the scanty anecdotes which have reached us are full of
peculiarity and interest they furnish us with nearer glimpses of human
nature and show what man is in a comparatively primitive state and what
he owes to civilization there is something of the charm of discovery
in lighting upon these wild and unexplored tracts of human nature in
witnessing as it were the native growth of moral sentiment and
perceiving those generous and romantic qualities which have been
artificially cultivated by society vegetating in spontaneous hardihood
and rude magnificence

in civilized life where the happiness and indeed almost the existence
of man depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow-men he is
constantly acting a studied part the bold and peculiar traits of native
character are refined away or softened down by the levelling influence
of what is termed good-breeding and he practises so many petty
deceptions and affects so many generous sentiments for the purposes
of popularity that it is difficult to distinguish his real from his
artificial character the indian on the contrary free from the
restraints and refinements of polished life and in a great degree a
solitary and independent being obeys the impulses of his inclination
or the dictates of his judgment and thus the attributes of his nature
being freely indulged grow singly great and striking society is like
a lawn where every roughness is smoothed every bramble eradicated and
where the eye is delighted by the smiling verdure of a velvet surface
he however who would study nature in its wildness and variety must
plunge into the forest must explore the glen must stem the torrent
and dare the precipice

these reflections arose on casually looking through a volume of early
colonial history wherein are recorded with great bitterness the
outrages of the indians and their wars with the settlers new england
it is painful to perceive even from these partial narratives how the
footsteps of civilization may be traced in the blood of the aborigines
how easily the colonists were moved to hostility by the lust of
conquest how merciless and exterminating was their warfare the
imagination shrinks at the idea of how many intellectual beings were
hunted from the earth how many brave and noble hearts of nature's
sterling coinage were broken down and trampled in the dust

such was the fate of philip of pokanoket an indian warrior whose name
was once a terror throughout massachusetts and connecticut he was the
most distinguished of a number of contemporary sachems who reigned over
the pequods the narragansetts the wampanoags and the other eastern
tribes at the time of the first settlement of new england a band of
native untaught heroes who made the most generous struggle of which
human nature is capable fighting to the last gasp in the cause of their
country without a hope of victory or a thought of renown worthy of
an age of poetry and fit subjects for local story and romantic fiction
they have left scarcely any authentic traces on the page of history but
stalk like gigantic shadows in the dim twilight of tradition


 while correcting the proof-sheets of this article the
 author is informed that a celebrated english poet has nearly
 finished an heroic poem on the story of philip of pokanoket


when the pilgrims as the plymouth settlers are called by their
descendants first took refuge on the shores of the new world from
the religious persecutions of the old their situation was to the last
degree gloomy and disheartening few in number and that number rapidly
perishing away through sickness and hardships surrounded by a howling
wilderness and savage tribes exposed to the rigors of an almost arctic
winter and the vicissitudes of an ever-shifting climate their minds
were filled with doleful forebodings and nothing preserved them
from sinking into despondency but the strong excitement of religious
enthusiasm in this forlorn situation they were visited by massasoit
chief sagamore of the wampanoags a powerful chief who reigned over
a great extent of country instead of taking advantage of the scanty
number of the strangers and expelling them from his territories into
which they had intruded he seemed at once to conceive for them a
generous friendship and extended towards them the rites of primitive
hospitality he came early in the spring to their settlement of new
plymouth attended by a mere handful of followers entered into a solemn
league of peace and amity sold them a portion of the soil and promised
to secure for them the good-will of his savage allies whatever may be
said of indian perfidy it is certain that the integrity and good
faith of massasoit have never been impeached he continued a firm and
magnanimous friend of the white men suffering them to extend their
possessions and to strengthen themselves in the land and betraying no
jealousy of their increasing power and prosperity shortly before his
death he came once more to new plymouth with his son alexander for
the purpose of renewing the covenant of peace and of securing it to his
posterity

at this conference he endeavored to protect the religion of his
forefathers from the encroaching zeal of the missionaries and
stipulated that no further attempt should be made to draw off his people
from their ancient faith but finding the english obstinately opposed
to any such condition he mildly relinquished the demand almost the
last act of his life was to bring his two sons alexander and philip
as they had been named by the english to the residence of a principal
settler recommending mutual kindness and confidence and entreating
that the same love and amity which had existed between the white men and
himself might be continued afterwards with his children the good old
sachem died in peace and was happily gathered to his fathers before
sorrow came upon his tribe his children remained behind to experience
the ingratitude of white men

his eldest son alexander succeeded him he was of a quick and
impetuous temper and proudly tenacious of his hereditary rights and
dignity the intrusive policy and dictatorial conduct of the
strangers excited his indignation and he beheld with uneasiness their
exterminating wars with the neighboring tribes he was doomed soon to
incur their hostility being accused of plotting with the narragansetts
to rise against the english and drive them from the land it is
impossible to say whether this accusation was warranted by facts or was
grounded on mere suspicions it is evident however by the violent and
overbearing measures of the settlers that they had by this time begun to
feel conscious of the rapid increase of their power and to grow harsh
and inconsiderate in their treatment of the natives they despatched
an armed force to seize upon alexander and to bring him before their
courts he was traced to his woodland haunts and surprised at a
hunting-house where he was reposing with a band of his followers
unarmed after the toils of the chase the suddenness of his arrest
and the outrage offered to his sovereign dignity so preyed upon the
irascible feelings of this proud savage as to throw him into a raging
fever he was permitted to return home on condition of sending his son
as a pledge for his re-appearance but the blow he had received was
fatal and before he reached his home he fell a victim to the agonies of
a wounded spirit

the successor of alexander was metamocet or king philip as he was
called by the settlers on account of his lofty spirit and ambitious
temper these together with his well-known energy and enterprise had
rendered him an object of great jealousy and apprehension and he was
accused of having always cherished a secret and implacable hostility
towards the whites such may very probably and very naturally have been
the case he considered them as originally but mere intruders into
the country who had presumed upon indulgence and were extending
an influence baneful to savage life he saw the whole race of his
countrymen melting before them from the face of the earth their
territories slipping from their hands and their tribes becoming feeble
scattered and dependent it may be said that the soil was originally
purchased by the settlers but who does not know the nature of indian
purchases in the early periods of colonization the europeans always
made thrifty bargains through their superior adroitness in traffic and
they gained vast accessions of territory by easily-provoked hostilities
an uncultivated savage is never a nice inquirer into the refinements of
law by which an injury may be gradually and legally inflicted leading
facts are all by which he judges and it was enough for philip to know
that before the intrusion of the europeans his countrymen were lords of
the soil and that now they were becoming vagabonds in the land of their
fathers

but whatever may have been his feelings of general hostility and his
particular indignation at the treatment of his brother he suppressed
them for the present renewed the contract with the settlers and
resided peaceably for many years at pokanoket or as it was called by
the english mount hope the ancient seat of dominion of his tribe
suspicions however which were at first but vague and indefinite
began to acquire form and substance and he was at length charged with
attempting to instigate the various eastern tribes to rise at once and
by a simultaneous effort to throw off the yoke of their oppressors it
is difficult at this distant period to assign the proper credit due to
these early accusations against the indians there was a proneness to
suspicion and an aptness to acts of violence on the part of the whites
that gave weight and importance to every idle tale informers abounded
where tale-bearing met with countenance and reward and the sword
was readily unsheathed when its success was certain and it carved out
empire


 now bristol rhode island


the only positive evidence on record against philip is the accusation
of one sausaman a renegado indian whose natural cunning had been
quickened by a partial education which he had received among the
settlers he changed his faith and his allegiance two or three times
with a facility that evinced the looseness of his principles he had
acted for some time as philip's confidential secretary and counsellor
and had enjoyed his bounty and protection finding however that the
clouds of adversity were gathering round his patron he abandoned his
service and went over to the whites and in order to gain their favor
charged his former benefactor with plotting against their safety a
rigorous investigation took place philip and several of his subjects
submitted to be examined but nothing was proved against them the
settlers however had now gone too far to retract they had previously
determined that philip was a dangerous neighbor they had publicly
evinced their distrust and had done enough to insure his hostility
according therefore to the usual mode of reasoning in these cases
his destruction had become necessary to their security sausaman the
treacherous informer was shortly afterwards found dead in a pond
having fallen a victim to the vengeance of his tribe three indians
one of whom was a friend and counsellor of philip were apprehended
and tried and on the testimony of one very questionable witness were
condemned and executed as murderers

this treatment of his subjects and ignominious punishment of his friend
outraged the pride and exasperated the passions of philip the bolt
which had fallen thus at his very feet awakened him to the gathering
storm and he determined to trust himself no longer in the power of the
white men the fate of his insulted and broken-hearted brother still
rankled in his mind and he had a further warning in the tragical story
of miantonimo a great sachem of the narragansetts who after manfully
facing his accusers before a tribunal of the colonists exculpating
himself from a charge of conspiracy and receiving assurances of amity
had been perfidiously despatched at their instigation philip therefore
gathered his fighting-men about him persuaded all strangers that
he could to join his cause sent the women and children to the
narragansetts for safety and wherever he appeared was continually
surrounded by armed warriors

when the two parties were thus in a state of distrust and irritation
the least spark was sufficient to set them in a flame the indians
having weapons in their hands grew mischievous and committed various
petty depredations in one of their maraudings a warrior was fired on
and killed by a settler this was the signal for open hostilities the
indians pressed to revenge the death of their comrade and the alarm of
war resounded through the plymouth colony

in the early chronicles of these dark and melancholy times we meet with
many indications of the diseased state of the public mind the gloom
of religious abstraction and the wildness of their situation among
trackless forests and savage tribes had disposed the colonists to
superstitious fancies and had filled their imaginations with the
frightful chimeras of witchcraft and spectrology they were much given
also to a belief in omens the troubles with philip and his indians
were preceded we are told by a variety of those awful warnings which
forerun great and public calamities the perfect form of an indian
bow appeared in the air at new plymouth which was looked upon by the
inhabitants as a prodigious apparition at hadley northampton and
other towns in their neighborhood was heard the report of a great piece
of ordnance with a shaking of the earth and a considerable echo
others were alarmed on a still sunshiny morning by the discharge of guns
and muskets bullets seemed to whistle past them and the noise of
drums resounded in the air seeming to pass away to the westward others
fancied that they heard the galloping of horses over their heads and
certain monstrous births which took place about the time filled the
superstitious in some towns with doleful forebodings many of these
portentous sights and sounds may be ascribed to natural phenomena to
the northern lights which occur vividly in those latitudes the meteors
which explode in the air the casual rushing of a blast through the top
branches of the forest the crash of fallen trees or disrupted rocks
and to those other uncouth sounds and echoes which will sometimes
strike the ear so strangely amidst the profound stillness of woodland
solitudes these may have startled some melancholy imaginations may
have been exaggerated by the love for the marvellous and listened
to with that avidity with which we devour whatever is fearful and
mysterious the universal currency of these superstitious fancies and
the grave record made of them by one of the learned men of the day are
strongly characteristic of the times


 the rev increase mather's history


the nature of the contest that ensued was such as too often
distinguishes the warfare between civilized men and savages on the part
of the whites it was conducted with superior skill and success but with
a wastefulness of the blood and a disregard of the natural rights of
their antagonists on the part of the indians it was waged with the
desperation of men fearless of death and who had nothing to expect from
peace but humiliation dependence and decay

the events of the war are transmitted to us by a worthy clergyman of the
time who dwells with horror and indignation on every hostile act of the
indians however justifiable whilst he mentions with applause the most
sanguinary atrocities of the whites philip is reviled as a murderer and
a traitor without considering that he was a true-born prince gallantly
fighting at the head of his subjects to avenge the wrongs of his family
to retrieve the tottering power of his line and to deliver his native
land from the oppression of usurping strangers

the project of a wide and simultaneous revolt if such had really been
formed was worthy of a capacious mind and had it not been prematurely
discovered might have been overwhelming in its consequences the war
that actually broke out was but a war of detail a mere succession of
casual exploits and unconnected enterprises still it sets forth the
military genius and daring prowess of philip and wherever in the
prejudiced and passionate narrations that have been given of it we
can arrive at simple facts we find him displaying a vigorous mind a
fertility of expedients a contempt of suffering and hardship and an
unconquerable resolution that command our sympathy and applause

driven from his paternal domains at mount hope he threw himself
into the depths of those vast and trackless forests that skirted the
settlements and were almost impervious to anything but a wild beast
or an indian here he gathered together his forces like the storm
accumulating its stores of mischief in the bosom of the thundercloud
and would suddenly emerge at a time and place least expected carrying
havoc and dismay into the villages there were now and then indications
of these impending ravages that filled the minds of the colonists with
awe and apprehension the report of a distant gun would perhaps be heard
from the solitary woodland where there was known to be no white man
the cattle which had been wandering in the woods would sometimes return
home wounded or an indian or two would be seen lurking about the
skirts of the forests and suddenly disappearing as the lightning will
sometimes be seen playing silently about the edge of the cloud that is
brewing up the tempest

though sometimes pursued and even surrounded by the settlers yet philip
as often escaped almost miraculously from their toils and plunging
into the wilderness would be lost to all search or inquiry until he
again emerged at some far distant quarter laying the country desolate
among his strongholds were the great swamps or morasses which extend
in some parts of new england composed of loose bogs of deep black
mud perplexed with thickets brambles rank weeds the shattered and
mouldering trunks of fallen trees overshadowed by lugubrious hemlocks
the uncertain footing and the tangled mazes of these shaggy wilds
rendered them almost impracticable to the white man though the indian
could thread their labyrinths with the agility of a deer into one of
these the great swamp of pocasset neck was philip once driven with a
band of his followers the english did not dare to pursue him fearing
to venture into these dark and frightful recesses where they might
perish in fens and miry pits or be shot down by lurking foes they
therefore invested the entrance to the neck and began to build a fort
with the thought of starving out the foe but philip and his warriors
wafted themselves on a raft over an arm of the sea in the dead of night
leaving the women and children behind and escaped away to the westward
kindling the flames of war among the tribes of massachusetts and the
nipmuck country and threatening the colony of connecticut

in this way philip became a theme of universal apprehension the mystery
in which he was enveloped exaggerated his real terrors he was an evil
that walked in darkness whose coming none could foresee and against
which none knew when to be on the alert the whole country abounded with
rumors and alarms philip seemed almost possessed of ubiquity for in
whatever part of the widely-extended frontier an irruption from the
forest took place philip was said to be its leader many superstitious
notions also were circulated concerning him he was said to deal in
necromancy and to be attended by an old indian witch or prophetess
whom he consulted and who assisted him by her charms and incantations
this indeed was frequently the case with indian chiefs either through
their own credulity or to act upon that of their followers and the
influence of the prophet and the dreamer over indian superstition has
been fully evidenced in recent instances of savage warfare

at the time that philip effected his escape from pocasset his fortunes
were in a desperate condition his forces had been thinned by repeated
fights and he had lost almost the whole of his resources in this time
of adversity he found a faithful friend in canonchet chief sachem of
all the narragansetts he was the son and heir of miantonimo the great
sachem who as already mentioned after an honorable acquittal of the
charge of conspiracy had been privately put to death at the perfidious
instigations of the settlers he was the heir says the old
chronicler of all his father's pride and insolence as well as of his
malice towards the english he certainly was the heir of his insults
and injuries and the legitimate avenger of his murder though he had
forborne to take an active part in this hopeless war yet he received
philip and his broken forces with open arms and gave them the most
generous countenance and support this at once drew upon him the
hostility of the english and it was determined to strike a signal blow
that should involve both the sachems in one common ruin a great force
was therefore gathered together from massachusetts plymouth and
connecticut and was sent into the narragansett country in the depth of
winter when the swamps being frozen and leafless could be traversed
with comparative facility and would no longer afford dark and
impenetrable fastnesses to the indians

apprehensive of attack canonchet had conveyed the greater part of his
stores together with the old the infirm the women and children of his
tribe to a strong fortress where he and philip had likewise drawn
up the flower of their forces this fortress deemed by the indians
impregnable was situated upon a rising mound or kind of island of five
or six acres in the midst of a swamp it was constructed with a degree
of judgment and skill vastly superior to what is usually displayed in
indian fortification and indicative of the martial genius of these two
chieftains

guided by a renegado indian the english penetrated through december
snows to this stronghold and came upon the garrison by surprise the
fight was fierce and tumultuous the assailants were repulsed in their
first attack and several of their bravest officers were shot down in
the act of storming the fortress sword in hand the assault was renewed
with greater success a lodgment was effected the indians were driven
from one post to another they disputed their ground inch by inch
fighting with the fury of despair most of their veterans were cut to
pieces and after a long and bloody battle philip and canonchet with
a handful of surviving warriors retreated from the fort and took refuge
in the thickets of the surrounding forest

the victors set fire to the wigwams and the fort the whole was soon in
a blaze many of the old men the women and the children perished in
the flames this last outrage overcame even the stoicism of the savage
the neighboring woods resounded with the yells of rage and despair
uttered by the fugitive warriors as they beheld the destruction
of their dwellings and heard the agonizing cries of their wives and
offspring the burning of the wigwams says a contemporary writer
the shrieks and cries of the women and children and the yelling of
the warriors exhibited a most horrible and affecting scene so that it
greatly moved some of the soldiers the same writer cautiously adds
they were in much doubt then and afterwards seriously inquired
whether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with humanity
and the benevolent principles of the gospel


 ms of the rev w ruggles


the fate of the brave and generous canonchet is worthy of particular
mention the last scene of his life is one of the noblest instances on
record of indian magnanimity

broken down in his power and resources by this signal defeat yet
faithful to his ally and to the hapless cause which he had espoused he
rejected all overtures of peace offered on condition of betraying philip
and his followers and declared that he would fight it out to the
last man rather than become a servant to the english his home being
destroyed his country harassed and laid waste by the incursions of
the conquerors he was obliged to wander away to the banks of the
connecticut where he formed a rallying-point to the whole body of
western indians and laid waste several of the english settlements

early in the spring he departed on a hazardous expedition with only
thirty chosen men to penetrate to seaconck in the vicinity of mount
hope and to procure seed corn to plant for the sustenance of his
troops this little hand of adventurers had passed safely through the
pequod country and were in the centre of the narragansett resting
at some wigwams near pautucket river when an alarm was given of an
approaching enemy having but seven men by him at the time canonchet
despatched two of them to the top of a neighboring hill to bring
intelligence of the foe

panic-struck by the appearance of a troop of english and indians rapidly
advancing they fled in breathless terror past their chieftain without
stopping to inform him of the danger canonchet sent another scout
who did the same he then sent two more one of whom hurrying back
in confusion and affright told him that the whole british army was
at hand canonchet saw there was no choice but immediate flight he
attempted to escape round the hill but was perceived and hotly pursued
by the hostile indians and a few of the fleetest of the english finding
the swiftest pursuer close upon his heels he threw off first his
blanket then his silver-laced coat and belt of peag by which his
enemies knew him to be canonchet and redoubled the eagerness of pursuit

at length in dashing through the river his foot slipped upon a stone
and he fell so deep as to wet his gun this accident so struck him with
despair that as he afterwards confessed his heart and his bowels
turned within him and he became like a rotten stick void of strength

to such a degree was he unnerved that being seized by a pequod indian
within a short distance of the river he made no resistance though
a man of great vigor of body and boldness of heart but on being made
prisoner the whole pride of his spirit arose within him and from that
moment we find in the anecdotes given by his enemies nothing but
repeated flashes of elevated and prince-like heroism being questioned
by one of the english who first came up with him and who had not
attained his twenty second year the proud-hearted warrior looking
with lofty contempt upon his youthful countenance replied you are a
child you cannot understand matters of war let your brother or your
chief come him will i answer

though repeated offers were made to him of his life on condition of
submitting with his nation to the english yet he rejected them with
disdain and refused to send any proposals of the kind to the great body
of his subjects saying that he knew none of them would comply being
reproached with his breach of faith towards the whites his boast that
he would not deliver up a wampanoag nor the paring of a wampanoag's
nail and his threat that he would burn the english alive in their
houses he disdained to justify himself haughtily answering that others
were as forward for the war as himself and he desired to hear no more
thereof

so noble and unshaken a spirit so true a fidelity to his cause and his
friend might have touched the feelings of the generous and the brave
but canonchet was an indian a being towards whom war had no courtesy
humanity no law religion no compassion he was condemned to die the
last words of his that are recorded are worthy the greatness of his
soul when sentence of death was passed upon him he observed that he
liked it well for he should die before his heart was soft or he had
spoken anything unworthy of himself his enemies gave him the death of
a soldier for he was shot at stoning ham by three young sachems of his
own rank

the defeat at the narraganset fortress and the death of canonchet were
fatal blows to the fortunes of king philip he made an ineffectual
attempt to raise a head of war by stirring up the mohawks to take arms
but though possessed of the native talents of a statesman his arts
were counteracted by the superior arts of his enlightened enemies and
the terror of their warlike skill began to subdue the resolution of the
neighboring tribes the unfortunate chieftain saw himself daily stripped
of power and his ranks rapidly thinning around him some were suborned
by the whites others fell victims to hunger and fatigue and to the
frequent attacks by which they were harassed his stores were all
captured his chosen friends were swept away from before his eyes his
uncle was shot down by his side his sister was carried into captivity
and in one of his narrow escapes he was compelled to leave his beloved
wife and only son to the mercy of the enemy his ruin says the
historian being thus gradually carried on his misery was not
prevented but augmented thereby being himself made acquainted with the
sense and experimental feeling of the captivity of his children loss of
friends slaughter of his subjects bereavement of all family relations
and being stripped of all outward comforts before his own life should be
taken away

to fill up the measure of his misfortunes his own followers began
to plot against his life that by sacrificing him they might purchase
dishonorable safety through treachery a number of his faithful
adherents the subjects of wetamoe an indian princess of pocasset a
near kinswoman and confederate of philip were betrayed into the hands
of the enemy wetamoe was among them at the time and attempted to make
her escape by crossing a neighboring river either exhausted by swimming
or starved with cold and hunger she was found dead and naked near the
water-side but persecution ceased not at the grave even death the
refuge of the wretched where the wicked commonly cease from troubling
was no protection to this outcast female whose great crime was
affectionate fidelity to her kinsman and her friend her corpse was the
object of unmanly and dastardly vengeance the head was severed from the
body and set upon a pole and was thus exposed at taunton to the view of
her captive subjects they immediately recognized the features of their
unfortunate queen and were so affected at this barbarous spectacle
that we are told they broke forth into the most horrid and diabolical
lamentations

however philip had borne up against the complicated miseries and
misfortunes that surrounded him the treachery of his followers seemed
to wring his heart and reduce him to despondency it is said that he
never rejoiced afterwards nor had success in any of his designs the
spring of hope was broken the ardor of enterprise was extinguished he
looked around and all was danger and darkness there was no eye to
pity nor any arm that could bring deliverance with a scanty band
of followers who still remained true to his desperate fortunes the
unhappy philip wandered back to the vicinity of mount hope the ancient
dwelling of his fathers here he lurked about like a spectre among the
scenes of former power and prosperity now bereft of home of family
and of friend there needs no better picture of his destitute and
piteous situation than that furnished by the homely pen of the
chronicler who is unwarily enlisting the feelings of the reader in
favor of the hapless warrior whom he reviles philip he says like a
savage wild beast having been hunted by the english forces through the
woods above a hundred miles backward and forward at last was driven to
his own den upon mount hope where he retired with a few of his best
friends into a swamp which proved but a prison to keep him fast till
the messengers of death came by divine permission to execute vengeance
upon him

even in this last refuge of desperation and despair a sullen grandeur
gathers round his memory we picture him to ourselves seated among his
care-worn followers brooding in silence over his blasted fortunes and
acquiring a savage sublimity from the wildness and dreariness of his
lurking-place defeated but not dismayed crushed to the earth but
not humiliated he seemed to grow more haughty beneath disaster and
to experience a fierce satisfaction in draining the last dregs of
bitterness little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune but great
minds rise above it the very idea of submission awakened the fury
of philip and he smote to death one of his followers who proposed an
expedient of peace the brother of the victim made his escape and in
revenge betrayed the retreat of his chieftain a body of white men
and indians were immediately despatched to the swamp where philip lay
crouched glaring with fury and despair before he was aware of their
approach they had begun to surround him in a little while he saw five
of his trustiest followers laid dead at his feet all resistance was
vain he rushed forth from his covert and made a headlong attempt to
escape but was shot through the heart by a renegado indian of his own
nation

such is the scanty story of the brave but unfortunate king philip
persecuted while living slandered and dishonored when dead if
however we consider even the prejudiced anecdotes furnished us by his
enemies we may perceive in them traces of amiable and lofty character
sufficient to awaken sympathy for his fate and respect for his memory
we find that amidst all the harassing cares and ferocious passions of
constant warfare he was alive to the softer feelings of connubial love
and paternal tenderness and to the generous sentiment of friendship
the captivity of his beloved wife and only son are mentioned with
exultation as causing him poignant misery the death of any near friend
is triumphantly recorded as a new blow on his sensibilities but the
treachery and desertion of many of his followers in whose affections he
had confided is said to have desolated his heart and to have bereaved
him of all further comfort he was a patriot attached to his native
soil a prince true to his subjects and indignant of their wrongs a
soldier daring in battle firm in adversity patient of fatigue of
hunger of every variety of bodily suffering and ready to perish in
the cause he had espoused proud of heart and with an untamable love
of natural liberty he preferred to enjoy it among the beasts of the
forests or in the dismal and famished recesses of swamps and morasses
rather than bow his haughty spirit to submission and live dependent
and despised in the ease and luxury of the settlements with heroic
qualities and bold achievements that would have graced a civilized
warrior and have rendered him the theme of the poet and the historian
he lived a wanderer and a fugitive in his native land and went down
like a lonely bark foundering amid darkness and tempest without a
pitying eye to weep his fall or a friendly hand to record his struggle




john bull

 an old song made by an aged old pate
 of an old worshipful gentleman who had a great estate
 that kept a brave old house at a bountiful rate
 and an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate

 with an old study fill'd full of learned old books
 with an old reverend chaplain you might know him by his
looks with an old buttery-hatch worn quite off the hooks
 and an old kitchen that maintained half-a-dozen old cooks
 like an old courtier etc old song

there is no species of humor in which the english more excel than that
which consists in caricaturing and giving ludicrous appellations or
nicknames in this way they have whimsically designated not merely
individuals but nations and in their fondness for pushing a joke they
have not spared even themselves one would think that in personifying
itself a nation would be apt to picture something grand heroic and
imposing but it is characteristic of the peculiar humor of the english
and of their love for what is blunt comic and familiar that they have
embodied their national oddities in the figure of a sturdy corpulent
old fellow with a three-cornered hat red waistcoat leather breeches
and stout oaken cudgel thus they have taken a singular delight in
exhibiting their most private foibles in a laughable point of view and
have been so successful in their delineations that there is scarcely
a being in actual existence more absolutely present to the public mind
than that eccentric personage john bull

perhaps the continual contemplation of the character thus drawn of them
has contributed to fix it upon the nation and thus to give reality
to what at first may have been painted in a great measure from the
imagination men are apt to acquire peculiarities that are continually
ascribed to them the common orders of english seem wonderfully
captivated with the beau ideal which they have formed of john bull and
endeavor to act up to the broad caricature that is perpetually before
their eyes unluckily they sometimes make their boasted bullism an
apology for their prejudice or grossness and this i have especially
noticed among those truly homebred and genuine sons of the soil who have
never migrated beyond the sound of bow bells if one of these should
be a little uncouth in speech and apt to utter impertinent truths he
confesses that he is a real john bull and always speaks his mind if he
now and then flies into an unreasonable burst of passion about trifles
he observes that john bull is a choleric old blade but then his passion
is over in a moment and he bears no malice if he betrays a coarseness
of taste and an insensibility to foreign refinements he thanks heaven
for his ignorance he is a plain john bull and has no relish for
frippery and knick-knacks his very proneness to be gulled by strangers
and to pay extravagantly for absurdities is excused under the plea of
munificence for john is always more generous than wise

thus under the name of john bull he will contrive to argue every fault
into a merit and will frankly convict himself of being the honestest
fellow in existence

however little therefore the character may have suited in the first
instance it has gradually adapted itself to the nation or rather they
have adapted themselves to each other and a stranger who wishes to
study english peculiarities may gather much valuable information from
the innumerable portraits of john bull as exhibited in the windows
of the caricature-shops still however he is one of those fertile
humorists that are continually throwing out new portraits and presenting
different aspects from different points of view and often as he has
been described i cannot resist the temptation to give a slight sketch
of him such as he has met my eye

john bull to all appearance is a plain downright matter-of-fact
fellow with much less of poetry about him than rich prose there is
little of romance in his nature but a vast deal of strong natural
feeling he excels in humor more than in wit is jolly rather than gay
melancholy rather than morose can easily be moved to a sudden tear or
surprised into a broad laugh but he loathes sentiment and has no turn
for light pleasantry he is a boon companion if you allow him in to
have his humor and to talk about himself and he will stand by a friend
in a quarrel with life and purse however soundly he may be cudgelled

in this last respect to tell the truth he has a propensity to be
somewhat too ready he is a busy-minded personage who thinks not merely
for himself and family but for all the country round and is most
generously disposed to be everybody's champion he is continually
volunteering his services to settle his neighbor's affairs and takes
it in great dudgeon if they engage in any matter of consequence without
asking his advice though he seldom engages in any friendly office of
the kind without finishing by getting into a squabble with all parties
and then railing bitterly at their ingratitude he unluckily took
lessons in his youth in the noble science of defence and having
accomplished himself in the use of his limbs and his weapons and become
a perfect master at boxing and cudgel-play he has had a troublesome
life of it ever since he cannot hear of a quarrel between the most
distant of his neighbors but he begins incontinently to fumble with the
head of his cudgel and consider whether his interest or honor does not
require that he should meddle in the broil indeed he has extended his
relations of pride and policy so completely over the whole country
that no event can take place without infringing some of his finely-spun
rights and dignities couched in his little domain with these
filaments stretching forth in every direction he is like some choleric
bottle-bellied old spider who has woven his web over a whole chamber
so that a fly cannot buzz nor a breeze blow without startling his repose
and causing him to sally forth wrathfully from his den

though really a good-hearted good-tempered old fellow at bottom yet he
is singularly fond of being in the midst of contention it is one of
his peculiarities however that he only relishes the beginning of an
affray he always goes into a fight with alacrity but comes out of
it grumbling even when victorious and though no one fights with more
obstinacy to carry a contested point yet when the battle is over and he
comes to the reconciliation he is so much taken up with the mere shaking
of hands that he is apt to let his antagonist pocket all that they have
been quarrelling about it is not therefore fighting that he ought so
much to be on his guard against as making friends it is difficult to
cudgel him out of a farthing but put him in a good humor and you may
bargain him out of all the money in his pocket he is like a stout ship
which will weather the roughest storm uninjured but roll its masts
overboard in the succeeding calm

he is a little fond of playing the magnifico abroad of pulling out
a long purse flinging his money bravely about at boxing-matches
horse-races cock-fights and carrying a high head among gentlemen of
the fancy but immediately after one of these fits of extravagance he
will be taken with violent qualms of economy stop short at the most
trivial expenditure talk desperately of being ruined and brought upon
the parish and in such moods will not pay the smallest tradesman's
bill without violent altercation he is in fact the most punctual
and discontented paymaster in the world drawing his coin out of his
breeches pocket with infinite reluctance paying to the uttermost
farthing but accompanying every guinea with a growl

with all his talk of economy however he is a bountiful provider and
a hospitable housekeeper his economy is of a whimsical kind its chief
object being to devise how he may afford to be extravagant for he will
begrudge himself a beefsteak and pint of port one day that he may roast
an ox whole broach a hogshead of ale and treat all his neighbors on
the next

his domestic establishment is enormously expensive not so much from
any great outward parade as from the great consumption of solid beef
and pudding the vast number of followers he feeds and clothes and his
singular disposition to pay hugely for small services he is a most
kind and indulgent master and provided his servants humor his
peculiarities flatter his vanity a little now and then and do
not peculate grossly on him before his face they may manage him to
perfection everything that lives on him seems to thrive and grow fat
his house-servants are well paid and pampered and have little to do his
horses are sleek and lazy and prance slowly before his state carriage
and his house-dogs sleep quietly about the door and will hardly bark at
a housebreaker

his family mansion is an old castellated manor-house gray with age and
of a most venerable though weather-beaten appearance it has been built
upon no regular plan but is a vast accumulation of parts erected
in various tastes and ages the centre bears evident traces of saxon
architecture and is as solid as ponderous stone and old english oak
can make it like all the relics of that style it is full of obscure
passages intricate mazes and dusty chambers and though these have
been partially lighted up in modern days yet there are many places
where you must still grope in the dark additions have been made to the
original edifice from time to time and great alterations have taken
place towers and battlements have been erected during wars and tumults
wings built in time of peace and out-houses lodges and offices run up
according to the whim or convenience of different generations until it
has become one of the most spacious rambling tenements imaginable an
entire wing is taken up with the family chapel a reverend pile that
must have been exceedingly sumptuous and indeed in spite of having
been altered and simplified at various periods has still a look of
solemn religious pomp its walls within are storied with the monuments
of john's ancestors and it is snugly fitted up with soft cushions and
well-lined chairs where such of his family as are inclined to church
services may doze comfortably in the discharge of their duties

to keep up this chapel has cost john much money but he is staunch in
his religion and piqued in his zeal from the circumstance that many
dissenting chapels have been erected in his vicinity and several of his
neighbors with whom he has had quarrels are strong papists

to do the duties of the chapel he maintains at a large expense a pious
and portly family chaplain he is a most learned and decorous personage
and a truly well-bred christian who always backs the old gentleman in
his opinions winks discreetly at his little peccadilloes rebukes the
children when refractory and is of great use in exhorting the tenants
to read their bibles say their prayers and above all to pay their
rents punctually and without grumbling

the family apartments are in a very antiquated taste somewhat heavy and
often inconvenient but full of the solemn magnificence of former times
fitted up with rich though faded tapestry unwieldy furniture and
loads of massy gorgeous old plate the vast fireplaces ample kitchens
extensive cellars and sumptuous banqueting-halls all speak of the
roaring hospitality of days of yore of which the modern festivity at
the manor-house is but a shadow there are however complete suites of
rooms apparently deserted and time-worn and towers and turrets that
are tottering to decay so that in high winds there is danger of their
tumbling about the ears of the household

john has frequently been advised to have the old edifice thoroughly
overhauled and to have some of the useless parts pulled down and the
others strengthened with their materials but the old gentleman always
grows testy on this subject he swears the house is an excellent house
that it is tight and weather-proof and not to be shaken by tempests
that it has stood for several hundred years and therefore is not likely
to tumble down now that as to its being inconvenient his family is
accustomed to the inconveniences and would not be comfortable without
them that as to its unwieldy size and irregular construction these
result from its being the growth of centuries and being improved by the
wisdom of every generation that an old family like his requires
a large house to dwell in new upstart families may live in modern
cottages and snug boxes but an old english family should inhabit an
old english manor-house if you point out any part of the building
as superfluous he insists that it is material to the strength or
decoration of the rest and the harmony of the whole and swears that the
parts are so built into each other that if you pull down one you run
the risk of having the whole about your ears

the secret of the matter is that john has a great disposition to
protect and patronize he thinks it indispensable to the dignity of an
ancient and honorable family to be bounteous in its appointments and
to be eaten up by dependents and so partly from pride and partly
from kind-heartedness he makes it a rule always to give shelter and
maintenance to his superannuated servants

the consequence is that like many other venerable family
establishments his manor is incumbered by old retainers whom he cannot
turn off and an old style which he cannot lay down his mansion is like
a great hospital of invalids and with all its magnitude is not a whit
too large for its inhabitants not a nook or corner but is of use in
housing some useless personage groups of veteran beef-eaters gouty
pensioners and retired heroes of the buttery and the larder are seen
lolling about its ways crawling over its lawns dozing under its tree
or sunning themselves upon the benches at its doors every office and
out-house is garrisoned by these supernumeraries and their families
for they are amazingly prolific and when they die off are sure to leave
john a legacy of hungry mouths to be provided for a mattock cannot be
struck against the most mouldering tumble-down tower but out pops from
some cranny or loophole the gray pate of some superannuated hanger-on
who has lived at john's expense all his life and makes the most
grievous outcry at their pulling down the roof from over the head of
a worn-out servant of the family this is an appeal that john's honest
heart never can withstand so that a man who has faithfully eaten his
beef and pudding all his life is sure to be rewarded with a pipe and
tankard in his old days

a great part of his park also is turned into paddocks where his
broken-down chargers are turned loose to graze undisturbed for the
remainder of their existences a worthy example of grateful recollection
which if some of his neighbors were to imitate would not be to their
discredit indeed it is one of his great pleasures to point out these
old steeds to his visitors to dwell on their good qualities extol
their past services and boast with some little vain-glory of the
perilous adventures and hardy exploits through which they have carried
him

he is given however to indulge his veneration for family usages and
family encumbrances to a whimsical extent his manor is infested by
gangs of gypsies yet he will not suffer them to be driven off because
they have infested the place time out of mind and been regular poachers
upon every generation of the family he will scarcely permit a dry
branch to be lopped from the great trees that surround the house lest
it should molest the rooks that have bred there for centuries owls have
taken possession of the dovecote but they are hereditary owls and must
not be disturbed swallows have nearly choked up every chimney with
their nests martins build in every frieze and cornice crows flutter
about the towers and perch on every weather-cock and old gray-headed
rats may be seen in every quarter of the house running in and out of
their holes undauntedly in broad daylight in short john has such a
reverence for everything that has been long in the family that he will
not hear even of abuses being reformed because they are good old family
abuses

all these whims and habits have concurred woefully to drain the old
gentleman's purse and as he prides himself on punctuality in money
matters and wishes to maintain his credit in the neighborhood they have
caused him great perplexity in meeting his engagements this too
has been increased by the altercations and heart-burnings which are
continually taking place in his family his children have been brought
up to different callings and are of different ways of thinking and as
they have always been allowed to speak their minds freely they do not
fail to exercise the privilege most clamorously in the present posture
of his affairs some stand up for the honor of the race and are clear
that the old establishment should be kept up in all its state whatever
may be the cost others who are more prudent and considerate entreat
the old gentleman to retrench his expenses and to put his whole system
of housekeeping on a more moderate footing he has indeed at times
seemed inclined to listen to their opinions but their wholesome advice
has been completely defeated by the obstreperous conduct of one of his
sons this is a noisy rattle-pated fellow of rather low habits who
neglects his business to frequent ale-houses is the orator of village
clubs and a complete oracle among the poorest of his father's
tenants no sooner does he hear any of his brothers mention reform or
retrenchment than up he jumps takes the words out of their mouths and
roars out for an overturn when his tongue is once going nothing
can stop it he rants about the room hectors the old man about his
spendthrift practices ridicules his tastes and pursuits insists that
he shall turn the old servants out of doors give the broken-down horses
to the hounds send the fat chaplain packing and take a field-preacher
in his place nay that the whole family mansion shall be levelled with
the ground and a plain one of brick and mortar built in its place he
rails at every social entertainment and family festivity and skulks
away growling to the ale-house whenever an equipage drives up to the
door though constantly complaining of the emptiness of his purse
yet he scruples not to spend all his pocket-money in these tavern
convocations and even runs up scores for the liquor over which he
preaches about his father's extravagance

it may readily be imagined how little such thwarting agrees with the old
cavalier's fiery temperament he has become so irritable from repeated
crossings that the mere mention of retrenchment or reform is a signal
for a brawl between him and the tavern oracle as the latter is too
sturdy and refractory for paternal discipline having grown out of all
fear of the cudgel they have frequent scenes of wordy warfare which at
times run so high that john is fain to call in the aid of his son tom
an officer who has served abroad but is at present living at home on
half-pay this last is sure to stand by the old gentleman right or
wrong likes nothing so much as a rocketing roistering life and is
ready at a wink or nod to out sabre and flourish it over the orator's
head if he dares to array himself against parental authority

these family dissensions as usual have got abroad and are rare food
for scandal in john's neighborhood people begin to look wise and shake
their heads whenever his affairs are mentioned they all hope that
matters are not so bad with him as represented but when a man's
own children begin to rail at his extravagance things must be badly
managed they understand he is mortgaged over head and ears and is
continually dabbling with money-lenders he is certainly an open-handed
old gentleman but they fear he has lived too fast indeed they never
knew any good come of this fondness for hunting racing revelling and
prize-fighting in short mr bull's estate is a very fine one and has
been in the family a long while but for all that they have known many
finer estates come to the hammer

what is worst of all is the effect which these pecuniary embarrassments
and domestic feuds have had on the poor man himself instead of that
jolly round corporation and smug rosy face which he used to present he
has of late become as shrivelled and shrunk as a frost-bitten apple
his scarlet gold-laced waistcoat which bellied out so bravely in those
prosperous days when he sailed before the wind now hangs loosely about
him like a mainsail in a calm his leather breeches are all in folds and
wrinkles and apparently have much ado to hold up the boots that yawn on
both sides of his once sturdy legs

instead of strutting about as formerly with his three-cornered hat on
one side flourishing his cudgel and bringing it down every moment with
a hearty thump upon the ground looking every one sturdily in the face
and trolling out a stave of a catch or a drinking-song he now goes
about whistling thoughtfully to himself with his head drooping down
his cudgel tucked under his arm and his hands thrust to the bottom of
his breeches pockets which are evidently empty

such is the plight of honest john bull at present yet for all this the
old fellow's spirit is as tall and as gallant as ever if you drop the
least expression of sympathy or concern he takes fire in an instant
swears that he is the richest and stoutest fellow in the country talks
of laying out large sums to adorn his house or buy another estate and
with a valiant swagger and grasping of his cudgel longs exceedingly to
have another bout at quarter-staff

though there may be something rather whimsical in all this yet i
confess i cannot look upon john's situation without strong feelings
of interest with all his odd humors and obstinate prejudices he is a
sterling-hearted old blade he may not be so wonderfully fine a fellow
as he thinks himself but he is at least twice as good as his neighbors
represent him his virtues are all his own all plain homebred and
unaffected his very faults smack of the raciness of his good qualities
his extravagance savors of his generosity his quarrelsomeness of his
courage his credulity of his open faith his vanity of his pride and
his bluntness of his sincerity they are all the redundancies of a rich
and liberal character he is like his own oak rough without but sound
and solid within whose bark abounds with excrescences in proportion to
the growth and grandeur of the timber and whose branches make a fearful
groaning and murmuring in the least storm from their very magnitude and
luxuriance there is something too in the appearance of his old family
mansion that is extremely poetical and picturesque and as long as it
can be rendered comfortably habitable i should almost tremble to see it
meddled with during the present conflict of tastes and opinions some of
his advisers are no doubt good architects that might be of service but
many i fear are mere levellers who when they had once got to work
with their mattocks on this venerable edifice would never stop until
they had brought it to the ground and perhaps buried themselves among
the ruins all that i wish is that john's present troubles may teach
him more prudence in future that he may cease to distress his mind
about other people's affairs that he may give up the fruitless attempt
to promote the good of his neighbors and the peace and happiness of
the world by dint of the cudgel that he may remain quietly at home
gradually get his house into repair cultivate his rich estate according
to his fancy husband his income if he thinks proper bring his unruly
children into order if he can renew the jovial scenes of ancient
prosperity and long enjoy on his paternal lands a green an honorable
and a merry old age




the pride of the village

 may no wolfe howle no screech owle stir
 a wing about thy sepulchre
 no boysterous winds or stormes come hither
 to starve or wither
 thy soft sweet earth but like a spring
 love kept it ever flourishing
 herrick

in the course of an excursion through one of the remote counties of
england i had struck into one of those cross-roads that lead through
the more secluded parts of the country and stopped one afternoon at a
village the situation of which was beautifully rural and retired there
was an air of primitive simplicity about its inhabitants not to be found
in the villages which lie on the great coach-roads i determined to
pass the night there and having taken an early dinner strolled out to
enjoy the neighboring scenery

my ramble as is usually the case with travellers soon led me to the
church which stood at a little distance from the village indeed it
was an object of some curiosity its old tower being completely overrun
with ivy so that only here and there a jutting buttress an angle of
gray wall or a fantastically carved ornament peered through the verdant
covering it was a lovely evening the early part of the day had been
dark and showery but in the afternoon it had cleared up and though
sullen clouds still hung overhead yet there was a broad tract of golden
sky in the west from which the setting sun gleamed through the dripping
leaves and lit up all nature into a melancholy smile it seemed like the
parting hour of a good christian smiling on the sins and sorrows of the
world and giving in the serenity of his decline an assurance that he
will rise again in glory

i had seated myself on a half-sunken tombstone and was musing as one
is apt to do at this sober-thoughted hour on past scenes and early
friends on those who were distant and those who were dead and
indulging in that kind of melancholy fancying which has in it something
sweeter even than pleasure every now and then the stroke of a bell from
the neighboring tower fell on my ear its tones were in unison with the
scene and instead of jarring chimed in with my feelings and it was
some time before i recollected that it must be tolling the knell of some
new tenant of the tomb

presently i saw a funeral train moving across the village green it
wound slowly along a lane was lost and reappeared through the breaks
of the hedges until it passed the place where i was sitting the pall
was supported by young girls dressed in white and another about the
age of seventeen walked before bearing a chaplet of white flowers a
token that the deceased was a young and unmarried female the corpse
was followed by the parents they were a venerable couple of the better
order of peasantry the father seemed to repress his feelings but his
fixed eye contracted brow and deeply-furrowed face showed the struggle
that was passing within his wife hung on his arm and wept aloud with
the convulsive bursts of a mother's sorrow

i followed the funeral into the church the bier was placed in the
centre aisle and the chaplet of white flowers with a pair of white
gloves was hung over the seat which the deceased had occupied

every one knows the soul-subduing pathos of the funeral service for who
is so fortunate as never to have followed some one he has loved to the
tomb but when performed over the remains of innocence and beauty thus
laid low in the bloom of existence what can be more affecting at that
simple but most solemn consignment of the body to the grave-earth
to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust the tears of the youthful
companions of the deceased flowed unrestrained the father still seemed
to struggle with his feelings and to comfort himself with the assurance
that the dead are blessed which die in the lord but the mother only
thought of her child as a flower of the field cut down and withered
in the midst of its sweetness she was like rachel mourning over her
children and would not be comforted

on returning to the inn i learnt the whole story of the deceased it was
a simple one and such as has often been told she had been the beauty
and pride of the village her father had once been an opulent farmer
but was reduced in circumstances this was an only child and brought up
entirely at home in the simplicity of rural life she had been the pupil
of the village pastor the favorite lamb of his little flock the good
man watched over her education with paternal care it was limited and
suitable to the sphere in which she was to move for he only sought to
make her an ornament to her station in life not to raise her above it
the tenderness and indulgence of her parents and the exemption from
all ordinary occupations had fostered a natural grace and delicacy of
character that accorded with the fragile loveliness of her form she
appeared like some tender plant of the garden blooming accidentally amid
the hardier natives of the fields

the superiority of her charms was felt and acknowledged by her
companions but without envy for it was surpassed by the unassuming
gentleness and winning kindness of her manners it might be truly said
of her

 this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
 ran on the green-sward nothing she does or seems
 but smacks of something greater than herself
 too noble for this place

the village was one of those sequestered spots which still retain some
vestiges of old english customs it had its rural festivals and holiday
pastimes and still kept up some faint observance of the once popular
rites of may these indeed had been promoted by its present pastor
who was a lover of old customs and one of those simple christians that
think their mission fulfilled by promoting joy on earth and good-will
among mankind under his auspices the may-pole stood from year to year
in the centre of the village green on mayday it was decorated with
garlands and streamers and a queen or lady of the may was appointed as
in former times to preside at the sports and distribute the prizes and
rewards the picturesque situation of the village and the fancifulness
of its rustic fetes would often attract the notice of casual visitors
among these on one may-day was a young officer whose regiment had been
recently quartered in the neighborhood he was charmed with the native
taste that pervaded this village pageant but above all with the
dawning loveliness of the queen of may it was the village favorite who
was crowned with flowers and blushing and smiling in all the beautiful
confusion of girlish diffidence and delight the artlessness of rural
habits enabled him readily to make her acquaintance he gradually won
his way into her intimacy and paid his court to her in that unthinking
way in which young officers are too apt to trifle with rustic
simplicity

there was nothing in his advances to startle or alarm he never even
talked of love but there are modes of making it more eloquent than
language and which convey it subtilely and irresistibly to the heart
the beam of the eye the tone of voice the thousand tendernesses
which emanate from every word and look and action these form the true
eloquence of love and can always be felt and understood but never
described can we wonder that they should readily win a heart young
guileless and susceptible as to her she loved almost unconsciously
she scarcely inquired what was the growing passion that was absorbing
every thought and feeling or what were to be its consequences she
indeed looked not to the future when present his looks and words
occupied her whole attention when absent she thought but of what had
passed at their recent interview she would wander with him through the
green lanes and rural scenes of the vicinity he taught her to see new
beauties in nature he talked in the language of polite and cultivated
life and breathed into her ear the witcheries of romance and poetry

perhaps there could not have been a passion between the sexes more pure
than this innocent girl's the gallant figure of her youthful admirer
and the splendor of his military attire might at first have charmed her
eye but it was not these that had captivated her heart her attachment
had something in it of idolatry she looked up to him as to a being of
a superior order she felt in his society the enthusiasm of a mind
naturally delicate and poetical and now first awakened to a keen
perception of the beautiful and grand of the sordid distinctions
of rank and fortune she thought nothing it was the difference of
intellect of demeanor of manners from those of the rustic society
to which she had been accustomed that elevated him in her opinion she
would listen to him with charmed ear and downcast look of mute delight
and her cheek would mantle with enthusiasm or if ever she ventured a
shy glance of timid admiration it was as quickly withdrawn and she
would sigh and blush at the idea of her comparative unworthiness

her lover was equally impassioned but his passion was mingled with
feelings of a coarser nature he had begun the connection in levity
for he had often heard his brother-officers boast of their village
conquests and thought some triumph of the kind necessary to his
reputation as a man of spirit but he was too full of youthful fervor
his heart had not yet been rendered sufficiently cold and selfish by a
wandering and a dissipated life it caught fire from the very flame it
sought to kindle and before he was aware of the nature of his situation
he became really in love

what was he to do there were the old obstacles which so incessantly
occur in these heedless attachments his rank in life the prejudices of
titled connections his dependence upon a proud and unyielding father
all forbade him to think of matrimony but when he looked down upon
this innocent being so tender and confiding there was a purity in her
manners a blamelessness in her life and a beseeching modesty in her
looks that awed down every licentious feeling in vain did he try to
fortify himself by a thousand heartless examples of men of fashion and
to chill the glow of generous sentiment with that cold derisive levity
with which he had heard them talk of female virtue whenever he came
into her presence she was still surrounded by that mysterious but
impassive charm of virgin purity in whose hallowed sphere no guilty
thought can live

the sudden arrival of orders for the regiment to repair to the continent
completed the confusion of his mind he remained for a short time in a
state of the most painful irresolution he hesitated to communicate the
tidings until the day for marching was at hand when he gave her the
intelligence in the course of an evening ramble

the idea of parting had never before occurred to her it broke in at
once upon her dream of felicity she looked upon it as a sudden and
insurmountable evil and wept with the guileless simplicity of a child
he drew her to his bosom and kissed the tears from her soft cheek nor
did he meet with a repulse for there are moments of mingled sorrow
and tenderness which hallow the caresses of affection he was naturally
impetuous and the sight of beauty apparently yielding in his arms the
confidence of his power over her and the dread of losing her forever
all conspired to overwhelm his better feelings he ventured to propose
that she should leave her home and be the companion of his fortunes

he was quite a novice in seduction and blushed and faltered at his own
baseness but so innocent of mind was his intended victim that she was
at first at a loss to comprehend his meaning and why she should leave
her native village and the humble roof of her parents when at last
the nature of his proposal flashed upon her pure mind the effect was
withering she did not weep she did not break forth into reproach she
said not a word but she shrunk back aghast as from a viper gave him a
look of anguish that pierced to his very soul and clasping her hands
in agony fled as if for refuge to her father's cottage

the officer retired confounded humiliated and repentant it is
uncertain what might have been the result of the conflict of his
feelings had not his thoughts been diverted by the bustle of departure
new scenes new pleasures and new companions soon dissipated his
self-reproach and stifled his tenderness yet amidst the stir of camps
the revelries of garrisons the array of armies and even the din of
battles his thoughts would sometimes steal back to the scenes of rural
quiet and village simplicity the white cottage the footpath along
the silver brook and up the hawthorn hedge and the little village maid
loitering along it leaning on his arm and listening to him with eyes
beaming with unconscious affection

the shock which the poor girl had received in the destruction of all her
ideal world had indeed been cruel faintings and hysterics had at first
shaken her tender frame and were succeeded by a settled and pining
melancholy she had beheld from her window the march of the departing
troops she had seen her faithless lover borne off as if in triumph
amidst the sound of drum and trumpet and the pomp of arms she strained
a last aching gaze after him as the morning sun glittered about his
figure and his plume waved in the breeze he passed away like a bright
vision from her sight and left her all in darkness

it would be trite to dwell on the particulars of her after story it
was like other tales of love melancholy she avoided society and
wandered out alone in the walks she had most frequented with her lover
she sought like the stricken deer to weep in silence and loneliness
and brood over the barbed sorrow that rankled in her soul sometimes
she would be seen late of an evening sitting in the porch of the village
church and the milk-maids returning from the fields would now and
then overhear her singing some plaintive ditty in the hawthorn walk she
became fervent in her devotions at church and as the old people saw her
approach so wasted away yet with a hectic gloom and that hallowed air
which melancholy diffuses round the form they would make way for her as
for something spiritual and looking after her would shake their heads
in gloomy foreboding

she felt a conviction that she was hastening to the tomb but looked
forward to it as a place of rest the silver cord that had bound her to
existence was loosed and there seemed to be no more pleasure under the
sun if ever her gentle bosom had entertained resentment against her
lover it was extinguished she was incapable of angry passions and in
a moment of saddened tenderness she penned him a farewell letter it was
couched in the simplest language but touching from its very simplicity
she told him that she was dying and did not conceal from him that his
conduct was the cause she even depicted the sufferings which she had
experienced but concluded with saying that she could not die in peace
until she had sent him her forgiveness and her blessing

by degrees her strength declined that she could no longer leave the
cottage she could only totter to the window where propped up in
her chair it was her enjoyment to sit all day and look out upon the
landscape still she uttered no complaint nor imparted to any one the
malady that was preying on her heart she never even mentioned her
lover's name but would lay her head on her mother's bosom and weep in
silence her poor parents hung in mute anxiety over this fading blossom
of their hopes still flattering themselves that it might again revive
to freshness and that the bright unearthly bloom which sometimes flushed
her cheek might be the promise of returning health

in this way she was seated between them one sunday afternoon her hands
were clasped in theirs the lattice was thrown open and the soft
air that stole in brought with it the fragrance of the clustering
honeysuckle which her own hands had trained round the window

her father had just been reading a chapter in the bible it spoke of the
vanity of worldly things and of the joys of heaven it seemed to have
diffused comfort and serenity through her bosom her eye was fixed on
the distant village church the bell had tolled for the evening service
the last villager was lagging into the porch and everything had sunk
into that hallowed stillness peculiar to the day of rest her parents
were gazing on her with yearning hearts sickness and sorrow which
pass so roughly over some faces had given to hers the expression of a
seraph's a tear trembled in her soft blue eye was she thinking of
her faithless lover or were her thoughts wandering to that distant
churchyard into whose bosom she might soon be gathered

suddenly the clang of hoofs was heard a horseman galloped to the
cottage he dismounted before the window the poor girl gave a faint
exclamation and sunk back in her chair it was her repentant lover he
rushed into the house and flew to clasp her to his bosom but her
wasted form her deathlike countenance so wan yet so lovely in its
desolation smote him to the soul and he threw himself in agony at her
feet she was too faint to rise she attempted to extend her trembling
hand her lips moved as if she spoke but no word was articulated she
looked down upon him with a smile of unutterable tenderness and closed
her eyes forever

such are the particulars which i gathered of this village story they
are but scanty and i am conscious have little novelty to recommend
them in the present rage also for strange incident and high-seasoned
narrative they may appear trite and insignificant but they interested
me strongly at the time and taken in connection with the affecting
ceremony which i had just witnessed left a deeper impression on my mind
than many circumstances of a more striking nature i have passed through
the place since and visited the church again from a better motive than
mere curiosity it was a wintry evening the trees were stripped of
their foliage the churchyard looked naked and mournful and the wind
rustled coldly through the dry grass evergreens however had been
planted about the grave of the village favorite and osiers were bent
over it to keep the turf uninjured

the church-door was open and i stepped in there hung the chaplet of
flowers and the gloves as on the day of the funeral the flowers were
withered it is true but care seemed to have been taken that no dust
should soil their whiteness i have seen many monuments where art has
exhausted its powers to awaken the sympathy of the spectator but i have
met with none that spoke more touchingly to my heart than this simple
but delicate memento of departed innocence




the angler

 this day dame nature seem'd in love
 the lusty sap began to move
 fresh juice did stir th embracing vines
 and birds had drawn their valentines
 the jealous trout that low did lie
 rose at a well-dissembled flie
 there stood my friend with patient skill
 attending of his trembling quill
 sir h wotton

it is said that many an unlucky urchin is induced to run away from his
family and betake himself to a seafaring life from reading the history
of robinson crusoe and i suspect that in like manner many of those
worthy gentlemen who are given to haunt the sides of pastoral streams
with angle-rods in hand may trace the origin of their passion to
the seductive pages of honest izaak walton i recollect studying his
complete angler several years since in company with a knot of friends
in america and moreover that we were all completely bitten with the
angling mania it was early in the year but as soon as the weather was
auspicious and that the spring began to melt into the verge of summer
we took rod in hand and sallied into the country as stark mad as was
ever don quixote from reading books of chivalry

one of our party had equalled the don in the fulness of his equipments
being attired cap-a-pie for the enterprise he wore a broad-skirted
fustian coat perplexed with half a hundred pockets a pair of stout
shoes and leathern gaiters a basket slung on one side for fish a
patent rod a landing net and a score of other inconveniences only to
be found in the true angler's armory thus harnessed for the field he
was as great a matter of stare and wonderment among the country folk
who had never seen a regular angler as was the steel-clad hero of la
mancha among the goatherds of the sierra morena

our first essay was along a mountain brook among the highlands of the
hudson a most unfortunate place for the execution of those piscatory
tactics which had been invented along the velvet margins of quiet
english rivulets it was one of those wild streams that lavish among
our romantic solitudes unheeded beauties enough to fill the sketch-book
of a hunter of the picturesque sometimes it would leap down rocky
shelves making small cascades over which the trees threw their broad
balancing sprays and long nameless weeds hung in fringes from the
impending banks dripping with diamond drops sometimes it would brawl
and fret along a ravine in the matted shade of a forest filling it with
murmurs and after this termagant career would steal forth into open
day with the most placid demure face imaginable as i have seen some
pestilent shrew of a housewife after filling her home with uproar
and ill-humor come dimpling out of doors swimming and curtseying and
smiling upon all the world

how smoothly would this vagrant brook glide at such times through some
bosom of green meadowland among the mountains where the quiet was only
interrupted by the occasional tinkling of a bell from the lazy cattle
among the clover or the sound of a woodcutter's axe from the neighboring
forest

for my part i was always a bungler at all kinds of sport that required
either patience or adroitness and had not angled above half an hour
before i had completely satisfied the sentiment and convinced myself
of the truth of izaak walton's opinion that angling is something like
poetry a man must be born to it i hooked myself instead of the fish
tangled my line in every tree lost my bait broke my rod until i gave
up the attempt in despair and passed the day under the trees reading
old izaak satisfied that it was his fascinating vein of honest
simplicity and rural feeling that had bewitched me and not the passion
for angling my companions however were more persevering in their
delusion i have them at this moment before eyes stealing along the
border of the brook where it lay open to the day or was merely fringed
by shrubs and bushes i see the bittern rising with hollow scream as
they break in upon his rarely-invaded haunt the kingfisher watching
them suspiciously from his dry tree that overhangs the deep black
millpond in the gorge of the hills the tortoise letting himself slip
sideways from off the stone or log on which he is sunning himself
and the panic-struck frog plumping in headlong as they approach and
spreading an alarm throughout the watery world around

i recollect also that after toiling and watching and creeping about for
the greater part of a day with scarcely any success in spite of all our
admirable apparatus a lubberly country urchin came down from the hills
with a rod made from a branch of a tree a few yards of twine and as
heaven shall help me i believe a crooked pin for a hook baited with a
vile earthworm and in half an hour caught more fish than we had nibbles
throughout the day

but above all i recollect the good honest wholesome hungry repast
which we made under a beech tree just by a spring of pure sweet water
that stole out of the side of a hill and how when it was over one of
the party read old izaak walton's scene with the milkmaid while i lay
on the grass and built castles in a bright pile of clouds until i fell
asleep all this may appear like mere egotism yet i cannot refrain from
uttering these recollections which are passing like a strain of music
over my mind and have been called up by an agreeable scene which i
witnessed not long since

in the morning's stroll along the banks of the alun a beautiful little
stream which flows down from the welsh hills and throws itself into
the dee my attention was attracted to a group seated on the margin
on approaching i found it to consist of a veteran angler and two rustic
disciples the former was an old fellow with a wooden leg with clothes
very much but very carefully patched betokening poverty honestly come
by and decently maintained his face bore the marks of former storms
but present fair weather its furrows had been worn into an habitual
smile his iron-gray locks hung about his ears and he had altogether
the good-humored air of a constitutional philosopher who was disposed to
take the world as it went one of his companions was a ragged wight with
the skulking look of an arrant poacher and i'll warrant could find
his way to any gentleman's fish-pond in the neighborhood in the darkest
night the other was a tall awkward country lad with a lounging
gait and apparently somewhat of a rustic beau the old man was busy in
examining the maw of a trout which he had just killed to discover by
its contents what insects were seasonable for bait and was lecturing
on the subject to his companions who appeared to listen with infinite
deference i have a kind feeling towards all brothers of the angle
ever since i read izaak walton they are men he affirms of a mild
sweet and peaceable spirit and my esteem for them has been increased
since i met with an old tretyse of fishing with the angle in which are
set forth many of the maxims of their inoffensive fraternity take
good hede sayeth this honest little tretyse that in going about your
disportes ye open no man's gates but that ye shet them again also ye
shall not use this forsayd crafti disport for no covetousness to the
encreasing and sparing of your money only but principally for your
solace and to cause the helth of your body and specyally of your
soule

i thought that i could perceive in the veteran angler before me
an exemplification of what i had read and there was a cheerful
contentedness in his looks that quite drew me towards him i could not
but remark the gallant manner in which he stumped from one part of
the brook to another waving his rod in the air to keep the line from
dragging on the ground or catching among the bushes and the adroitness
with which he would throw his fly to any particular place sometimes
skimming it lightly along a little rapid sometimes casting it into one
of those dark holes made by a twisted root or overhanging bank in
which the large trout are apt to lurk in the meanwhile he was giving
instructions to his two disciples showing them the manner in which
they should handle their rods fix their flies and play them along the
surface of the stream the scene brought to my mind the instructions
of the sage piscator to his scholar the country around was of that
pastoral kind which walton is fond of describing it was a part of the
great plain of cheshire close by the beautiful vale of gessford
and just where the inferior welsh hills begin to swell up from among
fresh-smelling meadows the day too like that recorded in his work was
mild and sunshiny with now and then a soft-dropping shower that sowed
the whole earth with diamonds


 from this same treatise it would appear that angling is a
 more industrious and devout employment than it is generally
 considered for when ye purpose to go on your disportes in
 fishynge ye will not desyre greatlye many persons with you
 which might let you of your game and that ye may serve god
 devoutly in saying effectually your customable prayers and
 thus doying ye shall eschew and also avoyde many vices as
 ydelness which is principall cause to induce man to many
 other vices as it is right well known


i soon fell into conversation with the old angler and was so much
entertained that under pretext of receiving instructions in his art i
kept company with him almost the whole day wandering along the banks of
the stream and listening to his talk he was very communicative having
all the easy garrulity of cheerful old age and i fancy was a little
flattered by having an opportunity of displaying his piscatory lore for
who does not like now and then to play the sage

he had been much of a rambler in his day and had passed some years of
his youth in america particularly in savannah where he had entered
into trade and had been ruined by the indiscretion of a partner he had
afterwards experienced many ups and downs in life until he got into the
navy where his leg was carried away by a cannon-ball at the battle of
camperdown this was the only stroke of real good-fortune he had ever
experienced for it got him a pension which together with some small
paternal property brought him in a revenue of nearly forty pounds
on this he retired to his native village where he lived quietly and
independently and devoted the remainder of his life to the noble art
of angling

i found that he had read izaak walton attentively and he seemed to have
imbibed all his simple frankness and prevalent good-humor though he had
been sorely buffeted about the world he was satisfied that the world
in itself was good and beautiful though he had been as roughly used in
different countries as a poor sheep that is fleeced by every hedge
and thicket yet he spoke of every nation with candor and kindness
appearing to look only on the good side of things and above all he
was almost the only man i had ever met with who had been an unfortunate
adventurer in america and had honesty and magnanimity enough to take the
fault to his own door and not to curse the country the lad that was
receiving his instructions i learnt was the son and heir-apparent of
a fat old widow who kept the village inn and of course a youth of some
expectation and much courted by the idle gentleman-like personages
of the place in taking him under his care therefore the old man had
probably an eye to a privileged corner in the tap-room and an occasional
cup of cheerful ale free of expense

there is certainly something in angling if we could forget which
anglers are apt to do the cruelties and tortures inflicted on worms
and insects that tends to produce a gentleness of spirit and a
pure serenity of mind as the english are methodical even in their
recreations and are the most scientific of sportsmen it has been
reduced among them to perfect rule and system indeed it is an
amusement peculiarly adapted to the mild and highly-cultivated scenery
of england where every roughness has been softened away from the
landscape it is delightful to saunter along those limpid streams
which wander like veins of silver through the bosom of this
beautiful country leading one through a diversity of small home
scenery sometimes winding through ornamented grounds sometimes
brimming along through rich pasturage where the fresh green is mingled
with sweet-smelling flowers sometimes venturing in sight of villages
and hamlets and then running capriciously away into shady retirements
the sweetness and serenity of nature and the quiet watchfulness of the
sport gradually bring on pleasant fits of musing which are now and then
agreeably interrupted by the song of a bird the distant whistle of the
peasant or perhaps the vagary of some fish leaping out of the still
water and skimming transiently about its glassy surface when i would
beget content says izaak walton and increase confidence in the power
and wisdom and providence of almighty god i will walk the meadows by
some gliding stream and there contemplate the lilies that take no care
and those very many other little living creatures that are not only
created but fed man knows not how by the goodness of the god of
nature and therefore trust in him

i cannot forbear to give another quotation from one of those ancient
champions of angling which breathes the same innocent and happy spirit

 let me live harmlessly and near the brink
 of trent or avon have a dwelling-place
 where i may see my quill or cork down sink
 with eager bite of pike or bleak or dace
 and on the world and my creator think
 whilst some men strive ill-gotten goods t embrace
 and others spend their time in base excess
 of wine or worse in war or wantonness

 let them that will these pastimes still pursue
 and on such pleasing fancies feed their fill
 so i the fields and meadows green may view
 and daily by fresh rivers walk at will
 among the daisies and the violets blue
 red hyacinth and yellow daffodil

on parting with the old angler i inquired after his place of abode
and happening to be in the neighborhood of the village a few evenings
afterwards i had the curiosity to seek him out i found him living in
a small cottage containing only one room but a perfect curiosity in its
method and arrangement it was on the skirts of the village on a green
bank a little back from the road with a small garden in front stocked
with kitchen herbs and adorned with a few flowers the whole front of
the cottage was overrun with a honeysuckle on the top was a ship for a
weathercock the interior was fitted up in a truly nautical style his
ideas of comfort and convenience having been acquired on the berth-deck
of a man-of-war a hammock was slung from the ceiling which in the
daytime was lashed up so as to take but little room from the centre of
the chamber hung a model of a ship of his own workmanship two or three
chairs a table and a large sea-chest formed the principal movables
about the wall were stuck up naval ballads such as admiral hosier's
ghost all in the downs and tom bowling intermingled with
pictures of sea-fights among which the battle of camperdown held a
distinguished place the mantelpiece was decorated with sea-shells over
which hung a quadrant flanked by two wood-cuts of most bitter-looking
naval commanders his implements for angling were carefully disposed
on nails and hooks about the room on a shelf was arranged his library
containing a work on angling much worn a bible covered with canvas an
odd volume or two of voyages a nautical almanac and a book of songs


 j davors


his family consisted of a large black cat with one eye and a parrot
which he had caught and tamed and educated himself in the course of
one of his voyages and which uttered a variety of sea-phrases with the
hoarse brattling tone of a veteran boatswain the establishment reminded
me of that of the renowned robinson crusoe it was kept in neat order
everything being stowed away with the regularity of a ship of war
and he informed me that he scoured the deck every morning and swept it
between meals

i found him seated on a bench before the door smoking his pipe in the
soft evening sunshine his cat was purring soberly on the threshold and
his parrot describing some strange evolutions in an iron ring that swung
in the centre of his cage he had been angling all day and gave me a
history of his sport with as much minuteness as a general would talk
over a campaign being particularly animated in relating the manner in
which he had taken a large trout which had completely tasked all his
skill and wariness and which he had sent as a trophy to mine hostess of
the inn

how comforting it is to see a cheerful and contented old age and to
behold a poor fellow like this after being tempest-tost through life
safely moored in a snug and quiet harbor in the evening of his days his
happiness however sprung from within himself and was independent of
external circumstances for he had that inexhaustible good-nature which
is the most precious gift of heaven spreading itself like oil over the
troubled sea of thought and keeping the mind smooth and equable in the
roughest weather

on inquiring further about him i learnt that he was a universal
favorite in the village and the oracle of the tap-room where he
delighted the rustics with his songs and like sindbad astonished them
with his stories of strange lands and shipwrecks and sea-fights he was
much noticed too by gentlemen sportsmen of the neighborhood had taught
several of them the art of angling and was a privileged visitor to
their kitchens the whole tenor of his life was quiet and inoffensive
being principally passed about the neighboring streams when the weather
and season were favorable and at other times he employed himself
at home preparing his fishing-tackle for the next campaign or
manufacturing rods nets and flies for his patrons and pupils among the
gentry

he was a regular attendant at church on sundays though he generally
fell asleep during the sermon he had made it his particular request
that when he died he should be buried in a green spot which he could see
from his seat in church and which he had marked out ever since he was
a boy and had thought of when far from home on the raging sea in danger
of being food for the fishes it was the spot where his father and
mother had been buried

i have done for i fear that my reader is growing weary but i could not
refrain from drawing the picture of this worthy brother of the angle
who has made me more than ever in love with the theory though i fear i
shall never be adroit in the practice of his art and i will conclude
this rambling sketch in the words of honest izaak walton by craving the
blessing of st peter's master upon my reader and upon all that are
true lovers of virtue and dare trust in his providence and be quiet
and go a-angling




the legend of sleepy hollow

found among the papers of the late diedrich knickerbocker

 a pleasing land of drowsy-head it was
 of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye
 and of gay castles in the clouds that pays
 for ever flushing round a summer sky
 castle of indolence

in the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern
shore of the hudson at that broad expansion of the river denominated
by the ancient dutch navigators the tappan zee and where they always
prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of st nicholas
when they crossed there lies a small market-town or rural port which
by some is called greensburg but which is more generally and properly
known by the name of tarry town this name was given we are told in
former days by the good housewives of the adjacent country from the
inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village
tavern on market days be that as it may i do not vouch for the fact
but merely advert to it for the sake of being precise and authentic
not far from this village perhaps about two miles there is a little
valley or rather lap of land among high hills which is one of the
quietest places in the whole world a small brook glides through it
with just murmur enough to lull one to repose and the occasional
whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound
that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity

i recollect that when a stripling my first exploit in squirrel-shooting
was in a grove of tall walnut trees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet
and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath
stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
if ever i should wish for a retreat whither i might steal from the world
and its distractions and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled
life i know of none more promising than this little valley

from the listless repose of the place and the peculiar character of its
inhabitants who are descendants from the original dutch settlers this
sequestered glen has long been known by the name of sleepy hollow and
its rustic lads are called the sleepy hollow boys throughout all the
neighboring country a drowsy dreamy influence seems to hang over the
land and to pervade the very atmosphere some say that the place
was bewitched by a high german doctor during the early days of the
settlement others that an old indian chief the prophet or wizard of
his tribe held his powwows there before the country was discovered by
master hendrick hudson certain it is the place still continues under
the sway of some witching power that holds a spell over the minds of the
good people causing them to walk in a continual reverie they are given
to all kinds of marvellous beliefs are subject to trances and visions
and frequently see strange sights and hear music and voices in the air
the whole neighborhood abounds with local tales haunted spots and
twilight superstitions stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the
valley than in any other part of the country and the nightmare with
her whole ninefold seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols

the dominant spirit however that haunts this enchanted region and
seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air is the
apparition of a figure on horseback without a head it is said by some
to be the ghost of a hessian trooper whose head had been carried away by
a cannonball in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war and
who is ever and anon seen by the country-folk hurrying along in the
gloom of night as if on the wings of the wind his haunts are not
confined to the valley but extend at times to the adjacent roads and
especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance indeed
certain of the most authentic historians of those parts who have been
careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this
spectre allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in
the churchyard the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly
quest of his head and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes
passes along the hollow like a midnight blast is owing to his being
belated and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak

such is the general purport of this legendary superstition which has
furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows
and the spectre is known at all the country firesides by the name of the
headless horseman of sleepy hollow

it is remarkable that the visionary propensity i have mentioned is not
confined to the native inhabitants of the valley but is unconsciously
imbibed by every one who resides there for a time however wide awake
they may have been before they entered that sleepy region they are sure
in a little time to inhale the witching influence of the air and begin
to grow imaginative to dream dreams and see apparitions

i mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud for it is in such
little retired dutch valleys found here and there embosomed in the
great state of new york that population manners and customs remain
fixed while the great torrent of migration and improvement which is
making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country
sweeps by them unobserved they are like those little nooks of still
water which border a rapid stream where we may see the straw and bubble
riding quietly at anchor or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor
undisturbed by the rush of the passing current though many years have
elapsed since i trod the drowsy shades of sleepy hollow yet i question
whether i should not still find the same trees and the same families
vegetating in its sheltered bosom

in this by-place of nature there abode in a remote period of american
history that is to say some thirty years since a worthy wight of the
name of ichabod crane who sojourned or as he expressed it tarried
in sleepy hollow for the purpose of instructing the children of the
vicinity he was a native of connecticut a state which supplies the
union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest and sends
forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters
the cognomen of crane was not inapplicable to his person he was tall
but exceedingly lank with narrow shoulders long arms and legs hands
that dangled a mile out of his sleeves feet that might have served for
shovels and his whole frame most loosely hung together his head was
small and flat at top with huge ears large green glassy eyes and a
long snip nose so that it looked like a weathercock perched upon his
spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew to see him striding along
the profile of a hill on a windy day with his clothes bagging and
fluttering about him one might have mistaken him for the genius
of famine descending upon the earth or some scarecrow eloped from a
cornfield

his school-house was a low building of one large room rudely
constructed of logs the windows partly glazed and partly patched with
leaves of old copybooks it was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours
by a withe twisted in the handle of the door and stakes set against the
window-shutters so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease
he would find some embarrassment in getting out -an idea most probably
borrowed by the architect yost van houten from the mystery of
an eel-pot the school-house stood in a rather lonely but pleasant
situation just at the foot of a woody hill with a brook running close
by and a formidable birch tree growing at one end of it from hence the
low murmur of his pupils voices conning over their lessons might be
heard in a drowsy summer's day like the hum of a bee-hive interrupted
now and then by the authoritative voice of the master in the tone of
menace or command or peradventure by the appalling sound of the birch
as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge
truth to say he was a conscientious man and ever bore in mind the
golden maxim spare the rod and spoil the child ichabod crane's
scholars certainly were not spoiled

i would not have it imagined however that he was one of those cruel
potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects on
the contrary he administered justice with discrimination rather than
severity taking the burden off the backs of the weak and laying it on
those of the strong your mere puny stripling that winced at the least
flourish of the rod was passed by with indulgence but the claims of
justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little
tough wrong-headed broad-skirted dutch urchin who sulked and swelled
and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch all this he called doing
his duty by their parents and he never inflicted a chastisement
without following it by the assurance so consolatory to the smarting
urchin that he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day
he had to live

when school-hours were over he was even the companion and playmate of
the larger boys and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the
smaller ones home who happened to have pretty sisters or good housewives
for mothers noted for the comforts of the cupboard indeed it behooved
him to keep on good terms with his pupils the revenue arising from his
school was small and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him
with daily bread for he was a huge feeder and though lank had the
dilating powers of an anaconda but to help out his maintenance he was
according to country custom in those parts boarded and lodged at the
houses of the farmers whose children he instructed with these he lived
successively a week at a time thus going the rounds of the neighborhood
with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief

that all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic
patrons who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous
burden and schoolmasters as mere drones he had various ways of
rendering himself both useful and agreeable he assisted the farmers
occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms helped to make
hay mended the fences took the horses to water drove the cows from
pasture and cut wood for the winter fire he laid aside too all the
dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little
empire the school and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating
he found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children
particularly the youngest and like the lion bold which whilom so
magnanimously the lamb did hold he would sit with a child on one knee
and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together

in addition to his other vocations he was the singing-master of the
neighborhood and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the
young folks in psalmody it was a matter of no little vanity to him on
sundays to take his station in front of the church-gallery with a band
of chosen singers where in his own mind he completely carried away
the palm from the parson certain it is his voice resounded far above
all the rest of the congregation and there are peculiar quavers still
to be heard in that church and which may even be heard half a mile off
quite to the opposite side of the mill-pond on a still sunday morning
which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of ichabod
crane thus by divers little makeshifts in that ingenious way which is
commonly denominated by hook and by crook the worthy pedagogue got on
tolerably enough and was thought by all who understood nothing of the
labor of headwork to have a wonderfully easy life of it

the schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female
circle of a rural neighborhood being considered a kind of idle
gentleman-like personage of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to
the rough country swains and indeed inferior in learning only to the
parson his appearance therefore is apt to occasion some little stir
at the tea-table of a farmhouse and the addition of a supernumerary
dish of cakes or sweetmeats or peradventure the parade of a silver
tea-pot our man of letters therefore was peculiarly happy in the
smiles of all the country damsels how he would figure among them in the
churchyard between services on sundays gathering grapes for them from
the wild vines that overrun the surrounding trees reciting for their
amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones or sauntering with a
whole bevy of them along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond while the
more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back envying his superior
elegance and address

from his half-itinerant life also he was a kind of travelling gazette
carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house so that
his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction he was moreover
esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition for he had read
several books quite through and was a perfect master of cotton mather's
history of new england witchcraft in which by the way he most firmly
and potently believed

he was in fact an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple
credulity his appetite for the marvellous and his powers of digesting
it were equally extraordinary and both had been increased by his
residence in this spellbound region no tale was too gross or monstrous
for his capacious swallow it was often his delight after his school
was dismissed in the afternoon to stretch himself on the rich bed of
clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his school-house
and there con over old mather's direful tales until the gathering dusk
of the evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes then
as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland to the
farmhouse where he happened to be quartered every sound of nature at
that witching hour fluttered his excited imagination the moan of the
whip-poor-will from the hillside the boding cry of the tree-toad that
harbinger of storm the dreary hooting of the screech-owl or the
sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost the
fire-flies too which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places now
and then startled him as one of uncommon brightness would stream across
his path and if by chance a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging
his blundering flight against him the poor varlet was ready to give up
the ghost with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token his
only resource on such occasions either to drown thought or drive away
evil spirits was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of sleepy
hollow as they sat by their doors of an evening were often filled with
awe at hearing his nasal melody in linked sweetness long drawn out
floating from the distant hill or along the dusky road


 the whip-poor-will is a bird which is only heard at night
 it receives its name from its note which is thought to
 resemble those words


another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter
evenings with the old dutch wives as they sat spinning by the fire with
a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth and listen
to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins and haunted fields
and haunted brooks and haunted bridges and haunted houses and
particularly of the headless horseman or galloping hessian of the
hollow as they sometimes called him he would delight them equally
by his anecdotes of witchcraft and of the direful omens and portentous
sights and sounds in the air which prevailed in the earlier times of
connecticut and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon
comets and shooting stars and with the alarming fact that the world did
absolutely turn round and that they were half the time topsy-turvy

but if there was a pleasure in all this while snugly cuddling in the
chimney-corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the
crackling wood-fire and where of course no spectre dared to show
its face it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk
homewards what fearful shapes and shadows beset his path amidst the dim
and ghastly glare of a snowy night with what wistful look did be eye
every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some
distant window how often was he appalled by some shrub covered with
snow which like a sheeted spectre beset his very path how often did
he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty
crust beneath his feet and dread to look over his shoulder lest he
should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him and how
often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast howling
among the trees in the idea that it was the galloping hessian on one of
his nightly scourings

all these however were mere terrors of the night phantoms of the mind
that walk in darkness and though he had seen many spectres in his time
and been more than once beset by satan in divers shapes in his lonely
perambulations yet daylight put an end to all these evils and he would
have passed a pleasant life of it in despite of the devil and all his
works if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more
perplexity to mortal man than ghosts goblins and the whole race of
witches put together and that was a woman

among the musical disciples who assembled one evening in each week
to receive his instructions in psalmody was katrina van tassel the
daughter and only child of a substantial dutch farmer she was a
blooming lass of fresh eighteen plump as a partridge ripe and melting
and rosy-cheeked as one of her father's peaches and universally famed
not merely for her beauty but her vast expectations she was withal a
little of a coquette as might be perceived even in her dress which was
a mixture of ancient and modern fashions as most suited to set off
her charms she wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold which her
great-great-grandmother had brought over from saardam the tempting
stomacher of the olden time and withal a provokingly short petticoat to
display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round

ichabod crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex and it is
not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his
eyes more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion
old baltus van tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving contented
liberal-hearted farmer he seldom it is true sent either his eyes or
his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm but within those
everything was snug happy and well-conditioned he was satisfied
with his wealth but not proud of it and piqued himself upon the hearty
abundance rather than the style in which he lived his stronghold was
situated on the banks of the hudson in one of those green sheltered
fertile nooks in which the dutch farmers are so fond of nestling a
great elm tree spread its broad branches over it at the foot of which
bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water in a little well
formed of a barrel and then stole sparkling away through the grass to
a neighboring brook that bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows
hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn that might have served for a
church every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the
treasures of the farm the flail was busily resounding within it from
morning to night swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the
eaves and rows of pigeons some with one eye turned up as if watching
the weather some with their heads under their wings or buried in their
bosoms and others swelling and cooing and bowing about their dames
were enjoying the sunshine on the roof sleek unwieldy porkers were
grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens whence sallied
forth now and then troops of sucking pigs as if to snuff the air
a stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond
convoying whole fleets of ducks regiments of turkeys were gobbling
through the farmyard and guinea-fowls fretting about it like
ill-tempered housewives with their peevish discontented cry before
the barn-door strutted the gallant cock that pattern of a husband a
warrior and a fine gentleman clapping his burnished wings and crowing
in the pride and gladness of his heart sometimes tearing up the earth
with his feet and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of
wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered

the pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise
of luxurious winter fare in his devouring mind's eye he pictured to
himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly
and an apple in his mouth the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a
comfortable pie and tucked in with a coverlet of crust the geese were
swimming in their own gravy and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes
like snug married couples with a decent competency of onion sauce in
the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon and juicy
relishing ham not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up with
its gizzard under its wing and peradventure a necklace of savory
sausages and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back
in a side-dish with uplifted claws as if craving that quarter which
his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living

as the enraptured ichabod fancied all this and as he rolled his great
green eyes over the fat meadow-lands the rich fields of wheat of rye
of buckwheat and indian corn and the orchards burdened with ruddy
fruit which surrounded the warm tenement of van tassel his heart
yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains and his
imagination expanded with the idea how they might be readily turned into
cash and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land and shingle
palaces in the wilderness nay his busy fancy already realized his
hopes and presented to him the blooming katrina with a whole family of
children mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery
with pots and kettles dangling beneath and he beheld himself bestriding
a pacing mare with a colt at her heels setting out for kentucky
tennessee or the lord knows where

when he entered the house the conquest of his heart was complete it
was one of those spacious farmhouses with high-ridged but lowly-sloping
roofs built in the style handed down from the first dutch settlers the
low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front capable of being
closed up in bad weather under this were hung flails harness various
utensils of husbandry and nets for fishing in the neighboring
river benches were built along the sides for summer use and a great
spinning-wheel at one end and a churn at the other showed the various
uses to which this important porch might be devoted from this piazza
the wondering ichabod entered the hall which formed the centre of
the mansion and the place of usual residence here rows of resplendent
pewter ranged on a long dresser dazzled his eyes in one corner
stood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun in another a quantity of
linsey-woolsey just from the loom ears of indian corn and strings of
dried apples and peaches hung in gay festoons along the walls mingled
with the gaud of red peppers and a door left ajar gave him a peep into
the best parlor where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables
shone like mirrors andirons with their accompanying shovel and
tongs glistened from their covert of asparagus tops mock-oranges
and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece strings of various-colored
birds eggs were suspended above it a great ostrich egg was hung from
the centre of the room and a corner cupboard knowingly left open
displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china

from the moment ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight the
peace of his mind was at an end and his only study was how to gain the
affections of the peerless daughter of van tassel in this enterprise
however he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of
a knight-errant of yore who seldom had anything but giants enchanters
fiery dragons and such-like easily-conquered adversaries to contend
with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass
and walls of adamant to the castle keep where the lady of his heart was
confined all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way
to the centre of a christmas pie and then the lady gave him her hand as
a matter of course ichabod on the contrary had to win his way to
the heart of a country coquette beset with a labyrinth of whims
and caprices which were forever presenting new difficulties and
impediments and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries
of real flesh and blood the numerous rustic admirers who beset every
portal to her heart keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other
but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor

among these the most formidable was a burly roaring roistering
blade of the name of abraham or according to the dutch abbreviation
brom van brunt the hero of the country round which rang with
his feats of strength and hardihood he was broad-shouldered and
double-jointed with short curly black hair and a bluff but not
unpleasant countenance having a mingled air of fun and arrogance
from his herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the
nickname of brom bones by which he was universally known he was famed
for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship being as dexterous on
horseback as a tartar he was foremost at all races and cockfights and
with the ascendancy which bodily strength acquires in rustic life was
the umpire in all disputes setting his hat on one side and giving his
decisions with an air and tone admitting of no gainsay or appeal he was
always ready for either a fight or a frolic but had more mischief than
ill-will in his composition and with all his overbearing roughness
there was a strong dash of waggish good-humor at bottom he had three or
four boon companions who regarded him as their model and at the head of
whom he scoured the country attending every scene of feud or merriment
for miles around in cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap
surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail and when the folks at a country
gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance whisking
about among a squad of hard riders they always stood by for a squall
sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farm-houses at
midnight with whoop and halloo like a troop of don cossacks and the
old dames startled out of their sleep would listen for a moment till
the hurry-scurry had clattered by and then exclaim ay there goes
brom bones and his gang the neighbors looked upon him with a mixture
of awe admiration and good-will and when any madcap prank or rustic
brawl occurred in the vicinity always shook their heads and warranted
brom bones was at the bottom of it

this rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming katrina
for the object of his uncouth gallantries and though his amorous
toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a
bear yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his
hopes certain it is his advances were signals for rival candidates to
retire who felt no inclination to cross a line in his amours insomuch
that when his horse was seen tied to van tassel's paling on a sunday
night a sure sign that his master was courting or as it is termed
sparking within all other suitors passed by in despair and carried
the war into other quarters

such was the formidable rival with whom ichabod crane had to contend
and considering all things a stouter man than he would have shrunk
from the competition and a wiser man would have despaired he had
however a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature
he was in form and spirit like a supple jack yielding but although
though he bent he never broke and though he bowed beneath the slightest
pressure yet the moment it was away jerk he was as erect and carried
his head as high as ever

to have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness
for he was not man to be thwarted in his amours any more than that
stormy lover achilles ichabod therefore made his advances in a
quiet and gently-insinuating manner under cover of his character of
singing-master he made frequent visits at the farm-house not that he
had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents
which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers balt van
tassel was an easy indulgent soul he loved his daughter better even
than his pipe and like a reasonable man and an excellent father let
her have her way in everything his notable little wife too had enough
to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry for as she
sagely observed ducks and geese are foolish things and must be looked
after but girls can take care of themselves thus while the busy dame
bustled about the house or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the
piazza honest balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other
watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior who armed with a
sword in each hand was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle
of the barn in the meantime ichabod would carry on his suit with the
daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm or sauntering
along in the twilight that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence

i profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won to me they
have always been matters of riddle and admiration some seem to have but
one vulnerable point or door of access while otheres have a thousand
avenues and may be captured in a thousand different ways it is a
great triumph of skill to gain the former but still greater proof
of generalship to maintain possession of the latter for the man must
battle for his fortress at every door and window he who wins a thousand
common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown but he who keeps
undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero certain
it is this was not the case with the redoubtable brom bones and from
the moment ichabod crane made his advances the interests of the former
evidently declined his horse was no longer seen tied at the palings
on sunday nights and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the
preceptor of sleepy hollow

brom who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature would fain have
carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions
to the lady according to the mode of those most concise and simple
reasoners the knights-errant of yore by single combat but ichabod was
too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists
against him he had overheard a boast of bones that he would double
the schoolmaster up and lay him on a shelf of his own school-house
and he was too wary to give him an opportunity there was something
extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system it left brom
no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his
disposition and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival
ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to bones and his gang
of rough riders they harried his hitherto peaceful domains smoked
out his singing school by stopping up the chimney broke into the
schoolhouse at night in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe
and window stakes and turned everything topsy-turvy so that the poor
schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their
meetings there but what was still more annoying brom took all
opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress
and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous
manner and introduced as a rival of ichabod's to instruct her in
psalmody

in this way matters went on for some time without producing any
material effect on the relative situation of the contending powers on
a fine autumnal afternoon ichabod in pensive mood sat enthroned on
the lofty stool whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little
literary realm in his hand he swayed a ferule that sceptre of despotic
power the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne a
constant terror to evildoers while on the desk before him might be
seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons detected upon
the persons of idle urchins such as half-munched apples popguns
whirligigs fly-cages and whole legions of rampant little paper
gamecocks apparently there had been some appalling act of justice
recently inflicted for his scholars were all busily intent upon their
books or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master
and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the school-room
it was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth
jacket and trowsers a round-crowned fragment of a hat like the cap of
mercury and mounted on the back of a ragged wild half-broken colt
which he managed with a rope by way of halter he came clattering up to
the school door with an invitation to ichabod to attend a merry-making
or quilting frolic to be held that evening at mynheer van tassel's
and having delivered his message with that air of importance and effort
at fine language which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of
the kind he dashed over the brook and was seen scampering away up the
hollow full of the importance and hurry of his mission

all was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet school-room the
scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles
those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity and those who
were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear to quicken
their speed or help them over a tall word books were flung aside
without being put away on the shelves inkstands were overturned
benches thrown down and the whole school was turned loose an hour
before the usual time bursting forth like a legion of young
imps yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early
emancipation

the gallant ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet
brushing and furbishing up his best and indeed only suit of rusty
black and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that
hung up in the school-house that he might make his appearance before
his mistress in the true style of a cavalier he borrowed a horse from
the farmer with whom he was domiciliated a choleric old dutchman of the
name of hans van ripper and thus gallantly mounted issued forth like
a knight-errant in quest of adventures but it is meet i should in
the true spirit of romantic story give some account of the looks
and equipments of my hero and his steed the animal he bestrode was a
broken-down plough-horse that had outlived almost everything but his
viciousness he was gaunt and shagged with a ewe neck and a head like a
hammer his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burrs one
eye had lost its pupil and was glaring and spectral but the other had
the gleam of a genuine devil in it still he must have had fire and
mettle in his day if we may judge from the name he bore of gunpowder
he had in fact been a favorite steed of his master's the choleric van
ripper who was a furious rider and had infused very probably some of
his own spirit into the animal for old and broken down as he looked
there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in
the country

ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed he rode with short
stirrups which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle
his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers he carried his whip
perpendicularly in his hand like a sceptre and as his horse jogged on
the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings a
small wool hat rested on the top of his nose for so his scanty strip of
forehead might be called and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out
almost to his horse's tail such was the appearance of ichabod and his
steed as they shambled out of the gate of hans van ripper and it was
altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad
daylight

it was as i have said a fine autumnal day the sky was clear and
serene and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always
associate with the idea of abundance the forests had put on their sober
brown and yellow while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped
by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange purple and scarlet
streaming files of wild-ducks began to make their appearance high in the
air the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech
and hickory nuts and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from
the neighboring stubble-field

the small birds were taking their farewell banquets in the fulness of
their revelry they fluttered chirping and frolicking from bush to bush
and tree to tree capricious from the very profusion and variety around
them there was the honest cock robin the favorite game of stripling
sportsmen with its loud querulous note and the twittering blackbirds
flying in sable clouds and the golden-winged woodpecker with his
crimson crest his broad black gorget and splendid plumage and the
cedar-bird with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little
monteiro cap of feathers and the blue jay that noisy coxcomb in his
gay light-blue coat and white under-clothes screaming and chattering
bobbing and nodding and bowing and pretending to be on good terms with
every songster of the grove

as ichabod jogged slowly on his way his eye ever open to every symptom
of culinary abundance ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly
autumn on all sides he beheld vast store of apples some hanging in
oppressive opulence on the trees some gathered into baskets and barrels
for the market others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press
farther on he beheld great fields of indian corn with its golden ears
peeping from their leafy coverts and holding out the promise of cakes
and hasty pudding and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them turning
up their fair round bellies to the sun and giving ample prospects
of the most luxurious of pies and anon he passed the fragrant
buckwheat-fields breathing the odor of the beehive and as he beheld
them soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks well
buttered and garnished with honey or treacle by the delicate little
dimpled hand of katrina van tassel

thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and sugared
suppositions he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which
look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty hudson the sun
gradually wheeled his broad disk down into the west the wide bosom of
the tappan zee lay motionless and glassy excepting that here and there
a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant
mountain a few amber clouds floated in the sky without a breath of air
to move them the horizon was of a fine golden tint changing gradually
into a pure apple green and from that into the deep blue of the
mid-heaven a slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the
precipices that overhung some parts of the river giving greater depth
to the dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides a sloop was loitering
in the distance dropping slowly down with the tide her sail hanging
uselessly against the mast and as the reflection of the sky gleamed
along the still water it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the
air

it was toward evening that ichabod arrived at the castle of the heer
van tassel which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the
adjacent country old farmers a spare leathern-faced race in homespun
coats and breeches blue stockings huge shoes and magnificent pewter
buckles their brisk withered little dames in close crimped caps
long-waisted shortgowns homespun petticoats with scissors and
pincushions and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside buxom lasses
almost as antiquated as their mothers excepting where a straw hat a
fine ribbon or perhaps a white frock gave symptoms of city innovation
the sons in short square-skirted coats with rows of stupendous brass
buttons and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times
especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose it being
esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener
of the hair

brom bones however was the hero of the scene having come to the
gathering on his favorite steed daredevil a creature like himself full
of metal and mischief and which no one but himself could manage he
was in fact noted for preferring vicious animals given to all kinds
of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck for he
held a tractable well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit

fain would i pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon
the enraptured gaze of my hero as he entered the state parlor of van
tassel's mansion not those of the bevy of buxom lasses with their
luxurious display of red and white but the ample charms of a genuine
dutch country tea-table in the sumptuous time of autumn such heaped-up
platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds known only
to experienced dutch housewives there was the doughty doughnut the
tenderer oily koek and the crisp and crumbling cruller sweet cakes
and short cakes ginger cakes and honey cakes and the whole family of
cakes and then there were apple pies and peach pies and pumpkin pies
besides slices of ham and smoked beef and moreover delectable dishes
of preserved plums and peaches and pears and quinces not to mention
broiled shad and roasted chickens together with bowls of milk and
cream all mingled higgledy-piggledy pretty much as i have enumerated
them with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the
midst heaven bless the mark i want breath and time to discuss this
banquet as it deserves and am too eager to get on with my story
happily ichabod crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian but
did ample justice to every dainty

he was a kind and thankful creature whose heart dilated in proportion
as his skin was filled with good cheer and whose spirits rose with
eating as some men's do with drink he could not help too rolling his
large eyes round him as he ate and chuckling with the possibility that
he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury
and splendor then he thought how soon he'd turn his back upon the old
school-house snap his fingers in the face of hans van ripper and every
other niggardly patron and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors
that should dare to call him comrade

old baltus van tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated
with content and good-humor round and jolly as the harvest moon his
hospitable attentions were brief but expressive being confined to a
shake of the hand a slap on the shoulder a loud laugh and a pressing
invitation to fall to and help themselves

and now the sound of the music from the common room or hall summoned
to the dance the musician was an old gray-headed negro who had been the
itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century
his instrument was as old and battered as himself the greater part of
the time he scraped on two or three strings accompanying every movement
of the bow with a motion of the head bowing almost to the ground and
stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start

ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal
powers not a limb not a fibre about him was idle and to have seen
his loosely hung frame in full motion and clattering about the room
you would have thought saint vitus himself that blessed patron of the
dance was figuring before you in person he was the admiration of all
the negroes who having gathered of all ages and sizes from the farm
and the neighborhood stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at
every door and window gazing with delight at the scene rolling their
white eyeballs and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear how
could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous the
lady of his heart was his partner in the dance and smiling graciously
in reply to all his amorous oglings while brom bones sorely smitten
with love and jealousy sat brooding by himself in one corner

when the dance was at an end ichabod was attracted to a knot of the
sager folks who with old van tassel sat smoking at one end of the
piazza gossiping over former times and drawing out long stories about
the war

this neighborhood at the time of which i am speaking was one of those
highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men
the british and american line had run near it during the war it had
therefore been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees
cow-boys and all kinds of border chivalry just sufficient time had
elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little
becoming fiction and in the indistinctness of his recollection to make
himself the hero of every exploit

there was the story of doffue martling a large blue-bearded dutchman
who had nearly taken a british frigate with an old iron nine-pounder
from a mud breastwork only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge
and there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless being too rich
a mynheer to be lightly mentioned who in the battle of whiteplains
being an excellent master of defence parried a musket-ball with a small
sword insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade and
glance off at the hilt in proof of which he was ready at any time to
show the sword with the hilt a little bent there were several more
that had been equally great in the field not one of whom but was
persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy
termination

but all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that
succeeded the neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the
kind local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered
long-settled retreats but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng
that forms the population of most of our country places besides there
is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages for they have
scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in
their graves before their surviving friends have travelled away from the
neighborhood so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds
they have no acquaintance left to call upon this is perhaps the reason
why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established dutch
communities

the immediate causes however of the prevalence of supernatural stories
in these parts was doubtless owing to the vicinity of sleepy hollow
there was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted
region it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting
all the land several of the sleepy hollow people were present at
van tassel's and as usual were doling out their wild and wonderful
legends many dismal tales were told about funeral trains and mourning
cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the
unfortunate major andre was taken and which stood in the neighborhood
some mention was made also of the woman in white that haunted the dark
glen at raven rock and was often heard to shriek on winter nights
before a storm having perished there in the snow the chief part of the
stories however turned upon the favorite spectre of sleepy hollow the
headless horseman who had been heard several times of late patrolling
the country and it was said tethered his horse nightly among the
graves in the churchyard

the sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a
favorite haunt of troubled spirits it stands on a knoll surrounded by
locust trees and lofty elms from among which its decent whitewashed
walls shine modestly forth like christian purity beaming through the
shades of retirement a gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet
of water bordered by high trees between which peeps may be caught at
the blue hills of the hudson to look upon its grass-grown yard where
the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly one would think that there at
least the dead might rest in peace on one side of the church extends a
wide woody dell along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and
trunks of fallen trees over a deep black part of the stream not far
from the church was formerly thrown a wooden bridge the road that led
to it and the bridge itself were thickly shaded by overhanging trees
which cast a gloom about it even in the daytime but occasioned a
fearful darkness at night such was one of the favorite haunts of
the headless horseman and the place where he was most frequently
encountered the tale was told of old brouwer a most heretical
disbeliever in ghosts how he met the horseman returning from his foray
into sleepy hollow and was obliged to get up behind him how they
galloped over bush and brake over hill and swamp until they reached
the bridge when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton threw old
brouwer into the brook and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap
of thunder

this story was immediately matched by a thrice-marvellous adventure of
brom bones who made light of the galloping hessian as an arrant jockey
he affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of
sing-sing he had been over taken by this midnight trooper that he had
offered to race with him for a bowl of punch and should have won it
too for daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow but just as they
came to the church bridge the hessian bolted and vanished in a flash of
fire

all these tales told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in
the dark the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving
a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe sank deep in the mind of
ichabod he repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable
author cotton mather and added many marvellous events that had taken
place in his native state of connecticut and fearful sights which he had
seen in his nightly walks about sleepy hollow

the revel now gradually broke up the old farmers gathered together
their families in their wagons and were heard for some time rattling
along the hollow roads and over the distant hills some of the
damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains and their
light-hearted laughter mingling with the clatter of hoofs echoed along
the silent woodlands sounding fainter and fainter until they gradually
died away and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and
deserted ichabod only lingered behind according to the custom of
country lovers to have a tete-a-tete with the heiress fully convinced
that he was now on the high road to success what passed at this
interview i will not pretend to say for in fact i do not know
something however i fear me must have gone wrong for he certainly
sallied forth after no very great interval with an air quite desolate
and chop-fallen oh these women these women could that girl have been
playing off any of her coquettish tricks was her encouragement of the
poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival
heaven only knows not i let it suffice to say ichabod stole forth
with the air of one who had been sacking a hen-roost rather than a fair
lady's heart without looking to the right or left to notice the scene
of rural wealth on which he had so often gloated he went straight to
the stable and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed
most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly
sleeping dreaming of mountains of corn and oats and whole valleys of
timothy and clover

it was the very witching time of night that ichabod heavy-hearted and
crestfallen pursued his travel homewards along the sides of the
lofty hills which rise above tarry town and which he had traversed so
cheerily in the afternoon the hour was as dismal as himself far below
him the tappan zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters with
here and there the tall mast of a sloop riding quietly at anchor under
the land in the dead hush of midnight he could even hear the barking of
the watch-dog from the opposite shore of the hudson but it was so vague
and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful
companion of man now and then too the long-drawn crowing of a cock
accidentally awakened would sound far far off from some farm-house
away among the hills but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear no
signs of life occurred near him but occasionally the melancholy chirp
of a cricket or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull-frog from a
neighboring marsh as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in
his bed

all the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon
now came crowding upon his recollection the night grew darker and
darker the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky and driving clouds
occasionally had them from his sight he had never felt so lonely and
dismal he was moreover approaching the very place where many of the
scenes of the ghost-stories had been laid in the centre of the road
stood an enormous tulip tree which towered like a giant above all the
other trees of the neighborhood and formed a kind of landmark its limbs
were gnarled and fantastic large enough to form trunks for ordinary
trees twisting down almost to the earth and rising again into the air
it was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate andre who
had been taken prisoner hard by and was universally known by the name
of major andre's tree the common people regarded it with a mixture of
respect and superstition partly out of sympathy for the fate of its
ill-starred namesake and partly from the tales of strange sights and
doleful lamentations told concerning it

as ichabod approached this fearful tree he began to whistle he thought
his whistle was answered it was but a blast sweeping sharply through
the dry branches as he approached a little nearer he thought he saw
something white hanging in the midst of the tree he paused and ceased
whistling but on looking more narrowly perceived that it was a place
where the tree had been scathed by lightning and the white wood laid
bare suddenly he heard a groan his teeth chattered and his knees
smote against the saddle it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon
another as they were swayed about by the breeze he passed the tree in
safety but new perils lay before him

about two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed the road and
ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen known by the name of wiley's
swamp a few rough logs laid side by side served for a bridge over
this stream on that side of the road where the brook entered the wood a
group of oaks and chestnuts matted thick with wild grape-vines threw a
cavernous gloom over it to pass this bridge was the severest trial it
was at this identical spot that the unfortunate andre was captured and
under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen
concealed who surprised him this has ever since been considered a
haunted stream and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to
pass it alone after dark

as he approached the stream his heart began to thump he summoned up
however all his resolution gave his horse half a score of kicks in the
ribs and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge but instead of
starting forward the perverse old animal made a lateral movement and
ran broadside against the fence ichabod whose fears increased with the
delay jerked the reins on the other side and kicked lustily with the
contrary foot it was all in vain his steed started it is true but
it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of
brambles and alder bushes the schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and
heel upon the starveling ribs of old gunpowder who dashed forward
snuffing and snorting but came to a stand just by the bridge with a
suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head
just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the
sensitive ear of ichabod in the dark shadow of the grove on the margin
of the brook he beheld something huge misshapen black and towering
it stirred not but seemed gathered up in the gloom like some gigantic
monster ready to spring upon the traveller

the hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror
what was to be done to turn and fly was now too late and besides
what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin if such it was which
could ride upon the wings of the wind summoning up therefore a
show of courage he demanded in stammering accents who are you
he received no reply he repeated his demand in a still more agitated
voice still there was no answer once more he cudgelled the sides
of the inflexible gunpowder and shutting his eyes broke forth with
involuntary fervor into a psalm tune just then the shadowy object of
alarm put itself in motion and with a scramble and a bound stood at
once in the middle of the road though the night was dark and dismal
yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained
he appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions and mounted on a black
horse of powerful frame he made no offer of molestation or sociability
but kept aloof on one side of the road jogging along on the blind side
of old gunpowder who had now got over his fright and waywardness

ichabod who had no relish for this strange midnight companion and
bethought himself of the adventure of brom bones with the galloping
hessian now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind the
stranger however quickened his horse to an equal pace ichabod pulled
up and fell into a walk thinking to lag behind the other did the
same his heart began to sink within him he endeavored to resume his
psalm tune but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and
he could not utter a stave there was something in the moody and
dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and
appalling it was soon fearfully accounted for on mounting a rising
ground which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief
against the sky gigantic in height and muffled in a cloak ichabod was
horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless but his horror was
still more increased on observing that the head which should have
rested on his shoulders was carried before him on the pommel of the
saddle his terror rose to desperation he rained a shower of kicks and
blows upon gunpowder hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion
the slip but the spectre started full jump with him away then they
dashed through thick and thin stones flying and sparks flashing at
every bound ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air as he
stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head in the eagerness
of his flight

they had now reached the road which turns off to sleepy hollow but
gunpowder who seemed possessed with a demon instead of keeping up it
made an opposite turn and plunged headlong down hill to the left this
road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter
of a mile where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story and just
beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church

as yet the panic of the steed had given his unskillful rider an apparent
advantage in the chase but just as he had got halfway through the
hollow the girths of the saddle gave away and he felt it slipping from
under him he seized it by the pommel and endeavored to hold it firm
but in vain and had just time to save himself by clasping old gunpowder
round the neck when the saddle fell to the earth and he heard it
trampled under foot by his pursuer for a moment the terror of hans van
ripper's wrath passed across his mind for it was his sunday saddle but
this was no time for petty fears the goblin was hard on his haunches
and unskilled rider that he was he had much ado to maintain his seat
sometimes slipping on one side sometimes on another and sometimes
jolted on the high ridge of his horse's back-bone with a violence that
he verily feared would cleave him asunder

an opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church
bridge was at hand the wavering reflection of a silver star in the
bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken he saw the walls
of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond he recollected the
place where brom bones ghostly competitor had disappeared if i can
but reach that bridge thought ichabod i am safe just then he heard
the black steed panting and blowing close behind him he even fancied
that he felt his hot breath another convulsive kick in the ribs and
old gunpowder sprang upon the bridge he thundered over the resounding
planks he gained the opposite side and now ichabod cast a look behind
to see if his pursuer should vanish according to rule in a flash of
fire and brimstone just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups
and in the very act of hurling his head at him ichabod endeavored to
dodge the horrible missile but too late it encountered his cranium
with a tremendous crash he was tumbled headlong into the dust and
gunpowder the black steed and the goblin rider passed by like a
whirlwind

the next morning the old horse was found without his saddle and with
the bridle under his feet soberly cropping the grass at his master's
gate ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast dinner-hour
came but no ichabod the boys assembled at the school-house and
strolled idly about the banks of the brook but no schoolmaster hans van
ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor
ichabod and his saddle an inquiry was set on foot and after diligent
investigation they came upon his traces in one part of the road leading
to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt the tracks of
horses hoofs deeply dented in the road and evidently at furious speed
were traced to the bridge beyond which on the bank of a broad part of
the brook where the water ran deep and black was found the hat of the
unfortunate ichabod and close beside it a spattered pumpkin

the brook was searched but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be
discovered hans van ripper as executor of his estate examined the
bundle which contained all his worldly effects they consisted of two
shirts and a half two stocks for the neck a pair or two of worsted
stockings an old pair of corduroy small-clothes a rusty razor a book
of psalm tunes full of dog's ears and a broken pitch-pipe as to the
books and furniture of the school-house they belonged to the community
excepting cotton mather's history of witchcraft a new england almanac
and a book of dreams and fortune-telling in which last was a sheet of
foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to
make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of van tassel these magic
books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames
by hans van ripper who from that time forward determined to send his
children no more to school observing that he never knew any good
come of this same reading and writing whatever money the schoolmaster
possessed and he had received his quarter's pay but a day or
two before he must have had about his person at the time of his
disappearance

the mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the
following sunday knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the
churchyard at the bridge and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin
had been found the stories of brouwer of bones and a whole budget of
others were called to mind and when they had diligently considered them
all and compared them with the symptoms of the present case they shook
their heads and came to the conclusion that ichabod had been carried
off by the galloping hessian as he was a bachelor and in nobody's debt
nobody troubled his head any more about him the school was removed to
a different quarter of the hollow and another pedagogue reigned in his
stead

it is true an old farmer who had been down to new york on a visit
several years after and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure
was received brought home the intelligence that ichabod crane was still
alive that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the
goblin and hans van ripper and partly in mortification at having been
suddenly dismissed by the heiress that he had changed his quarters to a
distant part of the country had kept school and studied law at the same
time had been admitted to the bar turned politician electioneered
written for the newspapers and finally had been made a justice of
the ten pound court brom bones too who shortly after his rival's
disappearance conducted the blooming katrina in triumph to the altar
was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of ichabod
was related and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the
pumpkin which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter
than he chose to tell

the old country wives however who are the best judges of these
matters maintain to this day that ichabod was spirited away by
supernatural means and it is a favorite story often told about the
neighborhood round the intervening fire the bridge became more than
ever an object of superstitious awe and that may be the reason why the
road has been altered of late years so as to approach the church by the
border of the mill-pond the schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to
decay and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate
pedagogue and the plough-boy loitering homeward of a still summer
evening has often fancied his voice at a distance chanting a melancholy
psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of sleepy hollow


postscript

found in the handwriting of mr knickerbocker

the preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which i heard
it related at a corporation meeting of the ancient city of manhattoes
at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers
the narrator was a pleasant shabby gentlemanly old fellow in
pepper-and-salt clothes with a sadly humorous face and one whom
i strongly suspected of being poor he made such efforts to be
entertaining when his story was concluded there was much laughter and
approbation particularly from two or three deputy aldermen who had
been asleep the greater part of the time there was however one tall
dry-looking old gentleman with beetling eyebrows who maintained a
grave and rather severe face throughout now and then folding his arms
inclining his head and looking down upon the floor as if turning a
doubt over in his mind he was one of your wary men who never laugh but
upon good grounds when they have reason and the law on their side
when the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided and silence was
restored he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair and sticking the
other akimbo demanded with a slight but exceedingly sage motion of the
head and contraction of the brow what was the moral of the story and
what it went to prove

the story-teller who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips as a
refreshment after his toils paused for a moment looked at his inquirer
with an air of infinite deference and lowering the glass slowly to the
table observed that the story was intended most logically to prove 

that there is no situation in life but has its advantages and
pleasures provided we will but take a joke as we find it

that therefore he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to
have rough riding of it

ergo for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a dutch
heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state

the cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this
explanation being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism
while methought the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a
triumphant leer at length he observed that all this was very well but
still he thought the story a little on the extravagant there were one
or two points on which he had his doubts

faith sir replied the story-teller as to that matter i don't
believe one-half of it myself

 chaucer's belle dame sans mercie

in concluding a second volume of the sketch book the author cannot but
express his deep sense of the indulgence with which his first has been
received and of the liberal disposition that has been evinced to treat
him with kindness as a stranger even the critics whatever may be
said of them by others he has found to be a singularly gentle and
good-natured race it is true that each has in turn objected to some
one or two articles and that these individual exceptions taken in the
aggregate would amount almost to a total condemnation of his work but
then he has been consoled by observing that what one has particularly
censured another has as particularly praised and thus the encomiums
being set off against the objections he finds his work upon the whole
commended far beyond its deserts


 closing the second volume of the london edition


he is aware that he runs a risk of forfeiting much of this kind favor by
not following the counsel that has been liberally bestowed upon him for
where abundance of valuable advice is given gratis it may seem a man's
own fault if he should go astray he only can say in his vindication
that he faithfully determined for a time to govern himself in his second
volume by the opinions passed upon his first but he was soon brought to
a stand by the contrariety of excellent counsel one kindly advised him
to avoid the ludicrous another to shun the pathetic a third assured
him that he was tolerable at description but cautioned him to leave
narrative alone while a fourth declared that he had a very pretty knack
at turning a story and was really entertaining when in a pensive mood
but was grievously mistaken if he imagined himself to possess a spirit
of humor

thus perplexed by the advice of his friends who each in turn closed
some particular path but left him all the world beside to range in
he found that to follow all their counsels would in fact be to stand
still he remained for a time sadly embarrassed when all at once the
thought struck him to ramble on as he had begun that his work being
miscellaneous and written for different humors it could not be expected
that any one would be pleased with the whole but that if it should
contain something to suit each reader his end would be completely
answered few guests sit down to a varied table with an equal appetite
for every dish one has an elegant horror of a roasted pig another
holds a curry or a devil in utter abomination a third cannot tolerate
the ancient flavor of venison and wild-fowl and a fourth of truly
masculine stomach looks with sovereign contempt on those knick-knacks
here and there dished up for the ladies thus each article is in
condemned in its turn and yet amidst this variety of appetites seldom
does a dish go away from the table without being tasted and relished by
some one or other of the guests

with these considerations he ventures to serve up this second volume in
the same heterogeneous way with his first simply requesting the reader
if he should find here and there something to please him to rest
assured that it was written expressly for intelligent readers like
himself but entreating him should he find anything to dislike to
tolerate it as one of those articles which the author has been obliged
to write for readers of a less refined taste

to be serious the author is conscious of the numerous faults and
imperfections of his work and well aware how little he is disciplined
and accomplished in the arts of authorship his deficiencies are also
increased by a diffidence arising from his peculiar situation he finds
himself writing in a strange land and appearing before a public
which he has been accustomed from childhood to regard with the highest
feelings of awe and reverence he is full of solicitude to deserve their
approbation yet finds that very solicitude continually embarrassing his
powers and depriving him of that case and confidence which are necessary
to successful exertion still the kindness with which he is treated
encourages him to go on hoping that in time he may acquire a steadier
footing and thus he proceeds half venturing half shrinking surprised
at his own good-fortune and wondering at his own temerity

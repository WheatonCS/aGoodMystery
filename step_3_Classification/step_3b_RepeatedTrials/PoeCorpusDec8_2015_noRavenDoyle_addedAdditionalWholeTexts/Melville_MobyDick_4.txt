an
aladdin's lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night
the ship's black hull still houses an illumination

see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
lamps often but old bottles and vials though to the copper cooler at
the try-works and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he
burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore
unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral
contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he
goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and
genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
supper of game



chapter stowing down and clearing up


already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descried from the mast-head how he is chased over the watery moors and
slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside
and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of
old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded
surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he
is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his
spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the fire but now it
remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by
rehearsing singing if i may the romantic proceeding of decanting off
his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where
once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along
beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow

while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the
six-barrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling
this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed
round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot
across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last
man-handled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap
rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officio
every sailor is a cooper

at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great
hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down
go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done the hatches are
replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up

in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with
freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of
the whale's head are profanely piled great rusty casks lie about as
in a brewery yard the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the
bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire
ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is
deafening

but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this
self-same ship and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works
you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a
most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses
a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never
look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil besides
from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is
readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale
remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hands
go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags
restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower
rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise
faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed
upon the try-works completely hiding the pots every cask is out of
sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined
and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's company the
whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew
themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to
toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as
bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest holland

now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and
humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics
propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not
to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to
such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short
of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and
bring us napkins

but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent
on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again
soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small grease-spot
somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest
uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through
for ninety-six hours when from the boat where they have swelled their
wrists with all day rowing on the line they only step to the deck to
carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea
and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined
fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works when on the
heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the
ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor
fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by
the cry of there she blows and away they fly to fight another whale
and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this
is man-killing yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long
toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable
sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its
defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul
hardly is this done when there she blows the ghost is spouted up
and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young life's
old routine again

oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two
thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with
thee along the peruvian coast last voyage and foolish as i am taught
thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope



chapter the doubloon


ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck
taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but
in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the
binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass
that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his
purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast
then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed
with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness

but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some
certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little
worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by
the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in
the milky way

now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the
head-waters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all
the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet
untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito
glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed
by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every
sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was
set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end and however wanton
in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white
whale's talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by
night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever
live to spend it

now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun
and tropic token-pieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes sun's disks
and stars ecliptics horns-of-plenty and rich banners waving are in
luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to
derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through
those fancy mints so spanishly poetic

it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example
of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del
ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the
middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it
and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that
knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three
andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a
crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned
zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the
keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra

before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now
pausing

there's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers and
all other grand and lofty things look here three peaks as proud as
lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the
courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all
are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe
which like a magician's glass to each and every man in turn but
mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those
who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now
this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign
of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a
former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in
throes t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be
it then here's stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then

no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devil's claws must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck
to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read
belshazzar's awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly
he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty
heaven-abiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint
earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over
all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a
hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil
but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer
yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain
snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin
speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it
lest truth shake me falsely

there now's the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the try-works he's
been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with
faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long
and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on
negro hill or in corlaer's hook i'd not look at it very long ere
spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as
queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons
of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your
doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold
moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what
then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing
wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa here's signs and
wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the
zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto i'll get the almanac and
as i have heard devils can be raised with daboll's arithmetic i'll try
my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with
the massachusetts calendar here's the book let's see now signs and
wonders and the sun he's always among em hem hem hem here they
are here they go all alive aries or the ram taurus or the bull
and jimimi here's gemini himself or the twins well the sun he
wheels among em aye here on the coin he's just crossing the threshold
between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring book you lie there
the fact is you books must know your places you'll do to give us the
bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts that's my
small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditch's
navigator and daboll's arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if
there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders there's
a clue somewhere wait a bit hist hark by jove i have it look you
doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter
and now i'll read it off straight out of the book come almanack to
begin there's aries or the ram lecherous dog he begets us then
taurus or the bull he bumps us the first thing then gemini or the
twins that is virtue and vice we try to reach virtue when lo comes
cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from virtue leo
a roaring lion lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites and surly
dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin that's our
first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes
libra or the scales happiness weighed and found wanting and while we
are very sad about that lord how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the
scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang
come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing
himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside here's the
battering-ram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing
and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the water-bearer pours
out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the
fishes we sleep there's a sermon now writ in high heaven and the
sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and
hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and
so alow here does jolly stubb oh jolly's the word for aye adieu
doubloon but stop here comes little king-post dodge round the
try-works now and let's hear what he'll have to say there he's
before it he'll out with something presently so so he's beginning

i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises
a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so what's all this
staring been about it is worth sixteen dollars that's true and at
two cents the cigar that's nine hundred and sixty cigars i won't smoke
dirty pipes like stubb but i like cigars and here's nine hundred and
sixty of them so here goes flask aloft to spy em out

shall i call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it has a
foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it a sort
of wiseish look to it but avast here comes our old manxman the old
hearse-driver he must have been that is before he took to the sea he
luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side
of the mast why there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side and now he's
back again what does that mean hark he's muttering voice like an old
worn-out coffee-mill prick ears and listen

if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when
the sun stands in some one of these signs i've studied signs and know
their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch
in copenhagen now in what sign will the sun then be the horse-shoe
sign for there it is right opposite the gold and what's the
horse-shoe sign the lion is the horse-shoe sign the roaring and
devouring lion ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee

there's another rendering now but still one text all sorts of men
in one kind of world you see dodge again here comes queequeg all
tattooing looks like the signs of the zodiac himself what says the
cannibal as i live he's comparing notes looking at his thigh bone
thinks the sun is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bowels i
suppose as the old women talk surgeon's astronomy in the back country
and by jove he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh i
guess it's sagittarius or the archer no he don't know what to make
of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers
but aside again here comes that ghost-devil fedallah tail coiled out
of sight as usual oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual what does he
say with that look of his ah only makes a sign to the sign and bows
himself there is a sun on the coin fire worshipper depend upon it
ho more and more this way comes pip poor boy would he had died
or i he's half horrible to me he too has been watching all of these
interpreters myself included and look now he comes to read with that
unearthly idiot face stand away again and hear him hark

i look you look he looks we look ye look they look

upon my soul he's been studying murray's grammar improving his mind
poor fellow but what's that he says now hist

i look you look he looks we look ye look they look

why he's getting it by heart hist again

i look you look he looks we look ye look they look

well that's funny

and i you and he and we ye and they are all bats and i'm a crow
especially when i stand a'top of this pine tree here caw caw caw
caw caw caw ain't i a crow and where's the scare-crow there he
stands two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers and two more poked
into the sleeves of an old jacket

wonder if he means me complimentary poor lad i could go hang
myself any way for the present i'll quit pip's vicinity i can stand
the rest for they have plain wits but he's too crazy-witty for my
sanity so so i leave him muttering

here's the ship's navel this doubloon here and they are all on fire
to unscrew it but unscrew your navel and what's the consequence then
again if it stays here that is ugly too for when aught's nailed to
the mast it's a sign that things grow desperate ha ha old ahab
the white whale he'll nail ye this is a pine tree my father in old
tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown
over in it some old darkey's wedding ring how did it get there and
so they'll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old
mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded oysters for the
shaggy bark oh the gold the precious precious gold the green
miser'll hoard ye soon hish hish god goes mong the worlds
blackberrying cook ho cook and cook us jenny hey hey hey hey
hey jenny jenny and get your hoe-cake done



chapter leg and arm

the pequod of nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london


ship ahoy hast seen the white whale

so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing
down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his
hoisted quarter-boat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow he was
a darkly-tanned burly good-natured fine-looking man of sixty or
thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in
festoons of blue pilot-cloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar's surcoat

hast seen the white whale

see you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it
he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head
like a mallet

man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near
him stand by to lower

in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his
crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger
but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the
moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was
always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other
vessel at a moment's warning now it is no very easy matter
for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it like
whalemen to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea for
the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and
then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived
of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied
with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a
clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height
he could hardly hope to attain

it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and
in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the
two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a
pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute
because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood
cried out i see i see avast heaving there jump boys and swing
over the cutting-tackle

as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved
blubber-hook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this
was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his
solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the
fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the
word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his
own weight by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of
the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and
gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust
forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his
ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two sword-fish blades
cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones
together an arm and a leg an arm that never can shrink d'ye
see and a leg that never can run where did'st thou see the white
whale how long ago

the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards
the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a
telescope there i saw him on the line last season

and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from
the capstan and resting on the englishman's shoulder as he did so

aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too

spin me the yarn said ahab how was it

it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line
began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time
well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat
fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went
milling and milling round so that my boat's crew could only trim dish
by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches
from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky-white
head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles

it was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended
breath

and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin

aye aye they were mine my irons cried ahab exultingly but on

give me a chance then said the englishman good-humoredly well
this old great-grandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam
into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line

aye i see wanted to part it free the fast-fish an old trick i
know him

how it was exactly continued the one-armed commander i do not know
but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow
but we didn't know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the
line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whale's
that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and
what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest i ever saw
sir in my life i resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage
he seemed to be in and thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose or
the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boat's
crew for a pull on a whale-line seeing all this i say i jumped
into my first mate's boat mr mounttop's here by the way
captain mounttop mounttop the captain as i was saying i jumped
into mounttop's boat which d'ye see was gunwale and gunwale
with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old
great-grandfather have it but lord look you sir hearts and souls
alive man the next instant in a jiff i was blind as a bat both
eyes out all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale's tail
looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble
steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with
a blinding sun all crown-jewels as i was groping i say after the
second iron to toss it overboard down comes the tail like a lima
tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and
flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was
all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized
hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that
like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same
instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a
flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes
caught me just here i say and bore me down to hell's flames i was
thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript
its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my arm came
out nigh my wrist and up i floated and that gentleman there will tell
you the rest by the way captain dr bunger ship's surgeon bunger
my lad the captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn

the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the
time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his
gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober
one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched
trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
marlingspike he held in one hand and a pill-box held in the other
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled captains but at his superior's introduction of him to ahab
he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding

it was a shocking bad wound began the whale-surgeon and taking my
advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy 

samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one-armed
captain addressing ahab go on boy

stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot
weather there on the line but it was no use i did all i could sat up
with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet 

oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering
his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he
couldn't see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas
over about three o'clock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with
me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very
dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why
don't ye you know you're a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead
boy i'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man

my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sir said the
imperturbable godly-looking bunger slightly bowing to ahab is apt to
be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but
i may as well say en passant as the french remark that i myself that
is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy am a strict total
abstinence man i never drink 

water cried the captain he never drinks it it's a sort of fits to
him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go on go on with
the arm story

yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing
sir before captain boomer's facetious interruption that spite of my
best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the
truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more
than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line
in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came
but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is
against all rule pointing at it with the marlingspike that is the
captain's work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had
that club-hammer there put to the end to knock some one's brains
out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical
passions sometimes do ye see this dent sir removing his hat and
brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull
but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever
having been a wound well the captain there will tell you how that
came here he knows

no i don't said the captain but his mother did he was born with
it oh you solemn rogue you you bunger was there ever such another
bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in
pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal

what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this by-play between the two englishmen

oh cried the one-armed captain oh yes well after he sounded
we didn't see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i
didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till
some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby
dick as some call him and then i knew it was he

did'st thou cross his wake again

twice

but could not fasten

didn't want to try to ain't one limb enough what should i do without
this other arm and i'm thinking moby dick doesn't bite so much as he
swallows

well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to
get the right do you know gentlemen very gravely and mathematically
bowing to each captain in succession do you know gentlemen that the
digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine
providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
even a man's arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the
white whale's malice is only his awkwardness for he never means
to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but
sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine
in ceylon that making believe swallow jack-knives once upon a time let
one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks
d'ye see no possible way for him to digest that jack-knife and fully
incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if
you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the
sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that
case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you
shortly that's all

no thank ye bunger said the english captain he's welcome to the
arm he has since i can't help it and didn't know him then but not to
another one no more white whales for me i've lowered for him once and
that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know
that and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him but hark ye
he's best let alone don't you think so captain glancing at the
ivory leg

he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let
alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures he's all a
magnet how long since thou saw'st him last which way heading

bless my soul and curse the foul fiend's cried bunger stoopingly
walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this man's
blood bring the thermometer it's at the boiling point his pulse
makes these planks beat sir taking a lancet from his pocket and
drawing near to ahab's arm

avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarks man the boat
which way heading

good god cried the english captain to whom the question was put
what's the matter he was heading east i think is your captain
crazy whispering fedallah

but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to
take the boat's steering oar and ahab swinging the cutting-tackle
towards him commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower

in a moment he was standing in the boat's stern and the manilla men
were springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him
with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own
ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod



chapter the decanter


ere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that
she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby
merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of
enderby sons a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion comes not
far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point
of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our
lord this great whaling house was in existence my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain but in that year it fitted
out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale
though for some score of years previous ever since our valiant
coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets
pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not
elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were
the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm
whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the
whole globe who so harpooned him

in a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose
and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape
horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one
and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the
amelia's example was soon followed by other ships english and american
and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open
but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again
bestirred itself samuel and all his sons how many their mother only
knows and under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their
expense the british government was induced to send the sloop-of-war
rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded
by a naval post-captain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and
did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in
 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to
go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that ship well
called the syren made a noble experimental cruise and it was thus
that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known
the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin a
nantucketer

all honour to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to
the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have
slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world

the ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the
forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumps every
soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine
gam i had long very long after old ahab touched her planks with his
ivory heel it minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that
ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever
lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it
at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for it's
squally off there by patagonia and all hands visitors and all were
called to reef topsails we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the
howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts
did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we
had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down
the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
taste

the beef was fine tough but with body in it they said it was
bull-beef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for
certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial
symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you
could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed
if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out
of you like billiard-balls the bread but that couldn't be helped
besides it was an anti-scorbutic in short the bread contained the
only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it
was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all
in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the
cook's boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft
i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty
fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to
hat-band

but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other
english whalers i know of not all though were such famous hospitable
ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the
joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing
i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers
is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of
historical whale research when it has seemed needed

the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders
zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions
touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english
merchant-ship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in
the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural
but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special
origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated

during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an
ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i
knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam
cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was
reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man
professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and
st pott's to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box
of sperm candles for his trouble this same dr snodhead so soon as he
spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper
but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book
treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained
a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it
was headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the
outfits for the larders and cellars of sail of dutch whalemen from
which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following

 lbs of beef lbs friesland pork lbs of stock
fish lbs of biscuit lbs of soft bread firkins
of butter lbs texel leyden cheese lbs cheese
probably an inferior article ankers of geneva barrels of
beer

most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in
the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes
barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer

at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic
application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my
own touching the probable quantity of stock-fish etc consumed by
every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen
whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and
leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their
naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the
nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game
in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country
where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil

the quantity of beer too is very large barrels now as those
polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen
including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much
exceed three months say and reckoning men to each of their fleet
of sail we have low dutch seamen in all therefore i say
we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks
allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that ankers of gin
now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might
fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in
a boat's head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem
somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but
this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with
the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford

but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers
of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english
whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when
cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the
world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the
decanter



chapter a bower in the arsacides


hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly
dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail
upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still
further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his
unconditional skeleton

but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the
fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures
on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land
a full-grown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a
roast-pig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been
ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone
the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters
ridge-pole sleepers and under-pinnings making up the frame-work of
leviathan and belike of the tallow-vats dairy-rooms butteries and
cheeseries in his bowels

i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged
to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the
heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my
boat-hatchet and jack-knife and breaking the seal and reading all the
contents of that young cub

and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted
to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides
for being at tranque years ago when attached to the trading-ship dey
of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with
the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a sea-side
glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo-town his
capital

among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted
with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought
together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices
chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes
and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the
wonder-freighted tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores

chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an
unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his
head against a cocoa-nut tree whose plumage-like tufted droopings
seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of
its fathom-deep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun
then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a
grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it

the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved with
arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests
kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head
again sent forth its vapoury spout while suspended from a bough the
terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hair-hung
sword that so affrighted damocles

it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy
glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the
industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom with a gorgeous carpet
on it whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof and
the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden
branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the message-carrying
air all these unceasingly were active through the lacings of the
leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied
verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaver pause one word whither
flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless
toilings speak weaver stay thy hand but one single word with
thee nay the shuttle flies the figures float from forth the loom the
freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away the weaver-god he weaves
and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and
by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only
when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through
it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that
are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly
heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements thereby
have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in
all this din of the great world's loom thy subtlest thinkings may be
overheard afar

now amid the green life-restless loom of that arsacidean wood the
great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler yet
as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven
over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but
himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim
god wived with youthful life and begat him curly-headed glories

now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the
skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as
an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests
should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced
before this skeleton brushed the vines aside broke through the
ribs and with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid
its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was
out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered
i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones

cutting me a green measuring-rod i once more dived within the skeleton
from their arrow-slit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the
altitude of the final rib how now they shouted dar'st thou measure
this our god that's for us aye priests well how long do ye make
him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning
feet and inches they cracked each other's sconces with their
yard-sticks the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance i
quickly concluded my own admeasurements

these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be
it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied
measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can
refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell
me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where
they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales likewise i
have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have
what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or
river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire
england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has
in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size
by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo's

in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir
clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir
clifford's whale has been articulated throughout so that like a
great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony
cavities spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan and swing all day
upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at
the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo
in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view
from his forehead

the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild
wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished
the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was
then composing at least what untattooed parts might remain i did not
trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale



chapter measurement of the whale's skeleton


in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain
statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we
are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here

according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base
upon captain scoresby's estimate of seventy tons for the largest
sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful
calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between
eighty-five and ninety feet in length and something less than forty
feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least
ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants

think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this
leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination

having already in various ways put before you his skull spout-hole
jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large
a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the
most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in
this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your
arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the
general structure we are about to view

in length the sperm whale's skeleton at tranque measured seventy-two
feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have
been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventy-two feet
his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty feet of
plain back-bone attached to this back-bone for something less than a
third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once
enclosed his vitals

to me this vast ivory-ribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine
extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks when only some twenty
of her naked bow-ribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the
time but a long disconnected timber

the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck
was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each
successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one
of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from
that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only
spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore
a seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most
arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams

in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of
the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of
the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish
which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the
invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the
living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw
but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of
added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the
ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the
weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank

how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead
attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the
heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry
flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale
be truly and livingly found out

but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a
crane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now
it's done it looks much like pompey's pillar

there are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton are
not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on
a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest
a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth
more than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into the
tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white
billiard-ball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they
had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priest's children
who had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the
spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple
child's play



chapter the fossil whale


from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not
compress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail
and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic
involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great
cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
line-of-battle-ship

since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me
to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him
in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it
now remains to magnify him in an archaeological fossiliferous and
antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the
leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly terms might justly be deemed
unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is
altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
words of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been
convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have
invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased
for that purpose because that famous lexicographer's uncommon personal
bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
like me

one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject
though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing
of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
capitals give me a condor's quill give me vesuvius crater for an
inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my
thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their
outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole
circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and
mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas
of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its
suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal
theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose
a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the
flea though many there be who have tried it

ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my credentials
as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been
a stone-mason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells
wine-vaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of
preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier
geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted
links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote
posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales
hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last
preceding the superficial formations and though none of them
precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet
sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking
rank as cetacean fossils

detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales fragments of their bones
and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been
found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in
scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama
among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the
year was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street
opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones
disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleon's
time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly
unknown leviathanic species

but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year on
the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awe-stricken credulous
slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen
angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed
upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being
taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out
that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a
significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this
book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the
shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster
zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society
pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures
which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence

when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks
jaws ribs and vertebrae all characterized by partial resemblances to
the existing breeds of sea-monsters but at the same time bearing on
the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back
to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun
for time began with man here saturn's grey chaos rolls over me and i
obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedged
bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in
all the miles of this world's circumference not an inhabitable
hand's breadth of land was visible then the whole world was the
whale's and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines
of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan
ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh's methuselah seems
a school-boy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horror-struck
at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of
the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after
all humane ages are over

but not alone has this leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim
for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable
print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah
some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and
dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the
moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there
swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled

nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
of the whale in his own osseous post-diluvian reality as set down by
the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller

not far from the sea-side they have a temple the rafters and beams
of which are made of whale-bones for whales of a monstrous size are
oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that
by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it
without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either
side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea
and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep a whale's rib
of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with
its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be
reached by a man upon a camel's back this rib says john leo is said
to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians
affirm that a prophet who prophesy'd of mahomet came from this temple
and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth
by the whale at the base of the temple

in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a
nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there



chapter does the whale's magnitude diminish will he perish


inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the head-waters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether
in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the
original bulk of his sires

but upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
ones

of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the
alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen
that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large
sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemen's authority that
sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of
capture

but may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may
it not be that since adam's time they have degenerated

assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such
gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny
tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus
of others which measured eight hundred feet in length rope walks and
thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and solander
cooke's naturalists we find a danish member of the academy of sciences
setting down certain iceland whales reydan-siskur or wrinkled bellies
at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet
and lacepede the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales
in the very beginning of his work page sets down the right whale at
one hundred metres three hundred and twenty-eight feet and this work
was published so late as ad 

but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of to-day is
as big as his ancestors in pliny's time and if ever i go where pliny
is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so
because i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies
that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not
measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian
and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are
drawn just as plainly prove that the high-bred stall-fed prize cattle
of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest
of pharaoh's fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of
all animals the whale alone should have degenerated

but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more
recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs
at the mast-heads of the whaleships now penetrating even through
behring's straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers
of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all
continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure
so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last
be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man
smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff

comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo
which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with
their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals
where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such
a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that
the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction

but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a
period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinois
exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day
not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the
cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far
different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for
forty-eight months think they have done extremely well and thank god
if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the days
of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when
the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and
a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of
months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain
not forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need
were could be statistically stated

nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former years
the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in
small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in
consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more
remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales
influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense
caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and
pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely
separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally fallacious seems
the conceit that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer
haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that
species also is declining for they are only being driven from
promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with
their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very
recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle

furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two
firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain
impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss
have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and
glades of the middle seas the whale-bone whales can at last resort to
their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and
walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle
of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man

but as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions
but though for some time past a number of these whales not less than
 have been annually slain on the nor-west coast by the americans
alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance
of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter

natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to
harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the
king of siam took elephants that in those regions elephants are
numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no
reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for
thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the
successive monarchs of the east if they still survive there in great
numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he
has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all
asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles
of the sea combined

moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity
of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more
therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations
must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea
of by imagining all the grave-yards cemeteries and family vaults of
creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children
who were alive seventy-five years ago and adding this countless host to
the present human population of the globe

wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his
species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas
before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the
tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noah's flood he
despised noah's ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like
the netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still
survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood
spout his frothed defiance to the skies



chapter ahab's leg


the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel
enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to
his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock and
when after gaining his own deck and his own pivot-hole there he so
vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it
was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then
the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench
that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet
ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy

and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his
pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the
condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not
been very long prior to the pequod's sailing from nantucket that he
had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible
by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his
ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stake-wise
smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured

nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all
the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous
reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable
events do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought
ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the
ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is
an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural
enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world
but on the contrary shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of
all hell's despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still
fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs
beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an
inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while
even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying
pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic
significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their
diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction to trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the
sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the
glad hay-making suns and soft cymballing round harvest-moons we must
needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad
the ineffaceable sad birth-mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of
sorrow in the signers

unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more
properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other
particulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some
why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing
of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grand-lama-like
exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as
it were among the marble senate of the dead captain peleg's bruited
reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed
as touching all ahab's deeper part every revelation partook more of
significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all
came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap was at
the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that
ever-contracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed
the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the
above hinted casualty remaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by
ahab invested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land
of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had
all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of
this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable
interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequod's decks

but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air
or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not
with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain
practical procedures he called the carpenter

and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay
set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied
with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory sperm whale which had thus
far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection
of the stoutest clearest-grained stuff might be secured this done the
carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to
provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to
the distrusted one in use moreover the ship's forge was ordered to be
hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate
the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the
forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed



chapter the carpenter


seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high
abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but
from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they
seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary
but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of
the high humane abstraction the pequod's carpenter was no duplicate
hence he now comes in person on this stage

like all sea-going ship carpenters and more especially those belonging
to whaling vessels he was to a certain off-handed practical extent
alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own
the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all
those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic
remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in
those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring
in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized
and far-distant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary
duties repairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of
clumsy-bladed oars inserting bull's eyes in the deck or new tree-nails
in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly
pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly
expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and
capricious

the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold
was his vice-bench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times
except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed
athwartships against the rear of the try-works

a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole
the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices and straightway
files it smaller a lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board
and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone and
cross-beams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking
cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a
soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon
the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood
the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation a sailor takes
a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings the carpenter drills his ears
another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping
one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow
unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the
handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in
that if he would have him draw the tooth

thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent
and without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he
deemed but top-blocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but
while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such
liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some
uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was
this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as
it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding
infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity
discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active
in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you
though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was this half-horrible
stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an all-ramifying
heartlessness yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old
crutch-like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now
and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of noah's ark was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long
wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss
but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings
might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an
unfractioned integral uncompromised as a new-born babe living without
premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost
say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of
unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so
much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to
it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by
a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure
manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early
oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of
those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield
contrivances assuming the exterior though a little swelled of a
common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes
but also screw-drivers cork-screws tweezers awls pens rulers
nail-filers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the
carpenter for a screw-driver all they had to do was to open that part
of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the
legs and there they were

yet as previously hinted this omnitooled open-and-shut carpenter
was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a
common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few
drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it
had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same
unaccountable cunning life-principle in him this it was that kept
him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning
wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a
sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the
time to keep himself awake



chapter ahab and the carpenter

the deck first night watch


carpenter standing before his vice-bench and by the light of two
lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is
firmly fixed in the vice slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws
and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red
flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work


drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft
and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaws and
shinbones let's try another aye now this works better sneezes
halloa this bone dust is sneezes why it's sneezes yes it's
sneezes bless my soul it won't let me speak this is what an old
fellow gets now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and
you don't get this dust amputate a live bone and you don't get it
sneezes come come you old smut there bear a hand and let's have
that ferule and buckle-screw i'll be ready for them presently lucky
now sneezes there's no knee-joint to make that might puzzle a little
but a mere shinbone why it's easy as making hop-poles only i should
like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i
could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever sneezes scraped to a lady
in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs i've seen in shop
windows wouldn't compare at all they soak water they do and of
course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneezes with washes and
lotions just like live legs there before i saw it off now i must
call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right
too short if anything i guess ha that's the heel we are in luck
here he comes or it's somebody else that's certain

ahab advancing

during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times


well manmaker

just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length
let me measure sir

measured for a leg good well it's not the first time about it
there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here
carpenter let me feel its grip once so so it does pinch some

oh sir it will break bones beware beware

no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this
slippery world that can hold man what's prometheus about there the
blacksmith i mean what's he about

he must be forging the buckle-screw sir now

right it's a partnership he supplies the muscle part he makes a
fierce red flame there

aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work

um-m so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that
old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a
blacksmith and animated them with fire for what's made in fire must
properly belong to fire and so hell's probable how the soot flies
this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of carpenter
when he's through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel
shoulder-blades there's a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack

sir

hold while prometheus is about it i'll order a complete man after a
desirable pattern imprimis fifty feet high in his socks then chest
modelled after the thames tunnel then legs with roots to em to stay
in one place then arms three feet through the wrist no heart at all
brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let
me see shall i order eyes to see outwards no but put a sky-light on
top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away

now what's he speaking about and who's he speaking to i should like
to know shall i keep standing here aside

tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome here's one no
no no i must have a lantern

ho ho that's it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn

what art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for man
thrusted light is worse than presented pistols

i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter


carpenter why that's but no a very tidy and i may say
an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here
carpenter or would'st thou rather work in clay

sir clay clay sir that's mud we leave clay to ditchers sir

the fellow's impious what art thou sneezing about

bone is rather dusty sir

take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under
living people's noses

sir oh ah i guess so yes dear

look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good
workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well
for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that
is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst
thou not drive that old adam away

truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard
something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still
pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir

it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the
soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a
hair do i is't a riddle

i should humbly call it a poser sir

hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing
may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most
solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold don't
speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now
so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery
pains of hell for ever and without a body hah

good lord truly sir if it comes to that i must calculate over again
i think i didn't carry a small figure sir

look ye pudding-heads should never grant premises how long before the
leg is done

perhaps an hour sir

bungle away at it then and bring it to me turns to go oh life here
i am proud as greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for
a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will
not do away with ledgers i would be free as air and i'm down in the
whole world's books i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with
the wealthiest praetorians at the auction of the roman empire which was
the world's and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by
heavens i'll get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to
one small compendious vertebra so

carpenter resuming his work


well well well stubb knows him best of all and stubb always says
he's queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he's
queer says stubb he's queer queer queer and keeps dinning it into
mr starbuck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer and
here's his leg yes now that i think of it here's his bedfellow has
a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife and this is his leg he'll stand
on this what was that now about one leg standing in three places and
all three places standing in one hell how was that oh i don't wonder
he looked so scornful at me i'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes
they say but that's only haphazard-like then a short little old body
like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall
heron-built captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick
and there's a great cry for life-boats and here's the heron's leg
long and slim sure enough now for most folks one pair of legs lasts
a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a
tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses but ahab
oh he's a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the
other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there
you smut bear a hand there with those screws and let's finish it
before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for
all legs true or false as brewery-men go round collecting old beer
barrels to fill em up again what a leg this is it looks like a real
live leg filed down to nothing but the core he'll be standing on this
to-morrow he'll be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the
little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so
so chisel file and sand-paper now



chapter ahab and starbuck in the cabin


according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no
inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have
sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into
the cabin to report this unfavourable affair


in sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it
is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench
the casks with sea-water which afterwards at varying intervals is
removed by the ship's pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept
damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the
mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo


now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and
the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with
a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him
and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
japanese islands niphon matsmai and sikoke with his snow-white new
ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long
pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand the wondrous old man with his
back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old
courses again

who's there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round
to it on deck begone

captain ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we
must up burtons and break out

up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heave-to here
for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops

either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
in a year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving
sir

so it is so it is if we get it

i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir

and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak
i'm all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks
but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and that's a far worse plight
than the pequod's man yet i don't stop to plug my leak for who can
find it in the deep-loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if
found in this life's howling gale starbuck i'll not have the burtons
hoisted

what will the owners say sir

let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what
cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating to me starbuck
about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but
look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye
my conscience is in this ship's keel on deck

captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation
of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself
a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab

devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me on
deck

nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sir to be forbearing
shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab

ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most
south-sea-men's cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck
exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one
captain that is lord over the pequod on deck

for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks
you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose
and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast
outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of
starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of
thyself old man

he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that
murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared what's that he said ahab
beware of ahab there's something there then unconsciously using the
musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and
returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck

thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate
then raising his voice to the crew furl the t'gallant-sails and
close-reef the top-sails fore and aft back the main-yard up burton
and break out in the main-hold

it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting
starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him
or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously
forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient
in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders
were executed and the burtons were hoisted



chapter queequeg in his coffin


upon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it
being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the
slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they
go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask
containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards
vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after
tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and
iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks
were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if
you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea
like an air-freighted demijohn top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless
student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the typhoons
did not visit them then

now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast
bosom-friend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh
to his endless end

be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown
dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the
higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as
harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale but as
we have elsewhere seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea and
finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating
all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen
the harpooneers are the holders so called

poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should
have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where
stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about
amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
of a well and a well or an ice-house it somehow proved to him poor
pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he
caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after
some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill
of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few
long-lingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his
frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheek-bones
grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller
they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply
looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that
immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like
circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes
seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that
cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who
were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and
fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing
near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last
revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell
so that let us say it again no dying chaldee or greek had higher and
holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping
over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying
hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final
rest and the ocean's invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher
towards his destined heaven

not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was
just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he
had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich
war-wood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all
whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not
unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior
stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to
the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars
are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild
uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the
white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at
the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual
sea-custom tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks
no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial
to him being a whaleman that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and
much lee-way adown the dim ages

now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter
was at once commanded to do queequeg's bidding whatever it might
include there was some heathenish coffin-coloured old lumber aboard
which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal
groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin
was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of
the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent
promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took
queequeg's measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequeg's
person as he shifted the rule

ah poor fellow he'll have to die now ejaculated the long island
sailor

going to his vice-bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches
at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his tools
and to work

when the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted
he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction

overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the
people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one's
consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some
dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will
shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be
indulged

leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with
an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock
drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also
biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water
was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in
the hold at the foot and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a
pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he
might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving
a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little
god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between he
called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him
the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg
in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai
it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced
in his hammock

but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this
while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him
by the hand in the other holding his tambourine

poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where
go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where
the beaches are only beat with water-lilies will ye do one little
errand for me seek out one pip who's now been missing long i think
he's in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he
must be very sad for look he's left his tambourine behind i found
it rig-a-dig dig dig now queequeg die and i'll beat ye your dying
march

i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in
violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues
and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their
wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip
in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all
our heavenly homes where learned he that but there hark he speaks
again but more wildly now

form two and two let's make a general of him ho where's his harpoon
lay it across here rig-a-dig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock
now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies game mind ye that
queequeg dies game take ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i
say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all
a'shiver out upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles
he's a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from
a whale-boat i'd never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail
him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all
cowards shame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped from a
whale-boat shame shame

during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream pip
was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock

but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now
that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon
there seemed no need of the carpenter's box and thereupon when some
expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the
cause of his sudden convalescence was this at a critical moment he
had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone
and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet
he averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of
his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word
it was queequeg's conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere
sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some
violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort

now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized
that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing
generally speaking a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day
so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a
vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms
and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then
springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon
pronounced himself fit for a fight

with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a sea-chest and
emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there
many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was
striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and
seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on
his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical
treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own
proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but
whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart
beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in
the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were
inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must
have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when
one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg oh devilish
tantalization of the gods



chapter the pacific


when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south
sea were it not for other things i could have greeted my dear pacific
with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was
answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues
of blue

there is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently
awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those
fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st
john and meet it is that over these sea-pastures wide-rolling watery
prairies and potters fields of all four continents the waves should
rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed
shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that
we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like
slumberers in their beds the ever-rolling waves but made so by their
restlessness

to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must
ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls the midmost waters of
the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms the same
waves wash the moles of the new-built californian towns but yesterday
planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still
gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands older than abraham while all between
float milky-ways of coral isles and low-lying endless unknown
archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine
pacific zones the world's whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay
to it seems the tide-beating heart of earth lifted by those eternal
swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan

but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab's brain as standing like an
iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles
in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other
consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in
which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at
length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the japanese
cruising-ground the old man's purpose intensified itself his firm lips
met like the lips of a vice the delta of his forehead's veins swelled
like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through
the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spouts thick blood



chapter the blacksmith


availing himself of the mild summer-cool weather that now reigned in
these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old
blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after
concluding his contributory work for ahab's leg but still retained
it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost
incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do
some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their
various weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an
eager circle all waiting to be served holding boat-spades pike-heads
harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement
as he toiled nevertheless this old man's was a patient hammer wielded
by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from
him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically
broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the
heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it
was most miserable

a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing
yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the
curiosity of the mariners and to the importunity of their persisted
questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every
one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate

belated and not innocently one bitter winter's midnight on the road
running between two country towns the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning
dilapidated barn the issue was the loss of the extremities of both
feet out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four
acts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophied fifth
act of the grief of his life's drama

he was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin he had been
an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house
and garden embraced a youthful daughter-like loving wife and three
blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerful-looking church
planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further
concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into
his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to
tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
his family's heart it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that
fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for
prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmith's shop was in
the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so
that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of
her young-armed old husband's hammer whose reverberations muffled by
passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly
in her nursery and so to stout labor's iron lullaby the blacksmith's
infants were rocked to slumber

oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst
thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon
him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a
truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and
all of them a care-killing competency but death plucked down some
virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the
responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless
old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to
harvest

why tell the whole the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last
the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyes glitteringly
gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows fell the
forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived
down into the long church-yard grass her children twice followed her
thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond
in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen
curls

death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death
is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but
the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the
wild the watery the unshored therefore to the death-longing eyes of
such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against
suicide does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly
spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and
wonderful new-life adventures and from the hearts of infinite
pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to them come hither
broken-hearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them come
hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and
abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put
up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we
marry thee

hearkening to these voices east and west by early sunrise and by fall
of eve the blacksmith's soul responded aye i come and so perth went
a-whaling



chapter the forge


with matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron about
mid-day perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter
placed upon an iron-wood log with one hand holding a pike-head in the
coals and with the other at his forge's lungs when captain ahab came
along carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag while
yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last
perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the
anvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights
some of which flew close to ahab

are these thy mother carey's chickens perth they are always flying
in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all look here they
burn but thou thou liv'st among them without a scorch

because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting
for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily can'st thou
scorch a scar

well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful
to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others
that is not mad thou should'st go mad blacksmith say why dost thou
not go mad how can'st thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet
hate thee that thou can'st not go mad what wert thou making there

welding an old pike-head sir there were seams and dents in it

and can'st thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard
usage as it had

i think so sir

and i suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents never
mind how hard the metal blacksmith

aye sir i think i can all seams and dents but one

look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning
with both hands on perth's shoulders look ye here here can ye
smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his
ribbed brow if thou could'st blacksmith glad enough would i lay
my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes
answer can'st thou smoothe this seam

oh that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents but one

aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for
though thou only see'st it here in my flesh it has worked down into the
bone of my skull that is all wrinkles but away with child's play no
more gaffs and pikes to-day look ye here jingling the leathern bag
as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that
a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will
stick in a whale like his own fin-bone there's the stuff flinging
the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered
nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses

horse-shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the
best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work

i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me
first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these
twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line quick i'll
blow the fire

when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one by one by
spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a
flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth

this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when
ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then
with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to
him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge
shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and
bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or
some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside

what's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered stubb
looking on from the forecastle that parsee smells fire like a fusee
and smells of it himself like a hot musket's powder-pan

at last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as
perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
by the scalding steam shot up into ahab's bent face

would'st thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain
have i been but forging my own branding-iron then

pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this
harpoon for the white whale

for the white fiend but now for the barbs thou must make them
thyself man here are my razors the best of steel here and make the
barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the icy sea

for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
not use them

take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup
nor pray till but here to work

fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the
shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith
was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he
cried to ahab to place the water-cask near

no no no water for that i want it of the true death-temper ahoy
there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me
as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of
dark nods replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh
and the white whale's barbs were then tempered

ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli
deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
baptismal blood

now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory
with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of
the iron a coil of new tow-line was then unwound and some fathoms of
it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing
his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp-string then eagerly
bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and
now for the seizings

at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns
were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole
was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope
was traced half-way along the pole's length and firmly secured so with
intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and rope like the three
fates remained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the
weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole
both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin
light unnatural half-bantering yet most piteous sound was heard oh
pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange
mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
melancholy ship and mocked it



chapter the gilder


penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising
ground the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery often in mild
pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the
stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing
or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy
minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success
for their pains

at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow
heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so
sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearth-stone
cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy
quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
ocean's skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and
would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang

these are the times when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
certain filial confident land-like feeling towards the sea that he
regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high
rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when
the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears while their
hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure

the long-drawn virgin vales the mild blue hill-sides as over these
there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that play-wearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad may-time when
the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes with your most
mystic mood so that fact and fancy half-way meeting interpenetrate
and form one seamless whole

nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as
temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden keys did seem
to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon
them prove but tarnishing

oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in
ye though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life in ye
men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some
few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them
would to god these blessed calms would last but the mingled mingling
threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by storms a
storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this
life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one
pause through infancy's unconscious spell boyhood's thoughtless
faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then
disbelief resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of if but once
gone through we trace the round again and are infants boys and men
and ifs eternally where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no
more in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will
never weary where is the foundling's father hidden our souls are like
those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of
our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it

and that same day too gazing far down from his boat's side into that
same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured 

loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young bride's
eye tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks and thy kidnapping
cannibal ways let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep
down and do believe

and stubb fish-like with sparkling scales leaped up in that same
golden light 

i am stubb and stubb has his history but here stubb takes oaths that
he has always been jolly



chapter the pequod meets the bachelor


and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
before the wind some few weeks after ahab's harpoon had been welded

it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad
holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vain-gloriously sailing
round among the widely-separated ships on the ground previous to
pointing her prow for home

the three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
at their hats from the stern a whale-boat was suspended bottom down
and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colours
were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of
her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her
top-mast cross-trees you saw slender breakers of the same precious
fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp

as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising
success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same
seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a
single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to
make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental
casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were
stowed along the deck and in the captain's and officers state-rooms
even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood and the
cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt lashed down to the
floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually
caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously
added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and
filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled
it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and
filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the
captain's pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands
into in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction

as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing
still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
try-pots which covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of
the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
hands of the crew on the quarter-deck the mates and harpooneers were
dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the
polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured
aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with
glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious
jig meanwhile others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at
the masonry of the try-works from which the huge pots had been
removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed
bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and
mortar were being hurled into the sea

lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the
ship's elevated quarter-deck so that the whole rejoicing drama was
full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion

and ahab he too was standing on his quarter-deck shaggy and black
with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each other's
wakes one all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings
as to things to come their two captains in themselves impersonated the
whole striking contrast of the scene

come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelor's commander lifting
a glass and a bottle in the air

hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply

no only heard of him but don't believe in him at all said the other
good-humoredly come aboard

thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men

not enough to speak of two islanders that's all but come aboard
old hearty come along i'll soon take that black from your brow come
along will ye merry's the play a full ship and homeward-bound

how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art
a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty
ship and outward-bound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there
set all sail and keep her to the wind

and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other
stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew
of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding
bachelor but the bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for the lively
revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the
homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and
then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two
remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket
soundings



chapter the dying whale


not seldom in this life when on the right side fortune's favourites
sail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the
rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so seemed
it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor
whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab

it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson
fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun
and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such
plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that
it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of
the manilla isles the spanish land-breeze wantonly turned sailor had
gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns

soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned
off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now
tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
dying the turning sunwards of the head and so expiring that strange
spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a
wondrousness unknown before

he turns and turns him to it how slowly but how steadfastly his
homage-rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too
worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sun oh
that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights
look here far water-locked beyond all hum of human weal or woe
in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks
furnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have still
rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the
niger's unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but
see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads
some other way

oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas
thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the
wide-slaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor
has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round
again without a lesson to me

oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed
jet that one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh
whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun that
only calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker
half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable
imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once living
things exhaled as air but water now

then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though
hill and valley mothered me ye billows are my foster-brothers



chapter the whale watch


the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to
windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one
could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night and that boat was ahab's

the waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole and
the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare
upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which
gently chafed the whale's broad flank like soft surf upon a beach

ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching
in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the
whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound
like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
gomorrah ran shuddering through the air

started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and
hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
flooded world i have dreamed it again said he

of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine

and who are hearsed that die on the sea

but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by
mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
america

aye aye a strange sight that parsee a hearse and its plumes
floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers ha such a
sight we shall not soon see

believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man

and what was that saying about thyself

though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot

and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere i can
follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me still was it not
so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two
pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it

take another pledge old man said the parsee as his eyes lighted up
like fire-flies in the gloom hemp only can kill thee

the gallows ye mean i am immortal then on land and on sea cried
ahab with a laugh of derision immortal on land and on sea

both were silent again as one man the grey dawn came on and the
slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the ship



chapter the quadrant


the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab
coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to
the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ship's
prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high
noon and ahab seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat was
about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
latitude

now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing
focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass the sky looks
lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness
of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of god's throne
well that ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through
which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form
to the roll of the ship and with his astrological-looking instrument
placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to
catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian
meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling
beneath him on the ship's deck and with face thrown up like ahab's
was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded
their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness
at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon
his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that
precise instant then falling into a moment's revery he again looked up
towards the sun and murmured to himself thou sea-mark thou high and
mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i am but canst thou cast the
least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing
besides me is this moment living where is moby dick this instant thou
must be eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is
even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally
beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun

then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its
numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered
foolish toy babies plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and
captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what
after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou
thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds
thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water
or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon and yet with thy impotence
thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed
be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to that heaven whose live
vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched
with thy light o sun level by nature to this earth's horizon are the
glances of man's eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if god
had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant
dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee
the level ship's compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by
line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye
lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry
thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee

as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live
and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a
fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over
the mute motionless parsee's face unobserved he rose and glided away
while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered
together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck
shouted out to the braces up helm square in

in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship half-wheeled upon
her heel her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon
her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one
sufficient steed

standing between the knight-heads starbuck watched the pequod's
tumultuous way and ahab's also as he went lurching along the deck

i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of
its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down
to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine
what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes

aye cried stubb but sea-coal ashes mind ye that mr
starbuck sea-coal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab
mutter here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine
swears that i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but
thou actest right live in the game and die in it



chapter the candles


warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of bengal
crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure skies the most effulgent
but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes
that never swept tame northern lands so too it is that in these
resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all
storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless
sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town

towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and
bare-poled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly
ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts
fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sport

holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck at every
flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster
might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask
were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the
boats but all their pains seemed naught though lifted to the very
top of the cranes the windward quarter boat ahab's did not escape
a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ship's high
teetering side stove in the boat's bottom at the stern and left it
again all dripping through like a sieve

bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck
but the sea will have its way stubb for one can't fight it you see
mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all
round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all
the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never
mind it's all in fun so the old song says sings

 oh jolly is the gale
 and a joker is the whale
 a flourishin his tail 
 such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky-poky lad is the ocean oh

 the scud all a flyin
 that's his flip only foamin
 when he stirs in the spicin 
 such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky-poky lad is the ocean oh

 thunder splits the ships
 but he only smacks his lips
 a tastin of this flip 
 such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky-poky lad is the ocean oh


avast stubb cried starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike his
harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
peace

but i am not a brave man never said i was a brave man i am a coward
and i sing to keep up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr
starbuck there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
throat and when that's done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a
wind-up

madman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own

what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never
mind how foolish

here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his
hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from
the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very
course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is
that stove in the stern-sheets man where he is wont to stand his
stand-point is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou
must

i don't half understand ye what's in the wind

yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to
nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubb's
question the gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it
into a fair wind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward
all is blackness of doom but to leeward homeward i see it lightens up
there but not with the lightning

at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following
the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead

who's there

old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fire

now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly
towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering
not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the
vessel's way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a
ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard but are generally made
in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require

the rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to
vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux
to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and
aft quick

avast cried ahab let's have fair play here though we be the weaker
side yet i'll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that
all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir

look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants

all the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each
tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar

blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently
jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast it but
slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and
immediately shifting his tone he cried the corpusants have mercy on us
all

to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of
the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses
from the topsail-yard-arms when most they teeter over to a seething
sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when
god's burning finger has been laid on the ship when his mene mene
tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage

while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the
enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle
all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away
constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic
jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed
the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of
tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth which strangely gleamed as
if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the
preternatural light queequeg's tattooing burned like satanic blue
flames on his body

the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more
the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment
or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it
was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the
same in the song

no no it wasn't i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i
hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faces have
they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuck but it's too dark
to look hear me then i take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
chock a block with sperm-oil d'ye see and so all that sperm will
work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will
yet be as three spermaceti candles that's the good promise we saw

at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb's face slowly beginning
to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once
more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
supernaturalness in their pallor

the corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again

at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame
the parsee was kneeling in ahab's front but with his head bowed away
from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where
they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen
arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a
knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted
attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in
herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes
upcast

aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white
flame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast
links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it
blood against fire so

then turning the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot
upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and high-flung right arm he
stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames

oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i as persian
once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to
this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now
know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence
wilt thou be kind and e'en for hate thou canst but kill and all
are killed no fearless fool now fronts thee i own thy speechless
placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the
personified impersonal a personality stands here though but a point at
best whencesoe'er i came wheresoe'er i go yet while i earthly live
the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war
is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will
kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power
and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds there's that
in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy
fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to
thee

sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap lengthwise
to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eyes
his right hand pressed hard upon them

i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor was it wrung
from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind but i can then
grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take the homage of
these poor eyes and shutter-hands i would not take it the lightning
flashes through my skull mine eye-balls ache and ache my whole beaten
brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh
yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou
leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping
out of thee the javelins cease open eyes see or not there burn the
flames oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou
art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what
hast thou done with her there lies my puzzle but thine is greater
thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten
certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i
know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent
there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom
all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through
thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it oh thou
foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable
riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read
my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with
thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee

the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man

ahab's harpoon the one forged at perth's fire remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whale-boat's
bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a
levelled flame of pale forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there
like a serpent's tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm god god
is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill
continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a
fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this

overhearing starbuck the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
braces though not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast
mate's thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but
dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the
burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to
transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end
petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke 

all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and
heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye
may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out
the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
flame

as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of
some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so
much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts
so at those last words of ahab's many of the mariners did run from him
in a terror of dismay



chapter the deck towards the end of the first night watch

ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him


we must send down the main-top-sail yard sir the band is working loose
and the lee lift is half-stranded shall i strike it sir

strike nothing lash it if i had sky-sail poles i'd sway them up
now

sir in god's name sir

well

the anchors are working sir shall i get them inboard

strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rises
but it has not got up to my table-lands yet quick and see to it by
masts and keels he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some
coasting smack send down my main-top-sail yard ho gluepots loftiest
trucks were made for wildest winds and this brain-truck of mine now
sails amid the cloud-scud shall i strike that oh none but cowards
send down their brain-trucks in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft
there i would e'en take it for sublime did i not know that the colic
is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine



chapter midnight the forecastle bulwarks


stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashings over
the anchors there hanging


no stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you
will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long
ago is it since you said the very contrary didn't you once say that
whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its
insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft
and boxes of lucifers forward stop now didn't you say so

well suppose i did what then i've part changed my flesh since that
time why not my mind besides supposing we are loaded with powder
barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get
afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have
pretty red hair but you couldn't get afire now shake yourself you're
aquarius or the water-bearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat
collar don't you see then that for these extra risks the marine
insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but
hark again and i'll answer ye the other thing first take your leg off
from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope
now listen what's the mighty difference between holding a mast's
lightning-rod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasn't
got any lightning-rod at all in a storm don't you see you timber-head
that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first
struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred
carries rods and ahab aye man and all of us were in no more
danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand
ships now sailing the seas why you king-post you i suppose you would
have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running
up the corner of his hat like a militia officer's skewered feather
and trailing behind like his sash why don't ye be sensible flask it's
easy to be sensible why don't ye then any man with half an eye can be
sensible

i don't know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard

yes when a fellow's soaked through it's hard to be sensible that's
a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the
turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two
anchors here flask seems like tying a man's hands behind him and what
big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists
hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is
anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable
though there hammer that knot down and we've done so next to
touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just
wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at long-togs
so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn
in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry
off the water d'ye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gable-end
eave-troughs flask no more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me i
must mount a swallow-tail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew
there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come
from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad



chapter midnight aloft thunder and lightning


the main-top-sail yard tashtego passing new lashings around it


um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here what's
the use of thunder um um um we don't want thunder we want rum give
us a glass of rum um um um



chapter the musket


during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequod's
jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached
to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller was
indispensable

in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the
pequod's at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is
a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotion

some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the
strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and the
other aft the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like
the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when
that storm-tossed bird is on the wing

the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a
storm-trysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through
the water with some precision again and the course for the present
east-south-east which he was to steer if practicable was once more
given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only
steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the
ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo
a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze
became fair

instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ho the
fair wind oh-ye-ho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so
promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
preceding it

in compliance with the standing order of his commander to report
immediately and at any one of the twenty-four hours any decided change
in the affairs of the deck starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to
the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily than he mechanically went
below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance

ere knocking at his state-room he involuntarily paused before it
a moment the cabin lamp taking long swings this way and that was
burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's bolted
door a thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels
the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of
the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as
they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest
upright man but out of starbuck's heart at that instant when he saw
the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with
its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew
it for itself

he would have shot me once he murmured yes there's the very musket
that he pointed at me that one with the studded stock let me touch
it lift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances
strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and
powder in the pan that's not good best spill it wait i'll cure
myself of this i'll hold the musket boldly while i think i come
to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and
doom that's fair for moby dick it's a fair wind that's only fair for
that accursed fish the very tube he pointed at me the very one
this one i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i
handle now aye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say
he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly
quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere
dead reckoning of the error-abounding log and in this very typhoon did
he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods but shall this crazed
old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom
with him yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my
soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this
instant put aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in
his sleep yes just there in there he's sleeping sleeping aye
but still alive and soon awake again i can't withstand thee then old
man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to
all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is
all thou breathest aye and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow say'st
all of us are ahabs great god forbid but is there no other way no
lawful way make him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest
this old man's living power from his own living hands only a fool
would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes
and hawsers chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor he would
be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the
sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself
inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what
then remains the land is hundreds of leagues away and locked japan
the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and
a whole continent between me and law aye aye tis so is heaven
a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed
tindering sheets and skin together and would i be a murderer then
if and slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the
loaded musket's end against the door

on this level ahab's hammock swings within his head this way a
touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again oh
mary mary boy boy boy but if i wake thee not to death old man
who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck's body this day week
may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall
i the wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails
are reefed and set she heads her course

stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last

such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
tormented sleep as if starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb dream
to speak

the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the panel
starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he
placed the death-tube in its rack and left the place

he's too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell
him i must see to the deck here thou know'st what to say



chapter the needle


next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk and striving in the pequod's gurgling track pushed her on
like giants palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded
so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world
boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible
sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his
bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian
kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a crucible of
molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat

long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time
the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye
the bright sun's rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by
the stern he turned behind and saw the sun's rearward place and how
the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake

ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye
yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea

but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the
helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading

east-sou-east sir said the frightened steersman

thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this
hour in the morning and the sun astern

upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then
observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the cause

thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse
of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost
seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two
compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west

but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew
the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened
before mr starbuck last night's thunder turned our compasses that's
all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it

aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate
gloomily

here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as
developed in the mariner's needle is as all know essentially one with
the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled
at that such things should be instances where the lightning has
actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and
rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal
all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic
steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle but in
either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original
virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected
the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were
the lowermost one inserted into the kelson

deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed
compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took
the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were
exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ship's course to be
changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod
thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair
one had only been juggling her

meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing
but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flask who
in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings likewise
unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly
rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as
ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed
or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
congenial hearts from inflexible ahab's

for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but
chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper
sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck

thou poor proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot yesterday i wrecked
thee and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but
ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbuck a lance without
a pole a top-maul and the smallest of the sail-maker's needles
quick

accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to
revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a
matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old
man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily
practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors
without some shudderings and evil portents

men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed
him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahab's
needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that
will point as true as any

abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this
was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
follow but starbuck looked away

with a blow from the top-maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the
lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade
him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul
after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the
blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered
that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then
going through some small strange motions with it whether indispensable
to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe
of the crew is uncertain he called for linen thread and moving to the
binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally
suspended the sail-needle by its middle over one of the compass-cards
at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at
either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had
been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the
binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed look
ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun
is east and that compass swears it

one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk
away

in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his
fatal pride



chapter the log and line


while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log
and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance
upon other means of determining the vessel's place some merchantmen
and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the
log though at the same time and frequently more for form's sake than
anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of
progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden
reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the
railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and
wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he
happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene
and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic
oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly
astern the billows rolled in riots

forward there heave the log

two seamen came the golden-hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take
the reel one of ye i'll heave

they went towards the extreme stern on the ship's lee side where the
deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into
the creamy sidelong-rushing sea

the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting
handle-ends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so
stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him

ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard when the old
manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to
speak

sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have
spoiled it

twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee
thou seem'st to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it

i hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these
grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a
superior who'll ne'er confess

what's that there now's a patched professor in queen nature's
granite-founded college but methinks he's too subservient where wert
thou born

in the little rocky isle of man sir

excellent thou'st hit the world by that

i know not sir but i was born there

in the isle of man hey well the other way it's good here's a man
from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man
which is sucked in by what up with the reel the dead blind wall
butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so

the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in
turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing
resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely

hold hard

snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging
log was gone

i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad
sea parts the log-line but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian
reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and
mend thou the line see to it

there he goes now to him nothing's happened but to me the skewer
seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in
tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and
dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip

pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whale-boat pip's missing
let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here fisherman it drags
hard i guess he's holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul
in no cowards here ho there's his arm just breaking water a hatchet
a hatchet cut it off we haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir
sir here's pip trying to get on board again

peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm
away from the quarter-deck

the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing
hands off from that holiness where sayest thou pip was boy

astern there sir astern lo lo

and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
thy eyes oh god that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve
through who art thou boy

bell-boy sir ship's-crier ding dong ding pip pip pip
one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip five feet high looks
cowardly quickest known by that ding dong ding who's seen pip the
coward

there can be no hearts above the snow-line oh ye frozen heavens look
down here ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him
ye creative libertines here boy ahab's cabin shall be pip's home
henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou
art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings come let's down

what's this here's velvet shark-skin intently gazing at ahab's hand
and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this
perhaps he had ne'er been lost this seems to me sir as a man-rope
something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now come
and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i
will not let this go

oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in
gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods
oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not
what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come
i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an
emperor's

there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with
strength the other daft with weakness but here's the end of the rotten
line all dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new
line altogether i'll see mr stubb about it



chapter the life-buoy


steering now south-eastward by ahab's levelled steel and her progress
solely determined by ahab's level log and line the pequod held on
her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such
unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled
by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed
the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene

at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the
equatorial fishing-ground and in the deep darkness that goes before the
dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watch then headed
by flask was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly like
half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod's murdered
innocents that one and all they started from their reveries and for
the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly
listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained
within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was
mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled
yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of all declared that the wild
thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men
in the sea

below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when
he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus
explained the wonder

those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams
that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company
with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this
only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a
very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their
peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their
round heads and semi-intelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from
the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have
more than once been mistaken for men

but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at
sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore
and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus
with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he
had not been long at his perch when a cry was heard a cry and a
rushing and looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and
looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
sea

the life-buoy a long slender cask was dropped from the stern where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it
slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and
the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to
yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one

and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out
for the white whale on the white whale's own peculiar ground that man
was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the
time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at
least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil
in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they
declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had
heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay

the lost life-buoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see
to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as
in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be
therefore they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a
buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint
concerning his coffin

a life-buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting

rather queer that i should say said stubb

it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can
arrange it easily

bring it up there's nothing else for it said starbuck after a
melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me so the coffin
i mean dost thou hear me rig it

and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer

aye

and shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with a
caulking-iron

aye

and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand as
with a pitch-pot

away what possesses thee to this make a life-buoy of the coffin and
no more mr stubb mr flask come forward with me

he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the parts he baulks
now i don't like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it
like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he won't put
his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin
and now i'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it it's like turning an old
coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i don't like this
cobbling sort of business i don't like it at all it's undignified
it's not my place let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their
betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair-and-square
mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and
is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not
a cobbler's job that's at an end in the middle and at the beginning at
the end it's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord
what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an old woman of
sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once and that's
the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when
i kept my job-shop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their
lonely old heads to run off with me but heigh-ho there are no caps at
sea but snow-caps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay
over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the
snap-spring over the ship's stern were ever such things done before
with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied
up in the rigging ere they would do the job but i'm made of knotty
aroostook hemlock i don't budge cruppered with a coffin sailing
about with a grave-yard tray but never mind we workers in woods make
bridal-bedsteads and card-tables as well as coffins and hearses we
work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask
the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling
and then we stash it if we can hem i'll do the job now tenderly
i'll have me let's see how many in the ship's company all told but
i've forgotten any way i'll have me thirty separate turk's-headed
life-lines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then
if the hull go down there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for
one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer
caulking-iron pitch-pot and marling-spike let's to it



chapter the deck


the coffin laid upon two line-tubs between the vice-bench and the open
hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum
slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of
his frock ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway and hears pip
following him


back lad i will be with ye again presently he goes not this hand
complies with my humor more genially than that boy middle aisle of a
church what's here

life-buoy sir mr starbuck's orders oh look sir beware the
hatchway

thank ye man thy coffin lies handy to the vault

sir the hatchway oh so it does sir so it does

art not thou the leg-maker look did not this stump come from thy
shop

i believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir

well enough but art thou not also the undertaker

aye sir i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg but
they've set me now to turning it into something else

then tell me art thou not an arrant all-grasping intermeddling
monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the
next day coffins to clap them in and yet again life-buoys out of those
same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a
jack-of-all-trades

but i do not mean anything sir i do as i do

the gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes and the grave-digger in the play sings spade in
hand dost thou never

sing sir do i sing oh i'm indifferent enough sir for that but
the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there
was none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark
to it

aye and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board and what in
all things makes the sounding-board is this there's naught beneath and
yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same carpenter
hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against
the churchyard gate going in

faith sir i've 

faith what's that

why faith sir it's only a sort of exclamation-like that's all
sir

um um go on

i was about to say sir that 

art thou a silk-worm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself
look at thy bosom despatch and get these traps out of sight

he goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot
latitudes i've heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos
is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of
equator cuts yon old man too right in his middle he's always under
the line fiery hot i tell ye he's looking this way come oakum
quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and i'm the
professor of musical glasses tap tap

ahab to himself

there's a sight there's a sound the grey-headed woodpecker tapping
the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that
thing rests on two line-tubs full of tow-lines a most malicious wag
that fellow rat-tat so man's seconds tick oh how immaterial are all
materials what things real are there but imponderable thoughts here
now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made
the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life
a life-buoy of a coffin does it go further can it be that in some
spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortality-preserver
i'll think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth
that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain
twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed
sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return
again now then pip we'll talk this over i do suck most wondrous
philosophies from thee some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds
must empty into thee



chapter the pequod meets the rachel


next day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directly down
upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the
time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from
the smitten hull

bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her
commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he
could hopefully hail ahab's voice was heard

hast seen the white whale

aye yesterday have ye seen a whale-boat adrift

throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question
and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain
himself having stopped his vessel's way was seen descending her
side a few keen pulls and his boat-hook soon clinched the pequod's
main-chains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognised by
ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged

where was he not killed not killed cried ahab closely advancing
how was it

it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while
three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which
had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were
yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had
suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon
the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had been instantly lowered in
chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat the swiftest
keeled of all seemed to have succeeded in fastening at least as
well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it in the
distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam
of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was
concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with
his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no
positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging
darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward
boats ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite
direction the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to
its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance
from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded
all sail stunsail on stunsail after the missing boat kindling a fire
in her try-pots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look-out
but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the
presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then
paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not finding
anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and
though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least
glimpse of the missing keel had been seen

the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his
object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his
own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were

i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one
in that missing boat wore off that captain's best coat mayhap his
watch he's so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two
pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of
the whaling season see flask only see how pale he looks pale in the
very buttons of his eyes look it wasn't the coat it must have been
the 

my boy my own boy is among them for god's sake i beg i
conjure here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far
had but icily received his petition for eight-and-forty hours let me
charter your ship i will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for it if
there be no other way for eight-and-forty hours only only that you
must oh you must and you shall do this thing

his son cried stubb oh it's his son he's lost i take back the
coat and watch what says ahab we must save that boy

he's drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manx
sailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirits

now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachel's
the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the
captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew but among
the number of the other boat's crews at the same time but on the other
hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase
there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched
father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which
was only solved for him by his chief mate's instinctively adopting the
ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies that is when
placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the
majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason
had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by
ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad
but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving
hardihood of a nantucketer's paternal love had thus early sought to
initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially
the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that
nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them
for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than
their own so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall
be unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely
partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern

meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab
and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without
the least quivering of his own

i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me
as you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy
captain ahab though but a child and nestling safely at home now a
child of your old age too yes yes you relent i see it run run
men now and stand by to square in the yards

avast cried ahab touch not a rope-yarn then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every word captain gardiner i will not do it
even now i lose time good-bye good-bye god bless ye man and may i
forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch
and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers
then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before

hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment
gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his
boat and returned to his ship

soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel
was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot
however small on the sea this way and that her yards were swung round
starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a
head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her
masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry
trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs

but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw
that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort
she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not



chapter the cabin


ahab moving to go on deck pip catches him by the hand to follow

lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming
when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him
there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady
like cures like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired
health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as if
thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed
chair another screw to it thou must be

no no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg only tread upon me sir i ask no more so i remain a
part of ye

oh spite of million villains this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
fidelity of man and a black and crazy but methinks like-cures-like
applies to him too he grows so sane again

they tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose
drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin
but i will never desert ye sir as stubb did him sir i must go with
ye

if thou speakest thus to me much more ahab's purpose keels up in him
i tell thee no it cannot be

oh good master master master

weep so and i will murder thee have a care for ahab too is mad
listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still
know that i am there and now i quit thee thy hand met true art
thou lad as the circumference to its centre so god for ever bless
thee and if it come to that god for ever save thee let what will
befall

ahab goes pip steps one step forward


here he this instant stood i stand in his air but i'm alone now
were even poor pip here i could endure it but he's missing pip pip
ding dong ding who's seen pip he must be up here let's try the
door what neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet there's no opening
it it must be the spell he told me to stay here aye and told me this
screwed chair was mine here then i'll seat me against the transom
in the ship's full middle all her keel and her three masts before me
here our old sailors say in their black seventy-fours great
admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains and
lieutenants ha what's this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come
crowding pass round the decanters glad to see ye fill up monsieurs
what an odd feeling now when a black boy's host to white men with gold
lace upon their coats monsieurs have ye seen one pip a little
negro lad five feet high hang-dog look and cowardly jumped from a
whale-boat once seen him no well then fill up again captains and
let's drink shame upon all cowards i name no names shame upon them
put one foot upon the table shame upon all cowards hist above there
i hear ivory oh master master i am indeed down-hearted when you walk
over me but here i'll stay though this stern strikes rocks and they
bulge through and oysters come to join me



chapter the hat


and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling waters swept seemed to
have chased his foe into an ocean-fold to slay him the more securely
there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
encountered moby dick and now that all his successive meetings with
various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference
with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned
against now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes
which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting
polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night
sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahab's purpose now
fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it
domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings
fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a
single spear or leaf

in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural
vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove
to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to
finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of
ahab's iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever
conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them

but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when
he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that
even as ahab's eyes so awed the crew's the inscrutable parsee's glance
awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it
such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah
now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious
at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal
substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
being's body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by
night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go
below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan
but wondrous eyes did plainly say we two watchmen never rest

nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivot-hole or
exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits the main-mast
and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle his
living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched
heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the
days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock
yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly
whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether
he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in
the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night-damp
gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat the
clothes that the night had wet the next day's sunshine dried upon him
and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath
the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for

he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals breakfast and
dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew
all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow
idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though
his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsee's
mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never
seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long intervals some
passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell
seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awe-struck crew
they seemed pole-like asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word
by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal
interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they
stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by
the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the
parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned
substance

and yet somehow did ahab in his own proper self as daily hourly
and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates ahab
seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both
seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade
siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel
was solid ahab

at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard
from aft man the mast-heads and all through the day till after
sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of
the helmsman's bell was heard what d'ye see sharp sharp

but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the
children-seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac
old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity at least of nearly
all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether
stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if
these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally
expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them

i will have the first sight of the whale myself he said aye
ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest
of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved
block to secure to the main-mast head he received the two ends of the
downward-reeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that
end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon
his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon
daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his
firm relying eye upon the chief mate said take the rope sir i give
it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket
he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being
the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and
thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad
upon the sea for miles and miles ahead astern this side and
that within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height

when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is
hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these
circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a
wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft
cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the
deck and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes
cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if
unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some
carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the
sea so ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only
strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one
only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the
slightest degree approaching to decision one of those too whose
faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat it was
strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman
freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's
hands

now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten
minutes one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet
straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying
again round his head

but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed
not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked
it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least
heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
sight

your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who
being posted at the mizen-mast-head stood directly behind ahab though
somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing
them

but already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes the long
hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with
his prize

an eagle flew thrice round tarquin's head removing his cap to replace
it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would
be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
accounted good ahab's hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and
on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while
from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly
discerned falling from that vast height into the sea



chapter the pequod meets the delight


the intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably
misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were
fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whaling-ships
cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to
carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats

upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and
some few splintered planks of what had once been a whale-boat but you
now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled
half-unhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse

hast seen the white whale

look replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail and with
his trumpet he pointed to the wreck

hast killed him

the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the
other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered
sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together

not forged and snatching perth's levelled iron from the crotch ahab
held it out exclaiming look ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold
his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs
and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin
where the white whale most feels his accursed life

then god keep thee old man see'st thou that pointing to the
hammock i bury but one of five stout men who were alive only
yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were
buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his
crew are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and
lift the body so then oh god advancing towards the hammock with
uplifted hands may the resurrection and the life 

brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men

but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so
quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
her hull with their ghostly baptism

as ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange life-buoy
hanging at the pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief

ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake
in vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn us your
taffrail to show us your coffin



chapter the symphony


it was a clear steel-blue day the firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable in that all-pervading azure only the pensive air was
transparently pure and soft with a woman's look and the robust and
man-like sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samson's
chest in his sleep

hither and thither on high glided the snow-white wings of small
unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air
but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed
mighty leviathans sword-fish and sharks and these were the strong
troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea

but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and
shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were
that distinguished them

aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the
girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motion most seen
here at the equator denoted the fond throbbing trust the loving
alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away

tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm
and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the
ashes of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's
forehead of heaven

oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged
creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how
oblivious were ye of old ahab's close-coiled woe but so have i seen
little miriam and martha laughing-eyed elves heedlessly gambol around
their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain

slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and
watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more
and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely
aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment
the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome
sky did at last stroke and caress him the step-mother world so long
cruel forbidding now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck
and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however
wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to
bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea
nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop

starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side
and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch
him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there

ahab turned

starbuck

sir

oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such
a day very much such a sweetness as this i struck my first whale a
boy-harpooneer of eighteen forty forty forty years ago ago forty
years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and
storm-time forty years on the pitiless sea for forty years has ahab
forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors
of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty years i have not
spent three ashore when i think of this life i have led the desolation
of solitude it has been the masoned walled-town of a captain's
exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
green country without oh weariness heaviness guinea-coast slavery of
solitary command when i think of all this only half-suspected not so
keenly known to me before and how for forty years i have fed upon dry
salted fare fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil when the
poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the
world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts away whole oceans away from
that young girl-wife i wedded past fifty and sailed for cape horn
the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow wife
wife rather a widow with her husband alive aye i widowed that poor
girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the frenzy
the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand
lowerings old ahab has furiously foamingly chased his prey more a
demon than a man aye aye what a forty years fool fool old fool
has old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy
the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or
better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this
weary load i bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under
me here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that i seem to weep
locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes but do i look
very old so very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and
humped as though i were adam staggering beneath the piled
centuries since paradise god god god crack my heart stave my
brain mockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hairs have
i lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old
close stand close to me starbuck let me look into a human eye it is
better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon god by
the green land by the bright hearth-stone this is the magic glass
man i see my wife and my child in thine eye no no stay on board on
board lower not when i do when branded ahab gives chase to moby dick
that hazard shall not be thine no no not with the far away home i see
in that eye

oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why
should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let us
fly these deadly waters let us home wife and child too are
starbuck's wife and child of his brotherly sisterly play-fellow
youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving
longing paternal old age away let us away this instant let me alter
the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl
on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such
mild blue days even as this in nantucket

they have they have i have seen them some summer days in the
morning about this time yes it is his noon nap now the boy
vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of
cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back
to dance him again

tis my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning
should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's
sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my
captain study out the course and let us away see see the boy's face
from the window the boy's hand on the hill

but ahab's glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and
cast his last cindered apple to the soil

what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what
cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor
commands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep
pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not
so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this
arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errand-boy
in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power
how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think
thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that
living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in
this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all
the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon
albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish where
do murderers go man who's to doom when the judge himself is dragged
to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and
the air smells now as if it blew from a far-away meadow they have been
making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the
mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay sleeping aye toil we how
we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid
greenness as last year's scythes flung down and left in the half-cut
swaths starbuck

but blanched to a corpse's hue with despair the mate had stolen away

ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at
two reflected fixed eyes in the water there fedallah was motionlessly
leaning over the same rail



chapter the chase first day


that night in the mid-watch when the old man as his wont at
intervals stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went
to his pivot-hole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing
up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will in drawing nigh to
some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that
peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the
living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner
surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dog-vane and
then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible
ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be slightly altered and the
sail to be shortened

the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery
wrinkles bordering it the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
tide-rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream

man the mast-heads call all hands

thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
deck daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear
with their clothes in their hands

what d'ye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky

nothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply

t'gallant sails stunsails alow and aloft and on both sides

all sail being set he now cast loose the life-line reserved for
swaying him to the main royal-mast head and in a few moments they were
hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft
and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail he raised a gull-like cry in the
air there she blows there she blows a hump like a snow-hill it is
moby dick

fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
look-outs the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final
perch some feet above the other look-outs tashtego standing just
beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast so that the indian's
head was almost on a level with ahab's heel from this height the whale
was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing
his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the
air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had
so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans

and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perched men
all around him

i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i
cried out said tashtego

not the same instant not the same no the doubloon is mine fate
reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the
white whale first there she blows there she blows there she blows
there again there again he cried in long-drawn lingering methodic
tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible jets
he's going to sound in stunsails down top-gallant-sails stand by
three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship
helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go
flukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by
stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower quick quicker and he
slid through the air to the deck

he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right away from
us cannot have seen the ship yet

be dumb man stand by the braces hard down the helm brace up
shiver her shiver her so well that boats boats

soon all the boats but starbuck's were dropped all the boat-sails
set all the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to
leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale death-glimmer lit up
fedallah's sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth

like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea
but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grew
still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a
noon-meadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came
so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump
was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing
and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish
foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head
beyond before it far out on the soft turkish-rugged waters went
the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical
rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters
interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but
these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly
feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to
some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but
shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back
and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering and
to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and
rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons

a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested
the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with
ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering
eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness
rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that
great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale as he so
divinely swam

on each soft side coincident with the parted swell that but once
leaving him then flowed so wide away on each bright side the whale
shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who
namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured
to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all
who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way
thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed before

and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among
waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby
dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw
but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant
his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia's natural
bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the
grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly
halting and dipping on the wing the white sea-fowls longingly lingered
over the agitated pool that he left

with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the
three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dick's reappearance

an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boat's stern and he gazed
beyond the whale's place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now
freshened the sea began to swell

the birds the birds cried tashtego

in long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were
now all flying towards ahab's boat and when within a few yards began
fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous
expectant cries their vision was keener than man's ahab could discover
no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its
depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose
till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked
rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable
bottom it was moby dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast
shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the
glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble
tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled
the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon
fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and
seizing perth's harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
stand by to stern

now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its
bow by anticipation was made to face the whale's head while yet
under water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that
malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself
as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath
the boat

through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for
an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of
a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock the bluish
pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab's
head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with
unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the
tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the
uttermost stern

and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the
whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his
body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from
the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and
while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and
helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized
the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the
frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an
enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain
and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two
floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew
at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast
to the oars to lash them across

at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first
to perceive the whale's intent by the crafty upraising of his head a
movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand
had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only
slipping further into the whale's mouth and tilting over sideways as it
slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of
it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea

ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little
distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more feet
out of the water the now rising swells with all their confluent waves
dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray
still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel
billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to
overleap its summit with their scud


this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation
pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down
poise of the whale-lance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously
described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
view whatever objects may be encircling him


but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful
wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault
the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of
grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus's elephants in the book
of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's
insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim though he could still
keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless
ahab's head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
might burst from the boat's fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and
mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not
succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves
for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale's aspect and so
planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made that he seemed
horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed
still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to
strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of
the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they
themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on
the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old
man's head

meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's
mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene
and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her sail on
the but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and
whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing
to rise on a towering crest he shouted sail on the whale drive him
off

the pequod's prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she
effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly swam
off the boats flew to the rescue

dragged into stubb's boat with blood-shot blinded eyes the white brine
caking in his wrinkles the long tension of ahab's bodily strength did
crack and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom for a time lying
all crushed in the bottom of stubb's boat like one trodden under foot
of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as
desolate sounds from out ravines

but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate it in an instant's compass great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through feebler men's whole lives and so such hearts though summary
in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their
life-time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous
intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures
contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls

the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one
bended arm is it safe

aye sir for it was not darted this is it said stubb showing it

lay it before me any missing men

one two three four five there were five oars sir and here are
five men

that's good help me man i wish to stand so so i see him there
there going to leeward still what a leaping spout hands off from me
the eternal sap runs up in ahab's bones again set the sail out oars
the helm

it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked
up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus
continued with what is called double-banked oars it was thus now but
the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale
for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin swimming with a
velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances
pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a
hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an
unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable
only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then as it
sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of
overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were
soon swayed up to their cranes the two parts of the wrecked boat having
been previously secured by her and then hoisting everything to her
side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it
with stun-sails like the double-jointed wings of an albatross the
pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby-dick at the well known
methodic intervals the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced
from the manned mast-heads and when he would be reported as just gone
down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnacle-watch
in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his
voice was heard whose is the doubloon now d'ye see him and if the
reply was no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his
perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless
anon unrestingly pacing the planks

as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft
or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still
greater breadth thus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at
every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon
the quarter-deck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern
at last he paused before it and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh
troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old man's face
there now stole some such added gloom as this

stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to
evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in
his captain's mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed the
thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha

what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did
i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could swear
thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck

aye sir said starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen
and an ill one

omen omen the dictionary if the gods think to speak outright to
man they will honourably speak outright not shake their heads and
give an old wives darkling hint begone ye two are the opposite poles
of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and
ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of
the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors cold cold i
shiver how now aloft there d'ye see him sing out for every spout
though he spout ten times a second

the day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling
soon it was almost dark but the look-out men still remained unset

can't see the spout now sir too dark cried a voice from the air

how heading when last seen

as before sir straight to leeward

good he will travel slower now tis night down royals and top-gallant
stun-sails mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning he's
making a passage now and may heave-to a while helm there keep her
full before the wind aloft come down mr stubb send a fresh hand
to the fore-mast head and see it manned till morning then advancing
towards the doubloon in the main-mast men this gold is mine for i
earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead
and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be
killed this gold is that man's and if on that day i shall again raise
him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away
now the deck is thine sir

and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and
slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervals
rousing himself to see how the night wore on



chapter the chase second day


at day-break the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh

d'ye see him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light
to spread

see nothing sir

turn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than i thought
for the top-gallant sails aye they should have been kept on her all
night but no matter tis but resting for the rush

here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale
continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing
by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the
wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence
acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they
will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both
the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of
sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period
and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of
a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires
shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this
pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the
cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright
the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the
fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and
diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night
obscures the fish the creature's future wake through the darkness
is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the
pilot's coast is to him so that to this hunter's wondrous skill the
proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the
mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in
its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate as
doctors that of a baby's pulse and lightly say of it the up train or
the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour
even so almost there are occasions when these nantucketers time that
other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his
speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have
gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of
latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in
the end the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies for of what
present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that
assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his
port inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile
matters touching the chase of whales

the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
cannon-ball missent becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
field

by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck
creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart this ship and i are two
brave fellows ha ha some one take me up and launch me spine-wise
on the sea for by live-oaks my spine's a keel ha ha we go the gait
that leaves no dust behind

there she blows she blows she blows right ahead was now the
mast-head cry

aye aye cried stubb i knew it ye can't escape blow on and
split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your
trump blister your lungs ahab will dam off your blood as a miller
shuts his watergate upon the stream

and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzies
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine
worked anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand
of fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of
the previous day the rack of the past night's suspense the fixed
unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled
along the wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race

they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all
though it was put together of all contrasting things oak and maple
and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these ran into each
other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and
directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of
the crew this man's valor that man's fear guilt and guiltiness all
varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal
goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to

the rigging lived the mast-heads like the tops of tall palms were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one
hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others
shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking
yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for
their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that might destroy them

why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard
sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd jet
that way and then disappears

it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whale-spout as the event itself soon proved for
hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its
pin on deck when he struck the key-note to an orchestra that made the
air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard as much nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead moby dick
bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white
whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths
the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of
air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the
distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged
waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his
act of defiance

there she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon-like to
heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved
against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for
the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and
stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale

aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour and
thy harpoon are at hand down down all of ye but one man at the fore
the boats stand by

unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds the men like
shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and
halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from
his perch

lower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boat a spare one
rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thine keep
away from the boats but keep near them lower all

as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first
assailant himself moby dick had turned and was now coming for the
three crews ahab's boat was central and cheering his men he told them
he would take the whale head-and-head that is pull straight up to his
forehead a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such
a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision
but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were
plain as the ship's three masts to his eye the white whale churning
himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing
among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling
battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every
boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which
those boats were made but skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling
like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him
though at times but by a plank's breadth while all the time ahab's
unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds

but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed
and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more
line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again hoping
that way to disencumber it of some snarls when lo a sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharks

caught and twisted corkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons
and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing
and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab's boat only one
thing could be done seizing the boat-knife he critically reached
within through and then without the rays of steel dragged in
the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice
sundering the rope near the chocks dropped the intercepted fagot of
steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant the white
whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines
by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and
flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on
a surf-beaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in
a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punch

while the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after
the revolving line-tubs oars and other floating furniture while
aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his
legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily
singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old man's
line now parting admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
rescue whom he could in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perils ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
heaven by invisible wires as arrow-like shooting perpendicularly
from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell
again gunwale downwards and ahab and his men struggled out from under
it like seals from a sea-side cave

the first uprising momentum of the whale modifying its direction as
he struck the surface involuntarily launched him along it to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his
back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip
or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and
came sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his
leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace

as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again
came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the
floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and
safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and
ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable
intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as
with fedallah the day before so ahab was now found grimly clinging to
his boat's broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor
did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap

but when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory
leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter

aye aye starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he
will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has

the ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i
put good work into that leg

but no bones broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern

aye and all splintered to pieces stubb d'ye see it but even with
a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i account no living bone of
mine one jot more me than this dead one that's lost nor white whale
nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and
inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape
yonder roof aloft there which way

dead to leeward sir

up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers down the rest of
the spare boats and rig them mr starbuck away and muster the boat's
crews

let me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir

oh oh oh how this splinter gores me now accursed fate that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate

sir

my body man not thee give me something for a cane there that
shivered lance will do muster the men surely i have not seen him yet
by heaven it cannot be missing quick call them all

the old man's hinted thought was true upon mustering the company the
parsee was not there

the parsee cried stubb he must have been caught in 

the black vomit wrench thee run all of ye above alow cabin
forecastle find him not gone not gone

but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was
nowhere to be found

aye sir said stubb caught among the tangles of your line i
thought i saw him dragging under

my line my line gone gone what means that little word what
death-knell rings in it that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry
the harpoon too toss over the litter there d'ye see it the forged
iron men the white whale's no no no blistered fool this hand did
dart it tis in the fish aloft there keep him nailed quick all
hands to the rigging of the boats collect the oars harpooneers
the irons the irons hoist the royals higher a pull on all the
sheets helm there steady steady for your life i'll ten times girdle
the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but i'll slay
him yet

great god but for one single instant show thyself cried starbuck
never never wilt thou capture him old man in jesus name no more of
this that's worse than devil's madness two days chased twice stove
to splinters thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil
shadow gone all good angels mobbing thee with warnings 

what more wouldst thou have shall we keep chasing this murderous fish
till he swamps the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom
of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh
oh impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more

starbuck of late i've felt strangely moved to thee ever since that
hour we both saw thou know'st what in one another's eyes but in this
matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
hand a lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this
whole act's immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
years before this ocean rolled fool i am the fates lieutenant i act
under orders look thou underling that thou obeyest mine stand round
me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered
lance propped up on a lonely foot tis ahab his body's part but
ahab's soul's a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel
strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale
and i may look so but ere i break ye'll hear me crack and till ye hear
that know that ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet believe ye men in
the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they
drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again
to sink for evermore so with moby dick two days he's floated tomorrow
will be the third aye men he'll rise once more but only to spout
his last d'ye feel brave men brave

as fearless fire cried stubb

and as mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he
muttered on the things called omens and yesterday i talked the same
to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek
to drive out of others hearts what's clinched so fast in mine the
parsee the parsee gone gone and he was to go before but still was
to be seen again ere i could perish how's that there's a riddle now
might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line
of judges like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain i'll i'll solve it
though

when dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward

so once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as
on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns
in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
their fresh weapons for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of
ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as
on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his
hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due
eastward for the earliest sun



chapter the chase third day


the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
daylight look-outs who dotted every mast and almost every spar

d'ye see him cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight

in his infallible wake though but follow that wake that's all helm
there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day
again were it a new-made world and made for a summer-house to the
angels and this morning the first of its throwing open to them a
fairer day could not dawn upon that world here's food for thought had
ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels
that's tingling enough for mortal man to think's audacity god only has
that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a
calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much
for that and yet i've sometimes thought my brain was very calm frozen
calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents
turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this
moment growing and heat must breed it but no it's like that sort
of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of
greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip
it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they
cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison
corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and
now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon it it's
tainted were i the wind i'd blow no more on such a wicked miserable
world i'd crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet tis a
noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight
it has the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run
through it ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not
stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thing a nobler
thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the things
that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are
bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents there's a most
special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i
say again and swear it now that there's something all glorious and
gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the
clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous
mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of
the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift
and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal
poles these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on these
trades or something like them something so unchangeable and full as
strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what d'ye see

nothing sir

nothing and noon at hand the doubloon goes a-begging see the sun
aye aye it must be so i've oversailed him how got the start aye
he's chasing me now not i him that's bad i might have known it too
fool the lines the harpoons he's towing aye aye i have run him by
last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look
outs man the braces

steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequod's
quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced
ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
white wake

against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured starbuck to
himself as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail god keep
us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my
flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him

stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket
we should meet him soon

aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahab's bidding and once
more ahab swung on high

a whole hour now passed gold-beaten out to ages time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the
weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three
mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced
it

forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck
there brace sharper up crowd her into the wind's eye he's too
far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over that
helmsman with a top-maul so so he travels fast and i must down but
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there's
time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and
not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sand-hills of
nantucket the same the same the same to noah as to me there's
a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead
somewhere to something else than common land more palmy than the
palms leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward
then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old
mast-head what's this green aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks
no such green weather stains on ahab's head there's the difference now
between man's old age and matter's but aye old mast we both grow old
together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship aye minus
a leg that's all by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
flesh every way i can't compare with it and i've known some ships made
of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of
vital fathers what's that he said he should still go before me my
pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes at the
bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all
night i've been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye
like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself o parsee
but ahab there thy shot fell short good-bye mast-head keep a good
eye upon the whale the while i'm gone we'll talk to-morrow nay
to-night when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail

he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck

in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallop's
stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the
mate who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck and bade him pause

starbuck

sir

for the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage starbuck

aye sir thou wilt have it so

some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing
starbuck

truth sir saddest truth

some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of
the flood and i feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb
starbuck i am old shake hands with me man

their hands met their eyes fastened starbuck's tears the glue

oh my captain my captain noble heart go not go not see it's a
brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then

lower away cried ahab tossing the mate's arm from him stand by
the crew

in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern

the sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabin-window there
o master my master come back

but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was high-lifted then and the
boat leaped on

yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when
numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they
dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their
bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in
those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in
the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching
regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that had been
observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried
and whether it was that ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow
barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the
sharks a matter sometimes well known to affect them however it was
they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others

heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and
following with his eyes the receding boat canst thou yet ring boldly
to that sight lowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by
them open-mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day for
when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure
the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening
and the end of that thing be that end what it may oh my god what
is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet
expectant fixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me
as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim
mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to
see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem
clearing but clouds sweep between is my journey's end coming my legs
feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heart beats
it yet stir thyself starbuck stave it off move move
speak aloud mast-head there see ye my boy's hand on the
hill crazed aloft there keep thy keenest eye upon the boats 

mark well the whale ho again drive off that hawk see he pecks he
tears the vane pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck ha
he soars away with it where's the old man now see'st thou that sight
oh ahab shudder shudder

the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mast-heads a
downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but
intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little
sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest
silence as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the
opposing bow

drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads
drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no
hearse can be mine and hemp only can kill me ha ha

suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then
quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a
subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with
trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise
but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it
hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back
into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whale

give way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to
the attack but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in
him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
from heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together
as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more
flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two
mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows
but leaving ahab's almost without a scar

while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the
whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round
and round to the fish's back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which
during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment
frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab

the harpoon dropped from his hand

befooled befooled drawing in a long lean breath aye parsee i
see thee again aye and thou goest before and this this then is the
hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of
thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those
boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to
me if not ahab is enough to die down men the first thing that but
offers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are
not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey me where's the
whale gone down again

but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily
swimming forward and had almost passed the ship which thus far had
been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present
her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost
velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the
sea

oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third
day to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that
madly seekest him

setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding
by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck's face as he
leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow
him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he
saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three
mast-heads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in
repairing them one after the other through the port-holes as he sped
he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves
on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he
heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving
a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or
flag was gone from the main-mast-head he shouted to tashtego who had
just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer
and nails and so nail it to the mast

whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white
whale's way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly
nearing him once more though indeed the whale's last start had not been
so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves the
unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the
boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became
jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost
every dip

heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on
tis the better rest the shark's jaw than the yielding water

but at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller

they will last long enough pull on but who can tell he
muttered whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
ahab but pull on aye all alive now we near him the helm take the
helm let me pass and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
to the bows of the still flying boat

at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along
with the white whale's flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advance as the whale sometimes will and ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whale's spout curled
round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when
with body arched back and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked
into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh
flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly
canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the
gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed
into the sea as it was three of the oarsmen who foreknew not the
precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its
effects these were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of
them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing
wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly
dropping astern but still afloat and swimming

almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated
instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering
sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air

what breaks in me some sinew cracks tis whole again oars oars
burst in upon him

hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking it it may be a
larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing
prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam

ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hands
stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way is't night

the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen

oars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for
ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see
the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship

but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledge-hammering seas the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves its half-wading splashing crew trying
hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water

meantime for that one beholding instant tashtego's mast-head hammer
remained suspended in his hand and the red flag half-wrapping him as
with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own
forward-flowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the
bowsprit beneath caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
as he

the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powers of air
now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman's
fainting fit up helm i say ye fools the jaw the jaw is this the
end of all my bursting prayers all my life-long fidelities oh ahab
ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again
he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one
whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now

stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help
stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale
who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb's own unwinking
eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too
soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou
grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of
as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet
ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou
grinning whale but there'll be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye
not o ahab for me off shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in
his drawers a most mouldy and over salted death though cherries
cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die

cherries i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope
my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this if not few coppers will
now come to her for the voyage is up

from the ship's bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers
bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their
hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their
enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely
vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading
semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance
eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal
man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's
starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon their
faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook
on their bull-like necks through the breach they heard the waters
pour as mountain torrents down a flume

the ship the hearse the second hearse cried ahab from the boat
its wood could only be american

diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its
keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far
off the other bow but within a few yards of ahab's boat where for a
time he lay quiescent

i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer
oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only
god-bullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and pole-pointed
prow death-glorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i
cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh
lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in
my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in
ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber
of my death towards thee i roll thou all-destroying but unconquering
whale to the last i grapple with thee from hell's heart i stab at
thee for hate's sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffins
and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let
me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee
thou damned whale thus i give up the spear

the harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting
velocity the line ran through the grooves ran foul ahab stooped to
clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the
neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was
shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the
heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty
tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its
depths

for an instant the tranced boat's crew stood still then turned the
ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana
only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or
fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers
still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now concentric
circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating
oar and every lance-pole and spinning animate and inanimate all
round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod
out of sight

but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag
which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying
billows they almost touched at that instant a red arm and a hammer
hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing
the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a sky-hawk that
tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the
hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill
the submerged savage beneath in his death-gasp kept his hammer frozen
there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his
imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the
flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink
to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and
helmeted herself with it

now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white
surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great
shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago




epilogue

and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job

the drama's done why then here does any one step forth because one
did survive the wreck

it so chanced that after the parsee's disappearance i was he whom the
fates ordained to take the place of ahab's bowsman when that bowsman
assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three
men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern so
floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it
when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i was then
but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had
subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting
towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling
circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital
centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of
its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great
force the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and
floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day
and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks
they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage sea-hawks
sailed with sheathed beaks on the second day a sail drew near nearer
and picked me up at last it was the devious-cruising rachel that in
her retracing search after her missing children only found another
orphan

 i stood in venice on the bridge sighs
a palace and a prison on each hand 
i saw from out the wave her structures rise
as from the stroke the enchanter s wand 
a thousand years their cloudy wings expand
around me and a dying glory smiles
o er the far times when many a subject land
look d to the winged lions marble piles
where venice sate in state throned on her hundred isles

the sun had disappeared behind the summits 
the tyrolean alps and the moon was already risen
above the low barrier the lido hundreds 
pedestrians were pouring out the narrow streets
 venice into the square st mark like water
gushing through some strait aqueduct into a broad
and bubbling basin gallant cavalier and grave

the hurried air and careless eye the measured

the song the cantatrice and the melody the

frown the improvisatore the pyramid the grotesque

most remarkable christendom
on the very confines that line which separates
western from eastern europe and in constant communication
with the latter venice possessed a
greater admixture character and costume than
any other the numerous ports that region a
portion this peculiarity is still to be observed
under the fallen fortunes the place but at the period
 our tale the city the isles though no
longer mistress the mediterranean nor even 
the adriatic was still rich and powerful her influence
was felt in the councils the civilized
world and her commerce though waning was yet
sufficient to uphold the vast possessions those
families whose ancestors had become rich in the
day her prosperity men lived among her islands
in that state incipient lethargy which marks the
progress a downward course whether the decline
be a moral or a physical decay
at the hour we have named the vast parallelogram
 the piazza was filling fast the cafes and
casinos within the porticoes which surround three
 its sides being already thronged with company
while all beneath the arches was gay and brilliant
with the flare torch and lamp the noble range
 edifices called the procurators the massive
pile the ducal palace the most ancient christian
church the granite columns the piazzetta the
triumphal masts the great square and the giddy
tower the campanile were slumbering in the
more mellow glow the moon
facing the wide area the great square stood the
quaint and venerable cathedral san marco a
temple trophies and one equally proclaiming the
prowess and the piety its founders this remarkable
structure presided over the other fixtures the
place like a monument the republic s antiquity

and mystery that well comported with the thick recollections
which crowd the mind as the eye gazes
at this rare relic the past

ornaments the place stood at hand the
base the campanile lay in shadow but a hundred
feet its gray summit received the full rays the
moon along its eastern face the masts destined
to bear the conquered ensigns candia constantinople
and the morea cut the air by its side in
dark and fairy lines while at the extremity the
smaller square and near the margin the sea the

the city each on his column african granite
were distinctly traced against the background 
the azure sky
it was near the base the former these massive
blocks stone that one stood who seemed to gaze
at the animated and striking scene with the listlessness
and indifference satiety a multitude some
in masques and others careless being known had
poured along the quay into the piazzetta on their
way to the principal square while this individual had
scarce turned a glance aside or changed a limb in
weariness his attitude was that patient practised
and obedient waiting on another s pleasure
with folded arms a bod poised on one leg and a
vacant though goodhumored eye lie appeared to
attend some beck authority ere lie quitted the
spot a silken jacket in wr
shakspearethe
evening such a day in a city with the
habits venice was not likely to be spent in the
dullness retirement the great sqinfre st
mark was again filled with its active and motley
crowd and the scenes already described in the
opening chapters this work were resumed if possible
with more apparent devotion to the levities 
the hour than on the occasion mentioned the
tumblers and jugglers renewed their antics the cries
 the fruitsellers and other venders light luxuries
were again mingled with the tones the flute and
the notes the guitar and harp while the idle and
the busy the thoughtless and the designing the conspirator
and the agent the police once more met
in privileged security
the night had advanced beyond its turn when a
gondola came gliding through the shipping the
port with that easy and sw t anlike motion which is
peculiar to its slow movement and touched the quay
with its beak at the point w here the canal st
mark forms its junction w with the bay
thou art welcome antonio said one who approached
the solitary individual that had directed
tke gondola when the latter had thrust the iron spike
 his painter between the crevices the stones as
gondoliers are accustomed to secure their barges 
thou art welcome antonio though late
i begin to know the sounds that voice though
they cone from a masked face said the fisherman
friend i owe my success today to thy kindness
and though it has not had the for which i had
both hoped and prayed i ought not to thank thee
the bravo 
less thou hast thyself been borne hard upon by
the world or thou would st not have bethought thee
 an old and despised man when the shouts triumph
were ringing in thy ear and when thy own
young blood was stirred with the feelings pride
and victory
nature gives thee strong language fisherman
i have not passed the hours truly in the games and
levities my years life has been no festa to me
but no matter the seriate was not pleased to hear
 lessening the number the galleys crew and
thou wilt bethink thee some other reward i have
here the chain and golden oar in the hope that it
will still be welcome
antonio looked amazed but yielding to a natural
curiosity he gazed a moment with a longing at the
prize then recoiling with a shudder he uttered
moodily and with the tones one whose determination
was made i should think the bauble coined
 my grandchild s blood keep it they have trusted
it to thee for it is thine right and now that
they refuse to hear my prayer it will be useless to
all but to him who fairly earned it
thou makes no allowance fisherman for difference
 years and for sinews that are in their vigor
methinks that in adjudging such a prize thought
should be had to these matters and then wouldest
thou be found outstripping us all holy st theodore
 i passed my childhood with the oar in hand
and never before have i met one in venice who has
driven my gondola so hard thou touches the
water with the delicacy a lady fingering her liar
and yet with the force the wave rolling on the
lido
i have seen the hour jacopo when even tinyoung
arm would have tired in such a strife between
us that was before the birth my eldest son who
died in battle with the ottoman when the dear boy
 the bravo
he left me was but an infant in arms thou never
safest the comely lad good jacopo
i was not so happy old man but if h resembled
thee well mayest thou mourn his loss body diana
 i have little cause to boast the small advantage
youth and strength gave me
there was a force within that bore me and the
boat on but what use hath it been thy kindness
and the pain given to an old frame that hath
been long racked by hardship and poverty are both
thrown away on the rocky hearts the nobles
we know not yet antonio the good saints
will hear our prayers when we least think they are
listening come with me for i am sent to seek thee
the fisherman regarded his new acquaintance
with surprise and then turning to bestow an instant
 habitual care on his boat he cheerfully professed
himself ready to proceed the place where they
stood was a little apart from the thoroughfare the
quays and though there was a brilliant moon the
circumstance two men in their garbs being there
was not likely to attract observation but jacopo
did not appear to be satisfied with this security from
remark he waited until antonio had left the gondola
and then unfolding a cloak which had lain on
his arm he threw it without asking permission over
the shoulders the other a cap like that he wore
himself was next produced and being placed on the
gray hairs the fisherman effectually completed
his metamorphosis
there is no need a mask he said examining
his companion attentively when his task was accomplished
 none would know thee antonio in
this garb
and is there need what thou hast done ja
copy i owe thee thanks for a wellmeant and but
for the hardness heart the rich and powerful
for what would have proved a great kindness still
the bravo 
i must tell thee that a mask was never yet put before
my face for what reason can there be why one
who rises with the sun to go to his toil and who
trusted to the favor the blessed st anthony for
the little he hath should go abroad like a gallant
ready to steal the good name a virgin or a robber
at night 
thou knowest our venetian custom and it maybe
well to use some caution in the business we are
on
thou forgettest that thy intention is yet a secret
to me i say it again and i say it with truth and
gratitude that i owe thee many thanks though the
 is defeated and the boy is still a prisoner in the
floatingschool wickedness but thou hast a name r
jacopo that i could wish did not belong to thee i
find it hard to believe all that they have this day said
on the lido one who has so much feeling for the
weak and wronged
the bravo ceased to adjust the disguise his
companion and the profound stillness which succeeded
his remark proved so painful to antonio that
he felt like one reprieved from suffocation when he
heard the deep respiration that announced the relief
 his companion
i would not willingly say 
no matter interrupted jacopo in a hollow
voice no matter fisherman we will speak 
these things on some other occasion at present
follow and be silent
as he ceased the selfappointed guide antonio
beckoned for the latter to come on when he led the
way from the waterside the fisherman obeyed
for little did it matter to one poor and heartstricken
as he w hither he was conducted jacopo took the
first entrance into the court the doge s palace
his footstep was leisurely and to the passing multitude
they appeared like any others the thousands
 the bravo
who were abroad to breathe the soft air the night
or to enter into the pleasures the piazza
when within the dimmer and broken light the
court jacopo paused evidently to scan the persons
 those it contained it is to be presumed he saw
no reason to delay for with a secret sign to his
companion to follow he crossed the area and
mounted the wellknown steps down which the head
 the falter had rolled and which from the statues
on the summit is called the giant s stairs the
celebrated mouths the lions were passed and they
were walking swiftly along the open gallery when
they encountered a halberdier the ducal guard
who comes demanded the mercenary throwing
forward his long and dangerous weapon
friends to the state and to st mark
none pass at this hour without the word
jacopo motioned to antonio to stand fast while
he drew nearer to the halberdier and whispered
the weapon was instantly thrown up and the sentinel
again paced the long gallery with practised indifference
the way was no sooner cleared than
they proceeded antonio not a little amazed at
what he had already seen eagerly followed his guide
for his heart began to beat high with an exciting
but undefined hope he was not so ignorant human
affairs as to require to be told that those who
ruled would some time concede that in secret which
policy forbade them to yield openly full therefore
 the expectation being ushered into the presence
 the doge himself and having his child
restored to his arms the old man stepped lightly
along the gloomy gallery and darling through an
entrance at the heels jacopo he found himself
at the foot another flight massive steps the
route now became confused to the fisherman for
quitting the more public dormitories the palace his
companion held his way by a secret door through
the bravo 
many dimly lighted and obscure passages they
ascended and descended frequently as often quitting
or entering rooms but ordinary dimensions and
decorations until the head antonio was completely
turned and he no longer knew the general direction
 their course at length they stopped in an apartment
 inferior ornaments and a dusky color
which the feeble light rendered still more gloomy
thou art well acquainted with the dwelling 
our prince said the fisherman when his companion
enabled him to speak by checking his swift movements
 the oldest gondolier venice is not
more ready on the canals than thou appeared to beam
oner these galleries and corridors
tis my business to bring thee hither and what
i am to do i endeavor to do well antonio thou
art a man that feareth not to stand in the presence
 the great as this day hath shown summon thy
courage for a moment trial is before thee
i have spoken boldly to the doge except the
holy father himself what power is there on earth
beside to fear
thou mayest have spoken fisherman too boldly
temper thy language for the great love not words
 disrespect
is truth unpleasant to them
that is as may be they love to hear their own
acts praised when their acts have merited praise
but they do not like to hear them condemned even
though they know what is said to be just
i fear me said the old man looking with simplicity
at the other there is little difference between
the powerful and the weak when the garments
are stripped from both and the man stands
naked to the eye
that truth may not be spoken here
how do they deny that they are christians
and mortals and sinners
u
sit
e

m
 the bravo
they make a merit the first antonio they
forget the second and they never like to be called
the last by any but themselves
i doubt jacopo after all if i get from them the
freedom the boy
speak them fair and say naught to wound their
selfesteem or to menace their authority they will
pardon much if the last in particular be respected
but it is that authority which has taken away
my child can i speak in favor the power which
i know to be unjust 
thou must feign it or thy suit will fail
i will go back to the lagunes good jacopo for
this tongue mine hath ever moved at the bidding
 the heart i fear i am too old to say that a son
may righteously be torn from the father by violence
tell them thou from me that i came thus far in
order to do them respect but that seeing the hopelessness
 beseeching further i have gone to my
nets and to my prayers to blessed st anthony
as he ceased speaking antonio wrung the hand
 his motionless companion and turned away as
if to retire two halberds fell to the level his
breast ere his foot had quitted the marble floor and
he now saw for the first time that armed men crossed
his passage and that in truth he was a prisoner
nature had endowed the fisherman with a quick arid
just perception and long habit had given great steadiness
to his nerves when he perceived his real
situation instead entering into useless remonstrance
or in any manner betraying alarm he again
red to jacopo with an air patience and resignation

it must be that the illustrious signore wish to dome
justice he said smoothing the remnant his
hair as men his class prepare themselves for the
presence their superiors and it would not be
decent in an humble fisherman to refuse them the
the bravo 
opportunity it would be better however if there
were less force used here in venice in a matter 
simple right and wrong but the great love to show
their power and the weak must submit t
we shall see answered ja cxipo who had
manifested no emotion during the abortive attempt
 the other to retire
a profound stillness succeeded the halberdiers
maintained their rigid attitudes within the shadow
 the wall looking like two insensible statues in the
attire and armor the age while jacopo and his
companion occupied the centre the room with
scarcely more the appearance consciousness
and animation it may be well to explain here to
the reader some the peculiar machinery the
state in the country which we write and which
is connected with the scene that is about to follow 
for the name a republic a word which if it mean
anything strictly implies the representation and supremacy
 the general interests but which has so
frequently been prostituted to the protection and
monopolies privileged classes may have induced
him to believe that there was at least a resemblance
between the outlines that government and the
more just because more popular institutions his
own country
in an age when rulers were profane enough to
assert and the ruled weak enough to allow that the
right a man to govern his fellows was a direct
gift from god a departure from the bold and selfish
principle though it were only in profession was
thought sufficient to give a character freedom
and common sense to the polity a nation this
belief is not without some justification since it establishes
in theory at least the foundations government
on a base sufficiently different from that
which supposes all power to be the property one
and that one to be the representative the faultless
vol i p
 the bravo
and omnipotent ruler the universe with the
first these principles we have nothing to do except
it be to add that there are propositions so inherently
false that they only require to be fairly stated
to produce their own refutation but our subject necessarily
draws us into a short digression on the
errors the second as they existed in venice
it is probable that when the patricians st
mark created a community political rights in
their own body they believed their state had done
all that was necessary to merit the high and generous
title it assumed they had innovated on a generally
received principle and they cannot claim the distinction
 being either the first or the last who
have imagined that to take the incipient steps in political
improvement is at once to reach the goal 
perfection venice had no doctrine divine right
and as her prince was little more than a pageant
she boldly laid claim to be called a republic she
believed that a representation the most prominent
and brilliant interests in society was the paramount
object government and faithful to the seductive
but dangerous error she mistook to the last collective
power for social happiness
it may be taken as a governing principle in all
civil relations that the strong will grow stronger
and the feeble more weak until the first become unfit
to rule or the last unable to endure in this important
truth is contained the secret the downfall
 all those states which have crumbled beneath the
weight their own abuses it teaches the necessity
 widening the foundations society until the base
shall have a breadth capable securing the just
representation every interest without which the
social machine is liable to interruption from its own
movement and eventually to destruction from its
own excesses
venice though ambitious and tenacious the
the bravo 
name a republic was in truth a narrow a vulgar
and an exceedingly heartless oligarchy to the
former title she had no other claim than her denial
 the naked principle already mentioned while her
practice is liable to the reproach the two latter
in the unmanly and narrow character its exclusion
in every act her foreign policy and in
every measure her internal police an aristocracy
must ever want the high personal feeling which
often tempers despotism by the qualities the
chief or the generous and human impulses a
popular rule it has the merit substituting things
for men it is true but unhappily it substitutes the
things a few men for those the whole it partakes
and it always has partaken though necessarily
tempered by circumstances and the opinions 
different ages the selfishness all corporations
in which the responsibility the individual while
his acts are professedly submitted to the temporizing
expedients a collective interest is lost in the subdivision
 numbers at the period which we
write italy had several these selfstyled commonwealths
in not one which however was there
ever a fair and just confiding power to the body
 the people though perhaps there is not one that
has not been cited sooner or later in proof the
inability man to govern himself in order to
demonstrate the fallacy a reasoning which is so
fond predicting the downfall our own liberal system
supported by examples drawn from transatlantic
states the middle ages it is necessary only to recount
here a little in detail the forms in which power
was obtained and exercised in the most important
 them all
distinctions in rank as separated entirely from
the will the nation formed the basis venetian
polity authority though divided was not less a
birthright than in those governments in which it was
 the bravo
openly avowed to be a dispensation providence
the patrician order had its high and exclusive privileges
which were guarded and maintained with a
most selfish and engrossing spirit he who was
not born to govern had little hope ever entering
into the possession his natural rights while he
who was by the intervention chance might
wield a power the most fearful and despotic
character at a certain age all senatorial rank
for by a specious fallacy nobility did not take its
usual appellations were admitted into the councils
 the nation the names the leading families
were inscribed in a register which was well entitled
the golden and he who enjoyed the envied
distinction having an ancestor thus enrolled
could with a few exceptions such as that named in
the case don camillo present himself in the
senate and lay claim to the honors the horned
bonnet neither our limits nor our object will
permit a digression sufficient length to point out
the whole the leading features a system so vicious
and which was perhaps only rendered tolerable
to those it governed by the extraneous contributions
 captured and subsidiary provinces on
which in truth as in all cases metropolitan rule
the oppression weighed most grievously the
reader will at once see that the very reason why
the despotism the selfstyled republic was tolerable
to its own citizens was but another cause its
eventual destruction
as the senate became too numerous to conduct
with sufficient secrecy and dispatch the affairs a
state that pursued a policy alike tortuous and complicated
the most general its important interests
were intrusted to a council composed three hundred
 its members in order to avoid the publicity
and delay a body large even as this a second
selection was made which was known as the count
bravo 
cil ten and to which much the executive
power that aristocratical jealousy withheld from
the titular chief the state was confided to
this point the political economy the venetian republic
however faulty had at least some merit for
simplicity and frankness the ostensible agents 
the administration were known arid though all real
responsibility to the nation was lost in the superior
influence and narrow policy the patricians the
rulers could not entirely escape from the odium that
public opinion might attach to their unjust or illegal
proceedings but a state whose prosperity was
chiefly founded on the contribution and support 
dependants and whose existence was equally menaced
by its own false principles and by the growth
 other and neighboring powers had need a still
more efficient body in the absence that executive
which its own republican pretensions denied to
venice a political inquisition which came intime
to be one the most fearful engines police
ever known was the consequence an authority
as irresponsible as it was absolute was periodical v
confided to another and still smaller body which
met and exercised its despotic and secret functions
under the name the council three the
choice these temporary rulers was decided bv
lot and in a manner that prevented the result from
being known to any but to their own number and
to a few the most confidential the more permanent
officers the government thus there
existed at all times in the heart venice a mysterious
and despotic power that was wielded by
men who moved in society unknown and apparently
surrounded by all the ordinary charities life 
but which in truth was influenced by a set political
maxims that were perhaps as ruthless as tyrannic
and as selfish as ever were invented by the evil
ingenuity man it was in short a power that
p
 tiie bravo
could only be intrusted without abuse to infallible
virtue and infinite intelligence using the terms in a
sense limited by human means and yet it was here
confided to men whose title was founded on the
double accident birth and the colors balls
and by whom it was wielded without even the
check publicity
the council three met in secret ordinarily
issued its decrees without communicating with any
other body and had them enforced with a fearfulness
 mystery and a suddenness execution
that resembled the blows fate the doge himself
was not superior to its authority nor protected from
its decisions while it has been known that one the
privileged three has been denounced by his companions
there is still in existence a long list the
state maxims which this secret tribunal recognized
as its rule conduct and it is not saying too much
to affirm that they set at defiance every other consideration
but expediency all the recognized laws
 god and every principle justice which is esteemed
among men the advances the human
intellect supported by the means publicity may
temper the exercise a similar irresponsible power
in our own age but in no country has this substitution
 a soulless corporation for an elective representation
been made in which a system rule has
not been established that sets at naught the laws 
natural justice and the rights the citizen any
pretension to the contrary by placing profession
in opposition to practice is only adding hypocrisy
to usurpation
it appears to be an unavoidable general consequence
that abuses should follow when pow r er is exercised
by a permanent and irresponsible body
from whom there is no appeal when this power
is secretly exercised the abuses become still more
grave it is also worthy remark that in the nathe
bravo 
tons which submit or have submitted to these undue
and dangerous influences the pretensions to
justice and generosity are the most exaggerated
character for while the fearless democrat vents
his personal complaints aloud and the voice the
subject professed despotism is smothered entirely
necessity itself dictates to the oligarchy the policy
 seemliness as one the conditions his own
safety thus venice prided herself on the justice
 st mark and few states maintained a greater
show or put forth a more lofty claim to the possession
 the sacred quality than that whose real
maxims government were veiled in a mystery
that even the loose morality the age exacted
chapter xii
 a power that if but named
in casual converse be it where it might
the speaker lower d at once his voice his eyes
and pointed upward as at god in heaven
rogers
the reader has probably anticipated that antonio
was now standing in an antechamber the
secret and stern tribunal described in the preceding
chapter in common with all his class the fisherman
had a vague idea the existence and the
attributes the council before which he was to appear
but his simple apprehension was far from
comprehending the extent or the nature functions
that equally took cognizance the most important
interests the republic and the more
trifling concerns a patrician family while conjectures
on the probable result the expected interview
were passing through his mind an inner
 the bravo
door opened and an attendant signed for jacopo to
advance
the deep and imposing silence which instantly
succeeded the entrance the summoned into the
presence the council three gave time for a
slight examination the apartment and those it
contained the room was not large for that country
and climate but rather a size suited to the
closeness the councils that had place within its
walls the floor was tessellated with alternate
pieces black and white marble the walls were
draped in one common and sombre dress black
cloth a single lamp dark bronze was suspended
over a solitary table in its centre which like every
other article the scanty furniture had the same
melancholy covering as the w r alls in the angles 
the room there were projecting closets which might
have been what they seemed or merely passages
into the other apartments the palace all the
doors were concealed from casual observation by
the hangings which gave one general and chilling
aspect gloom to the whole scene on the side 
the room opposite to that on which antonio stood
three men were seated in curule chairs but their
masks and the drapery which concealed their
forms prevented all recognition their persons
one this powerful body wore a robe crimson
as the representative that fortune had given to the
select council the doge and the others robes 
black being those which had drawn the lucky or
rather the unlucky balls in the council ten itself
a temporary and chancecreated body the senate
there were one or two subordinates near the table
but these as well as the still more humble officials
 the place were hid from all ordinary knowledge
by disguises similar to those the chiefs jacopo
regarded the scene like one accustomed to its effect
though with evident reverence and awe but the
the bravo 
impression on antonio was too manifest to be lost
it is probable that the long pause which followed
his introduction was intended to produce and to
note this effect for keen eyes were intently watching
his countenance during its continuance
thou art called antonio the lagunes demanded
one the secretaries near the table when
a sign had been secretly made from the crimson
member that fearful tribunal to proceed
a poor fisherman eccellenza who owes much
to blessed saint antonio the miraculous draught
and thou hast a son who bears thine own name
and who follows the same pursuit
it is the duty a christian to submit to the will
 god my boy has been dead twelve years come
the day when the republic s galleys chased the infidel
from corfu to candia he was slain noble signore
with many others his calling in that bloody
fight
there was a movement surprise among the
clerks who whispered together and appeared to
examine the papers in their hands with some haste
and confusion glances were sent back at the
judges who sate motionless wrapped in the impenetrable
mystery their functions a secret sign
however soon caused the armed attendants the
place to lead antonio and his companion from the
room
here is some inadvertency said a stern voice
from one the masked three so soon as the fall
 the footsteps those who retired was no longer
audible it is not seemly that the inquisition st
mark should show this ignorance
it touches merely the family an obscure fisherman
illustrious signore returned the trembling
dependant and it may be that his art would wish
to deceive us in the opening interrogatories
thou art in error interrupted another the
 the bravo
three the man is named antonio vecchio and
as he sayeth his only child died in the hot affair with
the ottoman he whom there is question is a
grandson and is still a boy
the noble signore is right returned the clerk
in the hurry affairs we have misconceived
a fact which the wisdom the council has been
quick to rectify st mark is happy in having
among his proudest and oldest names senators who
enter thus familiarly into the interests his meanest
children 
let the man be again introduced resumed the
judge slightly bending his head to the compliment
these accidents are unavoidable in the press affairs

the necessary order was given and antonio with
his companion constantly at his elbow was brought
once more into the presence
thy son died in the service the republic antonio
demanded the secretary
 signore he did holy maria have pity on his
early fate and listen to my prayers so good a
child and so brave a man can have no great need
 masses for his soul or his death would have been
doubly grievous to me since i am too poor to buy
them
thou hast a grandson
i had one noble senator i hope he still lives
he is not with thee in thy labors on the lagunes
f
san teodoro grant that he were he is taken
signore with many more tender years into the
galleys whence may our lady give him a safe deliverance
 if your eccellenza has an opportunity to
speak with the general the galleys or with any
other who may have authority in such a matter on
my knees i pray you to speak in behalf the child
who is a good and pious lad that seldom casts a line
the bravo 
into the water without an ave or a prayer to st
anthony and who has never given me uneasiness
until he fell into the grip st mark 
rise this is not the affair in which i have to
question thee thou hast this day spoken thy
prayer to our most illustrious prince the doge 
i have prayed his highness to give the boy liberty

and this thou hast done openly and with little
deference to the high dignity and sacred character
 the chief the republic
i did it like a father and a man if but half what
they say the justice and kindness the state were
true his highness would have heard me as a father
and a man
a slight movement among the fearful three caused
the secretary to pause when he saw however
that his superiors chose to maintain their silence he
continued
this didst thou once in public and among the
senators but when repulsed as urging a petition both
out place and out reason thou slightest other
to prefer thy request
true illustrious signore
thou earnest among the gondoliers the regatta
in an unseemly garb and placed thyself foremost
with those who contended for the favor the senate
and its prince
i came in the garb which i wear before the virgin
and st antonio and if i was foremost in the race
it was more owing to the goodness and favor the
man at my side than any virtue which is still left in
these withered sinews and dried bones san marco
remember him in his need for the kind wish and
soften the hearts the great to hear the prayer 
a childless parent 
there was another slight expression surprise
 the bravo
or curiosity among the inquisitors and once more
the secretary suspended his examination
thou hearest jacopo said one the three
what answer dost thou make the fisherman 
signore he speaketh truth
and thou hast dared to trifle with the pleasures
 the city and to set at naught the wishes the
doge
if it be a crime illustrious senator to have pitied
an old man who mourned for his offspring and to
have given up my own solitary triumph to his love
for the boy i am guilty
there was a long and silent pause after this reply
jacopo had spoken with habitual reverence but with
the grave composure that appeared to enter deeply
into the composition his character the paleness
 the cheek was the same and the glowing
ey r e which so singularly lighted and animated a
countenance that possessed a hue not unlike that 
death scarce varied its gaze while he answered
a secret sign caused the secretary to proceed with
his duty
and thou west thy success in the regatta antonio
to the favor thy competitor he who is now
with thee in the presence the council 
under san teodoro and st antonio the city s
patron and my own
l and thy whole desire was to urge again thy rejected
petition in behalf the young sailor 
signore i had no other what is the vanity
 a triumph among the gondoliers or the bauble
 a mimic oar and chain to one my years and
condition
thou forgettest that the oar and chain are
gold
excellent gentlemen gold cannot heal the wounds
which misery has left on a heavy heart give me
back the child that my eyes may not be closed by
the bravo 
strangers and that i may speak good counsel into
his young ears while there is hope my words may be
remembered and i care not for all the metals the
rialto thou mayest see that i utter no vain
vaunt by this jewel which i offer to the nobles
with the reverence due to their greatness and wisdom

when the fisherman had done speaking he advanced
with the timid step a man unaccustomed
to move in superior presences and laid upon the
dark cloth the table a ring that sparkled with
what at least seemed to be very precious stones
the astonished secretary raised the jewel and held
it in suspense before the eyes the judges
how is this exclaimed he the three who
had oftener interfered in the examination that
seemeth the pledge our nuptials 
it is no other illustrious senator with this ring
did the doge wed the adriatic in the presence the
ambassadors and the people
hadst thou aught to do with this also jacopo
sternly demanded the judge
the bravo turned his eye on the jewel with a look
 interest but his voice maintained its usual depth
and steadiness as he answered
signore no until now i knew not the fortune
 the fisherman
a sign to the secretary caused him to resume his
questions
thou must account and clearly account antonio
he said for the manner in which this sacred
ring came into thy possession hadst thou any one
to aid thee in obtaining it
signore i had
name him at once that we take measures for
his security
twill be useless signore he is far above the
power venice
vol i q
 the bravo
what meanest thou fellow none are superior
to the right and the force the republic that dwell
within her limits answer without evasion as thou
values thy person
i should prize that which is little value signore
and be guilty a great folly as well as a
great sin were i to deceive you to save a body old
and worthless as mine from stripes if your excellencies
are willing to hear you will find that i am
no less willing to tell the manner in which i got the
ring
speak then and trifle not
i know not signori whether you are used to
hearing untruths that you caution me so much
not to deal with them but we the lagunes are
not afraid to say what we have seen and done for
most our business is with the winds and waves
which take their orders from god himself there
is a tradition signori among us fishermen that intimes
past one our body brought up from the bay
the ring with which the doge is accustomed to marry
the adriatic a jewel that value was little
use to one who casts his nets daily for bread and oil
and he brought it to the doge as became a fisherman
into whose hands the saints had thrown a prize
to which he had no title as it were to prove his honesty
this act our companion is much spoken
 on the lagunes and at the lido and it is said
there is a noble painting done by some our venetian
masters in the halls the palace which tells
the story as it happened showing the prince on his
throne and the lucky fisherman with his naked legs
rendering back to his highness that which had been
lost i hope there is foundation for this belief signori
which greatly flatters our pride and is not without
use in keeping some among us truer to the right
and better favored in the eyes st anthony than
might otherwise be
the bravo 
the fact was so
and the painting excellent signore i hope our
vanity has not deceived us concerning the picture
neither
the picture you mention is to be seen within
the palace
corpo di bacco i have had my misgivings on
that point for it is not common that the rich and the
happy should take such note what the humble and
the poor have done is the work from the hands 
the great tiziano himself eccellenza
it is not one little name hath put his pencil
to the canvas
they say that tiziano had the art giving to
his works the look and richness flesh and one
would think that a just man might find in the honesty
 the poor fisherman a color bright enough to
have satisfied even his eye but it may be that the
senate saw danger in thus flattering us the lagunes

proceed with the account thine own fortune
with the ring
illustrious nobles i have often dreamed the
luck my fellow the old times and more than
once have i drawn the nets with an eager hand in
my sleep thinking to find that very jewel entangled
in its meshes or ernbowelled by some fish what 
have so often fancied has at last happened i aman
old man signori and there are few pools or
banks between fusina and giorgio that my lines or
my nets have not fathomed or covered the spot
to which the bucentoro is wont to steer in these ceremonies
is well known to me and i had a care to
cover the bottom round about with all my nets in
the hope drawing up the ring when his highness
cast the jewel i dropped a buoy to mark the
spot signori this is all my accomplice was su
anthony
 the bravo
for doing this you had a motive 
holy mother god was it not sufficient to
get back my boy from the gripe the galleys
exclaimed antonio with an energy and a simplicity
that are often found to be in the same character
i thought that if the doge and the senate were
willing to cause pictures to be painted and honors
to be given to one poor fisherman for the ring they
might be glad to reward another by releasing a lad
who can be no great service to the republic but
who is all to his parent
thy petition to his highness thy strife in the
regatta and thy search for the ring had the same
object
to r ie signore life has but one
there was a slight but suppressed movement
among the council
when thy request was refused by his highness
as illtimed 
ah eccellcnza when one has a white head and
f a failing arm he cannot stop to look for the proper
moment in such a cause interrupted the fisherman
with a gleam that impetuosity which forms the
true base italian character
when thy request was denied and thou hadst
refused the reward the victor thou went among
thy fellows and fed their ears with complaints the
injustice st mark and the senate s tyranny
signore no i went away sad and heartbroken
for i had not thought the doge and nobles would
have refused a successful gondolier so light a boon
and this thou didst not hesitate to proclaim
among the fishermen and idlers the lido
eccellenza it was not needed my fellows knew
my unhappiness and tongues w r ere not wanting to
tell the worst
there was a tumult with thee at its head and
sedition was uttered with much vainboasting 
the bravo 
what the fleet the lagunes could perform against
the fleet the republic
there is little difference signore between the
two except that the men the one go in gondolas
with nets and the men the other are in the galleys
 the state why should brothers seek each
other s blood 
the movement among the judges was more manifest
than ever they whispered together and a
paper containing a few lines written rapidly in
pencil was put into the hands the examining
secretary
thou didst address thy fellows and spoke openly
 thy fancied wrongs thou didst comment onthe
laws which require the services the citizens
when the republic is compelled to send forth a fleet
against its enemies
it is not easy to be silent signore when the
heart is full
and there was consultation among thee coining
to the palace in a body and asking the discharge
 thy grandson from the doge in the name
 the rabble the lido
signore there were some generous enough to
make the offer but others were advice it would
be well to reflect before they took so bold a measure
and thou what was thine own counsel on that
point
eccellenza i am old and though unused to be
thus questioned by illustrious senators i had seen
enough the manner in which st mark governs
to believe a few unarmed fishermen and gondoliers
would not be listened to with 
ha did the gondoliers become thy party t
i should have believed them jealous and displeased
with the triumph one who was not their body
a gondolier is a man and though they had the
feelings human nature on being beaten they had
q 
 till bravo
also the feelings human nature when they heard
that a father was robbed his son signore continued
antonio with great earnestness and a singular
simplicity there will be great discontent on
the canals if the galleys sail with the boy aboard
them
such is thy opinion w r ere the gondoliers on
the lido numerous 
when the sports ended eccellenza they came
over by hundreds and i will do the generous fellows
the justice to say that they had forgotten their
want luck in the love justice diamine these
gondoliers are not so bad a class as some pretend
but they are men like ourselves and can feel for a
christian as well as another
the secretary paused for his task was done and
a deep silence pervaded the gloomy apartment
after a short pause one the three resumed
antonio vecchio he said thou hast served
thyself in these said galleys to which thou now
keenest so averse and served bravely as i learn 
signore i have done my duty by st mark i
played my part against the irilidel but it w r as after
my beard w r as grown ami at an age when i had
learnt to know r good from evil there is no duty
more cheerfully performed by us all than to defend
the islands and the lagunes against the enemy
and all the republic s dominions thou canst
make no distinctions between any the rights 
the state
there is a wisdom granted to the great which
god hath denied the poor and the weak signore
to me it does not seen clear that venice a city
built on a few islands hath any more right to carry
her rule into crete or candia than the turk hath to
come here
how dost thou dare on the lido to question
the claim the republic to her conquests or do
the bravo 
the irreverent fishermen dare thus to speak lightly
 her glory 
eccellenza i know little rights that come by
violence god hath given us the lagunes but i
know not that he has given us more this glory 
which you speak may sit lightly on the shoulders
 a senator but it weighs heavily on a fisherman s
heart
thou speakest bold man that which thou
dost not comprehend
it is unfortunate signore that the pow r er to understand
hath not been given to those who have
so much power to suffer
an anxious pause succeeded this reply
thou mayest withdraw antonio said he who
apparently presided in the dread councils the
three thou wilt not speak what has happened
and thou wilt await the inevitable justice st
mark in full confidence its execution
thanks illustrious senator i will obey your
excellency but my heart is full and i would fain
say a few words concerning the child before i quit
this noble company
thou mayest speak and here thou mayest give
free vent to all thy wishes or to ad thy griefs if any
thou hast st mark has no greater pleasure than
to listen to the wishes his children
i believe they have reviled the republic in calling
its chiefs heartless and sold to ambition said
the old man with generous warmth disregarding
the stern rebuke which gleamed in the eye jas
 a senator is but a man and there are
fathers and children among them as among us 
the lagunes
 speak but refrain from seditious or discreditable
discourse uttered a secretary in a halfhis
per proceed
i have little now to offer signior i am not
 the bravo
used to boast my services to the state excellent
gentlemen hut there is a time when human modesty
must give way to huma nature these scars were
got in one the proudest days st mark and in
the foremost all the galleys that fought among
the greek islands the father my boy wept over
me then as i have since wept over his own son
yes might be ashamed to own it among men 
but if the truth must be spoken the loss the boy
has drawn bitter tears from me in the darkness 
night and in the solitude the lagunes i lay
many weeks signori less a man than a corpse and
when i got back again to my nets and my toil i
did not withhold my son from the call the republic
he went in my place to meet the infidel a
service from which he never came back this was
the duty men who had grown in experience and
who were not to be deluded into wickedness by the
evil company the galleys but this calling 
children into the snares the devil grieves a father
and i will own the weakness if such it be i am
not a courage and pride to send forth my own
flesh arid blood into the danger and corruption 
war and evil society as in days when the stoutness
 the heart was like the stoutness the limbs
give me back then my boy till he has seen my old
head laid beneath the sands and until by the aid 
blessed st anthony and such councils as a poor
 man can offer i may give him more steadiness in
his love the right and until i may have so shaped
his life that he will not be driven about by every
pleasant or treacherous wind that may happen to
blow upon his bark signori you are rich and
powerful and honored and though you may be
placed in the way temptations to do wrongs that
are suited to your high names and illustrious fortunes
ye know little the trials the poor what
are the temptations the blessed st anthony ijim
the bravo 
self to those the evil company the galleys 
and now signori though you may be angry to
hear it will say that when an aged man has no
other kin on earth or none so near as to feel the
glow the thin blood the poor than one poor
boy st mark would do well to remember that even
a fisherman the lagunes can feel as well as the
doge on his throne this much i say illustrious
senators in sorrow and not in anger for i would
get back the child and die in peace with my superiors
as with my equals
thou mayest depart said one the three
not yet signore i have still more to say 
the men the lagunes who speak with loud voices
concerning this dragging boys into the service 
the galleys
we will hear their opinions
noble gentlemen if i were to utter all they have
said word for word i might do some disfavor to
your ears man is man though the virgin and the
saints listen to his aves and prayers from beneath a
jacket serge and a fisherman s cap but i know
too well my duty to the senate to speak so plainly
but signori they say saving the bluntness their
language that st mark should have ears for the
meanest his people as well as for the richest noble
 and that not a hair should fall from the head
 a fisherman without its being counted as if it
were a lock from beneath the horned bonnet and
that where god hath not made marks his displeasure
man should not
do they dare to reason thus
i know not if it be reason illustrious signore
but it is what they say and eccellenza it is holy
truth we are poor workmen the lagunes who
rise with the day to cast our nets and return at
night to hard beds and harder fare but with this
xve might be content did the senate count us as
 the bravo
christians and men that god hath not given to afl
the same chances in life i well know for it often happens
that i draw an empty net when my comrades
are groaning with the weight their draughts but
this is done to punish my sins or to humble my
heart whereas it exceeds the power man to look
into the secrets the soul or to foretell the evil 
the still innocent child blessed st anthony knows
how many years suffering this visit to the galleys
may cause to the child in the think these
things i pray you signori and send men tried
principles to the wars
thou mayest retire rejoined the judge
i should be sorry that any who cometh my
blood continued the inattentive antonio should
be the cause illwill between them that rule and
them that are born to obey but nature is sti longer
even than the law and i should discredit her feelings
were i to go without speaking as becomes a
father ye have taken my child and sent him to
serve the state at the hazard body and soul without
giving opportunity for a parting kiss or a parting
blessing ye have used my flesh and blood as
ye would use the wood the arsenal and sent it
forth upon the sea as if it were the insensible metal
 the balls ye throw against the infidel ye have
shut your ears to my prayers as if they were words
uttered by the wicked and when i have exhorted
you on my knees wearied my stiffened limbs to do
ye pleasure rendered ye the jewel which st anthony
gave to my net that it might soften your hearts
and reasoned with you calmly on the nature your
acts you turn from me coldly as if i were unfitho
stand forth in defence the offspring that god hath
left my age this is not the boasted justice st
mark venetian senators but hardness heart and
a wasting the means the poor that would ill
become the most grasping hebrew the rialto 
the bravo 
hast thou aught more to urge antonio asked
the judge with the wily design unmasking the
fisherman s entire soul
is it not enough signore that i urge my years
my poverty my scars and my love for the boy i
know ye not but though ye are hid behind the folds
 your robes and masks still must ye be men
there may be among ye a father or perhaps someone
who hath a still more sacred charge the child
 a dead son to him i speak in vain ye talk 
justice when the weight your power falls on them
least able to bear it and though ye may delude
yourselves the meanest gondolier the canal
knows 
he was stopped from uttering more by his companion
who rudely placed a hand on his mouth
why hast thou presumed to stop the complaints
 antonio sternly demanded the judge
it was not decent illustrious senators to listen
to such disrespect in so noble a presence jacopo
answered bending reverently as he spoke this
old fisherman dread signori is warmed by love for
his offspring and he will utter that which in his
cooler moments he will repent
st mark fears not the truth if he has more to
say let him declare it
but the excited antonio began to reflect the
flush which had ascended to his weatherbeaten
cheek disappeared and his naked breast ceased to
heave he stood like one rebuked more by his discretion
than his conscience with a calmer eye and
a face that exhibited the composure his years
and the respect his condition
if i have offended great patricians he said
more mildly i pray you to forget the zeal an
ignorant old man whose feelings are master his
breeding and who knows less how to render the
truth agreeable to noble ears than to utter it
 the bravo
thou mayest depart
the armed attendants advanced and obedient to
a sign from the secretary they led antonio and his
companion through the door by which they had entered
the other officials the place followed
and the secret judges were left by themselves in the
chamber doom
chapter xiii
o the days that we have seen
shelton
a pause like that which accompanies selfcontemn
elation and perhaps conscious distrust purpose
succeeded then the three arose together and
bean to lay aside the instruments their disguise
when the masks were removed they exposed the
grave visages men in the decline life athwart
which worldly cares and worldly passions had
drawn those deep lines which no subsequent ease
or resignation can erase during the process 
undoing neither spoke for the affair on which they
had just been employed caused novel and disagreeable
sensations to them all when they were delivered
from their superfluous garments and their
masks however they drew near the table and each
sought that relief for his limbs and person which was
natural to the long restraint he had undergone
there are letters from the french king intercepted
said one after time had permitted them to
rally their thoughts it would appear they treat
 the new intentions the emperor
have they been restored to the ambassador or
the bfcavo 
are the originals to go before the senate demanded
another
on that we must take counsel at our leisure i
have naught else to communicate except that the
order given to intercept the messenger the holy
see hath failed its object
 this the secretaries advertised me we must
look into the negligence the agents for there is
good reason to believe much useful knowledge would
have come from that seizure
as the attempt is already known and much spoken
 care must be had to issue orders for the arrest
 the robbers else may the republic fall into
disrepute with its friends there are names on our
list which might be readily marked for punishment
for that quarter our patrimony is never in want 
proscribed to conceal an accident this nature
good heed will be had to this since as you say
the affair is weighty the government or the individual
that is negligent reputation cannot expect
long to retain the respect its equals
the ambition the house hapsburg robs
me my sleep exclaimed the other throwing
aside some papers over w r which his eye had glanced
in disgust holy st theodore what a scourge
to the race is the desire to augment territories and
to extend an unjust rule beyond the boundaries 
reason and nature here have we in venice been
in undisputed possession provinces that are adapted
to our institutions convenient to our wants and
agreeable to our desires for ages provinces that
were gallantly won by our ancestors and which
cling to us as habits linger in our age and yet are
they become objects a covetous ambition to our
neighbor under a vain pretext a policy that i
fear is strengthened by our increasing weakness i
sicken signori my esteem for men as i dive
deeper into their tempers and desires and often wish
vol i r
 the bravo 
myself a dog as i study their propensities in his
appetite for power is not the austrian the most rapacious
 all the princes the earth
more so think you worthy signore than the
castilian you overlook the insatiate desire the
spanish king to extend his sway in italy 
hapsburg or bourbon turk or englishman 
they all seem actuated by the same fell appetite for
dominion and now that venice hath no more to
hope than to preserve her present advantages the
least all our enjoyments becomes a subject 
covetous envy to our enemies there are passions
to weary one an interference with governments
and to send him to his cord penitence and the
cloisters 
i never listen to your observations signore
without quitting the chamber an edified man truly
this desire in the strangers to trespass on our privileges
and it may be well said privileges which
have been gained by our treasures and our blood
becomes more manifest daily should it not be
checked st mark will be stripped in the 
even a landingplace for a gondola on the main
the leap the winged lion is much curtailed
excellent sir or these things might not be it is no
longer in our power to persuade or to command as
 old and our canals begin to be encumbered with
slimy weeds instead wellfreighted argosies and
swiftsailing feluccas
the portuguese hath done us irretrievable harm
for without his african discoveries we might yet
have retained the traffic in indian commodities i
cordially dislike the mongrel race being as it is
half gothic and half moorish 
i trust not myself to think their origin or 
their deeds my friends lest prejudice should kindle
feelings unbecoming a man and a christian how
now signor gradenigo thou art thoughtful
the bravo 
the third member the secret council who had
not spoken since the disappearance the accused
and who was no other than the reader s old acquaintance
 the name just mentioned slowly
lilted his head from ameditative position at this
address
the examination the fisherman hath recalled
scenes my boyhood he answered with a touch
 nature that seldom found place in that chamber
i heard thee say he was thy fosterbrother returned
the other struggling to conceal a gape
we drank the same milk and for the first
years life we sported at the same games
these imaginary kindred often give great uneasiness
i am glad your trouble hath no other
source for i had heard that the young heir your
house hath shown a prodigal disposition late and
i feared that matter might have come to your knowledge
as one the council that a father might not
wish to learn
the selfish features the signor gradenigo instantly
underwent a change he glanced curiously
and with a strong distrust but in a covert manner
at the fallen eyes his two companions anxious
to penetrate their secret thoughts ere he ventured to
expose his own
is there aught complaint against the youth
he demanded in a voice hesitation you understand
a father s interest and will not conceal the
truth
signore you know that the agents the police
are active and little that comes to their knowledge
fails to reach the ears the council but at the
worst the matter is not life or death it can
only cost the inconsiderate young man a visit to
dalmatia or an order to waste the summer at the
foot the alps
 the bravo
youth is the season indiscretion as ye know
signori returned the father breathing more freely
and as none become old that have not been young
i have little need to awaken your recollection its
weaknesses i trust my son is incapable designing
aught against the republic
 that he is not suspected a slight expression
 irony crossed the features the old senator
as he spoke but he is represented as aiming too
freely at the person and wealth your ward and
that she who is the especial care st mark is not
to be solicited without the consent the senate is
an usage well known to one its most ancient and
most honorable members
such is the law and none coming me shall
show it disrespect i have preferred my claims to
that connexion openly but with diffidence and i
await the decision the state in respectful confidence

his associates bowed in courteous acknowledgement
 the justice what he said and the
loyalty his conduct but it was in the manner 
men too long accustomed to duplicity to be easily
duped
none doubt it worthy signor gradenigo for
thy faith to the state is ever quoted as a model for
the young and as a subject for the approbation 
the more experienced hast thou any communications
to make on the interest the young heiress
thyself
i am pained to say that the deep obligation conm suddenly
recalled them to the recollection their duties
 the bravo
each listened an instant as if in expectation that
some extraordinary consequence was to follow so
extraordinary an interruption the usual silence
 the place like a child whose truant propensities
were about to draw detection on his offence and
then the principal the council furtively wiped
the tears from his eyes and resumed his gravity
signori he said fumbling in a bundle papers
we must take up the matter the fisherman but
we will first inquire into the circumstance the
signet left the past night in the lion s mouth signor
gradenigo you were charged with the examination

the duty hath been executed noble sirs and
with a success i had not hoped to meet with
haste at our last meeting prevented a perusal 
the paper to which it was attached but it will now
be seen that the two have a connexion here is an
accusation which charges don camillo monforte
with a design to bear away beyond the power 
the senate the donna violetta my ward in order
to possess her person and riches it speaketh
 proofs in possession the accuser as if he
were an agent intrusted by the neapolitan as a
pledge his truth i suppose for there is no mention
made any other use he sends the signet 
don camillo himself which cannot have been obtained
without that noble s confidence
is it certain that he owns the ring 
 that am i well assured you know i am
especially charged with conducting his personal demand
with the senate and frequent interviews have
given me opportunity to note that he was wont to
wear a signet which is now wanting my jeweller
 the rialto hath sufficiently identified this as
the missing ring
thus far ft is clear though there is an obscurity
in the circumstance that the signet the accused
the bravo 
should be found with the accusation which being
unexplained renders the charge vague and uncertain
have you any clue to the writing or any
means knowing whence it comes
there was a small but nearly imperceptible red
spot on the cheek the signer gradenigo that did
not escape the keen distrust his companions but
he concealed his alarm answering distinctly that he
had none
we must then defer a decision for further proof
the justice st mark hath been too much vaunted
to endanger its reputation by a hasty decree in a
question which so closely touches the interest a
powerful noble italy don camillo monforte
hath a name distinction and countess too many
 note among his kindred to be dealt with as we
might dispose a gondolier or the messenger 
some foreign state
as respects him signore you are undoubtedly
right but may w r e not endanger our heiress by
too much tenderness
there are many convents in venice signore
the monastic life is ill suited to the temper 
my ward the signor gradenigo drily observed
and i fear to hazard the experiment gold is a key
to unlock the strongest cell besides we cannot with
due observance propriety place a child the
state in durance
signor gradenigo we have had this matter under
long and grave consideration and agreeably to
our laws when one our number hath a palpable
interest in the affair we have taken counsel his
highness who is accord with us in sentiment
your personal interest in the lady might have warped
your usually excellent judgment else be assured
we should have summoned you to the conference
the old senator who thus unexpectedly found
himself excluded from consultation on the very
 the bravo
matter that all others made him most value his
temporary authority stood abashed and silent reading
in his countenance however a desire to know
more his associates proceeded to communicate all
it was their intention he should hear
it hath been determined to remove the lady to a
suitable retirement and for this purpose care hath
been already had to provide the means thou wilt
be temporarily relieved a most grievous charge
which cannot but have worked heavily on thy spirits
and in other particulars have lessened thy muchvalued
usefulness to the republic
this unexpected communication was made with
marked courtesy manner but with an emphasis
and tone that sufficiently acquainted the signer
gradenigo with the nature the suspicions that beset
him he had too long been familiar with the sinuous
policy the council in which at intervals he
had so often sat not to understand that he would
run the risk a more serious accusation were he
to hesitate in acknowledging its justice teaching
his features therefore to wear a smile as treacherous
as that his wily companion he answered with
seeming gratitude
his highness and you my excellent colleagues
have taken counsel your good wishes and kindness
 heart rather than the duty a poor subject
 st mark to toil on in his service while he
hath strength and reason for the task he said
the management a capricious female mind is
i concern no light moment and while i thank
you for this consideration my case you will permit
me to express my readiness to resume the
charge whenever it shall please the state again to
confer it
 this none are more persuaded than we nor
are any better satisfied your ability to discharge
the trust faithfully but you enter signore into all
the bravo 
our motives and will join us in the opinion that it is
equally unbecoming the republic and one its most
illustrious citizens to leave a ward the former ina
position that shall subject the latter to unmerited
censure believe me we have thought less venice
in this matter than the honor and the interests 
the house gradenigo for should this neapolitan
thwart our views you us all would be most liable
to be disapproved 
a thousand thanks excellent sir returned the
deposed guardian you have taken a load from
my mind and restored some the freshness and
elasticity youth the claim don camillo now
is no longer urgent since it is your pleasure to remove
the lady for a season from the city
twere better to hold it in deeper suspense if it
were only to occupy his mind keep up thy communications
as wont and withhold not hope
which is a powerful exciter in minds that are not
deadened by experience we shall not conceal from
one our number that a negotiation is already
near a termination which will relieve the state from
the care the damsel and at some benefit to the
republic her estates lying without our limits greatly
facilitate the treaty which hath only been withheld
from your knowledge by the consideration that
 late we have rather too much overloaded thee
with affairs
again the signor gradenigo bowed submissively
and with apparent joy he saw that his secret design
had been penetrated notwithstanding all his
practised duplicity and specious candor and he
submitted with that species desperate resignation
which becomes a habit if not a virtue in men long
accustomed to be governed despotically when
this delicate subject which required the utmost
finesse venetian policy since it involved the interests
 one who happened at the moment to be
vol i s
 the bravo
in the dreaded council itself was disposed the
three turned their attention to other matters with
that semblance indifference to personal feeling
which practice in tortuous paths stateintrigue
enabled men to assume
since we are so happily opinion concerning
the disposition the donna violetta coolly observed
the oldest senator a rare specimen hackneyed
and worldly morality we may look into our
list daily duties what saith the lion s mouths tonight

a few the ordinary and unmeaning accusations
that spring from personal hatred returned
another one charge his neighbor with oversight
in religious duties and with some carelessness 
the fasts holy church a foolish scandal rated
for the ears a curate
is there naught else 
another complained neglect in a husband
the scrawl is in a woman s hand and beareth on
its face the evidence a woman s resentment
sudden to rise and easy to be appeased let
the neighborhood quiet the household by its sneers
what next
a suitor in the courts maketh complaint the
tardiness the judges
this touched the reputation st mark it must
be looked to
hold interrupted the signor gradenigo the
tribunal acteth advisedly tis in the matter a
hebrew who is thought to have secrets importance
the affair hath need deliberation i do assure
you
destroy the charge have we more 
nothing note the usual number pleasantries
and hobbling verses which tend to nothing
if we get some useful gleanings by these secret accusations
we gain much nonsense i would whip
the bravo 
a youngster ten who could not mould our soft
italian into better rhyme that this
tis the wantonness security let it pass
for all that serveth to amuse suppressed turbulent
thoughts shall we now see his highness signori

you forget the fisherman gravely observed the
signor gradenigo
your honor sayeth true what a head for business
hath he nothing that is useful escape his
ready mind
the old senator while he was too experienced to
be cajoled by such language saw the necessity 
appearing flattered again he bowed and protested
aloud and frequently against the justice compliments
that he so little merited when this little byplay
was over they proceeded gravely to consider
the matter before them
as the decision the council three will be
made apparent in the course the narrative we
shall not continue to detail the conversation that accompanied
their deliberations the sitting was long
so long indeed that when they arose having completed
their business the heavy clock the square
tolled the hour midnight
the doge will be impatient said one the
two nameless members as they threw on their
cloaks before leaving the chamber i thought his
highness wore a more fatigued and feeble air today
than he is wont to exhibit at the festivities 
the city
his highness is no longer young signore if
i remember right he greatly outnumbers either 
us in years our lady lorenzo lend him strength
long to wear the ducal bonnet and wisdom to wear
it well
he hath lately sent offerings to her shrine
signore he hath his confessor hath gone in
 the bravo
person with the offering as i know certainty
tis not a serious gift but a mere remembrance to
keep himself in the odor sanctity i doubt that
his reign will not be long 
there are truly signs decay in his system
he is a worthy prince and we shall lose a father
when called to weep for his loss 
most true signore but the horned bonnet is
not an invulnerable shield against the arrows death
age and infirmities are more potent than our wishes

thou art moody tonight signor gradenigo
thou art not used to be so silent with thy friends
i am not the less grateful signore for their favors
if i have a loaded countenance i bear a lightened
heart one who hath a daughter his own
so happily bestowed in wedlock as thine may judge
 the relief i feel by this disposition my ward
joy affects the exterior frequently like sorrow ay
even to tears
his two companions looked at the speaker with
much obvious sympathy in their manners they
then left the chamber doom together the menials
entered and extinguished the lights leaving all
behind them in an obscurity that was no bad type
 the gloomy mysteries the place
chapter xiv
then methought
a serenade broke silence breathing hope
through walls stone
italy
notwithstanding the lateness the hour the
melody music was rife on the water gondolas
continued to glide along the shadowed canals while
the bravo 
the laugh or the song was echoed among the arches
 the palaces the piazza and piazzetta were yet
brilliant with lights and gay with their multitudes 
unwearied revellers
the habitation donna violetta was far from
the scene general amusement though so remote
the hum the moving throng and the higher
strains the windinstruments came from time to
time to the ears its inmates mellowed and thrilling
by distance
the position the moon cast the whole the
narrow passage which flowed beneath the windows
 her private apartments into shadow in a balcony
which overhung the water stood the youthful
and ardent girl listening with a charmed ear and a
tearful eye to one those soft strains in which
venetian voices answered to each other from different
points on the canals in the songs the gondoliers
her constant companion and mentor was
near while the ghostly father them both stood
deeper in the room
there may be pleasant towns on the main
and capitals more revelry said the charmed
violetta withdrawing her person from its leaning
attitude as the voices ceased but in such a night
and at this witching hour what city may compare
with venice 
providence has been less partial in the distribution
 its earthly favors than is apparent to a vulgar
eye returned the attentive carmelite if we
have our peculiar enjoyments and our moments 
divine contemplation other towns have advantages
 their own genoa and pisa firenze ancona
roma palermo and chiefs all napoli 
napoli father
daughter napoli all the towns sunny
italy tis the fairest and the most blessed in natural
gifts every region i have visited during a life
s
 the bravo
 wandering and penitence that is the country on
which the touch the creator hath been the most
godlike
thou art imaginative tonight good father anselmo
the land must be fair indeed that can thus
warm the fancy a carmelite
the rebuke is just i have spoken more under
the influence recollections that came from days
 idleness and levity than with the chastened spirit
 one who should see the hand the maker in
the most simple and least lovely all his wondrous
works
you reproach yourself causelessly holy father
observed the mild donna florinda raising her eyes
towards the pale countenance the monk to
admire the beauties nature is to worship him
w r ho gave them being
at that moment a burst music rose on the air
proceeding from the water beneath the balcony
donna violetta started back abashed and as she
held her breath in wonder and haply with that delight
which open admiration is apt to excite in a
youthful female bosom the color mounted to her
temples
there passeth a band calmly observed the
donna florinda
no it is a cavalier there are gondoliers servitors
in his colors
this is as hardy as it may be gallant returned
the monk who listened to the air with an evident
and grave displeasure
there was no longer any doubt but that a serenade
was meant though the custom was much
use it was the first time that a similar honor had
been paid beneath the window donna violetta
the studied privacy her life her known destiny
and the jealousy the despotic state and perhaps
the deep respect which encircled a maiden her
the bravo 
tender years aud high condition had until that moment
kept the aspiring the vain and the interested
equally in awe
it is for me whispered the trembling the distressed
the delighted violetta
it is for one us indeed answered the cautious
friend a
be it for whom it may it is bold rejoined the
monk
donna violetta shrunk from observation behind
the drapery the window but she raised a hand in
pleasure as the rich strains rolled through the w r ide
apartments
what a taste rules the band she half whispered
afraid to trust her voice lest a sound should
escape her ears they touch an air petrarch s
sonatas how indiscreet and yet how noble 
more noble than wise said the donna florinda
who entered the balcony and looked intently on
the water beneath
here are musicians in the color a noble in
one gondola she continued and a single cavalier
in another
hath he no servitor doth he ply the oar himself

truly that decency hath not been overlooked 
one in a flowered jacket guides the boat
speak then dearest florinda i pray thee
would it be seemly
indeed i think it speak them fair say that i
am the senate s that it is not discreet to urge a
daughter the state thus say what thou w r wilt but
speak them fair
ha it is don camillo monforte i know him
bv his noble stature and the gallant wave his
hand
this temerity will undo him his claim w r ill
be refused himself banished is it not near
 the bravo
the hour when the gondola the police passes 
admonish him to depart good florinda and yet
can we use this rudeness to a signor his rank 
father counsel us you know the hazards 
this rash gallantry in the neapolitan aid us with
thy wisdom for there is not a moment to lose
the carmelite had been an attentive and an indulgent
observer the emotion which sensations
so novel had awakened in the ardent but unpractised
breast the fair venetian pity sorrow and
sympathy were painted on his mortified face as he
witnessed the mastery feeling over a mind so
guileless and a heart so warm but the look was
rather that one who knew the dangers the
passions than one who condemned them without
thought their origin or power at the appeal 
the governess he turned away and silently quitted
the room donna florinda left the balcony and
drew near her charge there was no explanation
nor any audible or visible means making their
sentiments known to each other violetta threw
herself into the arms her more experienced friend
and struggled to conceal her face in her bosom at
this moment the music suddenly ceased and the
plash oars falling into the water succeeded
he is gone exclaimed the young creature
who had been the object the serenade and whose
faculties spite her confusion had lost none 
their acuteness the gondolas are moving away
and we have not made even the customary acknowledgments
for their civility
it is not needed or rather it might increase a
hazard that is already too weighty remember thy
high destiny my child and let them depart
and yet methinks one my station should not
fail in courtesy the compliment may mean no
more than any other idle usage and they should not
quit us unthanked
the bravo 
rest you within i will watch the movement
 the boats for it surpassed female endurance not
to note their aspect
thanks dearest florinda hasten lest they enter
the other canal ere thou seest them
the governess was quickly in the balcony active
as was her movement her eyes were scarcely
cast upon the shadow beneath before a hurried
question demanded what she beheld
both gondolas are gone was the answer
that with the musicians is already entering the
great canal but that the cavalier hath unaccountably
disappeared 
nay look again he cannot be in such haste to
quit us
i had not sought him in the right direction
here is his gondola by the bridge our own
canal
and the cavalier he waits for some sign 
courtesy it is meet that we should not withhold it
i see him not his servitor is seated on the
steps the landing while the gondola appeareth to
be empty the man hath an air waiting but i
nowhere see the master 
blessed maria can aught have befallen the
gallant duca di sant agata
naught but the happiness casting himself
here exclaimed a voice near the person the
heiress the donna violetta turned her gaze from
the balcony and beheld him who filled all her
thoughts at her feet
the cry the girl the exclamation her friend
and a rapid and eager movement the monk
brought the w r hole party into a group
this may not be said the latter in a reproving
voice arise don camillo lest i repent listening
to your prayer you exceed our conditions
as much as this emotion exceeded my hopes
 the bravo
answered the noble holy father it is vain to oppose
providence providence brought me to the
rescue this lovely being when accident threw her
into the giudecca and once more providence is
my friend by permitting me to be a witness this
feeling speak fair violetta thou wilt not be an
instrument the senate s selfishness thou wilt not
hearken to their wish disposing thy hand on
the mercenary who would trifle with the most sacred
 all vows to possess thy wealth
for whom am i destined demanded violetta
no matter since it be not for me some trafficker
in happiness some worthless abuser the
gifts fortune
thou knowest camillo our venetian custom
and must see that i am hopelessly in their hands
arise duke st agata said the monk with
authority when i suffered you to enter this palace
it was to remove a scandal from its gates and to
save you from your own rash disregard the state s
displeasure it is idle to encourage hopes that the
policy the republic opposes arise then and
respect your pledges
that shall be as this lady may decide encourage
me with but an approving look fairest violetta
and not venice with its doge and inquisition shall
stir me an inch from thy feet 
camillo answered the trembling girl thou
the preserver my life hast little need to kneel tome

duke st agata daughter 
nay heed him not generous violetta he utters
words convention he speaks as all speak in age
when men s tongues deny the feelings their youth
he is a carmelite and must feign this prudence
he never knew the tyranny the passions the
dampness his cell has chilled the ardor the
the bravo 
heart had he been human he would have loved 
had he loved he would never have worn a cowl
father anselmo receded a pace like one pricked
in conscience and the paleness his ascetic features
took a deadly hue his lips moved as if he
would have spoken but the sounds were smothered
by an oppression that denied him utterance the
gentle florinda saw his distress and she endeavored
to interpose between the impetuous youth and
her charge
it may be as you say signor monforte she
said and that the senate in its fatherly care
searches a partner worthy an heiress a house
so illustrious and so endowed as that tiepolo
but in this what is there more than wont do
not the nobles all italy seek their equals in condition
and in the gifts fortune in order that their
union may be fittingly assorted how know we
that the estates my young friend have not a value
in the eye the duke st agata as well as in
those him that the senate may elect for thy husband

can this be true exclaimed violetta
believe it not my errand in venice is no secret
i seek the restitution lands and houses long withheld
from my family with the honors the senate
that are justly mine all these do i joyfully abandon
for the hope thy favor
thou hearest florinda don camillo is not to
be distrusted f
what are the senate and the power st mark
that they should cross our lives with misery be
mine lovely violetta and in the fastnesses my own
good calabriann castle we will defy their vengeance
and policy their disappointment shall furnish merriment
for my vassals and our felicity shall make
the happiness thousands i affect no disrespect
for the dignity the councils nor any indifference
 the bravo
to that i lose but to me art thou far more precious
than the horned bonnet itself with all its fancied
influence and glory
generous camillo 
be mine and spare the cold calculators the
senate another crime they think to dispose thee
as if thou wert worthless merchandise to their own
advantage but thou wilt defeat their design i
read the generous resolution in thine eye violetta 
thou wilt manifest a will superior to their arts and
egotism
i would not be trafficked for don camillo monforte
but wooed and won as befitted a maiden 
my condition they may still leave me liberty 
choice the signer gradenigo hath much encouraged
me late with this hope when speaking 
the establishment suited to my years
believe him not a colder heart a spirit more
removed from charity exists not in venice he
courts thy favor for his own prodigal son a cavalier
without honor the companion profligates and the
victim the hebrews believe him not for he is
stricken in deceit
he is the victim his own designs if this be
true all the youths venice i esteem giacomo
gradenigo least
this interview must have an said the
monk interposing effectually and compelling the
lover to rise it would be easier to escape the
toils sin than to elude the agents the police i
tremble lest this visit should be known for we are
encircled with the ministers the state and not a
palace in venice is more narrowly watched than
this were thy presence here detected indiscreet
young man thy youth might pine in a prison while
thou would st be the cause persecution and unmerited
sorrow to this innocent and inexperienced
maiden
the bravo 
a prison sayesl thou father 
no less daughter lighter offences are often
expiated by heavier judgments when the pleasure
 the senate is thwarted
thou must not be condemned to a prison
camillo
fear it not the years and peaceful calling 
the father make him timid i have long been prepared
for this happy moment and i ask but a single
hour to put venice and all her toils at defiance
give me the blessed assurance thy truth and confide
in my means for the rest
thou hearest florinda 
this bearing is suited to the sex don camillo
dearest but it ill becometh thee a maiden high
quality must await the decision her natural
guard hans
but should that choice be giacomo gradenigo
the senate will not hear it the arts hia
father have long been known to thee and thou must
have seen by the secrecy his own advances that
he distrusts their decision the state will have a
care to dispose thee as befitted thy hopes thou
art sought many and those who guard thy fortune
only await the proposals which best become
thy birth
proposals that become my birth 
suitable in years condition expectations and
character
am i to regard don camillo monforte as one
beneath me
the monk again interposed
 this interview must he said the eyes
drawn upon us by your indiscreet music are now
turned on other objects signore and you must
break your faith or depart
alone father
is the donna violetta to quit the roof her
vol t
 the bravo
father with as little warning as an favored dependant

nay signer monforte you could not in reason
have expected more in this interview than the
hope some future termination to your suit
some pledge 
and that pledge
the eye violetta turned from her governess
to her lover from her lover to the monk and from
the latter to the floor
is thine carnillo
a common cry escaped the carmelite and the
governess
thy mercy excellent friends continued the
blushing bat decided violetta if i have encouraged
don carnillo in a manner that thy counsels
and maiden modesty would reprove reflect that had
he hesitated to cast himself into the giudecca i
should have wanted the power to confer this trifling
grace why should i be less generous than my preserver
no carnillo when the senate condemns me
to wed another than thee it pronounces the doom 
celibacy i will hide my griefs in a convent till i die
there was a solemn and fearful interruption to a
discourse which was so rapidly becoming explicit
by the sound the bell that the groom the chambers
a longtried and confidential domestic had
been commanded to ring before he entered as this
injunction had been accompanied by another not to
appear unless summoned or urged by some grave
motive the signal caused a sudden pause even at
that interesting moment
how now exclaimed the carmelite to the servant
who abruptly entered what means this disregard
 my injunctions
father the republic 
is st mark in jeopardy that females and priest
are summoned to aid him
the bravo 
there are officials the state below who demand
admission in the name the republic i 
this grows serious said don camillo who
alone retained his selfpossession my visit ig
known and the active jealousy the state anticipates
its object summon your resolution donna
violetta and you father be heart i will assume
the responsibility the offence if offence it be and
exonerate all others from censure
forbid it father anselmo dearest florinda
we will share his punishment exclaimed the terrified
violetta losing all selfcommand in the fear 
such a moment he has not been guilty this indiscretion
without participation mine he has not
presumed beyond his encouragement
the monk and donna florinda regarded each
other in mute amazement and haply there was
some admixture feeling in the look that denoted
the uselessness caution when the passions
were intent to elude the vigilance those who
were merely prompted by prudence the former
simply motioned for silence w hile he turned to the
domestic
 what character are these ministers the
state he demanded
father they are its known officers and wear the
badges their condition
and their request
is to be admitted to the presence the donna
violetta
there is still hope rejoined the monk breathing
more freely moving across the room he opened
a door which communicated with the private oratory
 the palace retire within this sacred chapel
don camillo while we await the explanation so
extraordinary a visit
as the time pressed the suggestion was obeyed
on the instant the lover entered the oratory and
 the bravo
when the door was closed upon his person the
domestic one known to be worthy all confidence
was directed to usher in those who waited
without
but a single individual appeared he was known
at a glance for a public and responsible agent 
the government who was often charged with the
execution secret and delicate duties donna vi
oletta advanced to meet him in respect to his employers
and with the return that selfpossession
which long practice interweaves with the habits 
the great
i am honored by this care my dreaded and
illustrious guardians she said making an acknowledgment
for the low reverence with which the official
saluted the richest ward venice to what
circumstance do i owe this visit
the officer gazed an instant about him with an
habitual and suspicious caution and then repeating
his salutations he answered
lady he said i am commanded to seek an
interview with the daughter the state the heiress
 the illustrious house tiepolo with the donna
florinda mercator her female companion with the
father anselmo her commissioned confessor and
with any other who enjoy the pleasure her society
and the honor her confidence
those you seek are here i am violetta tiepolo
 to this lady am i indebted for a mother s care
and this reverend carmelite is my spiritual counsellor
shall i summon my household
it is unnecessary my errand is rather private
than public concern at the decease 
your late most honored and muchlamented parent
the illustrious senator tiepolo the care your
person lady was committed by the republic your
natural and careful protector to the especial guard
bravo 
kinship and wisdom signore alexandre gras
 illustrious birth and estimable qualities
signore you say true
though the parental love the councils may
have seemed to be dormant it has ever been wakeful
and vigilant now that the years instruction
beauty and other excellencies their daughter
have come to so rare perfection they wish to draw
the ties that unite them nearer by assuming their
own immediate duties about her person
by this i am to understand that i am no longer
a ward the signor gradenigo 
lady a ready wit has helped you to the explanation
that illustrious patrician is released from
his cherished and wellacquitted duties tomorrow
new guardians will be charged with the care 
your prized person and will continue their honorable
trust until the wisdom the senate shall have
formed for you such an alliance as shall not disparage
a noble name and qualities that might adorn a
throne
ami to be separated from those i love demanded
violetta impetuously
trust to the senate s wisdom i know not its
determination concerning those who have long
dwelt with you but there can be no reason to doubt
its tenderness or discretion i have now only to
add that until those charged anew with the honorable
office your protectors shall arrive it will
be well to maintain the same modest reserve in
the reception visitors as wont and that your
door lady must in propriety be closed against the
signor gradenigo as against all others his sex
shall i not even thank him for his care
he is tenfold rewarded in the senate s gratitude

it would have been gracious to have expressed
my feelings towards the signor gradenigo in
t
 the bravo
words but that which is refused to the tongue will
be permitted to the pen
the reserve that becomes the state one so favored
is absolute st mark is jealous where he
loves and now my commission is discharged i
humbly take my leave flattered in having been selected
to stand in such a presence and to have been
thought worthy so honorable a duty
as the officer ceased speaking and violetta returned
his bows she turned her eyes filled with apprehension
on the sorrowful features her companions
the ambiguous language those employed
in such missions was too well known to
leave much hope for the future they all anticipated
their separation on the morrow though
neither could penetrate the reason this sudden
change in the policy the state interrogation
was useless for the blow evidently came from the
secret council whose motives could no more be
fathomed than its decrees foreseen the monk
raised his hands in silent benediction towards his
spiritual charge and unable even in the presence
 the stranger to repress their grief donna florinda
and violetta sunk into each other s arms and
wept
in the mean time the minister this cruel blow
had delayed his departure like one who had a halfformed
resolution he regarded the countenance
 the unconscious carmelite intently and in a manner
that denoted the habit thinking much before
he decided
reverend father he said may i crave a
moment your time for an affair that concerns
the soul a sinner
though amazed the monk could not hesitate
about answering such an appeal obedient to a
gesture the officer he followed him from the
apartment and continued at his side while the other
the bravo 
threaded the magnificent rooms and descended to
his gondola
you must be much honored the senate holy
monk observed the latter while they proceeded
to hold so near a trust about the person one in
whom the state takes so great an interest
i feel it as such my son a life peace and
prayer should have made me friends
men like you father merit the esteem they
crave are you long venice 
since the last conclave i came into the republic
as confessor to the late minister from florence

an honorable trust you have been with us
then long enough to know that the republic never
forgets a servitor nor forgives an affront
tis an ancient state and one whose influence
still reaches far and near
have a care the step these marbles are
treacherous to an uncertain foot
mine is too practised in the descent to be unsteady
i hope i do not now descend these stairs
for the last time
the minister the council affected not to understand
the question but he answered as if replying
only to the previous observation
t is truly a venerable state he said but a little
tottering with its years all who love liberty
father must mourn to see so glorious a sway on the
decline sic transit gloria mundi you barefooted
carmelite do well to mortify the flesh in youth by
which you escape the pains a decreasing power
one like you can have few wrongs his younger
days to repair
we are none us without sin returned the
monk crossing himself he who would flatter his
soul with being perfect lays the additional weight
 vanity on his life
 the bravo
men my occupation holy carmelite have
few opportunities looking into themselves and i
bless the hour that hath brought me into company
so godly my gondola waits will you enter
the monk regarded his companion in distrust
but knowing the uselessness resistance he murmured
a short prayer and complied a strong
dash the oars announced their departure from
the steps the palace

venetian boat song
the moon was at the height its rays fell in a
flood on the swelling domes and massive roofs 
venice while the margin the town was brilliantly
defined by the glittering bay the natural and
gorgeous setting was more than worthy that picture
 human magnificence for at that moment
rich as was the queen the adriatic in her works
 art the grandeur her public monuments the
number and splendor her palaces and most else
that the ingenuity and ambition man could attempt
she was but secondary in the glories the
hour
above was the firmament gemmed with worlds
and sublime in immensity beneath lay the broad
expanse the adriatic endless to the eye tranquil
the bravo 
as the vault it reflected and luminous with its borrowed
light here and there a low island reclaimed
from the sea by the patient toil a thousand
years dotted the lagunes burthened with the group
 some conventual dwellings or picturesque with
the modest roofs a hamlet the fishermen
neither oar nor song nor laugh nor flap sail
nor jest mariner disturbed the stillness all in
the near view was clothed in midnight loveliness
arid all in the distance bespoke the solemnity nature
at peace the city and the lagunes the gulf
and the dreamy alps the interminable plain lombardy
and the blue void heaven lay alike in a
common and grand repose
there suddenly appeared a gondola it issued
from among the watery channels the town and
glided upon the vast bosom the bay noiseless as
the fancied progress a spirit a practised and
nervous arm guided its movement which was unceasing
and rapid so swift indeed was the passage
 the boat as to denote pressing haste on the part
 the solitary individual it contained it held the
direction the adriatic steering between one 
the more southern outlets the bay and the wellknown
island st giorgio for half an hour the
exertions the gondolier were unrelaxed though
his eye was often cast behind him as if he distrusted
pursuit and as often did he gaze ahead betraying
an anxious desire to reach some object that was
yet invisible when a wide reach water lay between
him and the town however he permitted his
oar to rest and he lent all his faculties to a keen and
anxious search
a small dark spot was discovered on the water
still nearer to the sea the oar the gondolier
dashed the element behind him and his boat again
glided away so far altering its course as to show
that all indecision was now ended the darker spot
 the bravo
was shortly beheld quivering in the rays the moon
and it soon assumed the form and dimensions a
boat at anchor again the gondolier ceased his efforts
and he leaned forward gazing intently at this
undefined object as if he would aid his powers 
sight by the sympathy his other faculties just
then the notes music came softly across the lagunes
the voice was feeble even to trembling but
it had the sweetness tone and the accuracy 
execution which belong so peculiarly to venice it
was the solitary man in the distant boat indulging
in the song a fisherman the strains were sweet
and the intonations plaintive to melancholy the
air was common to all who plied the oar in the canals
and familiar to the ear the listener he
waited until the close a verse had died away and
then he answered with a strain his own the
alternate parts were thus maintained until the music
ceased by the two singing a final verse in chorus
when the song was ended the oar the gondolier
stirred the water again and he was quickly by
the other s side
thou art busy with thy hook betimes antonio
said he who had just arrived as he stepped into the
boat the old fisherman already so well known to
the reader there are men that an interview with
the council three would have sent to their
prayers and a sleepless bed
there is not a chapel in venice jacopo in
which a sinner may so well lay bare his soul as in
this i have been here on the empty lagunes alone
with god having the gates paradise open before
my eyes
one like thee hath no need images to quicken
his devotion
i see the image my savior jacopo in those
bright stars that moon the blue heavens the misty
bank mountain the waters on which we float ay
the bravo 
even in my own sinking form as in all which has
come from his wisdom and power i have prayed
much since the moon has risen
and is habit so strong in thee that thou thickest
 god and thy sins while thou angles
the poor must toil and the sinful must pray
my thoughts have dwelt so much late on the boy
that i have forgotten to provide myself with food
if i fish later or earlier than common tis because a
man cannot live on grief
i have bethought me thy situation honest
antonio here is that which will support life and
raise thy courage see added the bravo stretching
forth an arm into his own gondola from which
he drew a basket here is bread from dalmatia
wine lower italy and figs from the levant eat
then and be cheer
the fisherman threw a wistful glance at the
viands for hunger was making powerful appeals to
the weakness nature but his hand did not relinquish
its hold the line with which he still continued
to angle
and these are thy gifts jacopo he asked in a
voice that spite his resignation betrayed the
longings appetite
antonio they are the offerings one who respects
thy courage and honors thy nature
bought with his earnings
can it be otherwise i am no beggar for the
love the saints and few in venice give unasked
eat then without fear seldom wilt thou be more
welcome
take them away jacopo if thou lowest me do
not tempt me beyond what i can bear
how art thou commanded to a penance 
hastily exclaimed the other
not so not so it is long since i have found
leisure or heart for the confessional
 tiie bravo
then why refuse the gift a friend remember
thy years and necessities
i cannot feed on the price blood 
the hand the bravo was withdrawn as if repelled
by an electric touch the action caused the
rays the moon to fail athwart his kindling eye
and firm as antonio was in honesty and principle
he felt the blood creep to his heart as he encountered
the fierce and sudden glance h companion
a long pause succeeded during which the fisherman
diligently plied his line though utterly regardless
 the object for which it had been cast
i have said it jacopo he added at length
and tongue mine shall not belie the thought 
my heart take away thy food then and forget all
that is past for what i have said hath not been
said in scorn but out regard to my own soul
thou knowest how i have sorrowed for the boy
but next to his loss i could mourn over thee ay
more bitterly than over any other the fallen 
the hard breathing the bravo was audible but
still he spoke not
jacopo continued the anxious fisherman do
not mistake me the pity the suffering and poor
is not like the scorn the rich and worldly if i
touch a sore i do not bruise it with my heel thy
present pain is better than the greatest all thy
former joys
enough old man said the other in a smothered
voice thy words are forgotten eat without
fear for the uttering is bought with earnings as pure
as the gleanings a mendicant friar
i will trust to the kindness st anthony and
the fortune my hook simply returned antonio
 tis common for us the lagunes to go to a supperless
bed take away the basket good jacopo
and let us speak other things
the bravo ceased to press his food upon the fishthe
bravo 
german laying aside his basket he sate brooding
over what had occurred
hast thou come thus far for naught else good
jacopo demanded the old man willing to weaken
the shock his refusal
the question appeared to restore jacopo to a recollection
 his errand he stood erect and looked
about him for more than a minute with a keen
eye and an entire intentness purpose the lookin
the direction the city was longer and more
earnest than those thrown toward the sea and the
main nor was it withdrawn until an involuntary
start betrayed equally surprise and alarm
is there not a boat here in a line with the
tower the campanile he asked quickly pointing
towards the city
it so seems it is early for my comrades to be
abroad but the draughts have not been heavy 
late and the revelry yesterday drew many our
people from their toil the patricians must eat and
the poor must labor or both would die
the bravo slowly seated himself and he looked
with concern into the countenance his companion
art thou long here antonio 
but an hour when they turned us away from
the palace thou knowest that i told thee my necessities
there is not in common a more certain
spot on the lagunes than this and yet have i long
played the line in vain the trial hunger is hard
but like all other trials it must be borne i have
prayed to my patron thrice and sooner or later he
will listen to my wants thou art used to the manners
 these masked nobles jacopo dost thou
think them likely to hearken to reason i hope i
did the cause no wrong for want breeding but i
spoke them fair and plainly as fathers and men with
hearts
as senators they have none thou little undervol
i u
 the bravo
stances antonio the distinctions these patricians
in the gaiety their palaces and among the companions
 their pleasures none will speak you fairer
 humanity and justice ay even god but
when met to discuss what they call the interests 
st mark there is not a rock on the coldest peak 
yonder alp with less humanity or a wolf among
their valleys more heartless 
thy words are strong jacopo i would not do
injustice even to those who have done me this wrong
the senators are men and god has given all feelings
and nature alike
the gift is then abused thou hast felt the
want thy daily assistant fisherman and thou hast
sorrowed for thy child for thee it is easy to enter
into another s griefs but the senators know nothing
 suffering their children are not dragged to the
galleys their hopes are never destroyed by laws
coming from hard taskmasters nor are their tears
shed for sons ruined by being made companions 
the dregs the republic they will talk public
virtue and services to the state but in their own
cases they mean the virtue renown and services
that bring with them honors and rewards the
wants the state is their conscience though they
take heed those wants shall do themselves no harm
k jacopo providence itself hath made a difference
in men one is large another small one weak
another strong one wise another foolish at what
providence hath done we should not murmur 
providence did not make the senate t is an invention
 man mark me antonio thy language
hath given offence and thou art not safe in venice
they will pardon all but complaints against their
justice that is too true to be forgiven
can they wish to harm one who seeks his own
child
 if thou wert great and respected they would
the bravo 
undermine thy fortune and character ere thou
should st put their system in danger as thou art
weak and poor they will do thee some direct injury
unless thou art moderate before all i warn
thee that their system must stand 
will god suffer this
we may not enter into his secrets returned the
bravo devoutly crossing himself did his reign
 with this world there might be injustice in suffering
the wicked to triumph but as it is we
yon boat approaches fast i little like its air and
movements 
they are not fishermen truly for there are many
oars and a canopy
it is a gondola the state exclaimed jacopo
rising and stepping into his own boat which he cast
loose from that his companion when he stood in
evident doubt as to his future proceedings antonio
we should do well to row away 
thy fears are natural said the unmoved fisherman
 and tis a thousand pities that there is
cause for them there is yet time for one skilful
as thou to outstrip the fleetest gondola on the canals

quick lift thy anchor old man and depart
my eye is sure i know the boat
poor jacopo what a curse is a tender conscience
 thou hast been kind to me in my need
and if prayers from a sincere heart can do thee
service thou shalt not w r ant them
antonio cried the other causing his boat to
whirl away and then pausing an instant like a man
undecided i can stay no longer trust them not
they are false as fiends there is no time to lose
i must away
the fisherman murmured an ejaculation pity
as he waved a hand in adieu 
holy st anthony watch over my own child
 the bravo
lest he corne to some such miserable life he added
in an audible prayer there hath been good
seed cast on a rock in that youth for a warmer or
kinder heart is not in man that one like jacopo
should live by striking the assassin s blow 
the near approach the strange gondola now
attracted the whole attention the old man it
came swiftly towards him impelled by six strong
oars and his eye turned feverishly in the direction
 the fugitive jacopo with a readiness that necessity
and long practice rendered nearly instinctive
had taken a direction which blended his wake
in a line with one those bright streaks that the
moon drew on the water and which by dazzling
the eye effectually concealed the objects within its
width when the fisherman saw that the bravo had
disappeared he smiled and seemed at ease
ay let them come here he said it will give
jacopo more time i doubt not the poor fellow hath
struck a blow since quitting the palace that the council
will not forgive the sight gold hath been
too strong and he hath offended those who have
so long borne with him god forgive me that i
have had communion with such a man but when
the heart is heavy the pity even a dog will
warm our feelings few care for me now or the
friendship such as he could never have been welcome

antonio ceased for the gondola the state
came with a rushing noise to the side his own
boat where it was suddenly stopped by a backward
sweep the oars the water was still in
ebullition when a form passing into the gondola 
the fisherman the larger boat shot away again to
the distance a few hundred feet and remained at
rest
antonio witnessed this movement in silent curiosity
 but when he saw the gondoliers tie state
the bravo 
lying on their oars he glanced his eye again furtively
in the direction jacopo saw that all was
safe and faced his companion with confidence
the brightness the moon enabled him to distinguish
the dress and aspect a barefooted carmelite
the latter seemed more confounded than his
companion by the rapidity the movement and
the novelty his situation notwithstanding his
confusion however an evident look wonder
crossed his mortified features when he first beheld
the humble condition the thin and whitened locks
and the general air and bearing the old man with
whom he now found himself
who art thou escaped him in the impulse 
surprise
antonio the lagunes a fisherman that
owes much to st anthony for favors little deserved

and why hath one like thee fallen beneath the
senate s displeasure 
i am honest and ready to do justice to others
if that offend the great they are men more to be
pitied than envied
the convicted are always more disposed to believe
themselves unfortunate than guilty the error
is fatal and it should be eradicated from the mind
lest it lead to death
go tell this to the patricians they have need
 plain counsel and a warning from the church
my son there is pride and anger and a perverse
heart in thy replies the sins the senators
and as they are men they are not without spot
can in no manner whiten thine own though
an unjust sentence should condemn one to punishment
it leaves the offences against god in their native
deformity men may pity him who hath wrongfully
undergone the anger the world but the
church will only pronounce pardon on him who 

 the bravo
passeth his errors with a sincere admission their
magnitude
have you come father to shrive a penitent 
such is my errand i lament the occasion and
if what i fear be true still more must i regret that
one so aged should have brought his devoted head
beneath the arm justice nev
antonio smiled and again he bent his eyes alon
that dazzling streak light which had swallowed
up the gondola and the person the bravo
father he said when a long and earnest look
was ended there can be little harm in speaking
truth to one thy holy office they have told thee
there was a criminal here in the lagunes who hath
provoked the anger st mark
thou art right
it is not easy to know when st mark is pleased
or when he is not continued antonio plying his
line with indifference for the very man he now
seeks has he long tolerated ay even in presence
 the doge the senate hath its reasons which lie
beyond the reach the ignorant but it would have
been better for the soul the poor youth and
more seemly for the republic had it turned a discouraging
countenance on his deeds from the first
thou speakest another thou art not then
the criminal they seek
i am a sinner like all born woman reverend
carmelite but my hand hath never held any other
weapon than the good sword with which i struck
the infidel there was one lately here that i grieve
to add cannot say this 
and he is gone
father you have your eyes and you can answer
that question for yourself he is gone though
he is not far still is he beyond the reach the
swiftest gondola in venice praised be st mark
the carmelite bowed his head where he was
the bravo 
seated and his lips moved either in prayer orin
thanksgiving
are you sorry monk that a sinner has escaped

son i rejoice that this bitter office hath passed
from me while i mourn that there should be a spirit
so depraved as to require it let us summon the
servants the republic and inform them that their
errand is useless
be not haste good father the night is
gentle and these hirelings sleep on their oars like
gulls in the lagunes the youth will have more
time for repentance should he be undisturbed
the carmelite who had arisen instantly reseated
himself like one actuated by a strong impulse
i thought he had already been far beyond pursuit
he muttered unconsciously apologizing for
his apparent haste
he is over bold and i fear he will row back to
the canals in which case you might meet nearer to
the city or there may be more gondolas the
state out in short father thou wilt be more certain
to escape hearing the confession a bravo by
listening to that a fisherman who has long wanted
an occasion to acknowledge his sins
men who ardently wish the same result require
few words to understand each other the carmelite
took intuitively the meaning his companion
and throwing back his cowl a movement that exposed
the countenance father anselmo he prepared
to listen to the confession the old man
thou art a christian and one thy years hath
not to learn the state mind that becometh a penitent
 said the monk when each was ready
i am a sinner father give me counsel and absolution
that i may have hope
thy will be done thy prayer s heard approach
and kneel
 the bravo
antonio who had fastened his line to his seat
and disposed his net with habitual care now
crossed himself devoutly and took his station before
the carmelite his acknowledgments error then
began much mental misery clothed the language
and ideas the fisherman with a dignity that his
auditor had not been accustomed to find in men 
his class a spirit so long chastened by suffering
had become elevated and noble he related his
hopes for the boy the manner in which they had
been blasted by the unjust and selfish policy the
state his different efforts to procure the release
 his grandson and his bold expedients at the regatta
and the fancied nuptials with the adriatic
when he had thus prepared the carmelite to understand
the origin his sinful passions which it was
now his duty to expose he spoke those passions
themselves and their influence on a mind that
was ordinarily at peace with mankind the tale
was told simply and without reserve but in a manner
to inspire respect and to awaken powerful sympathy
in him who heard it
and these feelings ttwu didst indulge against the
honored and powerful venice demanded the
monk affecting a severity he could not feel
before my god do i confess the sin in bitterness
 heart i cursed them for to me they seemed
men without feeling for the poor and heartless as
the marbles their own palaces
thou knowest that to be forgiven thou must
forgive dost thou at peace with all earth forget
this wrong and canst thou in charity with thy
fellows pray to him who died for the race in behalf
 those who have injured thee 
antonio bowed his head on his naked breast and
he seemed to commune with his soul
father he said in a rebuked tone i hope i
do
the bravo 
thou must not trifle with tin self to thine own
perdition there is an eye in yon vault above us
which pervades space and which looks into the inmost
secrets the heart canst thou pardon the
error the patricians in a contrite spirit for tliino
own sins
holy maria pray for them as i now ask mercy
in their behalf father they are forgiven
amen 
the carmelite arose and stood over the kneeling
antonio with the whole his benevolent countenance
illuminated by the moon stretching his arms
towards the stars he pronounced the absolution ina
voice that was touched with pious fervor the
upward expectant eye with the withered lineaments
 the fisherman and the holy calm the
monk formed a picture resignation and hope that
angels would have loved to witness
amen amen exclaimed antonio as he arose
crossing himself st anthony and the virgin aid
me to keep these resolutions 
i will not forget thee my son in the offices 
holy church receive my benediction that i may
depart
antonio again bowed his knee while the carmelite
firmly pronounced the words peace when
this last office was performed and a decent interval
 mutual but silent prayer had passed a signal was
given to summon the gondola the state it came
rowing down with great force and was instantly
at their side two men passed into the boat antonio
and with officious zeal assisted the monk to
resume his place in that the republic
is the penitent shrived half whispered one
seemingly the superior the two
here is an error he thou seest has escaped
this aged man is a fisherman named antonio and
one who cannot have gravely offended st mark
 the bravo
the bravo hath passed toward the island san
giorgio and must be sought elsewhere
the officer released the person the monk who
passed quickly beneath the canopy and he turned to
cat a hasty glance at the features the fisherman
the rubbing a rope was audible and the anchor
 antonio was lifted by a sudden jerk a heavy
plashing the water followed and the two boats
shot away together obedient to a violent effort 
the crew the gondola the state exhibited its
usual number gondoliers bending to their toil
with its dark and hearselike canopy but that 
the fisherman was empty 
the sweep the oars and the plunge the body
 antonio had been blended in a common wash 
the surge when the fisherman came to the surface
after his fall he was alone in the centre the
vast but tranquil sheet water there might have
been a glimmering hope as he arose from the
darkness the sea to the bright beauty that
moonlit night but the sleeping domes were too
far for human strength and the gondolas were
sweeping madly towards the town he turned and
swimming feebly for hunger and previous exertion
had undermined his strength he bent his eye on the
dark spot which he had constantly recognized as
the boat the bravo
jacopo had not ceased to watch the interview
with the utmost intentness his faculties favored
by position he could see without being distinctly
visible he saw the carmelite pronouncing the absolution
and he witnessed the approach the larger
boat he heard a plunge heavier than that falling
oars and he saw the gondola antonio towing
away empty the crew the republic had scarcely
swept the lagunes with their oarblades before
his own stirred the water
the bravo 
jacopo jacopo came fearfully and faintly
to his ears
the aoice was known and the occasion thoroughly
understood the cry distress was succeeded
by the rush the water as it piled before the beak
 the bravo s gondola the sound the parted
element was like the sighing a breeze ripples
and bubbles were left behind as the driven scud
floats past the stars and all those muscles which
had once before that day been so finely developed
in the race the gondoliers were now expanded
seemingly in twofold volumes energy and skill
were in every stroke and the dark spot came down
the streak light like the swallow touching the
water with its wing
hither jacopo thou steepest wide 
the beak the gondola turned and the glaring
eye the bravo caught a glimpse the fisherman s
head
quickly good jacopo i fail
the murmuring the water again drowned the
stifled words the efforts the oar were frenzied
and at each stroke the light gondola appeared to
rise from its element
jacopo hither dear jacopo 
the mother god aid thee fisherman i
some
jacopo the boy the boy 
the water gurgled an arm was visible in the
air and it disappeared the gondola drove upon
the spot where the limb had just been visible and a
backward stroke that caused the ashen blade to
bead like a reed laid the trembling boat motionless
the furious action threw tire lagune into ebullition
but when the foam subside it lay calm as the blue
and peaceful vault it reflected
 antonio burst from the lips the bravo
a frightful silence succeeded the call there wa
 the bravo
neither answer nor human form jacopo compressed
the handle his oar with fingers iron and
his own breathing caused him to start on every
side he bent a frenzied eye and on every side he
beheld the profound repose that treacherous element
which is so terrible in its wrath like the
human heart it seemed to sympathize with the tranquil
beauty the midnight view but like the
human heart it kept its own fearful secrets

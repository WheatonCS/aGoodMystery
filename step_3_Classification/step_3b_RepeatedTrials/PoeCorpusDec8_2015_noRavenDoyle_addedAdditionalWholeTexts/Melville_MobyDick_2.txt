book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise a pirate very
savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger
than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him
and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many times but
never yet saw him captured

book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealy-mouthed porpoise the
largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is
known the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated
is that of the fishers right-whale porpoise from the circumstance that
he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs
in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly
girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure he has
no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail
and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealy-mouth spoils
all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable
yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ship's hull called
the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two
separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part
of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he
had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag a most mean and
mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise


beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as
the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the
leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive
half-fabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by
reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their
fore-castle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if
any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then
he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio
octavo or duodecimo magnitude the bottle-nose whale the junk whale
the pudding-headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon
whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the
iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic
dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of
uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit
them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for
mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing

finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be
here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have
kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus
unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the
crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small
erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true
ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever
completing anything this whole book is but a draught nay but the
draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience



chapter the specksynder


concerning the officers of the whale-craft this seems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board arising
from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown
of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet

the large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries
and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an
officer called the specksynder literally this word means fat-cutter
usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in
those days the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation
and general management of the vessel while over the whale-hunting
department and all its concerns the specksynder or chief harpooneer
reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted
title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but
his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply
as senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captain's more
inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since
in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat
but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the
command of the ship's deck is also his therefore the grand political
maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from
the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as
their social equal

now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is
this the first lives aft the last forward hence in whale-ships and
merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and
so too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in the
captain's cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it

though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest
of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and
the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high
or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their
common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and
hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind
how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some
primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious
externals at least of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed
and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost
as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the
shabbiest of pilot-cloth

and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage
he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he
required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon
the quarter-deck and though there were times when owing to peculiar
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he
addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or in
terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means
unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea

nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those
forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally
making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain
which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through
those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
dictatorship for be a man's intellectual superiority what it will
it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men
without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always
in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever
keeps god's true princes of the empire from the world's hustings and
leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who
become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice
hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted
superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks
in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them
that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted
potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown
of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian
herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the
tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest
sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in
his art as the one now alluded to

but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket
grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and
kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings
and housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it
must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and
featured in the unbodied air



chapter the cabin-table


it is noon and dough-boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
face from the cabin-scuttle announces dinner to his lord and
master who sitting in the lee quarter-boat has just been taking an
observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the
smooth medallion-shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on
the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the
tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but
presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to
the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr
starbuck disappears into the cabin

when the last echo of his sultan's step has died away and starbuck the
first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck
rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after
a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness
dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges
about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to
see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise
takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows
after his predecessors

but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his
shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the grand turk's head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching
his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other
processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into
the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and
then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab's presence
in the character of abjectus or the slave

it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
same commander's cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say
deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of
the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this
difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of
babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he
who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private dinner-table of invited guests that man's unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time that man's royalty of
state transcends belshazzar's for belshazzar was not the greatest who
has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be caesar it
is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now
if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
ship-master then by inference you will derive the cause of that
peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned

over his ivory-inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned
sea-lion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be
served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab
there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind
their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife as he carved
the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they
would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his
knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby
motioned starbuck's plate towards him the mate received his meat as
though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started
if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it
noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like
the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly
dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were
somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab
forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was
to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and
poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary
family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have
been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this
must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had
he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have
been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless
strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself
the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did
flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners
of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear
sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such
marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for
him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man

another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask
is the first man up consider for hereby flask's dinner was badly
jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb
even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small
appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask
must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day
for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck
therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he
had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never
known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what
he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him
peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from
my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of
old-fashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the
mast there's the fruits of promotion now there's the vanity of glory
there's the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere
sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask's official
capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance
was to go aft at dinner-time and get a peep at flask through the cabin
sky-light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab

now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
in the pequod's cabin after their departure taking place in inverted
order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three
harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees
they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty
cabin

in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captain's table was the entire care-free
license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the
sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food
with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords
they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices
such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out
the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale dough-boy was
fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk seemingly quarried out of
the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with
a nimble hop-skip-and-jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoon-wise and once
daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted dough-boy's memory by
snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the
circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous
shuddering sort of little fellow this bread-faced steward the progeny
of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing
spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous
visitations of these three savages dough-boy's whole life was one
continual lip-quiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished
with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into
his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the
blinds of its door till all was over

it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing
his filed teeth to the indian's crosswise to them daggoo seated on the
floor for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin
framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a
ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious
not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad
baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed
strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his
dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by
beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a
mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so
much so that the trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether
any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear
tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be
picked the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the
whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their
lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at
all tend to tranquillize poor dough-boy how could he forget that in his
island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some
murderous convivial indiscretions alas dough-boy hard fares the
white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on
his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight
the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous
fable-mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every
step like moorish scimetars in scabbards

but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived
there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleeping-time
when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters

in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale
captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ship's cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth
the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to
have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it
was something as a street-door enters a house turning inwards for
a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing
residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin
was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally
included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he
lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled
missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of
the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter
there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age
ahab's soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the
sullen paws of its gloom



chapter the mast-head


it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round

in most american whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising ground and if after a three four or five years voyage
she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her say an empty vial
even then her mast-heads are kept manned to the last and not till her
skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more

now as the business of standing mast-heads ashore or afloat is a very
ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here
i take it that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them
for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by
their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all asia
or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread
gale of god's wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders
priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of
mast-head standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among
archaeologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical
purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like
formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious
long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount
to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the look-outs of a
modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in
saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him
a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of
his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a
tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
stander-of-mast-heads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs
or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to
the last literally died at his post of modern standers-of-mast-heads
we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely
incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange
sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome
stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air
careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis
blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high aloft on
his towering main-mast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillars
his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun-metal stands his
mast-head in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that
london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for
where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor
napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however
madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks
upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits
penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals
and what rocks must be shunned

it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is
not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole
historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us
that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty
spars along the sea-coast to which the look-outs ascended by means
of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house a few
years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand
who upon descrying the game gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh
the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the
one proper mast-head that of a whale-ship at sea the three mast-heads
are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set the seamen taking their
regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two
hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant
the mast-head nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there
you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the
deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and
between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even
as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old
rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with
nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship indolently rolls the
drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the
most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests
you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts
of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear
of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner for
all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and
your bill of fare is immutable

in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years
voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the
mast-head would amount to several entire months and it is much to be
deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute
of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock
a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your
most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallant-mast where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called
the t gallant cross-trees here tossed about by the sea the beginner
feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns to be sure
in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of
a watch-coat but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more
of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its
fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out
of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim
crossing the snowy alps in winter so a watch-coat is not so much of
a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you
cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you
make a convenient closet of your watch-coat

concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
or pulpits called crow's-nests in which the look-outs of a greenland
whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in
the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the
icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the
re-discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in
this admirable volume all standers of mast-heads are furnished with
a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
crow's-nest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleet's good
craft he called it the sleet's crow's-nest in honour of himself he
being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous
false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our
own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so
likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we
may beget in shape the sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large
tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with
a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale
being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a
little trap-hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the
stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for
umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which
to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical
conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his mast-head in this
crow's-nest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him
also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for
the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns
infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from
the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon
them is a very different thing now it was plainly a labor of love
for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed
conveniences of his crow's-nest but though he so enlarges upon many
of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his
experiments in this crow's-nest with a small compass he kept there for
the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to
the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks and in the
glacier's case perhaps to there having been so many broken-down
blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very
discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle
deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors
he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed
in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted
occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle so nicely
tucked in on one side of his crow's nest within easy reach of his hand
though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the
honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he
should so utterly ignore that case-bottle seeing what a faithful friend
and comforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
within three or four perches of the pole

but if we southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is
greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a
chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there
then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the
top-sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at
last mount to my ultimate destination

let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but
sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how
could i being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
altitude how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
whale-ships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out
every time

and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship-owners of
nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who
offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head beware
of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be
killed and this sunken-eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes
round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor
are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whale-fishery
furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent-minded
young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches
himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship and
in moody phrase ejaculates 

roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand
blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain

very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
interest in the voyage half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honourable ambition as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young
platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are
short-sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have
left their opera-glasses at home

why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads we've been
cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale
yet whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here
perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
the far horizon but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
vacant unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep
blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every
strange half-seen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every
dimly-discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him
the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs
away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like
crammer's sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every
shore the round globe over

there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from
the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye
move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity
comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps
at mid-day in the fairest weather with one half-throttled shriek you
drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise
for ever heed it well ye pantheists



chapter the quarter-deck


enter ahab then all


it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one
morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck there most sea-captains usually walk at that
hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the
garden

soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old
rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over
dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did
you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also
you would see still stranger foot-prints the foot-prints of his one
unsleeping ever-pacing thought

but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his
thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the
main-mast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought
turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely
possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every
outer movement

d'ye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick that's in him pecks
the shell twill soon be out

the hours wore on ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the
deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect

it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there and with
one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft

sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case

send everybody aft repeated ahab mast-heads there come down

when the entire ship's company were assembled and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew
started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but
this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried 

what do ye do when ye see a whale men

sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices

good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
thrown them

and what do ye next men

lower away and after him

and what tune is it ye pull to men

a dead whale or a stove boat

more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began
to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions

but they were all eagerness again as ahab now half-revolving in his
pivot-hole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost
convulsively grasping it addressed them thus 

all ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale look ye d'ye see this spanish ounce of gold holding up a
broad bright coin to the sun it is a sixteen dollar piece men d'ye
see it mr starbuck hand me yon top-maul

while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if
to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
vitality in him

receiving the top-maul from starbuck he advanced towards the main-mast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the
other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye
raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw
whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale with three holes
punctured in his starboard fluke look ye whosoever of ye raises me
that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys

huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast

it's a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul
a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water
if ye see but a bubble sing out

all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection

captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that
some call moby dick

moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash

does he fan-tail a little curious sir before he goes down said the
gay-header deliberately

and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a
parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab

and he have one two three oh good many iron in him hide too
captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twiske-tee be-twisk like
him him faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and
round as though uncorking a bottle like him him 

corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted
and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole
shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the
great annual sheep-shearing aye tashtego and he fan-tails like a
split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have
seen moby dick moby dick

captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far
been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain
ahab i have heard of moby dick but it was not moby dick that took off
thy leg

who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my
hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that
brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with
a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart-stricken moose
aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with
measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and i'll chase him
round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and
round perdition's flames before i give him up and this is what ye have
shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and
over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out
what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look
brave

aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the
excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for
moby dick

god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye
men steward go draw the great measure of grog but what's this long
face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not
game for moby dick

i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain
ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i
came here to hunt whales not my commander's vengeance how many barrels
will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it
will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market

nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest
a little lower layer if money's to be the measurer man and the
accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe by
girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let
me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here

he smites his chest whispered stubb what's that for methinks it
rings most vast but hollow

vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing
captain ahab seems blasphemous

hark ye yet again the little lower layer all visible objects man
are but as pasteboard masks but in each event in the living act the
undoubted deed there some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if man
will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside
except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that
wall shoved near to me sometimes i think there's naught beyond but
tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength
with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is
chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale
principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy
man i'd strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that
then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play
herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man
is even that fair play who's over me truth hath no confines take off
thine eye more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish
stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to
anger-glow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing
unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i
meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of
spotted tawn living breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan
leopards the unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek
and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the
crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale
see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it
stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot
starbuck and what is it reckon it tis but to help strike a fin no
wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt
then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back
when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings
seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speak aye aye
thy silence then that voices thee aside something shot from my
dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine
cannot oppose me now without rebellion

god keep me keep us all murmured starbuck lowly

but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the
hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage
nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment
their hearts sank in for again starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with
the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds
blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah
ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but
rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much
predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things
within for with little external to constrain us the innermost
necessities in our being these still drive us on

the measure the measure cried ahab

receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he
ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging them before him near
the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates
stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ship's company
formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly
eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the
bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere
he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to
fall into the hidden snare of the indian

drink and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman the crew alone now drink round with it round short
draughts long swallows men tis hot as satan's hoof so so it
goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this
way it comes hand it me here's a hollow men ye seem the years so
brimming life is gulped and gone steward refill

attend now my braves i have mustered ye all round this capstan and
ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there
with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some
sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you
will yet see that ha boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand
it me why now this pewter had run brimming again were't not thou st
vitus imp away thou ague

advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let
me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the
three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing
suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from
starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed as though by some
nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the
same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic
life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic
aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of
starbuck fell downright

in vain cried ahab but maybe tis well for did ye three but
once take the full-forced shock then mine own electric thing that had
perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye
dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do
appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there yon three
most honourable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain
the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using
his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that
shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings
and draw the poles ye harpooneers

silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs
up before him

stab me not with that keen steel cant them cant them over know ye
not the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cup-bearers
advance the irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith
slowly going from one officer to the other he brimmed the harpoon
sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter

now three to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow
them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league ha
starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful
whaleboat's bow death to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt
moby dick to his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted
and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were
simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss starbuck paled and turned and
shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds
among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all
dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin



chapter sunset


the cabin by the stern windows ahab sitting alone and gazing out


i leave a white and turbid wake pale waters paler cheeks where'er i
sail the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track let them
but first i pass

yonder by ever-brimming goblet's rim the warm waves blush like wine
the gold brow plumbs the blue the diver sun slow dived from noon goes
down my soul mounts up she wearies with her endless hill is then
the crown too heavy that i wear this iron crown of lombardy yet is
it bright with many a gem i the wearer see not its far flashings but
darkly feel that i wear that that dazzlingly confounds tis iron that
i know not gold tis split too that i feel the jagged edge galls
me so my brain seems to beat against the solid metal aye steel skull
mine the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight

dry heat upon my brow oh time was when as the sunrise nobly spurred
me so the sunset soothed no more this lovely light it lights not me
all loveliness is anguish to me since i can ne'er enjoy gifted with
the high perception i lack the low enjoying power damned most subtly
and most malignantly damned in the midst of paradise good night good
night waving his hand he moves from the window

twas not so hard a task i thought to find one stubborn at the least
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels and they
revolve or if you will like so many ant-hills of powder they all
stand before me and i their match oh hard that to fire others the
match itself must needs be wasting what i've dared i've willed and
what i've willed i'll do they think me mad starbuck does but i'm
demoniac i am madness maddened that wild madness that's only calm
to comprehend itself the prophecy was that i should be dismembered
and aye i lost this leg i now prophesy that i will dismember my
dismemberer now then be the prophet and the fulfiller one that's
more than ye ye great gods ever were i laugh and hoot at ye ye
cricket-players ye pugilists ye deaf burkes and blinded bendigoes
i will not say as schoolboys do to bullies take some one of your own
size don't pommel me no ye've knocked me down and i am up again but
ye have run and hidden come forth from behind your cotton bags i have
no long gun to reach ye come ahab's compliments to ye come and see
if ye can swerve me swerve me ye cannot swerve me else ye swerve
yourselves man has ye there swerve me the path to my fixed purpose is
laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run over unsounded
gorges through the rifled hearts of mountains under torrents beds
unerringly i rush naught's an obstacle naught's an angle to the iron
way



chapter dusk


by the mainmast starbuck leaning against it


my soul is more than matched she's overmanned and by a madman
insufferable sting that sanity should ground arms on such a field but
he drilled deep down and blasted all my reason out of me i think i see
his impious end but feel that i must help him to it will i nill i
the ineffable thing has tied me to him tows me with a cable i have no
knife to cut horrible old man who's over him he cries aye he would
be a democrat to all above look how he lords it over all below oh i
plainly see my miserable office to obey rebelling and worse yet
to hate with touch of pity for in his eyes i read some lurid woe would
shrivel me up had i it yet is there hope time and tide flow wide
the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in as the small
gold-fish has its glassy globe his heaven-insulting purpose god may
wedge aside i would up heart were it not like lead but my whole
clock's run down my heart the all-controlling weight i have no key to
lift again


a burst of revelry from the forecastle


oh god to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
mothers in them whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea the white whale
is their demigorgon hark the infernal orgies that revelry is forward
mark the unfaltering silence aft methinks it pictures life foremost
through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering
bow but only to drag dark ahab after it where he broods within his
sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further
on hunted by its wolfish gurglings the long howl thrills me through
peace ye revellers and set the watch oh life tis in an hour like
this with soul beat down and held to knowledge as wild untutored
things are forced to feed oh life tis now that i do feel the latent
horror in thee but tis not me that horror's out of me and with the
soft feeling of the human in me yet will i try to fight ye ye grim
phantom futures stand by me hold me bind me o ye blessed influences



chapter first night watch

stubb solus and mending a brace


ha ha ha ha hem clear my throat i've been thinking over it
ever since and that ha ha's the final consequence why so because a
laugh's the wisest easiest answer to all that's queer and come what
will one comfort's always left that unfailing comfort is it's all
predestinated i heard not all his talk with starbuck but to my poor

a frigate's pennant and so am i fa la lirra skirra oh 

we'll drink to-night with hearts as light to love as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim and break on the lips while
meeting

my superior he has his too if i'm not mistaken aye aye sir just
through with this job coming

chapter moby dick


i ishmael was one of that crew my shouts had gone up with the rest
my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and more
did i hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a
wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahab's quenchless feud
seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous
monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of
violence and revenge

for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied
secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of his
existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him
while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to
him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whale-cruisers
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery
circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along
solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a stretch to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort
the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the
times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct
and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide
whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby
dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have
encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian
a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after
doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to
some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in
question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the
sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster
attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave
battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were
content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to
the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual
cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and
the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded

and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance
caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other
whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue in these
assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or
devouring amputations but fatal to the last degree of fatality those
repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors
upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many
brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come

nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more
horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible events as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in
maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound
wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the
sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses
every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen
as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most
directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing
in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but
hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that
though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you
would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too
such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all
tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth

no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did
in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints
and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which
eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally
strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white
whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
jaw

but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work
not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm
whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are
those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would
perhaps either from professional inexperience or incompetency or
timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are
plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing
under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm
whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to
the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their
hatches these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest
and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the
pre-eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more
feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him

and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former
legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book
naturalists olassen and povelson declaring the sperm whale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so
incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor
even down to so late a time as cuvier's were these or almost similar
impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself
affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are
struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of
their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to
cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the
fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness
even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in
them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of
the hunters

so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of
the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days
of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would
be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted

nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the
specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious
accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered

one of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked
with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined
was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time

nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets
of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to
the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm whale
when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his
pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and
contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the
mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports
himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points

it is a thing well known to both american and english whale-ships and
as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby
that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whose
bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland
seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been
believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem
to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real
living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of
the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said
to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near
syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land
by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully
equalled by the realities of the whalemen

forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing
that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped
alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should
go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only
ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that
though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still
swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick
blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in
unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would
once more be seen

but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much his
uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales
but as was elsewhere thrown out a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent
features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he
revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him

the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with
the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive
appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by
his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden
gleamings

nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his
deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror
as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific
accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than
all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every
apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn
round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to
splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship

already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar
disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual
in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whale's
infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death
that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
unintelligent agent

judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed
boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the
white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene exasperating
sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal

his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies one captain seizing the line-knife from his broken prow had
dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking
with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale
that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his
sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahab's
leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no
hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice
small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal
encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale
all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came
to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his
intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before
him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which
some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with
half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been
from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe
one-half of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced
in their statue devil ahab did not fall down and worship it like them
but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he
pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and
torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice
in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle
demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly
personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon
the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt
by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a
mortar he burst his hot heart's shell upon it

it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the
monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate
corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he
probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more
yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long
months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one
hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape
then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another
and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward
voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems
all but certain from the fact that at intervals during the passage
he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital
strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover intensified
by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even
there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait-jacket he swung
to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable
latitudes the ship with mild stun'sails spread floated across the
tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old man's delirium seemed
left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his
dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that
firm collected front however pale and issued his calm orders once
again and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone even
then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a
cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but
become transfigured into some still subtler form ahab's full lunacy
subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson
when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the
highland gorge but as in his narrow-flowing monomania not one jot of
ahab's broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not
one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living
agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may
stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it
and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far
from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon
any one reasonable object

this is much yet ahab's larger darker deeper part remains unhinted
but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding
far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where
we here stand however grand and wonderful now quit it and take your
way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes
where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth his root
of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique
buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so with a broken
throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid he
patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud
sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled
royalties and from your grim sire only will the old state-secret come

now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means
are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or
change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling
was only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate
nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the
terrible casualty which had overtaken him

the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which
always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the
present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on
account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he
was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and
scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes
or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only
and all-engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his
old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him
then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the
ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruises the
profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint he was intent on an
audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge

here then was this grey-headed ungodly old man chasing with curses a
job's whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibals morally enfeebled
also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered
seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded
to the old man's ire by what evil magic their souls were possessed
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale as much
their insufferable foe as his how all this came to be what the white
whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in
some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon
of the seas of life all this to explain would be to dive deeper than
ishmael can go the subterranean miner that works in us all how can one
tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his
pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow
of a seventy-four can stand still for one i gave myself up to the
abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a-rush to
encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest
ill



chapter the whiteness of the whale


what the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times he
was to me as yet remains unsaid

aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm there
was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of
putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale
that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself
here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all
these chapters might be naught

though in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as
if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas
and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a
certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old
kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants above all
their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings
of siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard
and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger
and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlording rome
having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this
pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white
man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all
this whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among
the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal
sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many
touching noble things the innocence of brides the benignity of age
though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt
of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour though in many climes
whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge
and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milk-white steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being
held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove
himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull and though to the
noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was
by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful
creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit
with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from
the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of
one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the
cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white is
specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though
in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and
the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all
these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honourable
and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea
of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness
which affrights in blood

this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when
divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object
terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds
witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics
what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent
horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an
abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb
gloating of their aspect so that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his
heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or
shark


with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not
the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness
it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us
with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true
yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified
terror

as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the
same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish
mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence
requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now
in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and
the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him requin


bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but god's great
unflattering laureate nature


i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged
gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch
below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the
main hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and
with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth
its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous
flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered
cries as some king's ghost in supernatural distress through its
inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took
hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white
thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled
waters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only
hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and
turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney
never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i
learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross so that by no
possibility could coleridge's wild rhyme have had aught to do with those
mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our
deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be
an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little
brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet

i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this
that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses
and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when i
beheld the antarctic fowl

but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will
tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea
at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern
tally round its neck with the ship's time and place and then letting
it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was
taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding
the invoking and adoring cherubim


most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of
the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk-white charger
large-eyed small-headed bluff-chested and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the
elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his
mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him a
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western
world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god
bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid
his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his
circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the white
steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his
cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the
bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor
can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble
horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him
with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though
commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror

but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and
albatross

what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it
is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name
he bears the albino is as well made as other men has no substantive
deformity and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so

nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least palpable but
not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces
this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the
gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white
squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their
faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the
market-place

nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it
cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering
there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and
from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud
in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail to
throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a
milk-white fog yea while these terrors seize us let us add that even
the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his
pallid horse

therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul

but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to
account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then
by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful
but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however
modified can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seek

let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and
though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about
to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to
recall them now

why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention
of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless
processions of slow-pacing pilgrims down-cast and hooded with
new-fallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the
middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or
a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul

or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white
tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
an untravelled american than those other storied structures its
neighbors the byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer
towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods
comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
that name while the thought of virginia's blue ridge is full of a soft
dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and
longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness
over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal
thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by
the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly
unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading
the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man of the
hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the
green of the groves why is this phantom more terrible than all the
whooping imps of the blocksburg

nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide
field of leaning spires wrenched cope-stones and crosses all adroop
like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of
house-walls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cards it
is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest
saddest city thou can'st see for lima has taken the white veil and
there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro
this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful
greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions

i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught
of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost
solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under
any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean
by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the
following examples

first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by
night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just
enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely
similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his
ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as if from
encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round
him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom
of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the
lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm they both go
down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is
the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much the fear of
striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
stirred me

second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the
snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be
to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the
backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views an
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the
scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick
of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half
shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery
views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
ice monuments and splintered crosses

but thou sayest methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but
a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo
ishmael

tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of
vermont far removed from all beasts of prey why is it that upon the
sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that
he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskiness why
will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he
smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black
bisons of distant oregon

no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from
oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison
herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which
this instant they may be trampling into dust

thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt

though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere
those things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright

but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange
and far more portentous why as we have seen it is at once the
most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the
christian's deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in
things the most appalling to mankind

is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the
thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky
way or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all
colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness
full of meaning in a wide landscape of snows a colourless all-colour
of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory
of the natural philosophers that all other earthly hues every stately
or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea
and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of
young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent
in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature
absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but
the charnel-house within and when we proceed further and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great
principle of light for ever remains white or colourless in itself and
if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even
tulips and roses with its own blank tinge pondering all this the
palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in
lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their
eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental
white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him and of all these
things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery
hunt



chapter hark


hist did you hear that noise cabaco

it was the middle-watch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a
cordon extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist to the
scuttle-butt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets
to fill the scuttle-butt standing for the most part on the hallowed
precincts of the quarter-deck they were careful not to speak or rustle
their feet from hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence
only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the
unceasingly advancing keel

it was in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose
post was near the after-hatches whispered to his neighbor a cholo the
words above

hist did you hear that noise cabaco

take the bucket will ye archy what noise d'ye mean

there it is again under the hatches don't you hear it a cough it
sounded like a cough

cough be damned pass along that return bucket

there again there it is it sounds like two or three sleepers turning
over now

caramba have done shipmate will ye it's the three soaked biscuits
ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye nothing else look to the
bucket

say what ye will shipmate i've sharp ears

aye you are the chap ain't ye that heard the hum of the old
quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket you're
the chap

grin away we'll see what turns up hark ye cabaco there is somebody
down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck and i suspect
our old mogul knows something of it too i heard stubb tell flask one
morning watch that there was something of that sort in the wind

tish the bucket



chapter the chart


had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom
and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread
them before him on his screwed-down table then seating himself before
it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and
shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace
additional courses over spaces that before were blank at intervals he
would refer to piles of old log-books beside him wherein were set down
the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various
ships sperm whales had been captured or seen

while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw
shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it
almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses
on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead

but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his
cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were
brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and
others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before
him ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to
the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul

now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it
seem to ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby
calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food and also calling
to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to
certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground
in search of his prey

so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
sperm whale's resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that
could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the
logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated
then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows
on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
charts of the sperm whale

 since the above was written the statement is happily borne
 out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of
 the national observatory washington april th by
 that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in
 course of completion and portions of it are presented in
 the circular this chart divides the ocean into districts
 of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude
 perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
 columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each
 of which districts are three lines one to show the number
 of days that have been spent in each month in every
 district and the two others to show the number of days in
 which whales sperm or right have been seen

besides when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another the
sperm whales guided by some infallible instinct say rather secret
intelligence from the deity mostly swim in veins as they are called
continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with
one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the
direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel
and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these
times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width
more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but
never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads
when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at
particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating
whales may with great confidence be looked for

and hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate
feeding-grounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing
the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his
art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly
without prospect of a meeting

there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality
perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the
herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year
say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found
there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable
instances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the
same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries
and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby
dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the
seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese
coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of
those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly
encounter him there so too with some other feeding grounds where
he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual
stopping-places and ocean-inns so to speak not his places of prolonged
abode and where ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have
hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever
way-side antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular
set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become
probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every possibility the next
thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined
in the one technical phrase the season-on-the-line for there and then
for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried
lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round
loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there
it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had
taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was
that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive
to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those
hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest

now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the
season-on-the-line no possible endeavor then could enable her commander
to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running
down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time
to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season
yet the premature hour of the pequod's sailing had perhaps been
correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of
things because an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days
and nights was before him an interval which instead of impatiently
enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance
the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his
periodical feeding-grounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the
persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other
waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas nor-westers
harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon might
blow moby dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the pequod's
circumnavigating wake

but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not
but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary
whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual
recognition from his hunter even as a white-bearded mufti in the
thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar
snow-white brow of moby dick and his snow-white hump could not but
be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter
to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
would throw himself back in reveries tallied him and shall he escape
his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear and
here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness
and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the
deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trances
of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved
revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own
bloody nails in his palms

often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through
the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them
round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing
of his life-spot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes
the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its
base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and
lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among
them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be
heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his
state room as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these
perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent
weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens
of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had
gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from
it in horror again the latter was the eternal living principle or
soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the
characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer
vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching
contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no
longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
the soul therefore it must have been that in ahab's case yielding up
all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose
by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and
devils into a kind of self-assumed independent being of its own nay
could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was
conjoined fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth
therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when
what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated
thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be
sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in
itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature
in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a
vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature
he creates



chapter the affidavit


so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as
indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars
in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier
part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the
leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly
enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to
take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire
subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main
points of this affair

i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall
be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these
citations i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of
itself

first i have personally known three instances where a whale after
receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an
interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by
the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same
private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where
three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and i
think it may have been something more than that the man who darted
them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far
into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years
often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas
with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have
been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe
brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose
this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the
other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that
is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack
saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards
taken from the dead fish in the three-year instance it so fell out
that i was in the boat both times first and last and the last time
distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's
eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years
but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances
then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many
other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
good ground to impeach

secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable
historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became
thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his
peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly
valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences
of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that
most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some
poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they
make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they
pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for
their presumption

but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
celebrity nay you may call it an ocean-wide renown not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death
but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of
a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar was it not so
o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long
did'st lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft
seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack
thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of
the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty
jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross
against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked
like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain
prose here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean
history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar

but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various
times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were
finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with
that express object as much in view as in setting out through the
narragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture
that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the
indian king philip

i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make
mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for
this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without
some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the
fishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still
worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory

first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid
conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur
one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home
however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose
that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the
whale-line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the
bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose that that
poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
to-morrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very irregular
between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be
called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you
that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many
others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a
death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each
lost a boat's crew for god's sake be economical with your lamps and
candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of man's blood was
spilled for it

secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when
narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness
they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i
declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses
when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt

but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm
whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously
malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and
sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done it

first in the year the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket
was cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her
boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of
the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping
from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the
ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in
less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a surviving
plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of
the crew reached the land in their boats being returned home at last
captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another
ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and
breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith
forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain
pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was
chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his
plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all
this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe


the following are extracts from chace's narrative every fact seemed
to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
directed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at
a short interval between them both of which according to their
direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made
ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock
to effect which the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary his
aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury he
came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in
which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge
for their sufferings again at all events the whole circumstances
taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the
time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the
part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot now recall
induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion

here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during
a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed
upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought the
dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale
wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance

in another place p he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack
of the animal


secondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year 
totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic
particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter
though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions
to it

thirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j - then
commanding an american sloop-of-war of the first class happened to be
dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in
the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales
the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily
denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there
is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this
impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a
portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business
with him that business consisted in fetching the commodore's craft such
a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest
port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider
the commodore's interview with that whale as providential was not saul
of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the
sperm whale will stand no nonsense

i will now refer you to langsdorff's voyages for a little circumstance
in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you
must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern's
famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century
captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter

by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day
we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was very
clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not
till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an
uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself
lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any
one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail
was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking
against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this
gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at
least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether
while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding
that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster
sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain d'wolf
applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel
had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily
it had escaped entirely uninjured

now the captain d'wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual
adventures as a sea-captain this day resides in the village of
dorchester near boston i have the honour of being a nephew of his i
have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff
he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large
one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my
uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home

in that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure so full too
of honest wonders the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier's
old chums i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted
from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a
corroborative example if such be needed

lionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls
the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four
o'clock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues
from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our
men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were
or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed
the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the
ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little
over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the
suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and
several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who
lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin lionel then
goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate
the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about
that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but
i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the
morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically
bumping the hull from beneath

i might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to
me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more
than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing
boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long
withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship
pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength
let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and
secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a
horse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if
the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts
not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of
destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent
indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently
open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several
consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a
concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which
you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in
this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these
marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for
the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there is nothing new
under the sun

in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate
of constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius
general as many know he wrote the history of his own times a work
every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been
considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in
some one or two particulars not at all affecting the matter presently
to be mentioned

now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term
of his prefecture at constantinople a great sea-monster was captured
in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
years a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species
this sea-monster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as
well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly
inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long
time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am
certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the
present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious
resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in
modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that
on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found
the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes
through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route
pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis

in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance
called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have
every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale squid or
cuttle-fish lurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures
but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its
surface if then you properly put these statements together and
reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all
human reasoning procopius's sea-monster that for half a century stove
the ships of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm
whale



chapter surmises


though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick
though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways altogether to
abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if
this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more
influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even
considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed
exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though
not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet
were by no means incapable of swaying him

to accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in
the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew
for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a
sort of corporeal relation starbuck's body and starbuck's coerced will
were ahab's so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck's brain still
he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his
captain's quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from
it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse
ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck
would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
captain's leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial
influences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle
insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly
manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that
the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background for few men's courage is proof against protracted meditation
unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches
his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby
dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the
announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less
capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer weather and
they inhale its fickleness and when retained for any object remote and
blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the
end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and
employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the
final dash

nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent
the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought
ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the
hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even
breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them still while for the
love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food
for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and
chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without
committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious
perquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic object that final and romantic object too many would have
turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all
hopes of cash aye cash they may scorn cash now but let some months
go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same
quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon
cashier ahab

nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
pequod's voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing
he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew
if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further
obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from
even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible
consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must
of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection
could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand
backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected
to

for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be
verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod's
voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force
himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of his profession

be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three
mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out and not omit
reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward



chapter the mat-maker


it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging
about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters
queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat
for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet
somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie
lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
invisible self

i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i
kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between
the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as
queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
between the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and
unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did
there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by
the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were
the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving
and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp
subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and
that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending
of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity and here
thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own
destiny into these unalterable threads meantime queequeg's impulsive
indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly
or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference
in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final
aspect of the completed fabric this savage's sword thought i
which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this
easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and
necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly working together
the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate
course its every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that
free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and
chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of
necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though
thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the
last featuring blow at events


thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so
strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball
of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the clouds
whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the cross-trees was
that mad gay-header tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward
his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he
continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment
perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemen's
look-outs perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could
that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from
tashtego the indian's

as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries
announcing their coming

there she blows there there there she blows she blows

where-away

on the lee-beam about two miles off a school of them

instantly all was commotion

the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and
reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
other tribes of his genus

there go flukes was now the cry from tashtego and the whales
disappeared

quick steward cried ahab time time

dough-boy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact
minute to ahab

the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling
before it tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale
when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while
concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims off in the
opposite quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action
for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had
been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of
the men selected for shipkeepers that is those not appointed to the
boats by this time relieved the indian at the main-mast head the
sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed
in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed
and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over
high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale
so look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on
board an enemy's ship

but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air



chapter the first lowering


the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side
of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the
tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always
been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the
captain's on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the
figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white
tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips a rumpled chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers
of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness was a
glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled
round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of
this figure were of that vivid tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to
some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas a race notorious for
a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners
supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the
water of the devil their lord whose counting-room they suppose to be
elsewhere

while yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers
ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head all ready
there fedallah

ready was the half-hissed reply

lower away then d'ye hear shouting across the deck lower away
there i say

such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men
sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a
wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous
off-handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors
goat-like leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats
below

hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee when a fourth
keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and
showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern
loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely
so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again
riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other
boats obeyed not the command

captain ahab said starbuck

spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boats thou flask
pull out more to leeward

aye aye sir cheerily cried little king-post sweeping round
his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew
there there there again there she blows right ahead boys lay
back

never heed yonder yellow boys archy

oh i don't mind'em sir said archy i knew it all before now
didn't i hear em in the hold and didn't i tell cabaco here of it what
say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask

pull pull my fine hearts-alive pull my children pull my little
ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom
still showed signs of uneasiness why don't you break your backbones
my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they
are only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the
more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devils
are good fellows enough so so there you are now that's the stroke
for a thousand pounds that's the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah
for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers men all hearts
alive easy easy don't be in a hurry don't be in a hurry why don't
you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so
then softly softly that's it that's it long and strong give way
there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are
all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull
can't ye pull won't ye why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
don't ye pull pull and break something pull and start your eyes out
here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mother's son
of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth that's
it that's it now ye do something that looks like it my steel-bits
start her start her my silver-spoons start her marling-spikes

stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in
inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this
specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief
peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a
tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so
calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such
queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for
the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and
indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering-oar and so broadly
gaped open-mouthed at times that the mere sight of such a yawning
commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew
then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity
is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their
guard in the matter of obeying them

in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck was now pulling obliquely
across stubb's bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate

mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye
please

halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch as he
spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set
like a flint from stubb's

what think ye of those yellow boys sir

smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong
boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad
business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind
mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what
will spring my men spring there's hogsheads of sperm ahead mr
stubb and that's what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperm's the
play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand

aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats
diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and that's
what he went into the after hold for so often as dough-boy long
suspected they were hidden down there the white whale's at the bottom
of it well well so be it can't be helped all right give way men
it ain't the white whale to-day give way

now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably
awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's
company but archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got
abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some
small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge
of their wonder and so what with all this and stubb's confident way
of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from
superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for
all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab's precise agency in the
matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious
shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket
dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah

meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the
furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger
yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five
trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which
periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen
pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and
displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a
fencer's thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any
tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in
a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once
the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed
while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat and
crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the
rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily
down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it

every man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg
stand up

nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage
stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme
stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently
eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea

not very far distant flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still its
commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout
sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the
level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the
whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand
and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the
mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little
king-post was small and short and at the same time little king-post was
full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand-point
of his did by no means satisfy king-post

i can't see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to
that

upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
shoulders for a pedestal

good a mast-head as any sir will you mount

that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you
fifty feet taller

whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to
flask's foot and then putting flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head
and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous
fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was
flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
breastband to lean against and steady himself by

at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously
perverse and cross-running seas still more strange to see him giddily
perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the
sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious
for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of
barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously
rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen-haired flask seemed
a snow-flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly
vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then
stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to
the negro's lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the
living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her
seasons for that

meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far-gazing
solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings
not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case
stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the
languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband
where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed
home the loading with his thumb-end but hardly had he ignited his match
across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer
whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly
dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a
quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give way there they are

to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been
visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it and
suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white
rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it
were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this
atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of
water also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other
indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemed their forerunning
couriers and detached flying outriders

all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills

pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance
from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two
visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much
to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the
silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty

how different the loud little king-post sing out and say something
my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their
black backs boys only do that for me and i'll sign over to you my
martha's vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys
lay me on lay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad
see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his
head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far
off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's
stern like a crazed colt from the prairie

look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his
unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a
short distance followed after he's got fits that flask has fits
yes give him fits that's the very word pitch fits into em merrily
merrily hearts-alive pudding for supper you know merry's the word
pull babes pull sucklings pull all but what the devil are you
hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and
keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your
knives in two that's all take it easy why don't ye take it easy i
say and burst all your livers and lungs

but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
his these were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed
light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious
seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of
red murder and foam-glued lips ahab leaped after his prey

meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specific allusions of
flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which
he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its
tail these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like that
they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen
must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage
pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but
arms in these critical moments

it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swells of the
omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along
the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green
the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on
the knife-like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening
to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and
hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite
hill the headlong sled-like slide down its other side all these
with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps
of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing
down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her
screaming brood all this was thrilling

not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
heat of his first battle not the dead man's ghost encountering the
first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel
stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first
time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the
hunted sperm whale

the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows
flung upon the sea the jets of vapour no longer blended but tilted
everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes
the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales
running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still
rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through
the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
escape being torn from the row-locks

soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship
nor boat to be seen

give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet
of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes
there's white water again close to spring

soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when
with a lightning-like hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and
queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet

though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent
instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of
fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still
booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like
the erected crests of enraged serpents

that's his hump there there give it to him whispered starbuck

a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of
queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail
collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by
something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole
crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the
white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all
blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped

though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round
it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale
tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the
water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes
the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom
of the ocean

the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together
the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white
fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal
in these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar
to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew
darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen
the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were
useless as propellers performing now the office of life-preservers
so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures
starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching
it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standard-bearer of this
forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in
the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign
and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the
midst of despair

wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat
we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over
the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat
suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear
we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by
the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly
parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea as
the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a
distance of not much more than its length

floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it
tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a
cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no
more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed
against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on
board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from
their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us
up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of
our perishing an oar or a lance pole



chapter the hyena


there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than
suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own however
nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts
down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard
things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of
potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints and as for small
difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of
life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly
good-natured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking
of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes
in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might
have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the
general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this
free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now
regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its
object

queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck
and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water
queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen
without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to
understand that such things did often happen

mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his
oil-jacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i
think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief
mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose
then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion

certain i've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape
horn

mr flask said i turning to little king-post who was standing close
by you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell
me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an
oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death's
jaws

can't you twist that smaller said flask yes that's the law
i should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face
foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind
that

here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement
of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings
in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters
of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the
superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my
life into the hands of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellow who
at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling
the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the
particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed
to starbuck's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall
and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his
great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this
uncommonly prudent starbuck's boat and finally considering in what a
devil's chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all
things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a
rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my
lawyer executor and legatee

it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more
fond of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life
that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon
the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away
from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good
as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary
clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be i survived
myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked
round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean
conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault

now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock
here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the
devil fetch the hindmost



chapter ahab's boat and crew fedallah


who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg
you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
with my timber toe oh he's a wonderful old man

i don't think it so strange after all on that account said flask
if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing
that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other
left you know

i don't know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel


among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is
right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils
of the chase so tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their
eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the
thickest of the fight

but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then
comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any
maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt as a general thing the
joint-owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not

ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt above all for
captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boat's
crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boat's
crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head
nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all
that matter until cabaco's published discovery the sailors had little
foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out
of port all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then
found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his
own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even
solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was
observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety
he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is
sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the
knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed
how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
semi-circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter's chisel
gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these
things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but
almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness
in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick
for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster
in person but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest
suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that boat

now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned
away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck
oars whaleboats canoes blown-off japanese junks and what not that
beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable
excitement in the forecastle

but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were
somehow distinct from them yet that hair-turbaned fedallah remained
a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like
this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
linked with ahab's peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort
of a half-hinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even
authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain
an indifferent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as
civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide
among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles
to the east of the continent those insulated immemorial unalterable
countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal generations when the memory of
the first man was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants
unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of
the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though
according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of
men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane
amours



chapter the spirit-spout


days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds that off the azores off the
cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the
rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality
southerly from st helena

it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver
and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery
silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it
looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight
nights it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head and stand a
look-out there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet
though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred
would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions
then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual
hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after
spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights
without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his
unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moon-lit jet every
reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had
lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blows
had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet
still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most
unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously
exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
lowering

walking the deck with quick side-lunging strides ahab commanded the
t'gallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the
best man in the ship must take the helm then with every mast-head
manned the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind the strange
upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic
influences were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven the
other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched
ahab's face that night you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warring while his one live leg made lively echoes
along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap
on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly
sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot
yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore he
saw it once but not a second time

this midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days
after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it
was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it
disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after
night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously
jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be
disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow
seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and
further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on

nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance
with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested
the pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however
far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast
by one self-same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there
reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition
as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the
monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest
and most savage seas

these temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous
potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath
all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as
for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely
mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed
vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow

but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling
around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are
there when the ivory-tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and
gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips
the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity
of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before

close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens and
every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and
spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp
as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing
appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting-place for their
homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the
black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane
soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had
bred

cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoto as called
of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea
where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed
condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat
that black air without any horizon but calm snow-white and unvarying
still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us
on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried

during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the
time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck
manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed
his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and
aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await
the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists
so with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one
hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would stand
gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow
would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew
driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that
burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in
the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man
had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which
he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the
silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore
on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves
by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the
ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still
wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed
demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never
could starbuck forget the old man's aspect when one night going down
into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with
closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair the rain
and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the
table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly
clenched hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so
that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale
that swung from a beam in the ceiling


the cabin-compass is called the tell-tale because without going to the
compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the
course of the ship


terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this
gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose



chapter the albatross


south-eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising
ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross
by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the
fore-mast-head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea and long absent from home

as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her
spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
with hoar-frost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to
see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads they seemed
clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had
survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to
the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when
the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air
came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the
mast-heads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlorn-looking
fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own
look-outs while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below

ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale

but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the
act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand
into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make
himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the
distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod
were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first
mere mention of the white whale's name to another ship ahab for a
moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat
to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking
advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and
knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and
shortly bound home he loudly hailed ahoy there this is the pequod
bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the
pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them
to address them to 

at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then
in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish
that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted
away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and
aft with the stranger's flanks though in the course of his continual
voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to
any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings

swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water
there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep
helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but
turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the
wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voice up
helm keep her off round the world

round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings
but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through
numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that
we left behind secure were all the time before us

were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange
than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise
in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in
tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims
before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they
either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed



chapter the gam


the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had
this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded
her judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if so it
had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative
answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he
cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain
except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly
sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not
something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when
meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common
cruising-ground

if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the
equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering
each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of
them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment
to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while
and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the
illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling
vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth off lone
fanning's island or the far away king's mills how much more natural
i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only
interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and
sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of
course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains
officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other
and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about

for the long absent ship the outward-bounder perhaps has letters on
board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn
files and in return for that courtesy the outward-bound ship would
receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to
which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and
in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing
each other's track on the cruising-ground itself even though they
are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a
transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and
some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets
besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable
chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors
but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common
pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils

nor would difference of country make any very essential difference
that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case
with americans and english though to be sure from the small number of
english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they
do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your
englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not fancy that
sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers
sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american
whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript
provincialisms as a sort of sea-peasant but where this superiority
in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say
seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than
all the english collectively in ten years but this is a harmless
little foible in the english whale-hunters which the nantucketer does
not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few
foibles himself

so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the
whalers have most reason to be sociable and they are so whereas some
merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-atlantic will
oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition
mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in
broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon
each other's rig as for men-of-war when they chance to meet at sea
they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such
a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much right-down
hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all as touching
slave-ships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run
away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they
chance to cross each other's cross-bones the first hail is how many
skulls the same way that whalers hail how many barrels and that
question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are
infernal villains on both sides and don't like to see overmuch of each
other's villanous likenesses

but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable
free-and-easy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a gam a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and
repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers and such
like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchant-seamen and also
all pirates and man-of-war's men and slave-ship sailors cherish such
a scornful feeling towards whale-ships this is a question it would be
hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to
know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about
it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the
gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has
no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude
that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that
assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on

but what is a gam you might wear out your index-finger running up and
down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson
never attained to that erudition noah webster's ark does not hold it
nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in
constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees certainly
it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with
that view let me learnedly define it

gam noun a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a
cruising-ground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by
boats crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one
ship and the two chief mates on the other

there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten
here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so
has the whale fishery in a pirate man-of-war or slave ship when
the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern
sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often
steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with
gay cords and ribbons but the whale-boat has no seat astern no sofa of
that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling
captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen
in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whale-boat never admits of
any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew
must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of
the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and
the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit
all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being
conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from
the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the
importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is
this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting
steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the
after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus
completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself
sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a
spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again
it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes it would
never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with
his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self-command he
generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being
generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast
nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too
where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or
two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's
hair and hold on there like grim death



chapter the town-ho's story


as told at the golden inn


the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is
much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet
more travellers than in any other part

it was not very long after speaking the goney that another
homeward-bound whaleman the town-ho was encountered she was manned
almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave
us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white
whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town-ho's
story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god
which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance
with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the
secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears
of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was
unknown to the captain of the town-ho himself it was the private
property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it
seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy
but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed
so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well
withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing
have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of
it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in
this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
transpired abaft the pequod's main-mast interweaving in its proper
place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the
ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting
record


the ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin


for my humor's sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated
it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saint's eve
smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those
fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer
terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally
put and which are duly answered at the time

some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about
rehearsing to you gentlemen the town-ho sperm whaler of nantucket
was cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward
from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the
northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to
daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than
common they supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her gentlemen but the
captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck
awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit
them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though
indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down
as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her
cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals
but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet
undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking
some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest
harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired

though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance
favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way
because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at
them those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free
never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the
whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the
town-ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port
without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the
brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly
provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo

lakeman buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo
said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass

on the eastern shore of our lake erie don but i crave your
courtesy may be you shall soon hear further of all that now
gentlemen in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships well-nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far
manilla this lakeman in the land-locked heart of our america had yet
been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate
those grand fresh-water seas of ours erie and ontario and huron and
superior and michigan possess an ocean-like expansiveness with many
of the ocean's noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of
races and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles
even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great
contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime
approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted
all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries
and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the
fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their
beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out
their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient
and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines
of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric
beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes
to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and
cleveland as well as winnebago villages they float alike the
full-rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer
and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as
direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are
for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many
a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though
an inlander steelkilt was wild-ocean born and wild-ocean nurtured
as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his
infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse
at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our
austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as
vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh
from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives yet was this
nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits and this lakeman a
mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible
firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
which is the meanest slave's right thus treated this steelkilt had
long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved
so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkilt but
gentlemen you shall hear

it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing
her prow for her island haven that the town-ho's leak seemed again
increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole
way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of
the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability
would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on
account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the
solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it
altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in
full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie
along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat
is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of
the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her
captain begins to feel a little anxious

much this way had it been with the town-ho so when her leak was found
gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by
several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded
the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way
expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a
coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or
on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when
he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the
seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in
her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on
this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood
with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water
clear as any mountain spring gentlemen that bubbling from the pumps
ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
scupper-holes

now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional
world of ours watery or otherwise that when a person placed in command
over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he
conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a
chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower and
make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may
gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings
of your last viceroy's snorting charger and a brain and a heart and
a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he
been born son to charlemagne's father but radney the mate was ugly
as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love
steelkilt and steelkilt knew it

espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with
his gay banterings

aye aye my merry lads it's a lively leak this hold a cannikin one
of ye and let's have a taste by the lord it's worth bottling i tell
ye what men old rad's investment must go for it he had best cut away
his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that sword-fish
only began the job he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters
saw-fish and file-fish and what not and the whole posse of em
are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making
improvements i suppose if old rad were here now i'd tell him to jump
overboard and scatter em they're playing the devil with his estate i
can tell him but he's a simple old soul rad and a beauty too boys
they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses i
wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose

damn your eyes what's that pump stopping for roared radney
pretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at it

aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys
lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines
the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping
of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's
utmost energies

quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went
forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face
fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his
brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney
to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know
not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate
commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a
shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig
to run at large

now gentlemen sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household
work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of
sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom
would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all
vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys
if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the town-ho
that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being
the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly
assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have
been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical
duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these
particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood
between the two men

but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat
in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully
comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for
a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and
perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match
silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all
this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper
passionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most felt when
felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless
phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt

therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily
exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping
the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without
at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary
sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or
nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most
domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an
uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by

heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for
all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt
could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still
smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained
doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the
hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do
his bidding

steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily
followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his
intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not
the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his
twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to
no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass
when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had
now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on
the hatches and thus spoke to the officer

mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to
yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where
the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions
retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye
with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching
his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his
persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would
murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter
by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant
the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch
spouting blood like a whale

ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
mastheads they were both canallers

canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whale-ships in our
harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are
they

canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you
must have heard of it

nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary
land we know but little of your vigorous north

aye well then don refill my cup your chicha's very fine and
ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such
information may throw side-light upon my story

for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire
breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and
most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and
affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard-room
and bar-room through the holy-of-holies of great forests on roman
arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or
broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk
counties and especially by rows of snow-white chapels whose spires
stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly
corrupt and often lawless life there's your true ashantee gentlemen
there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you
under the long-flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches
for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan
freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so
sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities

is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the
crowded plazza with humorous concern

well for our northern friend dame isabella's inquisition wanes in
lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor

a moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all
us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by
no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima
for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look
surprised you know the proverb all along this coast corrupt as
lima it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than
billiard-tables and for ever open and corrupt as lima so too
venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st
mark st dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you
pour out again

freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make
a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like
mark antony for days and days along his green-turfed flowery nile
he indolently floats openly toying with his red-cheeked cleopatra
ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this
effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly
sports his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features
a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he
floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities
once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of
these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful
but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of
violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger
in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the
wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that
our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates
and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much
distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the
curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and
young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal
furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian
corn-field and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric
seas

i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha
upon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the world's one lima i
had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold
and holy as the hills but the story

i left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly
had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the
four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the
ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and
sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the
sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued
while standing out of harm's way the valiant captain danced up and down
with a whale-pike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter-deck at intervals he ran
close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into
the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his
resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them
all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily
slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass
these sea-parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade

come out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them
with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come
out of that ye cut-throats

steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there
defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to
understand distinctly that his steelkilt's death would be the signal
for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart
lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but
still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty

will you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their
ringleader

turn to turn to i make no promise to your duty do you want to
sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he
once more raised a pistol

sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us
turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us what say
ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response

the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye
on the captain and jerking out such sentences as these it's not our
fault we didn't want it i told him to take his hammer away it was
boy's business he might have known me before this i told him not to
prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his
cursed jaw ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there
men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to
yourself say the word don't be a fool forget it all we are ready
to turn to treat us decently and we're your men but we won't be
flogged

turn to i make no promises turn to i say

look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him
there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped
for the cruise d'ye see now as you well know sir we can claim our
discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we don't want a row it's
not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we
won't be flogged

turn to roared the captain

steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then said i tell you what
it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby
rascal we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till
you say the word about not flogging us we don't do a hand's turn

down into the forecastle then down with ye i'll keep ye there till
ye're sick of it down ye go

shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against
it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down
into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave

as the lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks the captain
and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide
of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called
for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
companionway

then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something
down the crack closed it and turned the key upon them ten in
number leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained
neutral

all night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers forward and
aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which
last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking
through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace
the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps
whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night
dismally resounded through the ship

at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned
the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then
lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the
captain returned to the quarter-deck twice every day for three days
this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and
then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and
suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready
to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united
perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to
surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his
demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to
stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth
morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left

better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer

shut us up again will ye cried steelkilt

oh certainly said the captain and the key clicked

it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven
of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last
hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as
the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two
canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of
their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their
keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle
at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any
devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he
would do this he said whether they joined him or not that was the
last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no
opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for
that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender
and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck
when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as
fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as
his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter
and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one
man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants
must come out

upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece
of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be
the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit
but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to
the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed
their before secret treacheries together and when their leader
fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three
sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords
and shrieked out for the captain at midnight

thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and
all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a
few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
allies who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been
fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along
the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the
mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till
morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them
the vultures would not touch ye ye villains

at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled
from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that
he had a good mind to flog them all round thought upon the whole
he would do so he ought to justice demanded it but for the present
considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a
reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular

but as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the
rigging for you i mean to mince ye up for the try-pots and
seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads
sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn

my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still
rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldn't give up take
that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself

for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort
of hiss what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me i murder
you

say ye so then see how ye frighten me and the captain drew off with
the rope to strike

best not hissed the lakeman

but i must and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke

steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain
who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly
two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i
won't do it let him go cut him down d'ye hear

but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man
with a bandaged head arrested them radney the chief mate ever since
the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult
on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole
scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak
but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the
captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his
pinioned foe

you are a coward hissed the lakeman

so i am but take that the mate was in the very act of striking
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing
no more made good his word spite of steelkilt's threat whatever that
might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned
to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as
before

just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor
was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up
besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew
entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own
instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation still no
sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed
that mainly at steelkilt's instigation they had resolved to maintain
the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the
ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the
speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing namely
not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for
spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the town-ho still
maintained her mast-heads and her captain was just as willing to
lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the
cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale

but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all
was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief
mate's watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than
half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted
against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head
of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances
steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge

during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the quarter-deck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ship's side
in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between
this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next
trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock in the morning of the
third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure
he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his
watches below

what are you making there said a shipmate

what do you think what does it look like

like a lanyard for your bag but it's an odd one seems to me

yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arm's length
before him but i think it will answer shipmate i haven't enough
twine have you any

but there was none in the forecastle

then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft

you don't mean to go a begging to him said a sailor

why not do you think he won't do me a turn when it's to help himself
in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him
quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given
him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night
an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the
lakeman's monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for
a pillow twenty-four hours after his trick at the silent helm nigh
to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to
the seaman's hand that fatal hour was then to come and in the
fore-ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and
stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in

but gentlemen a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the
avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in
to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
done

it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man
drawing water in the main-chains all at once shouted out there she
rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick

moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do
whales have christenings whom call you moby dick

a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but
that would be too long a story

how how cried all the young spaniards crowding

nay dons dons nay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more
into the air sirs

the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend looks
faint fill up his empty glass

no need gentlemen one moment and i proceed now gentlemen
so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the
moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been
plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads all was now a phrensy
the white whale the white whale was the cry from captain mates
and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious
to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed
askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass
that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like
a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality
pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out
before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the
mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while
radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken
the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were
lowered the mate's got the start and none howled more fiercely with
delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff
pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to
the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his
bandaged cry was to beach him on the whale's topmost back nothing
loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that
blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as
against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate
that instant as he fell on the whale's slippery back the boat righted
and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the
sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray
and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to
remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round
in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing
high up with him plunged headlong again and went down

meantime at the first tap of the boat's bottom the lakeman had
slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly
looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific
downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he
cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose
again with some tatters of radney's red woollen shirt caught in the
teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the
whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared

in good time the town-ho reached her port a savage solitary
place where no civilized creature resided there headed by the
lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double
war-canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor

the ship's company being reduced to but a handful the captain called
upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over
their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both
by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent
that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a
weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon
from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the
islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with
him and setting the sail of his best whale-boat steered straight
before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a
reinforcement to his crew

on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed
to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but
the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt
hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain
presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes
the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so
much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam

what do you want of me cried the captain

where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt
no lies

i am bound to tahiti for more men

very good let me board you a moment i come in peace with that he
leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood
face to face with the captain

cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me
as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder
island and remain there six days if i do not may lightning strike
me

a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping
into the sea he swam back to his comrades

watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the
roots of the cocoa-nut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time
arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended
him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially
in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they
embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he
been at all minded to work them legal retribution

some ten days after the french ships sailed the whale-boat arrived
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small
native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all
right there again resumed his cruisings

where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of
nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses
to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed him

are you through said don sebastian quietly

i am don

then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions
this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful
did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to
press

also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don
sebastian's suit cried the company with exceeding interest

is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen

nay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who
will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised
this may grow too serious

will you be so good as to bring the priest also don

though there are no auto-da-fe's in lima now said one of the company
to another i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy
let us withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this

excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg
that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists
you can

this is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian
gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure

let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light
and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it

so help me heaven and on my honour the story i have told ye
gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be
true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have
seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney



chapter of the monstrous pictures of whales


i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas
something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there
it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those
curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the
world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all
wrong

it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for
ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields
medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of
chain-armor like saladin's and a helmeted head like st george's ever
since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not
only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific
presentations of him

now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to
be the whale's is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of elephanta
in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable
avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of
whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale
referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the
incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the
matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so
as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is
all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the
broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes

but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painter's
portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
hindoo it is guido's picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the
sea-monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange
creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his
own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence
of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing
one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its back and its
distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be
taken for the traitors gate leading from the thames by water into the
tower then there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and
jonah's whale as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of
old primers what shall be said of these as for the book-binder's whale
winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor as
stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both
old and new that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature
imitated i take it from the like figures on antique vases
though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this
book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended
when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an old
italian publisher somewhere about the th century during the revival
of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively
late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the
leviathan

in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner
of spouts jets d'eau hot springs and cold saratoga and baden-baden
come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the title-page of the
original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some
curious whales

but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those
pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations
by those who know in old harris's collection of voyages there are some
plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages ad 
entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the
whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates the
whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among ice-isles
with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the
prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
flukes

then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett
a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn
into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale
fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of
a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the
coast of mexico august and hoisted on deck i doubt not the
captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines
to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which
applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm
whale would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet
long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out
of that eye

nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for
the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of
mistake look at that popular work goldsmith's animated nature in the
abridged london edition of there are plates of an alleged whale
and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly
whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one
glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century
such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent
public of schoolboys

then again in bernard germain count de lacepede a great
naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are
several pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these
are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland
whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long
experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its
counterpart in nature

but the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous
baron in he published a natural history of whales in which he
gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that
picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary
retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuvier's sperm whale is not
a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of
a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that
picture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that
is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the pencil
those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us

as for the sign-painters whales seen in the streets hanging over the
shops of oil-dealers what shall be said of them they are generally
richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting
on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners
their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint

but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings have
been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a
drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent
the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars
though elephants have stood for their full-lengths the living leviathan
has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale
in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in
unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight
like a launched line-of-battle ship and out of that element it is a
thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the
air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not
to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young
sucking whale and a full-grown platonian leviathan yet even in the
case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck such
is then the outlandish eel-like limbered varying shape of him that
his precise expression the devil himself could not catch

but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all
for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that
his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy
bentham's skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of
his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian
old gentleman with all jeremy's other leading personal characteristics
yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's
articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the mere skeleton
of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded
animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes
it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some
part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously
displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to
the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin has four
regular bone-fingers the index middle ring and little finger but
all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human
fingers in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly
said to handle us without mittens

for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs
conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world
which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit
the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding
out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in
which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is
by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had
best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan



chapter of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true
pictures of whaling scenes


in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of
them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern
especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass
that matter by

i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale
colnett's huggins's frederick cuvier's and beale's in the previous
chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to huggins's is far
better than theirs but by great odds beale's is the best all beale's
drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the
picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second
chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is
admirably correct and life-like in its general effect some of the sperm
whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they
are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though

of the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they
are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has
but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because
it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive
anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
hunters

but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details
not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed
and taken from paintings by one garnery respectively they represent
attacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble
sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of
the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon
the monster's spine and standing in that prow for that one single
incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if
from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
true the half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not
draw so good a one

in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls his black
weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the patagonian
cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so
abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave
supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the
small crabs shell-fish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the
right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back and all the while
the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of
tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean
steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in
admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the
drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of
a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily
hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole

who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously
tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lads for
painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and
where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion
on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder
fights his way pell-mell through the consecutive great battles of
france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the
successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned
centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea
battle-pieces of garnery

the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of england's
experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the
americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of
the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale
draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline
of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as
picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching
the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right
whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale
and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats
us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives
and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck
submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of
magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent
voyager i honour him for a veteran but in so important a matter it
was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace

in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two other
french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself
h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present
purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet
noon-scene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored
inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails
of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both
drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when
considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under
one of their few aspects of oriental repose the other engraving is
quite a different affair the ship hove-to upon the open sea and in the
very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the
vessel in the act of cutting-in hove over to the monster as if to a
quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is
about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and lances
lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands
half-erect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the
smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up
with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the
excited seamen



chapter of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet-iron in
stone in mountains in stars


on tower-hill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a
crippled beggar or kedger as the sailors say holding a painted board
before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg
there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed
to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being
crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years
they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that
stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has
now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in
wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you
will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on
that stump never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make but with
downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation

throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and
sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and
whaling-scenes graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale-teeth
or ladies busks wrought out of the right whale-bone and other
like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little
ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material
in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes
of dentistical-looking implements specially intended for the
skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their
jack-knives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor
they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner's
fancy

long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
to that condition in which god placed him ie what is called savagery
your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a
savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready
at any moment to rebel against him

now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian
war-club or spear-paddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon
for with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth that
miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved and it has
cost steady years of steady application

as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor-savage with the
same marvellous patience and with the same single shark's tooth of
his one poor jack-knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not
quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design
as the greek savage achilles's shield and full of barbaric spirit
and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old dutch savage albert
durer

wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
the noble south sea war-wood are frequently met with in the forecastles
of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy

at some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
by the tail for knockers to the road-side door when the porter is
sleepy the anvil-headed whale would be best but these knocking
whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some
old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
weather-cocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all
intents and purposes so labelled with hands off you cannot examine
them closely enough to decide upon their merit

in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the
plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against
them in a surf of green surges

then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky
point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of
whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough
whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish
to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact
intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point else
so chance-like are such observations of the hills that your precise
previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery like the
soloma islands which still remain incognita though once high-ruffed
mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them

nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out
great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as
when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies
locked in battle among the clouds thus at the north have i chased
leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright
points that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic
skies i have boarded the argo-navis and joined the chase against the
starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying
fish

with a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to
see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie
encamped beyond my mortal sight



chapter brit


steering north-eastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows
of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale
largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we
seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat

on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from
the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly
swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that
wondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated
from the water that escaped at the lip

as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these
monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving
behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea


that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does
not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there
being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable
meadow-like appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
floating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased


but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
reminded one of mowers seen from the mast-heads especially when they
paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked
more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the
great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even
so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the
leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense
magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses
of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort
of life that lives in a dog or a horse

indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the
deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though
some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of
the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for
example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any
generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him

but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the
seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita
so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific
of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters
though but a moment's consideration will teach that however baby man
may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering
future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever
to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize
the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the
continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense
of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it

the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow
that same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
of last year yea foolish mortals noah's flood is not yet subsided
two thirds of the fair world it yet covers

wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a
miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews
when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened
and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in
precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews

but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it
is also a fiend to its own off-spring worse than the persian host who
murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath
spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks
and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships no
mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad
battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the
globe

consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide
under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden
beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish
brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the
dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once more
the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each
other carrying on eternal war since the world began

consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile
earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a
strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling ocean
surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular
tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the
half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst
never return


chapter squid


slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on her
way north-eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling
her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a
plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely
alluring jet would be seen

but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural
spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when
the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered
together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible
sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main-mast-head

in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and
higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before
our prow like a snow-slide new slid from the hills thus glistening
for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose
and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick
thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on re-appearing once
more with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod the
negro yelled out there there again there she breaches right ahead
the white whale the white whale

upon this the seamen rushed to the yard-arms as in swarming-time the
bees rush to the boughs bare-headed in the sultry sun ahab stood on
the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo

whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the
ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed
him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
orders for lowering

the four boats were soon on the water ahab's in advance and all
swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with
oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same
spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for
the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind
a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing
cream-colour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating
from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as
if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible
face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or
instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless
chance-like apparition of life

as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still
gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice
exclaimed almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to
have seen thee thou white ghost

what was it sir said flask

the great live squid which they say few whale-ships ever beheld and
returned to their ports to tell of it

but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel
the rest as silently following

whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being
so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them
declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few
of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale
his only food for though other species of whales find their food above
water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti
whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and
only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that
food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what
are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus
exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that
the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to
the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is
supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it

there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop
pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in
which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with
some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond
but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
assigns it

by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttle-fish
to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong
but only as the anak of the tribe



chapter the line


with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as
for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented
i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale-line

the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly
vapoured with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary
ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to
the rope-maker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity
too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must
be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general
by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength however much it
may give it compactness and gloss

of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost
entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines for though not
so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and
i will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more
handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark
fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a golden-haired circassian
to behold

the whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness at first
sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons in length the common sperm whale-line measures something
over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally
coiled away in the tub not like the worm-pipe of a still though but so
as to form one round cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or
layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart
or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least
tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take
somebody's arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used
in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an
entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then
reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act
of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists

in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in this
because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the
boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly
three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky
freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness for
the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice which will bear up
a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated
one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub
the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great
wedding-cake to present to the whales

both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an
eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything
this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first
in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as
to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug
of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the
first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second this
arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake for were the
lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking
minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
the sea and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again

before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again
carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon
the loom or handle of every man's oar so that it jogs against his wrist
in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at
the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme
pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a
common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs
in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat
again and some ten or twenty fathoms called box-line being coiled
upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a
little further aft and is then attached to the short-warp the rope
which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that
connexion the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious
to detail

thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils
twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the
oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid
eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest
snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal
woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies
and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible
contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habit strange thing what
cannot habit accomplish gayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes
and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you
will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat when thus
hung in hangman's nooses and like the six burghers of calais before
king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death
with a halter around every neck as you may say

perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
those repeated whaling disasters some few of which are casually
chronicled of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the
line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in
the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings
of a steam-engine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and
wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the
heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and
you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning
and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of
volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run
away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out

again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself
for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and
contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the
line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
into actual play this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men
live enveloped in whale-lines all are born with halters round their
necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death
that mortals realize the silent subtle ever-present perils of life
and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whale-boat you would
not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before
your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side



chapter stubb kills a whale


if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents to
queequeg it was quite a different object

when you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow
of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale

the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special
to engage them the pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through
which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground
that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flying-fish
and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the
rio de la plata or the in-shore ground off peru

it was my turn to stand at the foremast-head and with my shoulders
leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in
what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that
dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my
body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long
after the power which first moved it is withdrawn

ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen
at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy so that at last
all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing
that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman
the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance
of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all

suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my
hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me
with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty
fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the
capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue
glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in
the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury
jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some
enchanter's wand the sleepy

on the evening the last day their
journey harry and lucy looked out anxi
 ously at every house they saw and many
times they hoped that cottages which at a
distance peeping between trees looked
charming would be theirs till on a nearer
n view they were as often contented to let
them pass one with a honeysuckle porch
and another with a trellis and another with
a pomegranate in full flower lucy however
looked back with regret fearing that
theirs could never be so pretty theirs
was to be on the sea shore but as yet they
did not seem to be near the sea presently
they turned into a lane which led down a

steep hill with hedges so high on each
side that nothing could be seen but the
narrow road before them at the bottom
 this lane to the right there was a gate
and a road leading through a wood
harry's father stopped the carriage and
asked an old woman who came to the
gate is this the road to rupert's cottage
 
yes sir
i am glad it thought hany weare
sure a wood that is one good thing
the gate opened and they drove in
now we shall see what sort a place
it is said lucy
rupert's cottage was at the foot a high
hill covered with trees which sheltered it
at the back in front was a very small
green lawn surrounded with evergreens
the cottage had a honeysuckle porch and
a bow window and a trellis the outside
was all that lucy desired and within 
within it was an odd kind house with
one long matted passage and steps up
here and down there and rooms that had
been enlarged with jutting windows and
niches and nooks in curious ways and
lucy liked it all the better for not being a
regular house the rooms in which she
and harry were to sleep if rooms they
could be called were very very small
as even lucy observed there was but just
space for a little bed and a little table and
a little chair and for a little person to turnabout
in no chest drawers or any
such luxury only a press in the corner cut
in the wall but the more difficulties the
more inconveniences the better there would
be more work for ingenuity in contriving
how to settle themselves and their ooods
lucy wanted to have the trunks brought
in and to go to the unpacking and arranging
directly but harry had other thoughts
in his head
lucy said he i am disappointed in
one thing and a great thing
what my dear harry said lucy
opening her eyes wide
the sea said harry looking out 
the window no view the sea any

where i thought the cottage was to be
on the sea shore
and so it was but the sea was hidden
from the view the windows the house
by a sand bank which had been thrown up
by the tide and which was now covered
by a plantation evergreens harry persuaded
lucy to put off unpacking their
trunk till morning and to go out with him
in search the sea he led the way and
as theywent round the little haven she delighted
with the new place and with every
new flower and shrub would have often
stopped to admire oh harry look at
this myrtle taller than i am oh harry
this myrtle taller than mamma 
harry looked back but ran on to find
the way down to the sea shore this is
the way this is the way he shouted joyously
to lucy bidding her follow 
follow follow 
but suddenly he stopped and was silent
struck by the first sight the ocean
lucy followed and turning abruptly the
corner the rock which had hid the
view from her exclaimed the sea the
sea
she stood for some moments in silence
beside her brother looking at the vast extent
 water far as her sight could reach
bounded only by the sky they were now
standing on the sands the shore it was
a still evening the tide was ebbing the
sun setting and there was a long bright
light upon the water while the green and
white waves curling gently over each
other moved on continually
how beautiful it is exclaimed lucy
how grand harry is not it more beautiful
and grander than you expected is
not it harry
infinitely said harry but hush
i want to look and to listen to it
lucy stood beside her brother a little
while longer and then ran back to the
house to call her mother to look at it before
the red sun should be quite set her
mother came and they found harry still
on the same spot fixed in admiration his
mother seemed to know what he felt and
thought and to sympathise with him just
as he wished at first in silence then expressing
for him in words that for which
he could not find utterance the ideas 
boundless extent duration power the
feelings admiration astonishment and
awe which create the sense the sublime
while his soul was under this strong impression
his mother seized the proper moment
to raise his thoughts still higher from
the ideas immeasurable extent duration
and power to that power by which the
ocean the sun the earth and we ourselves
were created and are preserved
the impression made on the minds 
harry and lucy was never effaced
by sunrise next morning harry was on
the sea shore at the stated hours he was
constantly there to watch the coming in
and going out the tide this regular
ebbing and flowing the sea excited such
astonishment in his mind that it seemed
insatiable a fisherman who lived by the
sea side asked him if he had never before
heard the coming in and going out 
the tide every day
yes i had heard it but i never said
it before said harry that was quite another
thing
the sea and the tides took such possession
 his imagination that he could think
 nothing else not even steam boats or
steam engines during the first day he
did not even think crossing the sea in a
steam vessel he was completely absorbed
in viewing this great spectacle nature
and in considering its wonderful phenomena

his mother was surprised to find that
he was susceptible this kind enthusiasm
 which she had not till now seen in
him any symptom all his enthusiasm
had seemed to be for mechanics his mind
had indeed opened during his travels to
other objects but still these had been introduced
or had interested him by their
connection with the steam engine to which
he had traced every thing good or great
so that as she had once told his father
she was afraid that harry's head would
be quite turned by his dear steam engine
or at best that it would leave no
room in his imagination for the beauties
 nature or for any thing else but his
father had answered that there was no
danger in letting the boy's enthusiasm take
its course especially as it was a means 
collecting all the knowledge he could upon
one subject his father said it was 
little consequence to which science he
first turned his attention the same thirst
for knowledge when satisfied on one point
would turn to new objects the boy who
was capable feeling such admiration for
the ingenious works art could not fail
as he thought to admire with still greater
enthusiasm the beauties nature he
would have probably disliked them if they
had been pressed upon his attention and
yet he would have felt pain from not being
able to sympathise with the admiration 
his friends his father was justified m
his opinion and his mother was now quite
satisfied
but on the evening the day after their
arrival lucy came to harry with no face
 rejoicing
 oh my dear hany here you are
standing on the sea shore looking at the
tide very happily but you do not know
what a misfortune has happened to you
 what misfortune can have happened
to me without my knowing it said
harry
i have been unpacking our trunk
said lucy
the glass my camera obscura is
broken i suppose said harry
you suppose so calmly cried lucy
perhaps it can be mended said
harry
impossible said lucy come and
look at it my dear harry it is broken into
a hundred pieces
then there is no use in looking at the
hundred pieces said harry

 but if you will come in and look at
it said lucy i can show you just how 
it happened
i cannot help it now said harry soit
does not much signify to me how it happened
i will look at it when i go in but
i want to stay here just to see how high
the waves come at full tide
i am glad your head is so full the
tide harry said lucy i was afraid
that you would be excessively vexed as i
was when i opened the box and saw it besides
i was afraid that you would think it
was my fault
 no i could not be so unjust said
harry i remember how carefully you
packed it and how goodnatured you were
about it and i do not forget your shell
box which you left at home to make room
for my camera obscura now i am sorry
you did not bring it
 can do without it said lucy
 i will make a shell box for you cried
harry and i know how i can make it
out that camera obscura mine and
without spoiling it even if i should get a
new glass i will go in and look at it and
begin directly said hairy i mean as
soon as ever i have seen the tide come in
and marked how high it comes up on this
rock
withinside the box harry's camera
obscura there was a set hinged
flaps which lay at the bottom when it was
not used but which when it was to be used
as a camera obscura were lifted up and
joining together formed a sort pyramid
on the top which the eye glass was fixed
this glass being broken harry cleared
away the fragments and took out the pins
from the hinges the flaps which formed
the pyramid then he could take out the
flaps and these with their pins and hinges
he gave into lucy's charge to take care 
till they should be wanted again then
with the help an old knife the only tool
to be had in rupert's cottage he cut up
a blue bandbox the only pasteboard to be
had in rupert's cottage he carved and
cut this pasteboard into a number slips
with tolerably straight edges and these
were to be fastened inside his box at the
bottom so as to form divisions from the middle
in the shape a large star the corners
round it filled up with other divisions
 hearts and crescents with some as lucy
described them no particular shape
this was the ground plan these divisions
were but half the height the depth 
the box over this first story there was to
be another a tray was to be made to fit in
and to lie on the top the basement story
as harry would have it called with difficulty
the blue bandbox furnished sufficient
pasteboard for this every scrap was required
and some parts its rim had been
so much bent and bruised and battered
that they could scarcely be made fit for
service with harry's utmost care and skill
when the work was all cut out harry set
lucy to write numbers on the pieces the
stars hearts crescents and nondescript
that each might fit rightly into its place
this he had learned he said from reading
the description the building the eddystone
lighthouse it was a precaution
he found great use in the present work
the first the kind he had ever attempted
he had no glue the cook or she who
acted as cook in rupert's cottage had no
time to make paste harry however
searched in the orchard on the cherry trees
for gum and found some which he melted
in hot water it was too thin so thin
that it would not stick his divisions together
by his mother's advice he melted
it in vinegar with which he made an excellent
cement though his fingers were
unused to this fiddlefaddle work as he
thought it he persevered for lucy's sake
and for the sake his promise it was
difficult to make the tray fit rightly or
draw up and let down easily but he polished
away all friction at the four corners
and he fastened tapes to the middle each
 the four sides so automatically that it
could be drawn up without hitching and
without dangler that when filled to the
brim with the smallest 
shells it should overturn or be overturned

while hairy had been working at the
shell tray in his oven little room lucy's
head was in all the cares and joys arranging
his goods and her oven after the
general unpacking it not only required
nice arrangement to make things comfortable
in the small space allotted to them in
their new abode but continual care would
be necessary to keep them so and now
lucy felt particularly the advantage those
habits order which her mother had
taught her even when she was a very little
girl
lucy put your work into your workbag
and put your work bag into its place
had not been said in vain
when lucy had arranged her own room
she stood contemplating her arrangements
and said to herself
 what a pleasure there is in seeing all
things fit nicely into their places
this pleasure in the perception the
fitness things has been felt probably by
every little or great lover order as well
as by lucy besides our sense the convenience
 having things in their places
and the expectation finding them readily
when wanted we feel some selfapprobation
in having done our duty in putting
them to rights
lucy having finished to the best her
power the arrangement all her brother's
things and her own went out to the seashore
to look for shells and numbers she
found the whole day was spent in the
delightful search and the next morning the
moment breakfast was over she asked
harry to come again with her to the same
amusement but he said that he had business
to do first and that he would join her
as soon as he had learned his lessons
 lessons repeated lucy with surprise
not unfixed with disappointment
do you intend to go on with lessons
harry
yes why not
 i do not know answered lucy putting
on her bonnet but i thought you
need not learn them i did not know
that we were to go on with lessons now
we are not at home
 we are at home now i think said
harry this is to be our home for two
months at least
that is a long time to be sure
said lucy tying the strings her bonnet
but i have not settled to any thing yet i
have no greek to learn thank goodness
i will go down to the sea shore to day at
least and you will find me there harry
when you have done your business make
haste
harry with his books under his arm
and lucy with her bonnet on and shell
tray in her hand were turning their different
ways in the matted passage when
their mother came out her room
where are you going lucy
 to the sea shore mamma to look for
shells
her mother said that this was a pleasant
amusement but reminded her that
there were other more necessary employments

yes tomorrow mamma i intend 
why not today lucy said her
mother
 i thought it would not signify mamma
if i went without lessons one day more 
you know i have not done any during all
the journey and in one day i could not
learn much
 my dear lucy said her mother
when your father and i first thought 
bringing you with us on this journey we
considered whether it would be advantage
or disadvantage to you
 thank you mamma and you said yesterday
that you thought it had been already
 great use to harry
true my dear but now i am speaking
 you
me only mamma said lucy when
you said you i thought you always meant
both us
you are not quite so steady in perseverance
as your brother and i was afraid
that seeing a great number new things
and being with a number new people
might be disservice to you
but i hope you do not think i am
spoilt at all yell mammas said lucy
i cannot tell yet my dear said her
mother smiling that remains for you to
show me your father thought as he told
me that i might trust to the habits regularly
employing yourself which you have
lately acquired or resumed and to the influence
 your brother's example i shall
not have it in my power to attend to you
here so much as i do at home i must
ride out while i am here some hours everyday
for my health and i am to bathe
therefore i cannot be with you so much or
hear your lessons as i used to do at regular
times
never mind my dear mother said
lucy i will get them always regularly
you shall see mamma that papa was right
in thinking you might trust to me and i
will follow harry's example and i will
begin today and this minute added she
untying her bonnet i will put by my
shell tray you will allow mamma that
i am exact in putting by my things and
before i went away from you mamma i
was regular in employing myself i know
that was the reason you said resumed
you shall see mamma
from this time forward lucy at fixed
hours always went to her daily employments
or lessons as punctually as harry
went to his and performed them well
whether her mother had leisure to attend
to her or not never did lucy neglect or
voluntarily omit any them one single
day while they remained at the sea shore
and when it was all over she declared
that all the pleasures the many pleasures
she enjoyed there the reflection that she
had done this was the greatest nothing
is more tiresome than to spend all day long
in amusement or in trying to amuse oneself
lucy after working hard and well
at whatever she knew she ought to do enjoyed
with double pleasure the succeeding
hours by the sea shore hairy with complaisance
which his lasting gratitude for
the packing his camera obscura sustained
used to help her to pick up shells but it
was not an amusement particularly to his
taste and when he had stooped till his
back ached which soon happened he went
off to refresh himself at some his own
works he had a bridge to build and a
canal to cut and a lock to make these
were some the projects which he had
formed during the journey and which he
was now eager to carry into execution
he found a fine place for his canal between
two rivulets at some distance from
each other his little bark might sail triumphantly
for a length course if he
could effect their junction he levelled
and calculated and calculated and levelled
before he dug with as much care perhaps
as has been bestowed upon some great
public works he dug and excavated indefatigably
his method proceeding
was to keep the water back by a small
dam earth till he had advanced a few
feet he would then remove the dam and
the water which flowed in detected any
errors that he had committed in the level
when the cut however had been made
some yards in length the sides in many
places fell in for the soil was loose and
crumbly this misfortune was easily remedied
by increasing the slope the
sides but a more serious disaster befel
our young engineer which obliged him to
recur to his father's neverfailing advice
he had carried his work through a vein 
sand and though the sides had been properly
sloped to keep them from falling in
yet when he opened the dam and admitted
a little water it gradually disappeared
and left the canal dry
his father willingly gave his assistance
and having examined the spot and perceiving
that the sand communicated with
other porous ground underneath he said
 this is a difficulty my dear harry which
often occur sto older and wiser engineers and
always occasions great increase trouble
and expense i was in hopes that by
some alteration in the line your canal
this leaky place might have been avoided 
but the sand is so extensive that i believe
your only resource vill be to puddle the
sides and bottom
he took harry to a ditch at some little
distance in which there was abed strong
tenacious clay and he explained to him
that puddling was performed by spreading
the clay in layers wetting it sufficiently
and then beating it into a thick paste
which he would find was quite impervious
to water as soon as harry knew what
was to be done he proceeded in his work
with fresh vigour and lucy assisted him
in carrying the clay in small quantities
such as their only basket would hold the
claypaste was well mixed and rammed
with the buttend a long club and the
sides and bottom were nicely smoothed
with the back the spade when the
dam was again opened the canal was
tight and firm to admiration and harry
felt not only the pleasure successful
labour but the satisfaction having acquired
knowledge in every step he took
lucy stood by to witness and admire
this operation in which proper female
consideration for her shoes and petticoats
forbade her to join but female
sympathy is often agreeable in circumstances
in which woman's aid can in no
other way be given something to this
effect but very unlike it in words harry
once said to lucy and it paid her for
standing above an hour looking on
harry had examined the real lock on the
canal and understood its construction so
well that he succeeded in making his miniature
imitation the canal about two feet
wide and one foot deep the lock about
four feet long from gate to gate the gates
were made an old hatch door the
chicken yard which he found posts and
all among a heap rubbish in the wood
house his father oave him leave to take
possession it and the woodman lent him
a saw with which he cut it in two across
the middle leaving on each half one 
the leather straps which had served for
hinges he wisely contented himself with
single gates at each his lock as he
was aware that neither his skill nor his
tools would enable him to construct the
double gates which meet together anglewise
so as to support each other and
which he well remembered was the casein
the real lock the posts he sawed
in two also in the middle their
height but this he did without sufficient
consideration he spoiled his four
wellseasoned posts and lost a day by
this rash act he found each them cut
too short for the doors and sides his
lock because he had not considered the
depth to which it was necessary to drive
them into the ground to make them stand
firmly and bear the weight the doors
that hinged upon or shut against them
he had four new posts to make and these
he made twice as high as the others and
drove them down several inches deep into
the ground this was the hardest work 
all harry without hat or coat wielding
the woodman's heavy axe battered
these piles with the butt lending his
little soul at every stroke at every pause
lucy in pity would say
harry pray do let me try now while
you rest yourself
but when she took up the axe she
found it was too heavy for her and her
strokes were so feeble that they did no
good the post never stirred at her hammering
never sunk in twenty strokes a hairbreadth
each blow hers was so uncertain
in its aim that harry fearing the
axe would turn in her hands and that
she would by cutting off her legs besought
her to desist protesting that it
made him hotter to see her batter than to
batter himself he assured her that battering
was too hard work for women and
quite unfit for them and she being much
out breath believed him and resigned
the ponderous axe he worked himself
into another heat while she repeated
many times
it will do now harry it is deep
vol iii c
enough down now harry i am sure that
is enough
but harry battered on till the post would
stir no more then he was satisfied for it
was as he said au refus de mouton
 au refus de mouton said lucy what
can that mean mouton is mutton or
sheep what can mutton or sheep have
to do with this 
harry told her that mouton is not only
the name for mutton and sheep in french
but also for a battering hammer or pile
engine the machine with which piles are
driven down into the ground he said
that he met with the expression in a description
 the pile engine which he had
read in consequence the old gentleman
at mr franklin's having excited his curiosity
about it by the description he gave
 the houses in amsterdam built on piles
how curious it is said lucy to see
how one thing leads to another and how
one bit knowledge sometimes in the
oddest way helps us on to another that
seems to have nothing to do with it and
harry think your explaining this french
expression to me though i began to learn
french so long before you and though i
heard so much it from french people
too when i was at aunt pierrepoint's i
ought to be very much ashamed
not at all my dear said harry 
this is a scientific expression not necessary
for a woman to know
lucy looked as if she was not sure
whether she should be satisfied or dissatisfied
by this observation
not necessary for a woman to know
she repeated to be sure it is not absolutely
necessary one could live without it
yet i do not see why a woman should not
know scientific expressions as well as
men
you are very welcome to know them
ray dear said harry i do not make
any objection am not i teaching them
to you but i hope my dear lucy you
will never use them
 never use them said lucy
c 
 in the wrong place i mean added
harry
no danger if once i understand them
rightly said lucy
 still you do not quite understand me
said harry if you knew the meaning
 the words ever so well there might be
danger your using them in the wrong
place
oh harry how could that be
ask mamma and she can tell you better
than i can said harry
but tell me as well as you can said
lucy
 then for instance said harry if
you were to talk au refus de mouton
before company just to show that you
knew the expression or could say it do
you understand me now
yes but i would never do such a foolish
thing said lucy
pray do not my dear sister said
harry for it would make me feel horribly
ashamed
i shall never make you ashamed me
i hope brother said lucy i will take
great care but there was another thing
i was in a great hurry to say before you
went off to this why is a battering hammer
or a machine for driving down posts
or what do you call them piles called a
mouton 
i do not know said harry
i think i have found out the reason
said lucy
have you said harry then you are
much quicker than i am but that you always
are
 only about words said lucy and
i am not sure that i am right but i think
perhaps it is because sheep sometimes butt
this way with their heads
 i do believe you are right said harry
 this must be the meaning batteringraw
it never struck me till this minute
but i do not know what i shall do for want
 nails to nail these leather hinges on my
gate posts
lucy recollected having seen some yesterday
left sticking in the lid a deal
packing case perhaps these would do
she ran to ask her mother if she might
have them and soon returned with them
and with a hammer which had been used
at the unpacking the case and which
though it belonged to the carriage toolbox
her father lent her trusting to her returning
it punctually
not only quick in words but in deeds
said harry as she put the nails and hammer
into his hands
the hinges were fastened on and harry
pronounced the lock to be finished
but after all said lucy here is
your lock and your canal but where is
your boat to go upon it now you must
make a boat or a canoe harry yours
indeed must be made out a branch not
from the great trunk a tree to be in
proportion to your canal
true said harry a branch as you
say will do but what size must it be i
must consider that before i ask papa to let
the woodman give it to me
 you might do it by the rule three
said lucy as the great canal is to the
great boat so must the little canal be to the
little boat
well said harry do the sum forme
here is a pencil and a bit paper
but stay said lucy there is something
more we want i must have the measures
 the great canal and the little canal
and the size the great boat
harry measured his little canal and
gave breadth and depth to lucy who
multiplied them rightly into one another
the measures the great canal and the
great boat he did not know but his father
estimated them for him nearly enough to
answer his purpose lucy and he worked
out the sum patiently that evening and
when he knew the size required his father
gave him an order upon the woodman fora
branch or piece a branch the requisite
dimensions he also borrowed for
him a mallet a chisel and a gouge and
even an adze which were necessary tools
for hollowing out the solid wood and for
shaping the outside the intended canoe
this last indeed is a dangerous tool and
should never be trusted without circumspection
to oung or to old hands unless
they be skilful and careful harry
both careful and skilful for he had been
practised in the use this tool under his
father's eye at home was trusted with it
now but upon special condition that
lucy was never to touch it a condition
to which lucy having just fear her
shins as well as proper habits obedience
willingly submitted
as the hollowing out this canoe chip
by chip was likely to be a tedious operation
lucy left harry and his adze to themselves
and went to her own amusements
upon the shelly shore as she was creeping
aloncr searching for shells an old woman
crossed her path carrying on her back a
huoe basket full sea weed the woman's
foot hit against some shingles on the
beach she stumbled and let fall her
basket the contents which were overturned
on the sands lucy went to fill it
again for her and now seeing that she was
the gatekeeper who lived at the entrance
 the wood took hold one the
handles the basket and helped her to
carry it home
dame peyton for that was the old woman
s name thanked her and accepted her
offer more perhaps for the pleasure 
talking to the young lady on the way than
for any use in her assistance the load
though bulky was very light the basket
was chiefly filled with the little black bladders
 a particular kind sea weed
these when dried and oiled she strung
and sent by her daughter to the shops in a
town hard by where they were made into
necklaces and bracelets for whosoever gentle
or simple might chance to have a liking
for such the dame loved talking and she
pursued her discourse you were looking
for shells miss when i came by i suppose
 and if i may be so bold i can show
you more in an hour than you would find ina
week without me for i know where the
beds them lie and where the sea urchins
c 
bide miss if ever you heard them
urchins
lucy was eager to find a sea urchin and
had been searching for one in vain as
soon as they reached the cottage at the
gate where she lived dame peyton
pointed to a shelf in her corner cupboard
on which were several shells which had
been left there by her sailor son who had
picked up some them from the neighbouring
sands and some from foreign
parts
the shell the sea urchin which lucy
first examined was about the size an
orange the shape a turnip and divided
into compartments like a melon the colour
was lilac jut looking as if sprinkled thickly
with little white frosted sugarplums in
some its quarters and in others perforated
with a multitude holes nearly as
small as pin holes the shell was as light as
an empty egg shell through each the
little holes the urchin when alive puts out
its prickles or spines which stand in all directions
round the creature's shell like the
prickles a hedgehog lucy who had read
the description it knew that these serve
the sea urchin for legs with which at the
bottom the sea it can walk as it is said
in any direction sometimes with its mouth
upwards sometimes with its mouth downwards
sometimes rolling along sideways
like a wheel there was an opening at
the upper part the shell which served
for its mouth and another opposite to it
through which the creature can at pleasure
push out or draw in what resemble the
horns snails these which were formerly
supposed to have been its legs the
urchin uses only to feel about wdtb when
it walks as a blind man uses a staff to
touch and try every thing that lies in his
way
lucy who knew all this from her books
was eager to see the fish alive with all its
spines about it but dame peyton's dinner
was ready boiling over in her pot and
though the goodnatured old woman would
have left it to go that instant to show lucy
the haunt the urchins yet lucy would
not let her she waited till evening and
then harry accompanied her though rather
unwilling to lay by his adze and leave
his canoe
as he went with lucy towards the appointed
place he objected to her wonderful
account the urchin's mode walking
on the spines he said that as these
creatures were in the habit walking only
at the bottom the sea few people only
those who had gone down in a diving bell
could have observed them walking
 you shall see you shall see them
yourself harry said lucy
she recollected what she had read that
reaumur had first seen an urchin walking
at the bottom a shallow pan full seawater
and at her request dame peyton
had provided one her shallow milk pans
to show the experiment they found her
waiting for them when they reached ure
she took out one from a number
 these fish which had congregated
together and put the apparently inanimate
ball into the pan full water presently
it sent forth some its hundred horns
through the holes in its shell and soon
stretching its spines it appeared with all
its wiry looking prickles full upon it
thirteen hundred horns and two thousand
spines well counted
it moves it moves now harry
see it rising up now it is putting out
its feelers from beneath now look at it
feeling about like a blind man with his
staff and now he is really beginning to
walk look at him w alkino on his shines
like a wheel on its spokes how beautifully
he goes on 
 he is an admirable mechanic exclaimed
harry look how he uses some
 his spines as a fulcrum against which
he pushes and drawls on his shell by
turns i did not think any fish could have
so much sense
harrys admiration increased as well
it mioht the more he considered these
things
 now harry you see that even my
shell hunting leads to something said
lucy you will not despise shell fish
when you know more about them and
their houses
after this day whenever harry wanted
to rest himself from his hard labour he
used to go to lucy to learn something
more her shells
one day she showed him the shell the
razor fish and told him in what an ingenious
manner the fish which inhabits this
shell can move itself forward or descend
into its sandy hole it does not walk upon
spines but by means its tongue it hasa
fleshy cylindrical tongue which it can use
by turns as a shovel a hook a borer and
a ball when it wants to go on it forms
its tongue into the shape a hook which
it strikes into the sand and by which it
pulls its body after it when it wants to
descend it bores a hole in the sand with
its tongue sometimes two feet in depth 
and when it wants to ascend to the surface
it forms the its tongue into the
shape a ball which stops the bottom
 the hole and serves as a fulcrum and
then making an effort to extend the whole
tongue pushes the shell upwards till by
a repetition this operation it gains the
surface
 all things lucy most wished to see
a barnacle not for its beauty nor for its
rarity but on account the strange stories
she had read concerns it she had first
met with some account it in a note on
the barnacle in her bewick's british birds 
and afterwards she had copied from some
other a whole page its fabulous
history she searched honor the shore
many a time in vain for a barnacle but
dame peyton gave her one which had
been found by her sailor boy at the bottom
 an old plank a ship lucy ran with
her treasure to harry and showed it to
him it looked something like a transparent
white flexible gristle branching from
one centre or body into various arms 
at the or summit each branch
there was a small shell about the size a
bean and the shape the bill a large
bird these arms or branches are called
pedicle or footsteps by these the fish
attaches itself to rocks or to the bottoms
 vessels these footsteps are sometimes
 a fine red and the shells sometimes
 a violet colony
 but now harry said she you
might guess for ever what not only foolish
people but grave naturalists my dear who
wrote books in former times believed came
out these little shells pray guess
i suppose some sort offish said harry
no but a bird a goose a great
goose said lucy out each these
tiny shells this was called the treebearing
goose and now let me read this
to you or read for yourself if you please
and can read my small hand writing
harry read as follows 
what our eyes have seen and hands
have touched we shall declare there is
a small island 
lucy put her hand over the name the
place and bid harry read on without
knowing where the place was
 there is a small island wherein are
found the broken pieces old bruised
ships some whereof have been cast thither
by shipwreck and also the trunks and
branches rotten trees whereon is found
a certain spume or froth that in time
breadth into certain shells in shape like
those the muscle but sharper pointed
and a whitish colour wherein is contained
a thing in form like a lace silk
finely woven together one whereof is
fastened to the inside the shell even as
the fish oysters and muscles are the
other is made fast unto a rude mass or
lump which in time comes into the shape
and form a bird when it is perfectly
formed the shell gapeth open and the
first thing that appeareth is the aforesaid
lace or string next come the legs the
bird hanp'ino out and as it orroweth greater
it opened the shell by degrees till at
length it is all come forth and hanoeth
only by the bill in short space after it
cometh to maturity and falleth into the
sea where it gathered feathers and groweth
to a fowl bigger than a mallard lesser
than a goose which the people 
lucy put her finger over the place
 call by no other name than a tree
goose which place aforesaid and all those
parts adjoining do so much abound with
that one the best is bought for threes

pence
 i never heard such nonsense in my
life said harry
 for the truth whereof if any doubt
continued lucy reading may it please
them to repair unto me and i shall satisfy
them by the testimony good witnesses
 good witnesses indeed said harry
he asked in what part the world and
at what time what age such nonsense
could have been believed he supposed
that it must have been in the dark ages
and at novazembla or the lord knows
where he was surprised when lucy
told him that the place reputed to be the
native soil the tree bearing goose
was in england in a small island on the
 
coast lancashire and that the time when
grave naturalists wrote its history was the
latter the days queen elizabeth
 but what could have given rise to such
a strange story 
lucy said that there was no reason
given but that the silky looking membrane
which hung out the shells the fish
look something like feathers
their mother observed that as the barnacle
goose was a bird passage and
appeared only for a short time in severe
winters the country people had not means
 learning their history nor could they
tell how they came there and seeing the
barnacle shells also but seldom and perhaps
happening to see these also in bad
weather when cast ashore on shipwrecked
vessels they had concluded too hastily
that one elinor was the cause the other
because it appeared at the same time or
just before it
lucy said this was natural for ignorant
peasants but for naturalists mamma and
people who write great books think 
their believing that a great goose which
weighs i have it written down hereabout
five pounds and measures more than
two feet in length and nearly four feet
and a half in breadth came out this
little shell 
 but lucy said her mother i do
not think that is the incredible part the
story
no mamma dont you indeed
 i do not do not the common geese
you see every day come from an egg almost
as much less than the fuuorown bird
as the barnacle shell is less than the barnacle
goose 
 that is true to be sure said lucy
 great birds come from small eggs we see
but then mother the wonder is that the
bird should come from the shell a
fish
 now you have it lucy cried harry
and why should not that be believed 
said their mother
 oh mamma and do you really believe
it cried lucy
i do not recollect telling you that i
believed it replied her mother smiling
but i asked you your reason for disbelieving
 unless you can give some reason
for your belief or your disbelief you are
not wiser than the poor people you have
been laughing at
that is perfectly true said harry
but i did not think it till mamma said
so
my reason for not believing it said
lucy is that it is contrary to all we ever
heard or read the history birds or
fishes
that is a good reason said her mother
 all that we know their history is
from observation or from reading the observations
 others and all the means we
have judging whether any new fact we
hear related be true or false must be from
comparing it with former established facts
and considering whether it agtrees with
them or not
yes mamma i understand said
lucy also by considering whether it
agrees or not with what are called the laws
 nature
and what do you mean my dear by
the lawes nature said her mother
the laws nature repeated lucy
to gain time oh mamma you know
what i mean by the laws nature you
only ask that to puzzle me
no my dear lucy i ask it only
that you may not puzzle yourself that you
may not use words without clearly understanding
their meaning
is not the laws nature a good expression
mamma said lucy
a very good expression for those who
understand what they mean by it said
her mother but no expression can be
good for those who do not to them it
expresses nothing
lucy thought for some time and then
said harry do you try you can explain
it better
you mean by the laws nature said
harry things or circumstances which
have been known regularly and constantly
to happen about animals and vegetables
and minerals and all things in nature i
cannot express it quite mother but for
instance it is a law nature that the
earth turns round every twentyfour
hours
 yes that the sun rises every morning
said lucy and in the same way it maybe
said to be a lave nature mamma that
birds do not come fishes shells
very vell between you you have explained
pretty nearly what is meant by
the laws nature said their mother
 what from the beginning the
world was never in any instance known to
happen we do not believe cadi happen
said harry i mean in nature and
yet continued he new facts are discovered
which sometimes prove that what
was thought to be quite true and a settled
law nature is not so
but said lucy to go back to the
barnacle goose tree harry suppose that
you and i had lived in queen elizabeth's
days and in lancashire and near that
island geese do not you think that we
should have believed in the goosetree
i hope not said harry butlam
not sure
 suppose that a great many people had
told you that they were sure there was
such a tree said lucy what would you
have said then
 i would have asked whether they had
seen it themselves or whether they had
only heard it from others said harry
 i would have questioned the people separately
and have observed whether they
all agreed or disagreed in their answers
and above all i would have gone to the
place and would have examined the barnacle
shells with my own eyes then i
think i should have perceived that what
people had mistaken for feathers a bird
were the membranes or what do you call
them lucy teiitacula a fish i would
have returned at different times the
year to watch what became the barnacles
and then i think i should have found
the truth
and i think harry said his mother
 that if you follow such a prudent course
in judging extraordinary assertions you
will never be the dupe wonders or undertakers
whenever either you
feel inclined to believe in a wonder without
proof pray remember the barnacle
goose and the goosetree
so long as luc had any ingenious contrivances
to show harry in her shells or
any curious anecdotes to tell him the
modes life their inhabitants he
looked and listened and was pleased 
but he ceased to be interested and looked
dull when she told him any their hard
names he however admitted that the
great classes into which shells are divided
are easy to remember and he liked their
names univalves bivalves and mulilvalves
lucy placed before him a snail shell an
oyster shell and a barnacle as examples 
each class he examined the curious construction
 the hinges various shells
vol iii d
but farther he had no curiosity he could
not he said understand the use lucy's
spending so much time in settling to what
order each shell belonged lucy had
much to say in favour the use and advantages
 classification to preserve things
in order in our memory and to assist us
in recollecting them more easily but it
was not a good time to enter upon the
subject nowe because harrys head had
gone back to his boat he had finished
it and he wanted her to come out and
look at it she put aside her shells directly
and followed him
the boat it must be confessed was buta
clumsy affair the few tools that harry
had were in very imperfect order but he
forbore to complain because he had once
heard from lucy a french proverb un
mauvais ouvrier se plaint de ses outils
a bad workman complains his tools
imperfect as the boat was lucy viewed it
with indulgence and when harnessed to it
she towed it along respectfully and with
the greatest circumspection often looking
back to see that she did not upset or strand
it by pulling it against the bank harry
however remonstrated against her looking
back which he observed was out character
for a horse he told her that she
should go steadily on with her head down
and that he would take care ail the rest
and guide and govern horse and boat
the boat was on the upper branch the
canal and harry as lockman shut the
lower gate so that the lock might fill
but the lock did not fill the water indeed
rose a few inches but gushed outwith
sad velocity between the gate posts
and the sides the lock harry stood
calmly contemplating this disappointment
and considering how he could make good
the defect when lucy who observed that
the water was actually subsiding instead
 rising said
indeed harry you need not stand
there looking at your posts for all the
water that was in the lock has run out 
i think it has found some other channel
true replied harry we must stop
d 
 lia
up our useful dam once more and then we
shall discover the fault no knowledge
like that we gain by experience
the dam was soon stopped and when
the lock was nearly dry harry perceived
that the pressure the water when it had
begun to rise had torn away the loose
earth under the gate and escaped almost
as freely as if there had been no gate
after due deliberation on the best means
 obviating this unforeseen evil he resolved
to fix a sill in the bottom the
lock from post to post so that the gate
should shut tightly against it
lucy said he one those old
posts which i so awkwardly spoiled will
now be the greatest service
two days were occupied in this undertaking
the sill was at last securely pegged
down to the ground and for fear a
similar misfortune with the upper gate he
laid a sill to it also to prevent the
weight water from undermining these
sills he paved the bottom the whole
lock and a small portion the canal with
large flat stones and the intervals between
the gateposts and the lock sides he
puddled with great care another happy
thought occurred to him he had felt the
difficulty opening the gates when the
water was bearing against them and he
now provided means for letting it off gradually
by boring two round holes in each
gate into which he fitted plugs in imitation
 the sluices in the real lock
a satisfactory trial was made their
work and having ascertained that all was
right harry ran home and requested his
father to come and see his boat ooino
through the lock his father came and
first it was to go down the stream when
it came within proper distance the lock
the lower gate was closed and the sluices
 the upper gate were opened by harry
with due ceremony and with proper apologies
for not having double gates the
lock was now brim full to the level the
stream through which the boat had passed
the boat entered the gate behind it was
shut harry opened the sluice the
lower gate and by happy degrees the boat
sank as the water flowed out till it came
down to the level the lower branch 
the canal then the lower lockgate was
opened and out was drawn the boat safely
and happily
just as well said lucy as it was
managed in the real lock on the real
canal
say on the great lock on the great
canal said harry for this is a real
lock is it not father though it is
small
to reward him for his perseverance
his father promised harry to provide him
with the tools necessary for the better
finishing his boat he showed him the
principal faults in its shape and explained
to him that the middle part a boat or
ship is made broad ov full in proportion to
the kind cargo it is intended to carry 
that the foremost or bow is rounded off
to a sharp edge called the stem or cutwater
in order to lessen the resistance in moving 
and that the stern is made very narrow
under water to allow the full impulse 
the water to strike the rudder
soon afterwards his father took harry
with him to see a boat which was building
at some miles distance from rupert cottage
there he learned how the ribs a boat
are put together and fastened to the keel
so as to make them as strong and as light
as possible harry told lucy when he
returned that the framework a boat
before the boards are put in looked like the
skeleton the dead horse which they had
often seen in a rove near their father's
house he told her that he had heard the
boatmaker and his father talking about
ship building and some great improvements
that had been lately made
harry could not understand much what
they said because he had never seen the
inside a ship besides the boatbuilder
talked in workman's lanoruasre using a
number terms that were familiar to
shipwrights but not to him and taking it
for granted that every body must know
what he was talking 
 picked out however some things
that interested me said harry particularly
some that concern the steamvessels
these improvements in shipbuilding
have been great use to them
people have learned how to put the timbers
together in such a manner as to make
vessels much stronger than they were formerly
 so that now they can bear the
straining and wo j king the steamengine
i heard the man say that unless they had
been so strengthened engines such
great power could not have been used 
in short they could not have made the
steam vessels carry so much or go so fast
or so safely as they do now
 that is good for the steam vessels
said lucy and for all who go in them 
and some time or other perhaps i shall
go in one myself but harry you said
there were other things you heard which
interested you what were they
oh i heard one very ingenious
and useful invention cried harry for
taking down easily and quickly the upper
masts topmasts a they call them 
ships
upper masts topmasts repeated
lucy i do not understand what you
mean i thought the mast a ship was
all in one a great thick straight upright
pole like the stem a tree
but it is not all in one piece said
harry there is a piece put on at the
upper part the lowest mast to which
sails are hung which are called topsails 
and that piece is called the topmast it
is often great consequence for sailors to
be able to take down and put up the topmasts
quickly as my father explained tome
sometimes a topmast is broken by
a high wind or a sudden squall and till
they can replace the broken mast you
know they cannot make use the sail
that belongs to it perhaps at that moment
the ship may be running away from
an enemy or perhaps trying to escape
from some rocky shore on which they are
afraid being wrecked
then to be sure the sailors must be in
d 
a great imrry said lucy to get down
the broken mast directly
but they could not do it directly in
the old way said harry it required a
great many men pulling and hauling and
a great deal time an hour at least
even if there were plenty men and
sometimes there are few men and then
it takes a longer time two hours very
likely now by this new invention they
say it can be done by one man or two
men at the most and in five minutes or
less
and how is this done said lucy
 will you tell me the old way first and
then the new way if you can make me
understand them
i do not understand them myself yet
said harr but i shall soon know more
about the matter i hope my father is to
go next week to see a friend his who
lives near plymouth and there is a great
dockyard at plymouth and a number 
ships there and amongst them there is
one that has this new invention
but are you to see it my dear harry
said lucy
 yes my father says he will take me
with him said harry is not that
good 
very good and next week too and
you will tell me all about it harry when
you come back and i hope you will see a
man war and that you will describe
that to me too said lucy
next week arrived and harry's father
took him to plymouth and to the dockyard
on his return he told lucy that
he had seen and heard so much that he
did not know where to begin his description
or what to tell her first
first tell me about the man war
said lucy if you saw one
 i saw many said harry and i went
on board one and all over it but it is
impossible to give you any idea it
harry however attempted to give her
an idea its magnificent size the height
 the masts the spread the sails the
intricate rigging the coils ropes on the
deck and the vast thickness the cables
which were to draw up the huge ponderous
anchor then he described the
accommodations and all the conveniences
for jiving in this floating wooden town
it was more like a town than a house he
said as it was such an extent and
contained so many inhabitants several
hundred men and all their provisions and
all they must want for living months perhaps
years at sea he described how the
sailors hammocks were slung and how
they were aired every day on the deck
then he described the captain's cabin a
large handsome room with a sofa and
writing table and a bookcase and ail the
comforts and luxuries life but principally
harris expatiated on the manner in
which the arms were arranged in the gunroom
in star shapes and curious forms
which at first he thought was merely for
ornament but he learned that they were
all so placed in order that they might take
ei
up the least possible room and that they
might be found easily in time need
and in the storerooms he observed that
every thing great and small down to the
least bolt screw or nail had its own
place the use order was seen thereto
the greatest perfection
 in time action as they call it said
harry meaning in time battle and
in a storm when the safety the vessel
and the lives the men all depend on
their being able to find what they want ina
moment consider my dear lucy what
advantage it must be to have them all in
order but i cannot give you a right
idea it you must see it lucy and i
hope you will some time
and i hope then you will be with
me said lucy
i hope so said harry so now i
will tell you about the jiciy
what is di jicir said lucy
a thick iron bolt said harry which
is run through a hole in the heel or lower
 the topmast when the topmast is
up in its place the ends the fid rest
upon two strong bars wood which are
fixed to the head or upper the
great lower mast the topmast stands
up between these bars and the fid you
perceive lucy supports its whole weight
as well as that all the sails and yards
which are hung on it and besides all
this weight there are several thick ropes
from the head the topmast which are
called shrouds and which are fastened
down very tight in order to steady it
now you must understand next continued
harry that when the topmast is
up it cannot be taken down without first
taking out this fid
but what a very odd namewis said
lucy
fiddlefaddle said harry never
mind that one name is as good as another
when you are used to it now let
me explain the thing itself before the fid
can be pulled out the whole weight the
topmast must be lifted up off it and
before this can be done all the ropes
which steady it on each side must be
loosened to lift this great weight there
must be great pulling and hauling and
altogether it is a long difficult job and
many men must work hard at it and fora
long time but now without loosening
rope and with only one or two men
they get out the new lever fid in a fewminutes

 how very nice cried lucy
 nice repeated harry what a word
when talking the masts a great ship
 one word is as good as another when
you are used to it as you said about fid
replied lucy laughing but what is the
contrivance you have not told me that 
can i understand it
 yes if you understand the general
principle the use the lever are you
clear that
 i believe i am said lucy i know
what you have told me and shown me
that the greater the space your hand passes
through in moving the long a lever
the more weight you can move at the short
 it
very well you might have put it in
other words but i believe you understand
something about it said harry now
for the view lever bids instead one
great bolt run through the mast there are
two strong levers one at each side it
and they are fixed on the same bars which
supported the ends the common old fid
when the topmast is up in its place the
short arm each lever goes a little way
into the hole in its heel and the long armis
securely fastened by a small pin to a
frame wood when it is to be lowered
the little fastening pins are taken out the
levers immediately tilt up and down comes
the topmast but not with the sudden and
dangerous jerk you might suppose because
there are ropes from the long arms the
levers by which the sailors manage the
affair as gently as they like
so then said lucy you mean that
these two little pins from being applied
at the ends the long arms the levers
have power to balance the whole weight 
the great topmast and all its ropes and
sails and other things that are supported
on the short arms how wonderful 
there is the wonderful power the
lever lucy said harry
 then you could lift any weight in the
world with a lever if you had but one long
enough and strong enough said lucy
if i had space and time enough and
something to stand upon said harry i
am glad lucy you are so much struck by
the use this wonderful powder for as
my father said to me when we were talking
about the fid on our return home it
does not much signify whether we know
the best way lowering the topmast 
a ship but the principle the lever it
is great consequence that we should
understand because in some way or other
little or great we have to use it every day
in the most common things
 yes said lucy for instance at this
moment when i am going to stir the fire
i could not without the help this lever
in my hand commonly called the poker
raise up this great heavy coal which now
i lift so easily look putting the point
 my pokerlever under it and resting
my lever on the bar 
yes the bar is your fulcrum said
harry
and by pulling down the other 
the poker i gain all the power as you call
it this long lever
 tell me exactly what advantage you
think you gain said harry tell me
how you would measure it
i gain the advantage the whole
length the poker said lucy
 not the whole length the poker
said harry look where it rests on the
bar from that bar to the point under the
coal is what we may call the short arm 
your lever and from the place where it
rests on the bar to your hand is the long
arm your lever now if you were to
measure those two lengths and find how
many times longer the one is than the
other you would tell exactly the advantage
you gain in this case and in every
possible case in which a lever is used
ha the proportion between the long
and the short the lever said lucy
 is the advantage gained now i know
exactly oh i hope i shall remember
this
but lucy is not this leverfid a very
simple invention 
beautifully simple said lucy i
only wonder that it was never found out
before
that is the wonder always when any
good contrivance is made said harry
but now i will tell you another wonder 
that this was not found out by any sailor
or captain or admiral or any seaman 
any kind but by a landsman as the captain
said to papa and what is more he
belongs to a profession quite away from
the sea he is a lawyer
 a lawyer lucy exclaimed
and what do you think made him a
lawyer said harry
i suppose studying the law said lucy
and as they say being called to the bar
but said harry i meant to ask
what do you think first turned his mind to
the law or determined him to become a
lawyer my dear it is a foolish question
 mine because you cannot guess 
so i will tell you it was his love mechanics

 how could that be said lucy
 i will tell you said harry i heard
the whole story for a gentleman a friend
 his who had known him from a boy
and as well as he knows himself was
telling it on shipboard to my father this
is what i wanted to come to all the time i
was telling you about the lid the inventor
who has made such a useful invention
which will probably save many ships
and the lives all that are in them has
often said to his friends that he owes all
his success in life to his early love 
mechanics when he came home from
school he used to employ himself in doing
all the little mechanical jobs that were
wanting about the house he used to mend
the locks for instance then in taking a
lock to pieces he saw how it was made
and by degrees learning the use tools 
he made many things which he could not
afford to buy when he was a boy
what sorts things did he make
said lucy
i do not know all i only heard a
desk and a little cabinet i think then
he took to pieces an old watch his
father's and learned how to put it together
again when he left school he
lived two years at home with his father
and sometimes he employed himself in
drawing maps in attempting to draw
portions very large circles on his
maps he found great difficulty for want
 right instruments and he invented and
made for himself an instrument by the
help which he could as his friend described
it to my father draw these small
portions circles without the necessity
 using compasses or finding a centre
i wish you had invented that harry
said lucy
i exclaimed harry but do you
know he was only eighteen at that time 
well he was one day using his instrument
and not at all aware that it was anything
but a help to himself when a gentleman
came into his father's study where he
was drawing this gentleman was charmed
with the invention and advised him to offer
it for sale to some optician or some maker
 mathematical instruments he determined
to follow this advice and set about
directly and made one neatly in brass
and carried it to london to an optician
who approved it and gave him for it
an air pump and an electrical apparatus
and some other instruments 
delightful cried lucy and what
did he do next 
he improved his own little instrument
by adding a scale to it then other people
used it and found it answered and at last
what do you think he had a silver medal
voted and presented to him by the society
 arts when he was yet a boy as his
friend said not out his teens
 a silver medal from the society 
arts i know the look it said lucy
i saw one that was given to a friend 
papa's i remember seeing it in its little
crimson case lined with satin but what
an honour for a boy 
 he did not stop there said harry
he went on 
 i know to the fid cried lucy
 stay a bit said harry we are not
come to the fid yet during those two
years he lived in a lonely place in south
wales and his attention happened to be
turned to the shoeing horses some
horse his father's was ill shod i suppose
and he considered how to prevent
horses feet from being cramped and hurt
by their shoes he invented an elastic
horse shoe
 better and better said lucy
stay a bit said harry it was
tried upon the horses some regiment 
horse guards and it did not do
 what a pity that must have vexed
him very much said lucy
not at all said harry i should
think not a man cannot expect always
to succeed in every thing much less a boy
but though the horseshoe did not succeed
yet it led to the most important event
 his life
how tell me that said lucy i
am always glad in lives when we come to
those words
tell me first said harry do you
know what is meant by taking out a patent

 not very well said lucy
not very well but do you know at
all do you know what a patent is
 not exactly said lucy but i have
read about patents and monopolies in the
english history long ago to mamma in the
reign king james or king 
 never mind about the kings or their
reigns said harry ego on to the thing
if you know it
 i know that the kings england
were blamed said lucy for granting
these monopolies and patents
but what were they said harry
i believe they were permissions
granted to particular people to sell particular
things and orders that none should
sell those things but themselves said
lucy
i did not think you knew so much
about it said harry how came you to
know that 
the way i know most things that i
do know said lucy mamma explained
it to me when i was reading to her
 but those were some them unjust
patents and mamma explained how and
why i dare say said harry as my father
did to me yesterday b ut there are patents
in these days which i think are very
just laws which by granting some writing
called a patent secures to whoever makes
any new useful mention the right to sell
vol iii e
it to others and to have all the credit and
profit it for a certain number years
as a reward for their ingenuity
 very fair said lucy
 this gentleman wanted to have a
patent for his horseshoe continued harry
and before he could obtain it it is necessary
they say to make out in a sort 
law paper a description the invention
in lawyer's words he went to a great
lawyer to do this for him but the great
lawyer was no mechanic and he did not
understand and could not describe the
thing at all he did the law words
rightly but the mechanic himself was
obliged to rite the description so borrowing
the law terms from his lawyer he
put the description in himself and he did
it well and it was thought by others to be
well done now he found that some
lawyers are paid a great deal money
for drawing out these patent descriptions 
specifications is the word which harry did not
know
or whatever they call them this first
put it into his head that if he knew as
much law as was necessary for this he
could do the whole himself and earn his
bread by doing it for other people this
determined him to learn law and he
did so you see as i told you his love
 mechanics first made a lawyer 
him he acquired all the knowledge requisite
 and now as his friend said he
is unrivalled in england in that particular
employment but now i must tell
you another curious circumstance continued
harry to show you how after he
was a lawyer he was brought back to
mechanics again it happened that he
was employed as an advocate in some
cause where there was a dispute about
the loss a cargo or the goods onboard
a merchant ship which had been
wrecked he was to examine the captain
 the ship in the court justice to find
out whether he had or had not done all
that was possible to save the ship and the
cargo in this examination he asked the
e
captain some question about the loweringthe
topmasts the captain laughed at
him for his question whatever it was because
it showed that he did not understand
rightly how the topmasts were to be got
down the captain explained this to
him and showed him the difficulties and
i suppose told him all about the fid the
common old fid i mean he perceived
what an inconvenient contrivance it was
and that very evening after the trial by
considering how a fid could be better managed
he invented the leverfid his
friend said that when he went to his
supper he cut out the shape his leverfid
in a bit cheese and thinking that
it would answer its purpose he could not
go to rest till he had made a nice little
model in box wood he made model after
model till he was satisfied then how to
get it into use was the next difficulty
the gentleman said a great deal about
the lords the admiralty that i did
not understand but in short his contrivance
was approved by them and they

ordered that all the assistance he wanted
should be given to him for trying it in
some one ship the maidstone frigate
i remember that was the name the ship
in which it was tried and it succeeded
perfectly the first time the ship went
out to sea with it the topmast was to betaken
down and this was done so easily
and quickly that all felt the use and excellence
 the invention and the officers
 the navy have given it their decided
approbation and it has been brought into
use in a great many ships
how happy the man who made this
invention must be added harry
 and his sisters and his father and
mother said lucy how glad they must
be to see it succeed so well and to know
how useful it is
an invention useful to all the british
navy what a grand thing said harry
after pausing and considering for sometime
harry added
yet he was once a boy like me and
trying little mechanical experiments my
dear lucy i heard his friend telling my
father something which made a great
impression upon me the more so because
he was not thinking me or that it
could do me any good to hear it when he
said it
 what did he say asked lucy eagerly

that this gentleman attributes all his
success in life to his having early acquired
a taste for mechanics and to the habit 
trying to invent and to improve his early
inventions in those two years which he
employed so well at home when he came
from school and before he was fit for any
profession a time which they say many
boys waste in idleness
i am sure you never will harry said
lucy
no after hearing this i think it
would be impossible i should said harry
 this has raised my ambition i assure
you but i must go on as he did learning
by degrees and be content with doing
little things first
 what will you do next said lucy
 now you have finished your boat and
your lock
 i have a plan said hairy you
shall know it tomorrow
harry's new project was to build a bridge
over a little mountain stream which had
often stopped his mother in her walks
he had already laid a board across from
bank to bank and had fixed it steadily
but upon this two people could not walk
abreast nor could the ass cart pass this
way it was necessary to take it by another
road a quarter a mile round that a
bridge at this place would be a public and
private benefit seemed evident and harry
was ambitious building a real substantial
arched bridge which should last he
would not say for ever but as long as man
could reasonably expect a bridge to last
this project was heartily approved by his
prime counsellor lucy before whose quick
anticipating eyes the arch instantly rose
complete
and when it is built cried she it
shall be called harrys bridge i or afi
another's bridge which shall we call it
harry
let us build it first said harry and
we may easily find a name for it afterwards
come with me to the place lucy
when they reached the spot hairy bid
her guess what the distance was from bank
to bank she guessed about a yard and a
half
a yard and a half such a woman's
measure that is four feet six said
harry
such a man's measure six what lucy
might have said had she been disposed to
retort criticism but that was far ar from
her disposition she knew what he meant
and that was all she thought 
four feet six inches said she is
it more or less 
 you are within half a foot it my
dear said harry my arch must be a
five feet span i mean that the width
across from abutment to abutment from
foundation stone to foundation stone on the
opposite sides must be five feet but
there is my father cried harry on the
sands below at the very place where i
want him to be i will show him my
plan directly
down the hill ran he to the sea shore
and down ran lucy after him with equal
speed their father was stopped short
and the bridge project started and his consent
assistance and advice anxiously requested
lucy thought his first look was
not favourable he shook his head and
answered that he feared harry would find
it beyond his skill or present knowledge
to construct an arch
harry stood quite still and silent for a
minute or two then collecting himself he
deliberately answered
 i remember father your showing me
long ago an arch which you made for me
 a thin lath between heavy weiojits
e
half hundred weights from the qreat scales
which were placed at each for buttmeets
then i pressed on the top the
arch and felt how strong it was it bore all
tny weight i recollect this i think
continued he in a very modest but firm
tone made me understand the oreat
principle the arch which as you told meat
the time depends on the buttments being
secure and i will take care and
make the abutments my bridge strong
enouoh
you will do well hany and you remember
well and understand one oreat
principle on which the security an arch
depends but there is much more to be
known and considered however my
dear boy try and build your bridge you
will lean best from your own experience
you may amuse and instruct yourself at
the same time tell me what assistance
you want and i will tell you whether i
can give it to you
thank you father then in the first
place will you come on a few steps that i
may stow you my arch which i have
drawn on the sand and will you give me
your opinion it
lucy ran on before to see it first and
then waited anxiously to hear her father's
opinion she saw surprise in his countenance
the moment he looked at the arch
described on the sand
this is well done harry this will
do said he who showed you how to
describe this arch or how happened it
that you chose this shape more than any
other 
nobody showed me how said harry
 but i took it from the little bridge which
i saw the mason building in that lane
where we went to look at the road mending
i measured the centering as it lay
on the ground when they had done with
it and i drew my arch exactly by that
centering
 what is the centering harry whispered
lucy
 a sort wooden frame on which the
stones the arch are supported while it
is building said harry for you know
they could not hang in the air
his father told harry he thought he had
done wisely to take advantage the experience
 a mason who was used to
build bridges instead going to work
rashly without knowing what he was
about
 but father said harry colouring i
do not think i deserve to be praised for
prudence i was not prudent at all at
least not in the way you think i would
much rather have done it all myself and
drawn my arch my own way and different
from this but i took this curve because
the masons centering will fit it and i
thought you could borrow it for me and
that though you might perhaps allow me
to build the bridge you would not like the
trouble or expense getting boards forme
to make a centering for myself besides
i was not sure that i could make it
all myself
well harry since i cannot admire
your prudence i am the more satisfied
swith
yoiir honesty now what assistance
do you want for your bridge consider
and let me know tomorrow
 i have considered already father
cried harry and if you please i can tell
you all today and this minute stones
in the first place and i know where they
can be had and where they are no use 
in the ruins the old garden wall which
is now rebuilding brick
granted as many them as you
want and can carry said his father
but there are some too heavy for me
said harry will you order the boy and
the ass cart to bring them
his father assented
and will you order for me lime and
sand enough for mortar 
if you can tell me how much each
you want harry
he could for he had inquired from the
mason how much had been used in building
the bridge the same size and he
named the quantities then he had farther
to ask for a bucket a hod a trowel
and a plumbline and the mason's centering
and the mason or the mason's manif
he could be had for three days to assist
him in lifting and placing the heavy
stones
lucy held her breath with anxiety
while harry uttered all these requests
fearful that so many at once could not be
granted but her father was pleased by
harry's making them all at once and by
his having so well considered what was
necessary for his undertaking bucket
hod trowel plumbline and centering all
were granted but there was a doubt with
respect to the mason or the mason's man
 i am willing to give you all necessary
assistance hands but not head harry
i cannot let you have the mason but i
will lend you for three days the mason's
man who if i mistake not has hands but
no head
i am glad it father cried harry 
 i mean so much the better for me because
if he had ever so good a head it
would be in my way it would hinder me
from using my own then i should not
learn as you said from my own experience
i would rather do all that i possibly
can my bridge for myself i am sorry
the arch is not my own but that could not
be helped you know father on account 
the centering
 however just the curve the arch
does not much signify i suppose said
lucy one shape one curve an arch
is much the same or as good as another
though not so pretty perhaps
there you are quite mistaken lucy
said her father one curve on the contrary
may be as pretty but not as good as
another not as capable sustaining weight
not as durable there is a great deal 
difference between one curve and another
for a bridge as harry when he has more
knowledge science will be able to explain
to you
harry again expressed his regret that
he had this arch laid out ready to his hand
in short said he now the most
difficult the most scientific part is done
and i have only to do the easy masonwork
part which any body can do without
making any mistakes or requiring any ingenuity

 there is no danger harry your not
finding sufficient difficulty before you have
done there is room enough left i promise
you to make mistakes and to exercise
as much ingenuity as you possess
harry brightened up again on hearing
this and so did lucy
 the more difficulty the more glory
said she
as soon as all was provided which was
not quite so speedily as lucy wished
harry set to work first he cleared and
levelled a place on the bank on each side
for his foundations then while the
heavy stones were drawing up by the ass
he was busy very busy making mortar
with the assistance the man without a
head the great foundation stones were
then placed harry taking particular care
to choose the most solid weighty stones
and to have them laid level and firm
then came the wooden frame work that
was to support the mason work while they
were building the arch the centering
as lucy knew that it was called and she
would have liked to have examined it
but she would not interrupt harry at this
moment for he was eager to have it put
up and to get on with the work therefore
she stood by without interrupting the
operations by question or remark the
centering was hoisted up and fixed by
harry and the headless man whose
hands and length arms were it must be
acknowledged manifest use upon this
occasion the wooden arch was raised
to the height at which the stone arch was
to be built upon it and it was supported at
each side by upright props between these
and the wooden frame wedges were put
in and harry busy as he was stopped to
explain to lucy that these wedges were to
be knocked out when the bridge was completed
and that the wooden arch being
removed would as it was to be hoped
leave the stone one standing firm
then the building the arch began
we cannot follow the work stone by stone
as lucy did with untired sisterly sympathy
not only stone by stone as each was
placed but as they were many a time displaced
and tried over and over again before
they fitted to lucy's surprise and
mortification she observed that even the
stupid mason's man by long practice could
judge better which stones would best fit
and how they would best go into certain
places than harry could with all his
quickness eye and sense this was
most apparent the first and second days on
the third after even this little practice
harry found his eye and hand improving
and his sense began to get the better his
awkwardness at his new trade after
this third day's long and hard and hot
labour the arch rose from each side till it
nearly met at top and wanted only the
putting in the last stone the key stone
to complete the work harry showed
lucy that when this was put in all the
parts the arch were pressed together
and that none could give way without displacing
the others each part tended to
support each and to hinder any stone from
being pressed upwards or downwards
more than another
 so it is impossible it should comedown
as long as it is an arch said lucy
 as long as it is an arch impossible
said harry all we have to desire is
that it should never alter from this shape
and i do not see how it can continued
he looking at it my abutments are so
secure there is no danger their giving
way or being thrust out by any weight
that will go over the bridge
now then said lucy you will
take away all this wooden underbridge
and these props and you are to knock out
the wedges that you may take down the
centering now the bridge is finished
not yet said harry we must leave
it some time for the stones to settle and
the mortar to dry a little
lucy's impatience yielded to her brother's
prudence but he was very eager
himself for the taking down the centering
that trying time at length arrived
an anxious moment even to old experienced
architects veteran bridge builders the
wedges were knocked away the props
fell the centering was lowered and
withdrawn from under the arch and it
stood i harry took breath and pushed
back his hat off his hot forehead lucy
clapped her hands exclaiming
it stands harry's bridge stands it
shall be called harry's bridge 
no my mother's bridge said harry
if you please it was for her i built it
 and i will run and call her to see it
cried lucy
 and i will go for my father said
harry i hope he is not busy
neither father nor mother were to be
found in the house they were outriding
and they staid out till it was so late that
harry and lucy thought it was better not
to ask them to look at the bridge till the
next day their mother had never yet
seen even the plan she was not in the
secret they hoped that she would be
delightfully surprised it was settled that
she should be invited out to look at it
early the next day she was as they
arranged it to be handed over the bridge
by harry to a seat which lucy had prepared
in a recess in the rocks on the opposite
side where she might sit and read
happily
alas who can answer for tomorrow
the next day it rained and the next and
the next poured torrents the rain lasted
without intermission a week a long melancholy
week for in rupert's cottage
they had not the same means amusing
and employing themselves which they
possessed at home they had but few
books and those few belonged chiefly to
their latin or english lessons their
father and mother had been promised the
use the library a friend who lived in
the neighbourhood and upon the faith 
this promise they had brought scarcely
any books with them but their friend

unexpectedly called to town upon business
was unfortunately for them absent
there was no circulating library no 
society in this part the country
there was one advantage to be sure in
possessing but few books these were well
read and many things found in them
which had escaped attention when in the
midst greater variety at last they
were reduced to johnson's dictionary not
the delightful quarto in which there are
quotations from all the best authors in our
language exemplifying the various uses 
each word with the great johnson they
might have happily amused themselves at
night reading those quotations and puzzling
their father and mother by making
them guess the authors this had often
been a favourite resource at home but
now they had the little octavo johnson in
which there are only the meanings and
the derivations the words this
however they made what profit and diversion
they could they picked out
words for each other to explain and compared
their own explanation with definitions
in the dictionary
 now lucy i will give you a woman's
word to darn cried harry let us see
whether you can explain the meaning as
well as it is explained here by a man 
lucy made many attempts her colour
rising at each ineffectual trial and at last
she could not equal the mans definition 
to darn
to mend holes by imitating the texture
 the stuff
lucy had her revenge when they came
to network which is thus described by the
learned doctor 
 any thing reticulated or decorated
at equal distances with interstices between
the intersections
 look for decussate said harry
lucy turned over the leaves and read
 decussate to intersect at acute angles
well that is something like netting
said harry
is it how said lucy
 why you know said harry in a
net each mesh or stitch is intersected is it
not at acute angles
 but it is not intersected said lucy 
for to intersect means to cut in two
does not it and the mesh the net instead
 being cut in two is joined at the
corners is it not very extraordinary that
the man should say the very contrary to
what he means and to the sense the
thing 
 it would be very extraordinary if it
were so said cautious harry but i
think to intersect does not always mean to
cut in two i know in euclid lines are
said to be intersected when they are only
crossed 
on turning to the dictionary harry
found himself supported in his assertion
for there are two verbs to intersect one
is a verb active meaning to cut to divide
each other the second is a verb
neuter and means what i told you said
harry to meet and cross each other 
as in your net the threads do meet and
cross at the angles
 yes said lucy but they must do
more not only cross but be tied and
knotted i wish continued she that
dictionary makers would use easy words
instead words more difficult than those
they are explaining at least when i am as
sleepy as i am now i can look for no
more words so good night dr johnson
i am going to bed
let me put him away for you said
harry poor creature you are fast
asleep
as he went to put johnson in his place
he saw another dictionary by dr ash on
the same shelf and taking it down said he
had a mind before he gave up the search
just to look in this for network
it will do you no good said lucy 
 all the dictionary people since johnson's
time have copied from him mamma told
me so and she told me a droll story
which proves what bungling copies they
vol iii f
sometimes make but i am too sleepy to
recollect it rightly mamma would you
be so good as to tell him about curmudgeon
r
his mother asked him if he knew what
is meant by a curmudgeon
yes a cross selfish miserly person
is not it 
 and can you guess from what the
word is derived harry it is but fair to
tell you that it is a corruption two
french words ill pronounced
 french words said harry then i
have no chance if you had said english
words i might have said two that must
came into my head
oh say them for i am sure they are
odd by your look said lucy wakening
with the hope diversion
 cur munching said harry say it
quickly and it will make curmudgeon
and a cur munching is cross and miserly
if you attempt to take his bone from him
lucy laughed and tried to repeat
cur munching as often and as quickly as
she could to turn it into curmudgeon for
harry and his mother wrote down for
him the derivation as it is given in the
quarto edition johnson's dictionary
curmudgeon n s it is a vitious
manner pronouncing coeur merchants fr
an unknown correspondent
now here is ash's dictionary cried
lucy i will look for it i am quite
awake now mamma but stay first
harry tell us what you think is meant by
 fr an unknown correspondent 
fr means french to be sure said
harry and an unknown correspondent
sent johnson this derivation i suppose
you suppose perfectly rightly said
lucy but now look how dr ash understood
or misunderstood it for want 
knowing the meaning the two french
words here it is
curmudgeon noun sub from the french
coeur unknown merchant correspondent
excellent cried harry laughing
let me see it 
oh mamma can you tell us any more
f 
 such droll mistakes said lucy i
dare say there are a great many more if
one could but find them and i should like
to make a list them all
to shame the poor dictionarymakers
said harry but that would be very
ungrateful you after all lucy for
consider how often dictionaries have
helped us when we were in difficulties
and how much amusement we have had
from johnson's quotations
in the great johnson oh i acknowledged
that at first said lucy and
you forget this curmudgeon mistake was
not your dear great or little johnson's so
i am not ungrateful
 but you know you triumphed over
him when you had him caught in your
network said harry
because his hard words said
lucy
lucy said her father did you ever
hear the fable apollo and the critic
no papa pray tell it to me said
lucy i love fables
are you awake enough to hear and
understand it said her father
yes papa perfectly wide awake 
curmudgeon and the munching cur have
wakened me completely
there was a famous critic who read
a famous poem for the express purpose 
finding out all its faults and when he had
found them and made a list them he
carried his list and his notes to apollo
apollo ordered that a bushel the finest
wheat that had ever grown on mount parnassus
should be brought and he ordered
that it should be winnowed with the utmost
care and when all the corn was separated
from the chaff apollo presented the chais
to the critic for his reward and banished
him for ever from parnassus
 thank you papa said lucy i
understand the moral that fable very
well and i think i hall better banish myself
to bed now good night harry i
hope it will be a fine day tomorrow
it was a fine day all the dark clouds
had disappeared and left the sky clear
blue the sandy soil had dried so quickly
that harry and lucy flattered themselves
that their mother would walk out this morning
and they ran to prepare her seat beyond
the bridge
but oh disappointment extreme oh 
melancholy sight the bridge was no
more nothing remained the arch but
some fragments over which the waters
were rushing the mountain stream
which had been swelled by the rains to a
torrent had not yet sunk to its natural
quiet state but was dashing down the
rock with deafening noise
harry stood motionless looking at it
i do not hear you my dear said he
as lucy twitched his arm to obtain an
answer what do you say 
come a little further away from this
noise said lucy i say that i am exceedingly
sorry for you harry
thank you said harry so am i
sorry for myself but sorrow will do no
good
how could it happen when you took
such care about the abutments asked
lucy
i did not take care enough said
harry that much is clear but it is not
clear to me how it all happened or why 
the water covers every thing now it
runs you see over the banks beyond my
foundations we must have patience
oh how hard it is to have patience
sometimes said lucy with a deep sigh
harry could not forbear echoing her
sigh though he passed it off with a hem
immediately thinking it was not manly
he was determined to bear his disappointment
like a man but he could not help
feeling it
in the evening when the waters had
subsided they revisited the place their
misfortune while harry surveyed the
ruins below and examined into the cause
 the disaster lucy stood on the bank
looking alternately at his countenance
and at the fragments the fallen bridge
in all the respectful silence sympathy
i see now how it happened said
harry though i made my abutments
strong enough i did not go down to the
solid rock for my foundations i bush them
on the bank which i thought at the time
was firm enough
so did i i am sure said lucy it
was as firm and hard as the ground i am
now standing upon
but it was all sandy soil as you can
see here where it has been broken away
said harry and i perceive exactly how
it happened when the rain swelled that
mountain torrent the water came higher
under my arch than i ever expected
who could have expected it said
lucy
 there was not room for it to pass underneath
continued harry and therefore
it pressed against the sides the arch
and rose up over the banks then the
earth and sand were loosened the foundations
were undermined the stones were
swept away and then down fell our arch
 poor arch poor harry said lucy
that horrible mountain torrent how
violent it was who could have thought it
who had only seen it running gently in its
peaceable way but it is all over we
can never have a bridge here we must
give it up
 give it up because i have made one
mistake said harr and when i seethe
cause it oh no if my father will
but let me try again and here he is and
i will ask him cried harry
his father who had heard his misfortune
was coming to condole with him
and to inquire how it had happened
harry showed him you were quite
right father said he in foreseeing
that i should find room enouoi to make
mistakes and so i have you see but
this was my first attempt and now i have
learnt something by experience will ou
be so kind as to let me try again and let
me have the assistance the mason's
man for three days more 
three days more a labourer's work at
two shillings a day some people would
consider this a oreat deal too much to five
f 
to the mother s bridge or rather to the
sons bridge but harry's kind father did
not think so he was pleased to find that
his son was not discouraged by disappointment
and that he had immediately
set about to discover the cause his
failure and he told harry that he should
have the mason's man for three days to
make a second trial upon the same conditions
as before
 and will you help me father to find a
better place for my foundations will you
father 
 no harry do it all yourself
he would give no opinion or advice he
pursued his walk to the wood and harry
was left to determine his plans after
much careful deliberation he decided on
a place a little higher up the stream where
the foundations his abutments would
stand upon the solid rock so that no treacherous
sand or loose earth should be
washed away by the torrent and again expose
them to be undermined
after settling this point and measuring
the span and other dimensions he repaired
to the seashore to draw the plan
and elevation his second bridge the
stream being rather wider and the
banks much higher in the new situation
that he had chosen it was clear that the
arch could not be the same as the first 
and at this he seemed to rejoice and so
did lucy for now it would be all his
own he described arches various
curves on the sands but he had no exact
principle or rule to guide him in what he
was about he had a general notion that
the strength his bridge must depend in
some degree on the curve or the proportion
between its span and height and that
the weight and pressure it was to bear on
its different parts should be calculated
but how to accomplish all this or how to
choose the best curve for the situation he
did not know he could be guided only
by his eye by a sort feeling proportion
 by guess in short lucy assisted
lii with her feelings and taste as to which
was the prettiest
 my dear harry cried she that
high pointed arch is very ugly it will
never do your first bridge was a much
prettier curve
it must be this height my dear said
harry because my foundations are to be
upon the rock which is far below the
bank the top my bridge will be
but a little above the level the path on
each side and when the bridge is built
i shall fill np the space between the side
and the banks with stones and earth and
then level the road over it from the path
on each side he drew the slope for her
and she was satisfied
but now harry had to consider the serious
affair a centering for his new arch
his father had said that if he could make
one for himself he might do so and
that he would supply him with boards if
he could tell him exactly what he wanted
harry fortunately knew what he wanted 
but he was ashamed when he came to
write down all that would be necessary
to see how much it was
twelve thin boards each four feet
long and nine inches wide and three
boards six feet long which are each to
be slit into two parts for ties and six
uprights any pieces rough wood 
and nails one hundred and a half
his father seemed satisfied with these
distinct orders and told him that he should
have all that he required next morning
the carpenter and his boy arrived bearing
the wishedfor boards on their shoulders
the moment harry obtained possession 
them to work he went to make his centering
flat on the ground he laid four 
his four feet boards two forming each side
 the pointed arch and bringing their
upper edges as nearly as he could bring
straight lines to something like the curves
which he had marked upon the ground
the ends the boards were lapped over
where they joined and the corners were
left projecting on the outside
 it is not in the least like an arch yet
said lucy
 have patience and you shall see said
harry
with all the decision a carpenter who
knows what he is about harry bored holes
for his nails and nailed the pieces together
as they lay three nails in each side
joint and four at the top then he nailed
one slip one the six feet long boards
across his wooden arch at bottom to hold
it together and another piece half way upto
brace and strengthen it then he
sawed ois the jutting corners the boards
which had been left sticking out and
chiselled and planed away parts the
outer edges to bring them to the curves
he wanted three such frames or wooden
arches he made in the same manner and
exactly the same size
then having determined on the proper
breadth for his intended bridge and having
marked it on the ground by two parallel
lines and drawn another midway between
them he placed the frames erect on their
lower edge and exactly upon the three
ill
lines with ready lucy's assistance and
some broken branches he secured them
steady and upright and then proceeded
to roof them over with narrow slips 
wood bits paling which he had prepared
for this purpose these he nailed
across the top all the three arches
leaving intervals between the breadth
 each slip so that when the whole was
done lucy said that it looked something
like the model the roof a house
this day's work completed the centering
props wedges and all were prepared
for putting it up and going on with
the masonry there was no hindrance
from the stream the little rivulet now
sunk to insignificance ran so quietly down
its pebbly bed that lucy could scarcely
believe it to be the same which had roared
so loud and foamed so high and had done
such mischief in its fury
the masonwork harry's second
bridge went on more rapidly than that his
first his eye and hand having become more
expert in the builder's art he worked
and wondered at the work he made or
rather lucy wondered at it for him
how one improves by practice cried
she as she stood by looking on while the
arch was closing the key stone was in
before they left off work on the fourth day
and the triumphant finishing blow the
mallet given
but the work the arch only was
finished much remained to be done to
close up the hollow on each side the
bridge between it and the banks this
was to be filled in with stones and earth
down to the rocky foundation a heavy
job and heavily they felt it the three
days allowed them help from the headless
man or as lucy now in gratitude for
his services called him the handy man
were passed they averse left to themselves
and obliged to bring the stones and
the earth from a distance many yards
and up a height the handy man had
carried his barrow ofi and they had
only one wheelbarrow and a basket if
basket it could be called which was so
infirm that it let through continual
scribbling sand lucy however
mended this with a plaiting sea weed
and stuffings moss and refrained as
harry was busy from saying something
she could have said about the sieve the
dana'ides
when at last both gulfs were filled up
and well trampled and harry was spreading
gravel on the road over the bridge
lucy had time to rest for they had but
one shovel and while he shovelled away
she sat on a large mossy stone amusing
herself with observing a community 
ants whose dwellings had been disturbed
by the new works these emigrants were
toiling on in search new habitations
each with his white load in his forceps all
following the leader through the moss
and up the stone to them a rock perilous
height and scarcely practicable
ascent once when a wayworn ant had
just reached the summit a white polished
treacherous pebble intervened he raised
one half his body so as to be almost
perpendicular and wabbling about his
little head from side to side deliberated
which way he could go or whether he
could go at all on he went straight up
the slippery hill on the pinnacle the
white pebble another pinnacle arose 
sparkling mica whose projecting points
proved fatal striving to reach the first
 these he lost his balance he fell head
over heels if ants have heels and at the
bottom the hill lay on his back on the
sand for a moment helpless but the
next instant being an ant spirit ne
righted himself resumed his load and his
labour up the hill labour in vain this
time a treacherous rush more treacherous
than the pebble a springy green rush or
branch sedge hanging from above
tempted him to trust himself on its smooth
green side but
the wind fell a blowing and set it a going
and gave our dear joy a most terrible toss

lucy held out a helping finger and
raising him up placed him safely at once
upon the very pinnacle he had been so
long labouring to attain away he ran
as she hoped perfectly happy she was
particularly pleased with him for this 
because she had sometimes helped up ants
who had not seemed in the least obliged
to her for her assistance nor at all happier
for it but on the contrary by turning
back directly or not going the way she
wished had provokingly given her to understand
that they would rather have been
without her interference in spite however
 these incivilities and the little disgusts
they had at the moment excited her love for
the species had continued it had indd
commenced happily in early childhood at
the time when she and harry used to
watch them making their causeway and
by reading the travelled ant in
evenings at home it increased when
she read with her mother that entertaining
paper in the guardian well known to
young and old and it had been late renewed
with fresh interest by some curious
anecdotes which her mother had told her
from ruler's history the industrious
race
harry said she taking up her basket
again i feel quite rested i have
been very happy looking at these ants i
am sure this has rested me better than if i
had been the whole time yawning and
thinking nothing at all
pray can any body think nothing
at all said harry 
let every body answer for themselves
said lucy i think that i have
sometimes thought nothing at all but i
am not sure yes indeed i remember
saying to myself now i am thinking 
nothing 
but then my dear lucy said harry
your own very words prove you were not
thinking nothing
 how so said lucy
 you were thinking that you were
thinking nothing at all said harry
 i do not understand said lucy is
not that nonsense harry
 oh no my dear it is metaphysics
said harry
and what do you mean by metaphysics
my dear said lucy
it comes from two greek words said
harry
but i do not ask you where it comes
from said lucy but what you mean
by it
i said harry a little puzzled i
mean i am not sure i believe metaphysics
is the knowledge our oti
minds
but if we do not know our own
minds said lucy what is it the
knowledge will you tell me harry 
 i cannot tell you more said harry
i will look for metaphysics in the dictionary
when we have time but now let
us on with our bridge
ove however hairy
you may laugh but i assure you as i
stooped down to look at one them he
put up his head and looked at me and
see there is another coiling his tail
how curious i do not touch them nor
move any thing that touches them here
are my hands not even near their drawer
so that i cannot have loosed any springthat
could set them in motion but perhaps
opening the drawer did it
no but that is not a bad guess said
sir rupert
 think again lucy said hany and
you will find it out
 first let me look at this conjurer said
lucy pointing to a painted figure a
conjurer with a long beard and cap and
wand which she saw glimpses under
the serpents at the bottom the drawer 
 may i have him out sir said lucy
perhaps he may tell me something i have
a mind to consult him
do as you please said sir rupert 
 but i think you had better consult your
own sense
yes yes so i will said lucy i
am only in joke about the conjurer but i
just want to look at him because when
i have satisfied my curiosity about him i
shall think better about the serpents
as she spoke she cautiously began to
put her hand down through the midst 
them toward the bottom the drawer to
seize hold the conjurer but the serpents
all rearing their heads or tails immediately
she hastily withdrew her hand
i am afraid i shall do some miscliietv
said she
 no my dear said sir rupert smiling
 you will do no mischief to them and
they will do none to you there is no
danger
 danger oh no know that said
lucy but i think harry had better be
so good as to take him out for me
harry plunged in his hand and drew up
the conjurer by the beard there he is
for you said harry what good will
he do you 
it is only a coloured print on a paper
case now i see it in the light said lucy
may i open the case sir there seems
to be something in it
as sir rupert assented she opened it 
within the case she found a yellow paper
on which were what lucy called hieroglyphics
 and inside were a number little
fish about twice the length the motherofpearl
fish which are used as counters
at a cardtable but these were not 
d
motherofpearl they were some very
thin material thin as oiled paper or as
goldbeater's skin and somewhat that
colour as lucy looked close to see what
they were made they began to move
sir rupert took one by the tail out 
the paper and bidding lucy hold out her
hand he laid it flat upon the palm at
first it lay still but in a few seconds began
to heave and move its head and tail
like the serpent said lucy but
how or why they move i cannot conceive
because there is no room for any spring
or any mechanism harry withinside
there is no double skin he is quite
transparent i can see through him and
there is nothing in him how he writhes
about but what says the conjurer what
has he to do with it let me look at his
paper and try if i can make it out it is
not english copenhagen copenhagen
it is danish then
yes this conjurer and his fish were
brought to me from copenhagen by an
officer long ago before they became common
in this country and they afforded us
then much amusement trying the temperaments
and fortunes or at least the tempers
and understandings those who consulted
this conjurer and took his fish in hand
here is an english translation his advertisement
for you lucy
lucy read and learned that the conjurer
promised to tell the temperaments dispositions
characters and fortunes all manner
 men women and children by the
aid his fish mute but not still their
motions spoke a language which as he
boasted could never like the language 
men err or deceive and this language he
to a certain degree and in some general
points condescended to interpret for the
advantage all who consulted him and
purchased his hieroglyphic scroll opposite
to the hieroglyphics on this scroll
were the interpretations the different
motions the fishes heads and tails and
bodies also what was to be inferred from
their lying still and motionless
now i understand the directions and
let us try on ourselves said lucy hold
out your hand harry
she placed one the fish flat on his
palm and observing its motions which
were quick and sudden floundering vith
his tail she consulted her hieroglyphics
and found that harry was sanguine and
choleric fortunate in war
 that is not true i can answer for it
cried lucy as far as the choleric and
sanguine go now try mes
atrabilious and melancholia to die
 a broken heart if not taken in time
lucy let fall the fish while she laughed
and exclaimed what nonsense 
the fish fell into seme water which was
kept in the workshop for the use the
grindstone recovering from her laughter
she said that he was at last in his proper
element yet he did not seem to like it
his head and tail curling up met and he
lay with only the middle his side touching
the water as if he feared to go in
put him quite in said harry and
see what will happen
lucy pressed him down into the water
but not without his struggling however
when he was fairly in for it as she said
he ceased to flounder and lay perfectly
quiet
 now let us take him out and dry
him said harry and see what will
happen
harry dried one his sides and laid
him down in the sunshine
oh the poor fish cried lucy he
is just as the proverb says as uncomfortable
as a fish out water how he writhes
about i'll sprinkle a little water over
him
 stay let me dry him quite and that
will do as well you will see said harry 
he will lie quietly then though he is a
fish ont water
well try said lucy now he
does lie quiet indeed exactly as if he were
dead
but as she stooped closer to look at
him he seemed to revive and moved
again
as if he felt my breath cried lucy
 oh harry i see how it is row i
know it all
harry smiled
 you are right said sir rupert
and you knew it all the while harry
said lucy i was very stupid not to
think it before
you would have thought it said
harry but that you were so full the
conjuror
 but even now i do not know all
said lucy i suppose that the motions
 this fish depend on the changes
from wet to dry and that he curls and
incurs as my hair does and for the
same reason i have not forgotten
harry all you and papa explained tome
about the cause curling when
one side is wet and the other dry
when the pores are filled with moisture
on one side and not on the other i
understand that that was the case with
the fish when you dried him on one side
and left him wet on the other but 
vol iii n
cannot yet guess what substance he is
made
 think some those substances 
which you know hygrometers are made
said harry
 old whalebone hygrometer i remember
you said lucy you smile harry
it is whalebone but i never saw any
before so thin
very likely you never did said
harry but whalebone can be scraped
very thin as thin as this you see
it really is whalebone then and i
could make such a fish myself said
lucy if my head had not been so
full that foolish conjuror i might
have seen all that you observed harry
and then i should have found it out
too
i dare say that now you will find out
what the chinese serpents are made 
said sir rupert
they are hygrometers too then i
suppose said lucy hey harry what
can they be made do you know 
i am not sure but i believe i do
said harry
yes you are right said sir rupert
following the motion harry's eye
lucy turned and looked yet she saw
nothing as she said but dust under the
workbench and a box full old iron
and brass and hundreds things continued
she going towards it
you had better stop and think instead
 going into that box said harry look
back at the serpents and see what they are
like recollect all the substances which
you know would make good hygrometers
and then consider which is most like these
serpents
ivory cried lucy i remember you
told me that it has many pores and that it
makes a good hygrometer they must be
made ivory and now i know what
your eye turned to it was to that curled
shaving ivory which is lying on the
floor
sir rupert after some conversation with
harry about hygrometers asked him if he
had ever seen daniel's and when harry
n 
answered that lie had not sir rupert exclaimed
 let whoever is curious in hygrometers
follow me to the laboratory
harry followed instantly but lucy did
not she thought she had had enough hygrometers
 and she preferred going to divert
herself with a canary bird which she saw
hanging in its cage at the window the
housekeeper's room on the side the
court opposite to the laboratory this
bird could as the housekeeper told her
draw up water for itself in a little bucket
she saw this bucket it was about the
size a thimble it hung by a delicate
chain on the outside a sort projecting
o bow window in the cage the upper
 the chain was fastened to the bird's
foot and the bucket lay in a small reservoir
 water the manner in which the
bird drew it up was as the housekeeper
told lucy by taking the chain in his beak
and by placing his foot on each portion 
it as it was drawn up till the bucket was
as high as the little window where he
could drink
he disliked it seems the labour 
drawing water and never performed this
operation except when compelled by thirst
unluckily for lucy just before she arrived
he had drawn up a bucket full and having
satisfied his thirst he was now singing
away loud and shrill as if rejoicing in
having cast dull care behind him lucy
waited and waited she and the housekeeper
exhausted all their exhortations al
the endearing epithets in the language and
all their hemp seed in vain the canary
took all the bribes as fast as they were
offered and received all the compliments
seemingly in good part but no return
made he not that he did not understand
what return was expected the rogue
eyed the bucket askance as the housekeeper
held it up to him then straight he
turned his back upon her or upon it and
sang away pertinaciously with a louder
and a shriller note than before a full
quarter an hour was spent upon him
then lucy gave it up
what an obstinate or capricious little
creature it is said lucy she then went
to ask lady digby whether it hurt him to
draw up the bucket
lady digby said she believed it did not
hurt him though she could not be certain 
but she thought his unwillingness to perform
the operation might be accounted forby
recollecting the pain which he had
undergone in learning this feat it is said
that much cruelty is practised on birds
when young in teaching them this and
other accomplishments
 how happy lucy it is for some young
birds who are taught accomplishments
without pain
meantime as soon as sir rupert and
harry had returned to the laboratory sir
rupert said before i show you the new
hygrometer harry i must tell you that
in all those hygrometers which are made
 vegetable or animal substances and
which measure the moisture the air by
their expansion or contraction there is
one great source error they have no
standard point by which they may be
readily compared with each other the
great de saussure whom you will admire
still more for his random than for his
ingenuity foresaw and pointed out this
fault in his own hair hygrometer and the
celebrated humboldt who used both the
hair and the whalebone hygrometers complained
that he could never make their
results agree another philosopher calls
all the ordinary hygrometers mere toys 
but without going further it is enough
for you to know that from this cause all
those instruments are found to be insufficient
for ranking nice observations on the
atmosphere they have besides other
imperfections no two hairs are exactly
similar in elasticity whalebone is not only
very irregular but very slow in its expansion
 the wind disturbs their movements
and dust and oil in time clog the
pivots
 thank you sir said harry for
explaining to me the faults the old
ones
 now for the new one said sir rupert
 you have i dare say often observed
the dewy appearance on the outside
 a glass cold water when brought
into a warm room this dewy appearance
you know is the condensation the moisture
contained in the air and it was this
circumstance that first turned mr dan i ell's
thoughts to a new mode measuring the
pi'oportiojt they bear to each other with
the aid some hints which he candidly
acknowledges that he received from other
philosophers with whose names at least you
must be acquainted dalton and wollaston
he succeeded in making the ingenious instrument
which i will now show you
he placed before harry's eyes a bras
stand and pillar five or six inches in
height to the pillar was fixed a small
thermometer and from the top there hung
a glass tube each which was bent
down and terminated in a ball or globe 
thin glass one these globes was
covered with muslin and the other contained
a very delicate thermometer the bulb
 which was partly immersed in ether
 the first thing to tell you harry
said sir rupert is the purpose these
two thermometers the outside one on
the pillar shows the temperature the
air while the inside one marks the temperature
 the ether and therefore the
glass globe that contains it
now let us place it in this open window
 and when i wet the muslin covering
 the empty ball with a few drops 
ether you are to observe what takes place
on the other ball
it was what is called a very dry day
and after sir rupert had applied the ether
two or three times harry said that he saw
a slight film dew forming like a ring
round the uncovered ball
now harry said sir rupert mark
the height both thermometers
 you are aware he continued that
rapid evaporation produces cold and that
ether evaporates more rapidly than any other
fluid
harry was partly aware this yet he
was surprized by the instantaneous cold
n 
produced by a drop ether that sir rupert
let fall on the back his hand
 when i applied some ether to the
muslin said sir rupert the glass under
it was immediately cooled and the
condensation the vapour inside gradually
communicated the cold to the other
ball the degree cold there is shown
by the inside thermometer and the difference
between that and the temperature
 the external air at the moment the dew
is deposited on the glass is the measure
we want the moisture suspended in the
atmosphere
then i suppose sir said harry
 the drier the air the greater is the difference
between the thermometers for the
difference is fifteen degrees
you are right harry and i will endeavour
to explain to you how and why
when water is evaporated from the surface
 the earth it can only be supported
in the atmosphere by the influence heat
a decrease heat therefore condenses
some the watery vapour and when there
is a large proportion moisture in the
air a very small additional degree cold
precipitates it in the shape rain or dew
if that had been the case during our experiment
or in other words if it had been
just going to rain you would have seen
the film dew immediately follow the
application the ether to the covered
ball on the contrary when the air is
very dry a considerable increase cold
is requisite to make it part with its moisture
as you have found to be the case today
 the inside thermometer having fallen
fifteen degrees before the dew was deposited
on the ball
all we have to do then said harry
is to observe what additional degree 
cold is necessary to convert the vapour into
water and this is shown by the difference
 the two thermometers when the ring
 dew is formed
that degree cold said sir rupert
is called the point deposition or the
dewpoint and this hygrometer marks it
with great precision for an instrument
 daily use however i think it has
one inconvenience can you perceive what
it is harry 
harry after a few moments reflection
answered it is certainly an inconvenience
to be obliged to pour fresh ether on
the ball every time an observation is to be
made
that is what i meant said sir rupert
 but on the other hand in this very
ingenious instrument there is no unequal
stretching hair or whalebone no clogging
 the pivots with dust and the results
are certain as certain and as easily
compared with each other as the results 
the thermometer
after this explanation for which harry
was very thankful sir rupert advised him
to look at the inventor's own description
 the instrument in the quarterly journal
 science no 
but first said sir rupert let us go
out if you please this fine day and have
some exercise and some amusement remember
the bow must not be always
bent by the bye here are bows and arrows
and here is a little bow which edward
had when he was your age which
will just suit your sister lucy call her
and brinof her out with you to the bowling
green i will have the target set up for
sou
 an hour and a half is it possible
said lucy that we have been really an
hour and half here on this bowlinggreen

 exactly an hour and a half since first
i fixed an arrow in that bow and settled
it in your hand said harry for i happened
to look at the sundial just as i
went back to my place
we have been so very happy i said
lucy stretching out her arm to rest it
but now you seem to be rather tired
 your happiness said her father and
you had better stop before pleasure turns
into pain
 my arm only is tired papa said
lucy i am not the least tired myself
however i think we have had enough for
today and we can come back to it tomorrow
if tomorrow should be as fine as
today
in the mean time come with me to
the house said sir rupert this
way leads towards the old part the
castle i will turn you into a cool armoury
to rest yourselves and where perhaps you
may find fresh amusement in looking at
the bows and arrows former times
they followed joyfully to the armoury 
he showed them in the first place a bow
and arrows which had remained in this
castle family tradition failed to tell how
long but certainly since the days our
henrys and edwards when bowmen and
archers flourished and when bows and
arrows were not as now taken up as matters
 amusement by fine gentlemen and
ladies to win prizes at festive meetings
but employed as serious weapons in battles
and sieges sir rupert was going on to
show harry the crossbow such as was in
use and repute among our ancestors but
lucy's eye was caught by an indian bow
and arrow and he turned to take it down
for her it was stiff with rings dried
thongs leather which had been put on
the bow to commemorate each savage victory
obtained by the owner next to this
indian bow there hung another said to
have been brought from mexico at the time
when those poor people or unhappily for
them those too rich people were invaded
by the avaricious pizarro and when their
bows and arrows so ill defended them
against the firearms the spaniards
harry and lucy regretted the fate the
inoffensive mexicans and wished that they
had been possessed the ingenious invention
 firearms for their just defence
sir rupert went back to the crossbow
and showed harry how it was constructed
and used the stock was made wood
neatly inlaid with bone and ornamented
with tassels but the bow was steel and
so stiff that harry's utmost efforts could
scarcely bend it sir rupert told him that
no person had sufficient strength to drawback
the string into its place without some
mechanical assistance and desired him to
examine the bow carefully harry observed
a long iron lever the which
turned upon a pin in the middle the
stock to this lever a little jointed arm
was attached which terminated in a kind
 hook that seemed to invite the string 
he slipped the string over the hook and
pulling round the outer the lever
down to the butt the stock he
easily accomplished the bending the
bow sir rupert then showed them the
trigger or serpeiit'we as he said it was
formerly called by which the string was
released and the arrow or ball projected
harry was surprised to hear him mention
balls still more when he was told
that balls both lead and stone were used
sir rupert showed them also various kinds
 darts and arrows one which to lucy's
great amusement he called a quarrel he
explained to her however that the termwas
derived from the old french word
quarreaii on account its square head
 iron crossbows and quarrels sir
rupert added were much used in the time
 henry the second they were great
effect in his wars in ireland and assisted
much in his conquest the irish who
possessed no such weapons
in this armoury were many the warlike
instruments and armour used in ancient
times by the english sir rupert showed
harry the helmet the vizor and the lance 
and explained to him how the lance stood in
the rest when the knight was on horseback
 and he showed him all the parts 
the knights armour with which he cased
himself and his horse in iron so that as
honores he and his steed could hold together
they were almost invulnerable till
the lance was wrested from his hand or
his foot ousted from the stirrup the
united weight man and horse or their
joint momentum was great consequence
as the heavier they were the greater the
shock with which they came against their

adversary horse to horse and man to man
harry and lucy were glad to know the
exact appearance all these things 
which they had read in history as being
used not only in battles but in the just
and tournaments former days
lucy enjoyed them from the recollection
they brought to her mind many passages
in poetry and from the pleasure she
always felt in whatever filled her imagination

harry's mechanical taste was gratified
by examining the ancient coat mail or
hauberk consisting small steel rings
linked together or interwoven in the manner
that some ingenious purses steel
rings are made at this day
after harry had satisfied his curiosity
sir rupert took him on to those later inventions
which made no avail helm
and hauberk's twisted mail he showed
him some the first rude attempts at firearms
 the arquebuse or long gun described
by froissart used with a rest upon
which it was supported and with a sort 
shelterpiece to protect the match from
wet and wind between this first clumsy
attempt to execute that grand invention
and the perfected wanton's and forth's
guns our own times various improvements
were made some which sir rupert explained
to harry lucy whose curiosity
was not only satisfied but satiated went
off to seek for amusement and information
more interesting to her in the garden and
the conservatory with her mother and
lady digby indefatigably kind sir rupert
ended by finding froissart for harry
in the library and unfolding for him those
delightfully entertaining old prints where
the battles poictiers and cressy are
represented so happily though in defiance
 all the laws perspective
after speaking the wonderful change
which the introduction firearms produced
in the world and the astonishment
which their first appearance created
among civilized and uncivilized nations in
europe and america sir rupert related
to harry an account which he had just
read in a new travels a people
by whom the power firearms has been
even recently defied
 between the nile and the desert said
sir rupert there is a narrow strip 
cultivated land which in some places is
not more than half a mile in breadth but
which stretches hundreds miles in length
this strip land was inhabited by various
independent tribes till within the last three
or four years when a despotic turkish
pasha the name mahomet ali
resolved to send a large army under the
command his son ismael to subdue
them ismael's progress was unresisted
till he came to one warlike tribe who
with equal courage and patriotism defied
the invader he may drive us to the
gates the world but we will never submit
was the answer they sent to his
threats
brave people cried harry i
hope they drove him back again
 they were heard shouting from their
encampment continued sirrupert you
may come against us from the north and
from the east and from the west but we
will never submit they knew that the
pacha had firearms they had none 
but they put their trust in the weapons and
shields to which they had been accustomed
and in their own courage their
shields hippopotamus or crocodile
skin covered the head and the breast
their weapons were swords and lances
and their sorcerers assured them that their
shields and themselves should be rendered
by magic invulnerable to masque balls
bravely they came out to give him
battle and advanced boldly at first but
when the vollies musketry began to
play and when they found that in spite 
their promised invulnerability many fell
wounded and killed a panic seized them
and they fled after this first defeat however
they entrenched themselves in their
mountains their courage revived and
again they sent forth shouts defiance
bidding the pacha to come if he dared
but ismael had learned to respect their
bravery he had once already been surprised
and almost defeated by the black
horsemen the desert and he therefore
prudently resolved to attack them with a
heavy fire shot and shells one these
shells fell amongst them and as it was
rolling and bounding along these poor
ignorant people gathered round it admiring
and amused by its motions but
when it burst and spread destruction round
it they cried out the evil spirits are
come against us and are too mighty for us
the superstition that had at first given
them confidence now only increased their
despair and abandoning their strongholds
they set off in full flight their
patriotism expiring with their liberties
afterwards they bargained for their wretched
lives and were contented to join as his
soldier slaves the army their conqueror
as sir rupert concluded harry groaned
was this said he the their
glorious you may drive us to the gates
 the world but we will never submit
even so harry so little dependence
can there be on mere animal ignorant
courage thatbraves the danger which
it does not know the nature or extent
the glass doors at one the library
leading into the conservatory were half
open and now that harry's attention was
no longer engaged he observed a gale 
fragrance like the smell fresh hay or
 that grass which gives to fresh hay its
pleasant odour anthoxanthum odoratum
a second waft however decided that it
was from lady digby's favourite plant
the heliotrope innumerable pots which
the skilful old gardener contrived to force
into premature flower and perfume so as to
have a constant succession for her ladyship's
conservatory he heard lucy's voice too 
and though he was not as he used to say
 himself a great greenhouse merchant
he now went in there and found
lady digby showing some plants which
had been lately sent to her from north
carolina by a kind american lady there
was one which is rather uncommon in
these countries as it is so delicate that
without care it seldom survives a winter in
our climates it is something the
nature the sensitive plant the inside
 the leaf is thickly set with bristly hairs
like thorns or like many little sharp teeth
as soon as lucy saw this plant she took
up a straw and drew it along the division
or middle rib one its leaves and
immediately the two sides the leaf folded
up and the prickly teeth closed together
so as to hold fast the straw
i see it is the plant i thought said
lucy venus's flytrap is not it
 yes dioncba muscular said lady
digby have you seen one before 
no lucy had never seen one but she
knew it she said from having read a
description it the gardener by this
time had caught a fly which he bad
been in search on the window for sometime
 for flies were few and rare at this
season and holding his struggling prisoner
by the two wings he was going to
set him upon one the leaves that the
young lady as he said might see what
would happen but lucy stopped his hand
she knew what would happen that
the moment the fly touched the leaf the
teeth would close upon it as they had
closed on the straw and squeeze it to
death the old gardener immediately
complied with lucy's entreaties to release
the poor fly and lucy observed to him
that there was the less occasion for this
experiment as the many dead flies showed
how well some the leaves had performed
their cruel office but i really think
she said that those flykilling leaves are
larger and greener than the rest
the gardener answered that he had
often remarked the same thing and though
some folk said that they were fattened and
nourished by the dead flies for his part
he thought it just as likely that it was because
the healthy and vigorous leaves had
a greater power shutting close and
crushing the flies but added he with
vol iii o
due philosophic caution i can't take
upon me to decide
harr admired the ingenious mechanical
structure this flytrap and began to
say that it reminded him something
which he had seen elsewhere when lucy
smiled and said i know what you are
going to say harry and you are quite
right you mean the plant called the flycatcher
 a sort arum which smells as
you said harry like a dead horse and
there is another plant in which mamma
showed me the same sort contrivance
continued lucy but i cannot recollect
its long latin name i remember
that papa lent me a magnifying glass to
look at the dead flies lying at the bottom
 its flowers some were held by the
proboscis and some by the legs this
plant is called in english i believe dog'sbane
was not this what you were thinking
 harry 
no i was not thinking any plant
said harry i was thinking a machine
a sort trap which catches rats in the
manner that this catches flies
lucy was a little scandalized by this
inelegant comparison
 the flytrap venus compared to a
rattrap but on harry's appeal to his
father it was allowed to be just as far as
mechanics go
the gardener thought it was now his
turn to get in a few words in praise the
strength and healthiness his dionaea
it had been sent over from carolina in
sods its native earth which still remained
in a box to which he pointed
there were more plants in it said he 
but they have died so i shall empty
out the sods now for they are a disfigurement
here
harry said it would be a pity to throw
this earth away for he recollected having
heard that when the boxes plants
which peruse in his voyage round the
world sent home to france were opened
the plants and shrubs in some were dead
yet the gardener did not throw away the
o 
earth but preserved it carefully because
he thought it might contain the seeds 
some sorts plants unknown perhaps in
these countries and so it proved
lady digby upon hearing this circumstance
desired her gardener to put the
american earth into small pots and to
place them in a hot bed if it should
produce any plants that are worth your
acceptance harry said she you to
whom shall owe them shall share them
with me
mayhap master you might not know
what this is said the gardener opening
another little box and putting into his
hands a small bundle what seemed to
harry to be black horsehair
 is it horsehair said harry
 it is horsehair said lucy
no miss no master though i took
it myself for that at first unpacking
lucy pulled a bit it out and after
feeling said it feels like horsehair
crisp and springy and it looks so like it that
i can hardly believe it is not horsehair
 never was on a horse's back miss
nor ever belonged to any animal
is it animal or vegetable said lucy
that was soon settled by harry's running
back to the library and burning a bit
 it the remains he held to lucy's nose
and its smell convinced her that which
her eyes had failed to discover that it was
neither horsehair nor any animal substance
 then it is a vegetable what
can it be 
 and what do you think this can be
miss said the gardener putting into her
hand another little bundle something
which harry said looked like ends white
coarse thread such as he had seen in a
taylor's shop and which he had heard
called thrums lucy agreed that it was
like tangled housewife's thread but on a
nearer view she who was more knowing
in housewifery than harry pronounced that
it certainly was not thread looking at
what harry drew out and called a needlefull
she observed sundry little short filaments
or stalks and at the some 
them were little knobs which on further
examination were evidently the remains 
very small flowers she pronounced it
therefore to be a vegetable and she was
surprised to hear that both this and what
she had called black horsehair were one
and the same thing only in different states
i will if you please said lady digby
read to you the account that i received
from the american friend who sent them
to me
she returned to the library to look for
the letter in her writingdesk and harry
and lucy stuck close to her much afraid
that the letter might not be forthcoming 
but she found it and read as follows 
 the foliage several trees here
near wilmington in north carolina
has in some situations a singular appearance
a sort long grey moss suspends
itself from the branches and waving
in the wind gives the trees a hoary and
to me not uninteresting appearance when
stripped its external coat this moss
nearly resembles horsehair it is 

elected for that purpose in large quantities
and buried in marshy spots and when the
outer coat peels off the inner part is dried
and cleaned and makes excellent mattresses

lucy's mother observed that the outer
coat flax is destroyed in the same way
by steeping it in water
lucy inquired whether this kind horsehair
moss as she called it had any name 
and whether it was known in england or
was a new discovery sir rupert digby
told her that though he had never before
seen this extraordinarily fibrous species yet
he was aware that the genus or family 
plants to which it belonged had been well
known to linnaeus who had given it a
singular name from a singular circumstance

it will make me remember the singular
name said lucy if you will be
so good as to tell me the singular circumstance

 you must know then said sir rupert
 that among the early botanists sweden
there was a certain doctor who having in
his youth had an unfavourable voyage by
water from abo where he lived to stockholm
made a vow the moment he set his
foot on dry land that he would never again
venture himself upon the sea he kept
this vow so scrupulously that when he was
to return home he took a roundabout
journey several hundred miles to avoid
a passage a few hours by water his
hatred water and his love the dry
land rose to such a pitch that he laid
aside his family name to take that tillands
which in swedish means on land
you think perhaps and so do i that this
doctor made a rash vow and did not in all
this show much sense but a man maybe
weak in some things and wise in others
he was wise in botany and made an excellent
catalogue all the wild plants in
the neighbourhood his residence in
honour which and the whimsical
name he had adopted linnaeus gave the
name tillandsia to this genus plants
as they are remarkable for their dislike 
water lucy do you think you will now
be able to remember the nametillandsia
i think i am sure i shall said
lucy
sir rupert further told lucy that one
 the most severe censors linnaeus had
been so much pleased with the happy
choice this name that he declared he
would excuse in linnaeus a thousand
faults for that fact alone
lady digby said her american friend
had been so obliging as to send many
other curious things in the box besides
the specimen this moss among
others i am sure lucy you will like to
see some pods cotton in their different
stages ripening my friend tells me
that they grow on a bush from two to four
feet high and that the flower is a delicate
straw colour i dare say you may
have seen an engraving it
i think i have said lucy bui
oh lady digby before you shut the box
will you give me leave to look at that
green leaf if it is a leaf 
you do well to say if it is a leaf
answered lady digby do you know
what it is 
 is it the creeping leafy said lucy
no answered lady digby it
much resembles the creepingleaf or mantis
strumaria but this is a different insect
by the country people in america it is
called the candid from the sound its
chirping resembling the frequent repetition
 candid candid
lucy examined this insect more closely
it was about the size a roseleaf the
pale green colour the inside a pea
pod and apparently that smooth texture
 but upon looking at it with a magnifying
glass lucy saw that what had
appeared like the veins a leaf were the
ribs or sinews the wings and in the
intermediate spaces which had to the
naked eye appeared perfectly smooth she
now saw embossed innumerable little
spots looking like shagreen
now i see the animal's head where
the footstalk the leaf seemed to be and
its eyes nose and mouth cried lucy
 pray look harry its head and face
are like a horse's head and face in body
clothes look at its protuberant bladderlooking
eye the mouth however is like
a pig's or the antbear's and round its
neck it has a curious worked pelerine
standing up like the leather hood on the
collar a waggon horse but what
curious thing is that lying loose in the box
with its green longjointed storklike legs 
what do they belong to 
before her question could be answered
her rambling eye fixed with delight and
curiosity on a plant which hung flaunting
from the top the conservatory she
asked where its roots were how it was
nourished or whether it lived on air
ladydigby answered that it was reputed
to live on air as its name jos aris or
the airplant shows and that probably it
derives its nourishment from the moisture
in the air however this may be in
its native country it thrives much better
here if planted in a little light earth or
even in wet moss as you may perceive
by comparing it with the other specimens
which you see twined round that
pillar and which are all planted in pots
this plant nevertheless has been hanging
where you see it for four months and
though it requires a much greater heat it is
quite alive it is frequently watered and i
want to try how long it will live in that situation
but continued lady digby if
you my dear lucy who are so active and
obliging will run up stairs to the little
turret within my room you will find a
 with many paper marks in it on my
desk bring it down to me and it will
tell you something more about this curious
plant
lucy vanished and reappeared bearing
in her hand the proof her swift errand
this is a favourite mine and
 my son edward's all these marks he
put in for my edification i was no botanist
but he and this little volume together
have made me fond what appears to me
the most interesting and rational part the
study that which opens to our view the
curious and useful structure plants and
the progress vegetation i like this
 for another reason continued lady
digby turning to lucy's mother which
makes me rejoice that it pleases young
people without any ostentation religious
sentiment it really inspires it in the
best and happiest manner here is the
account the jos aeris continued lady
diobv will you read it to us it is
very short
lucy read there is one species 
the epidendrum family the jos aris a
native india that deserves to be particularly
distinguished it is so called because
it grows and blossoms when suspended
in the air and we are assured
that hanging from the ceiling a room
it will vegetate for years it is likewise
said to be remarkably reviving to the inhabitants
by the fine odour its blossoms

that fact said lucy's father its
hanging from the ceiling a room and
vegetating for a length time in that
manner is mentioned if i recollect rightly
in one sir william jones's letters written
when he was in india he says the
flos aris was at that instant suspended
over his head that he had tied its rootless
branches to the beams the roof and
he speaks with delight the charming
fragrance the blossoms
and now said sir rupert pray
may i ask i have been very patient while
you ladies have had the to yourselves
with three pairs hands upon it
at once may i ask the name this favourite
 if name it have for hitherto
i have heard it called only it or the 
or my favourite has it a name
it has a name answered lady 
 and a name that will be well known
to fame in due time dialogues on botany


next morning after breakfast an express
came from the housekeeper's room to inform
lucy that the canarybird was beginning
to draw up his bucket downstairs
she ran immediately and after her
followed harry
the thirsty little fellow nowe working for
his own interest and with his own goodwill
soon performed his task and earned
his thimblefull duly raised when lifted
to the proper height he held it by keeping
the collected chain fast under one foot
then he dipped shook his beak and
dipped and shook again much to his own
delight and to that the spectators
when he had fully satisfied his thirst he
began to favour the company with a sono 
but his notes even when joy tuned his
throat were so loud and shrill that his
mistress the housekeeper soon threw a
white handkerchief over the top his
cage to reduce him to silence so that as
she said she might hear somebody speak
besides him
lady digby who had followed lucy
to see her friend the canarybird perform
its little exercises confirmed lucy's hopes
that birds may be taught by gentle methods
when young many those feats
which are generally acquired by the infliction
 so many tortures she had
when abroad as she told lucy known
a german musicmaster who was very fond
 birds and who was most expert in
teaching them he assured her that he
had himself instructed a bullfinch which he
would venture to say was as accomplished
as any its kind in all germany where
these birds are chiefly born and bred and
he had never used hot knitting needle or
any other instrument torture in its education
 only soft words and sometimes he
acknowledged a little wholesome fasting
lady digby recollected that this judicious
birdfancier or birdinstructor further
told her that he always taught his
pupil at the dead still hour midnight
or when all the rest the family were
asleep and when there was nothing to
distract the bird's attention then he
would play tunes for him on the violin
the bullfinch seemed to take no notice
and never attempted at the time to follow
him but the next day he would practise by
himself and at last bring out the tune he
had heard at night
lucy's attention was now called off to
a basket lavender which a maid at this
instant brought into the room the housekeeper
was going to make her annual store
 lavenderwater the still was ready
and lucy wished to see the operation 
distilling but harry whispered his advice
to her to wait and see it performed in the
laboratory looking out the window to
the other side the court he observed that
the iron door was open which was a sign
that sir rupert was in the laboratory and
on this hint lucy immediately ran therewith
harry and found sir rupert and
their father
fortunately for lucy sir rupert wanted
for the experiment he was then trying to
have some water that should be perfectly
pure that is quite free from all mixture
 earth or salts or other substances and
for which purpose it was to be distilled
this was a simple process which lucy
could understand sir rupert had just
prepared his alembic the apparatus usually
employed in distillation for chemical purposes
it was a pearshaped glass vessel
into which the liquor to be distilled was
put a lamp was placed underneath by
the heat which the liquor was made
to boil and the vapour that rose was condensed
in the cover which was a conicalshaped
cap metal with a beak or spout
that sloped downwards into another vessel
called the received
these drops said sir rupert which
you see running ois from the beak are
collected in the receiver and the liquor
thus collected is said to be distilled
all distillation is performed upon this principle
though the apparatus is different
for different purposes and sometimes made
 copper
i have heard a worm used in a still
what is that said lucy
the worm is a spiral tube so called
from its resembling the form a worm 
its use in the still is the same as that 
the cap over this alembic to condense the
hot vapour
lucy asked why the worm was used
instead the cap 
 because said sir rupert it exposes
more cold surface to the vapour
suppose the whole pipe to be unwound
and laid open you would then perceive
what a large surface there would be besides
which the colder the worm is kept
the quicker the condensation proceeds 
and a worm or a long pipe coiled up is
very conveniently placed in a vessel 
cold water which may be changed whenever
it becomes warmed by the hot vapour
that communicates its heat to the metal
worm
 i understand it now thank you sir
said lucy
she perceived that in fact though the
apparatus was different the thing done
was no more than what she had formerly
seen when she was six years old when the
cold plate was held over the vapour 
boiling water that issued from the top 
the tea urn she recollected something 
the account distillation and sublimation
in conversations on chemistry and
searching for the in the library she
refreshed her memory by reading the passages
over again at this moment when she
had the advantage seeing the real
things and perhaps seeing the experiments
tried
she there found that sublimation is the
name given to the process distillation
when applied to solid substances
sublimation a sandbath flowers 
sulphur she repeated wishing earnestly
that she could see all these things
sir rupert said that as the sandbath
was now heated over his little stove for
his own experiments he could easily gratify
her curiosity if she pleased he would
however instead flowers sulphur let
her see flowers benzoin
he put into her hand a small lump 
a brownish substance which he told her
was benzoin and that it was a res'm or
more properly a balsam obtained from
certain trees which grow in the east indies
chiefly in the island sumatra from
this substance flowers benzoin are obtained
by sublimation in the same manner
as flowers sulphur are produced lucy
watched the process
the benzoin was put into the glass
alembic which was placed in the sandbath
and this she saw was merely a castiron
vessel containing a quantity sand
sir rupert explained to her that the heat
was more uniform and could be better regulated
by means the hot sand and
that there was less danger to the glass
than if it were exposed to the direct heat
 the fire he told her also that chemists
make much use a bath boilinor water 
and that in some arts tempering certain
kinds springs for instance workmen
use baths melted lead or tin or some
other fusible substance because the exact
temperature at which these metals melt
being known the proper heat may be applied
with the greatest precision
in a short time the benzoin began to
swell the resinous parts and other impurities
with which it had been combined
remained at the bottom the alembic
but the volatile parts flew off and were
condensed by the cold cap these were
the flowers and were different from what
lucy expected to see they were more
like flakes snow than any thing else to
which she could compare them while
she was looking at them harry ran out
into the yard to the gardener's boy whom
he saw coming in from the garden with a
basket herbs on his arm from his
basket harry plucked a sprig rosemary
and returning without letting lucy see
what he had in his hand he sprinkled it
over with flowers benzoin and then held
it before her eves
 it looks exactly as if it were covered
with hoar frost cried lucy howbeautiful
 i shall never forget this harry
but here are the horses coming out for
sir rupert and papa to ride and so there
is an all things at least in the laboratory
for this day
battledore and shuttlecock was kept up
one rainy morning by harry and lucy 
believe it who may boast as much who
can two thousand three hundred and
twentyfour times they had also many
a game ninepins in the great hall
where prolonged by its echoes was often
heard the heart's light laugh at the fall 
the merry men all
but all these the promised joys 
castle each proving greater in the enjoyment
than the promise were exceeded
by the delights the workshop and laboratory
every morning they watched for
the moment when sir rupert moved towards
the iron door avicenna never
watched more anxiously the famous library
door that opened but once a year
one morning lucy observed a shallow
drawer on the table between her father
and sir rupert and in this she saw some
things which she thought might be very
useful to harry the drawer contained
many lenses telescopes and glasses 
different sizes some as large as that 
harry's camera obscura which had been
so unfortunately broken it occurred to
lucy that the loss might now be repaired
she waited till sir rupert was not busy
and then she asked him whether these
glasses were very precious too precious to
part with or whether she might beg one
for harry sir rupert said that they
were precious to him because he was repeating
some beautiful experiments dr
brewster's and mr herschel's on the magnifying
powers telescopes but he desired
to know which lucy wished for as possibly
that one might be spared
she looked at the variety that lay before
her but which them she wanted she
could not tell it was in vain to consult
her father's eye it never moved sir
rupert stood by with his goodnatured
smile waiting her decision but without
giving any direction to her choice
 if i could but recollect exactly the
shape the old glass in harris's camera
obscura said lucy what i want is a
glass that magnifies that i am sure
these which are convex magnify i believe
but continued she after having looked
through several them at a word which
was written in small characters on the front
 the drawer i find that some these
glasses magnify much more than others 
and another thing i perceive that as i
move each glass nearer or further there
is one particular distance at which
the object appears distinct but that the
distances are quite different for different
glasses i recollect hearing you papa
telling harry something about the focal
distance but i had better not say anything
about that as i do not understand
it i cannot tell which these convex
glasses will suit the camera obscura
vol iii p
however i know the sort that i want
should be convex
 very well my dear said sir rupert
that is indeed all that you can tell or
that can be known without trial you
shall therefore take several these convex
lenses home with you and harry by trial
can determine which will best answer your
purpose
lucy was very much obliged to sir
rupert and delighted that through her
means her brother's camera obscura was
likely to be mended but now that her
curiosity was excited she wished to know
more
 why papa do convex glasses magnify
and concave glasses diminish i
wish i knew i wish i could understand
the camera obscura mamma says that
camera obscura is italian for dark chamber

 so far so good for the name said
her father but in this case the name
tells us nothing the nature the thing
 yet papa said lucy the first
time you showed harry and me a camera
obscura it was in a large dark
room
 was it quite dark said her father
not quite the shutters were all
closed but there was a little hole in one
 them through which the rays light
came we saw images things very
faintly upon a white sheet which you
had hung up opposite to the hole what
we saw was a sort coloured shadowy
picture the landscape that was outside
 the window and i remember that all
the images were upside down
true said her father you observed
that it was very faint and indistinct
did it remain so
oh no papa it became afterwards
quite distinct and almost as bright as the
natural colours the trees and orass and
we saw the figures people as they
walked past in a field at a little distance
from the window i saw the colour 
the women's red cloaks and their faces
quite plainly and the figures were not upside
down as before
and what made these differences
asked her father
it was a glass a lens you called it
which you put into that hole in the 
just the same way as the
glass makes the landscape appear brighter
on the paper in harry's portable camera
obscura
 do you recollect how or why the lens
produced this effect said her father
no papa not exactly harry explained
to me afterwards something about
it but he could not tell me all he said
he did not know all then
all no indeed said harry not
tien nor now
tell us all you remember if you remember
any thing what he did explain
said her father
 first he told me said lucy why
we see the shapes and colours things
he said it was by the rays light which
come from them
come from them how said her
father do you mean come out 
them
no papa but the rays light go
from the sun and strike upon objects and
then come from them to our eyes or as
people express it are reflected by those
objects harry next told me something
which i thought i understood at the time
but i am not sure that i can explain it
 try said sir rupert
harry showed me in a an engraving
 an eye with lines representing
the rays light coming from all parts 
an object and meeting in an angle at the
eye he told me that objects appear tous
great or small according to the size 
that angle next he told me that our eye
is in some way like a camera obscura
there is a little hole in the middle
through which the rays light pass as
they passed through the little hole in the
windowshutter into the dark room and
after having crossed each other they make
a small picture the object i do not
know where exactly somewhere at the
back the eye i believe and upside
down as we saw the objects at first on the
white sheet but in the eye these pictures
must be extremely small something more
harry said about a part the eye which
he called the crystalline humour and
about the rays light being bent as they
pass through it which i think he called
being refracted but which i did not understand
at all
sir rupert observed that lucy did well
not to attempt to go farther than she knew
clearly there is hope he said teaching
any thing to those who perceive and
acknowledge when they do not clearly understand
and who are not satisfied with
confused notions lucy was glad to hear
sir rupert say to harry that his little
pupil did him credit and that she was not
like little conceited misses who instead 
wishing to learn in order to improve desire
only to display a smattering knowledge

i am glad my dear lucy added her
father that your curiosity has been raised
on these subjects but we cannot at present
assist you further only keep what
you have steadily in your mind and from
that you may go on hereafter with
harry's help assisted by his favourite 
 scientific dialogues and with your own
attention you may learn what you desire
but not all at once you must not expect
to learn optics in one morning

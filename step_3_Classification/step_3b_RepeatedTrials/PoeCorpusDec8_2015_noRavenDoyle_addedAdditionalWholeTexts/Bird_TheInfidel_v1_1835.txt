the infidel




chapter i


the traveller who wanders at the present day along the northern and
eastern borders of the lake of tezcuco searches in vain for those
monuments of aboriginal grandeur which surrounded it in the age of
montezuma the lake itself which not so much from the saltness of its
flood as from the vastness of its expanse was called by cortes the sea
of anahuac is no longer worthy of the name the labours of that unhappy
race of men whose bondage the famous conquistador cemented in the blood
of their forefathers have conducted through the bowels of a mountain
the waters of its great tributaries the pools of san cristobal and
zumpango and these rushing down the channel of the tula or river of
montezuma and mingled with the surges of the great gulf support fleets
of modern argosies instead of piraguas and chinampas and expend upon
foundering ships-of-war the wrath which in their ancient beds was
wasted upon reeds and bulrushes with the waters which rippled through
their streets have vanished the numberless towns and cities that once
beautified the margin of the alpine sea the towers have fallen the
lofty pyramids melted into earth or air and the palaces and tombs of
kings will be looked for in vain under tangled copses of thistle and
prickly-pear

the royal city of tezcuco is now though the capital of a republican
state a mean and insignificant village it was originally the
metropolis of a kingdom once more ancient and powerful than that of
mexico and which when it had shared the fate of all others within the
bounds of anahuac and acknowledged the sway of the island kings still
preserved the reputed and perhaps the real possession of superior
civilization its princes in becoming the feudatories became also the
electors of mexico and thus added dignity to an independence which was
only nominal the polished character of these barbarous chieftains as
the world has been taught to esteem them may be better understood when
we know that they sowed the roadside with corn for the sustenance of
travellers and the protection of husbandmen built hospitals and
observatories endowed colleges and formed associations of literature
and science in which to compare small things with great as in the
learned societies of modern europe and america encouragement was given
to the study of history poetry music painting astronomy and natural
magic the various mechanical trades were divided into corporate bodies
and assigned each to some particular quarter of the city courts and
councils were regularly established and the laws which they dispensed
digested into uniform and written codes some of which are still
preserved the kings of tezcuco themselves mingled in the generous
rivalries which they fomented there are still in existence at least
in the form of translation several of the odes of nezahualcojotl a
royal tezcucan poet and his hymns to the creator composed half a
century before the advent of the spaniards were admired and chanted by
the conquerors until devoted by misjudging and fanatical missionaries
to the flames which consumed the written histories and laws of the
kingdom as well as the idolatrous rituals of the priests with which
last the others were unfortunately confounded

footnote these poems we presume were handed down orally we know
not how far the picture-writing of the mexicans the art of interpreting
which appears to be now lost was capable of conveying any such
thoughts as could not be represented by an absolute portrait no
system of writing that is not essentially phonetic or dialectical
i e representative of sounds or of language can be made to express
abstract ideas which may be defined to be such as admit of no
ideographic or metaphoric representation if they could mankind might
at once enjoy the benefits of the universal language or to speak
strictly a substitute for it for it would convey ideas not words
which leibnitz dreamed of and bishop wilkins and many others after
him so vainly attempted to construct

when therefore we relate any very curious and marvellous matters
appertaining to mexican literature though we speak upon the authority
of historians we invite the reader to receive our accounts with some
grains of allowance with the exception of a few arbitrary symbols
expressive of numerals and a few other objects of constant recurrence
the picture-writing of mexico spoke in ideas not words and it may
therefore be assumed that it could express nothing that did not or by
a stretch of ingenuity could not be made to address and explain itself
to the eye

a few ruins a cluster of dilapidated houses a galloping creole on his
high spanish saddle with glittering manga and rattling
anquera and now and then an indian skulking moodily along in his
squalid serape are all that remain of tezcuco

footnote the manga and serape are mexican cloaks worn
scapulary-wise the one of richly embroidered cloth the other of
blanket or some such coarse material the anquera is a leather housing
embossed and gilt with a jingling fringe of brass or silver ornaments

in the spring of the year that followed the flight of the
spaniards from mexico the city of the acolhuacanese presented all its
grandeur of aspect and to the eye looked full as royal and
imperishable as in the best days of its freedom but the molewarp was
digging at its foundations and the cloud which had ravaged the mexican
valley and then passed away into the east where it lay for a time
still and small like to a man's hand had again crept over the
mountain barriers to its gates and was now brooding among its
sanctuaries a group of christian men sat under a cypress-tree without
the walls regarding the great pyramid on whose lofty terrace
overshadowing the surrounding edifices floated a crimson banner of
velvet and gold on which besides the royal arms of spain was
emblazoned as on the labarum of the constantines a white cross with
the legend imitated from that famous standard of fanaticism in hoc
signo vincemus if other proof had been wanting of the return of the
spaniards to the scene of their discomfiture their presence in tezcuco
and their unchangeable resolution to complete the work of conquest so
disastrously begun it might have been traced abundantly in the strange
spectacle which equally with the desecrated temple divided the
attention of the group of castilians at the cypress-tree they sat on a
little swell of earth a natural mound which jutted into the lake
whose waters agitated by a western breeze dashed in musical breakers
at its base while the rustling of the leaves above mingled with these
sounds of waves a tone that was both melancholy and harmonious the
beautiful prospect of tezcuco rising beyond fertile meadows in the
livery of spring flanked on the right hand by a sheet of dark and
glossy water with white towers turrets and temple-tops painted as
it seemed on a background of mountains of the purest azure was enough
of itself to engross the admiration of a looker-on had there not been
presented hard by a scene still more singular and romantic

a train of warriors artificers and labourers the latter bending under
such burthens as had never before descended to the verge of tezcuco was
seen passing at a little distance towards the city into which as was
denoted by a sudden explosion of artillery and the blast of trumpets on
the top of the pyramid the leaders were just entering while the rear
of the procession extending for miles and winding like some mighty
snake over hill and meadow was lost among distant forests

the martial salutation from the town was answered by the whole train
with a yell filling the air and causing the distant hills and lakes to
tremble with the reverberation in this the ear might detect besides
the war-cry of indians tlascala tlascala the not less piercing
shouts of spaniards in the name of god and santiago as well as the
flourish of bugles scattered at intervals among the train if the broad
sea of anahuac trembled at the sound it was with good reason for the
clamour of triumph indicated the approach of those unknown naval
engines which were to plough its undefiled bosom and convert every
billow into the vassal of the stranger on the shoulders of eight
thousand tlascalans were borne the materials for the construction of
thirteen brigantines with which the unconquerable spaniard capable of
every expedient meditated the complete investment and the certain
reduction of tenochtitlan the iron the sails and cordage of that
fleet which he had caused to be broken up and sunk in the harbour of
vera cruz were added to planks spars and timbers from the sierras of
tlascala and to pitch and rosin from the pinales or pine-forests of
huexotzinco a gloomy and broken desert notorious in the present day
as the haunt of bandits the most brutal and merciless in the world

the brawny carriers of these massive materials were protected on the
front and in the rear by legions of their countrymen armed after
their wild and romantic way and clad in tunics of cotton or maguey
cloth with tiaras of feathers who passed by in successive bodies of
spearmen archers slingers and swordsmen arranged and divided in the
manner of their christian confederates besides these guards of front
and rear of whom the historian herrera asserts there were 
while even the modest clavigero computes their numbers at full one-sixth
of this vast host there were on either flank bodies of picked
warriors marching in company with small bands of spaniards and
personally led by distinguished christian cavaliers a military man may
form a juster estimate of the numbers of the train by being told that
it formed a line more than six miles in length the whole marching
compactly and in strict order so as to be best able to resist an
attack of enemies

the spaniards under the cypress-tree surveyed this striking spectacle
with interest but not with the grave wonder and absorbing admiration of
men unfamiliar with such scenes on the contrary it was evident from
the tone of the remarks with which they wiled away the time of
observation for it was many a long hour before the last of the train
drew in sight that they were of that levity of spirit or in that
wantonness of mood which can find matter for ridicule in the most
serious of occurrences thus they beheld or fancied they beheld
somewhat that was diverting in the persons or motions of the stern and
warlike tlascalans and especially in the zealous eagerness with which
these barbarians strove to imitate the bearing and gait as well as the
evolutions of their disciplined associates nay their raillery was
extended even to the spanish portion of the train and sometimes when
a comrade passed by if near enough to be made sensible of the jest he
was saluted with some such outpouring of wit as put to the proof either
his gravity or his patience

these happy individuals to whom we desire to introduce the reader were
five in number and with a single exception though betraying none of
the submissiveness of inferior personages were evidently of no very
exalted rank in the christian army their attire was plain and
consisted for the most part of the cumbrous escaupil or
cotton-armour over which in the case of one or two at least were
buckled a few plates of iron most of them had on their heads helmets
or rather caps of the same flimsy material sometimes so thickly padded
as to assume the bulk as well as the appearance of rude turbans all
wore swords and two had crossbows hanging at their backs no
distinction of station could have been inferred from their manner of
discoursing one with another and it was only by the morion of bright
steel richly inlaid with gold on the head of one and the polished
hauberk on his chest worn more for display than for any present
service that the wearer would have been recognized as of a grade
superior to that of his companions he was a tall and athletic cavalier
with a long chin and cheeks broad and bony and a singular and rather
unpleasing expression was added to his countenance by eyes
disproportionably small though exceedingly black keen and resolute a
small sharply peaked beard mustaches so thin long and straight
that they looked rather like the drooping locks of a woman than the
favourites of a vain gallant a narrow but lofty forehead on either
side of which divided and smoothed with effeminate care fell masses of
straight black hair touched yet almost invisibly with the traces of
matured manhood a small mouth a prominent nose and a complexion
exceedingly dark yet rather of the hue of iron than mahogany completed
a visage which a stranger would not have hesitated to attribute to a man
of decided character but without daring to determine whether that was
of good or evil

the individual who would have been the second to attract the notice of a
wayfarer owed this distinction rather to his personal deformity than to
any other very striking characteristic he was a hunchback with much of
the saturnine and sour expression which distinguishes the countenances
of the deformed and yet of a spirit so much belied by his looks that
he heard recognized and constantly replied to without anger the
nickname of corcobado or the humpbacked to which his misfortune
exposed him the most observable peculiarity in his countenance was the
uncommon length of his nose which so far intruded upon the lower part
of his visage as to give this a look of age which was contradicted
not only by other features but by the prodigious muscularity of his
shoulders and arms it must be confessed however that his lower
extremities were entirely unworthy to compare with the upper being both
so short and thin that when he stood upon his feet his arms crossed
behind which was their ordinary position with the stout iron plates
protruding from both back and breast he looked rather like a bundle of
armour and garments exposed to the air and supported above the earth on
two broken pikestaves or javelins than a living and human creature

the next individual was a man of good stature who would have been
considered notwithstanding his grey hairs the strongest man in the
company had it not been for his general emaciation and an expression of
suffering on a countenance over which disease contracted among the hot
and humid swamps of the coast had cast the sickliest hues of jaundice
indeed this discolouration on a visage naturally none of the fairest
was of so deep a tint that it had gained for the invalid as well as
for a whole ship's crew of his companions the significant title of ojo
verde or the green eye and here we may as well observe that in the
army of cortes the wit which shows itself in the invention of such
distinctions was so prevalent that there was scarce a man from the
general down to his groom or scullion who had not been honoured by at
least one sobriquet

the fourth personage was a man of indifferent figure remarkable for
little save the marvellous sweetness of his eyes which were set among
features exceedingly sharp and harsh and the volubility of his tongue

the fifth sat apart from the others a little down the slope of the
hillock with tablets in his hands yet so plunged in abstraction or so
much wrapped up in the contemplation of the dark lake the little
piraguas dancing over its billows and the far-distant turrets of the
infidel city that he seemed to have forgotten not only the presence of
his companions and the passing procession but the purpose for which he
had drawn forth his writing implements

the sound of the cannon as we have said was immediately responded to
by the shouts of the train which commencing at the gates of the city
were continued and prolonged by the various bodies that composed the
huge and moving mass until they died away in the distance like peals
of rolling thunder at the same time the indians struck their tabours
and sounded their conches and cane-flutes in rivalry with the spanish
buglers and a din was made which for a time put a stop to the
conversation of the four castilians it also startled the solitary man
from his meditations but only for an instant he rose turned his eye
listlessly towards the procession and then again resuming his seat he
was presently sunk in as profound abstraction as before

in the meanwhile the cavalier of the helmet had bent his gaze upon the
pyramid from the top of which the cannon-smoke was driving slowly away
like a cloud and revealing the proud banner which it had for a moment
enveloped he could see even at this distance that the two stone
turrets the idol-chambers on the summit were crowned with crosses
and that the flag-staff a tall cedar that might have made a mast for
an admiral's ship was surrounded by a tent or rather pavilion of
native white cloth broadly striped with crimson which glittered
brilliantly at its foot as he looked he stroked his beard and
muttered addressing himself to the hunchback

harkee najara man give me the benefit of thy thoughts and care not
if they come out like crab-apples what thinkest thou of cortes now is
there not something over-stately and very regal-like in the present
condition of his temper

why dost thou ask that of me when thou hast villafana at thy elbow
replied the hunchback with a voice worthy the acerbity of his aspect
if thou wilt have dirty water get thee to the ditch

you call me gruñidor and grumbler i am said he of the sweet eyes
with a laugh i grumble when i am in the humour and i care not who
knows it am i a ditch old sinner i'faith i must be when i have such
ill weeds as thyself growing about me wilt thou have my thoughts
señor guzman on this subject i can speak them

be quick then said the cavalier for corcobado is digesting an
answer to thy fling which will leave thee speechless

pho i will bandy mudballs with him at any moment said villafana i
care not for the buffets of a friend as for the noble señor the
captain general what you say is true the king's letter hath set him
mad while the bishop of burgos was still in power and his enemy he
was e'en a good companion a comrade and no master demonios twas a
better thing for us when his authority rested on our good-will and no
royal patent

ay said guzman when we were but rebels and exiles denounced by the
governor cursed by the priest and outlawed by the king cortes was the
most moderate humble and loving rogue of us all i do think he is
somewhat altered

oh señor there is no such bond for our friendship as a consciousness
of dependence upon those who love us and nothing so efficacious in
cooling us to friends as the discovery that we can do without them his
authority is no longer our gift the bishop has fallen the king has
acknowledged his claims and sent him besides a fair lawful commission
and goodly reinforcements both of men and arms a letter of commendation
written with his own royal hands may his majesty live a thousand years
but would to heaven his letter were at the bottom of the sea it has
brought us a hard master can your favour solve me the riddle of the
king's change what argument has so operated on his mind that he now
does honour to a man he once condemned as a traitor and advances him
into such power as leaves him independent even of the governor of the
islands

the very same argument replied guzman which has turned thee a
friend of velasquez into the most devoted though grumbling adherent of
our captain interest sirrah interest it is manifest that this
empire was made to be won and equally apparent that the man who could
half subdue it though trammelled and opposed by all the arts and power
of velasquez was the fittest to conclude the good work and what was no
less persuasive it was plain our valiant don was fully determined to
do the work himself without much questioning whether the king would or
not

why by heaven cried villafana you make out the general to be a
traitor indeed

ay for in certain cases there is virtue in treason

hark now to villafana cried the hunchback abruptly he will thank
you for the maxim as if twere a mass for his soul

i curmudgeon exclaimed the grumbler there were a virtue in it
could it bring such fellows as thyself to the block what i aver is
that the king's honours have spoiled our general by'r lady i see not
what good can come of sending us a royal treasurer franciscan friars
with bulls of st peter and lady abbesses to build up nunneries unless
to make up more state for our leader

then art thou more thick-pated than i thought thee replied the
cavalier the bulls will make us somewhat stronger of heart and
therefore better gatherers of gold in a land where gold is not to be had
without fighting la monjonaza will sanctify our efforts by converting
the women and the king's treasurer will see that we do not cheat the
king after we have got our rewards as it is rumoured we have done
somewhat already

santos i know what thou art pointing at don francisco said
villafana significantly the four hundred thousand crowns that have
vanished out of the treasury hah this is a matter that has stained the
general's honour for ever and as for la monjonaza thou knowest there
are dark thoughts about her

have a care said don francisco we are friends and friends may
speak their minds but i cannot hear thee abuse don hernan

hast thou never been as free thyself cried villafana with a laugh
which mingled a careless derision with good-humour come now confess
thou wert pleased to be appointed grand guardian and chamberlain or
if thou wilt grand vizier to his god-son the young king of tezcuco
and that since he gave thee lerma's horse thou hast been better
mounted than any other cavalier in the army

thou art an ass cortes has ever been my friend and when i have
complained as i have sometimes done it was only like a good house-dog
who howls in the night-watches because he has nothing better to amuse
him but hold look the carriers are passed the rear-guard
approaches now is my friend sandoval yonder betwixt the two tlascalan
chiefs glorified in his imagination slid he would have had me
exchange my brown bobadil for his raw-boned motacila come najara rub
up thy wit fling me some sweet word into the teeth of the tlascalan
generals dost thou perceive with what solemn visages they approach us

i perceive said najara that xicotencal is in no mood for jesting
it is said he comes to join us with his power reluctantly dost thou
see how he stalks by himself frowning a maravedi to a ducat he would
sooner take us by the throat than the hand

why then be quick show him thy scorn in a fillip

hast thou forgotten it has been decreed a matter for the bastinado to
abuse an ally

ay cried villafana there is another fruit of a king's patent one
may neither laugh nor scold gamble nor play truant but straight he is
told of a decree faith when cortes was our plain captain it was
another matter if there was aught to be done or not to do it was then
in simple phrase i commend to your favours or i beg of your
friendships do me this thing or do it not as was needful but now
the captain-general deals only in decrees or proclamations wherein we
have commands for exhortations prohibitions in place of dissuasions
and withal a plentiful garnishing of stocks and dungeons whips and
halters all in the king's name by santiago there is too much state in
this

pho thou art an alguazil why shouldst thou care said the cavalier
the decrees are wholesome the restrictions wise it is right we
should not displease the republicans they are our best friends very
quick and jealous too and we were but a scotched snake without them

if they fight our battles said villafana they divide our spoil in
my mind that black-faced xicotencal is a villain and traitor

thy judgment is better in such matters than another's said the
hunchback

right cried guzman the alguazil will be presently in his own
stocks if thou dost heat him into a quarrel we are not forbidden to
abuse one another let the red jackalls pass by unnoticed we have mirth
enough among ourselves we will worry our immortality look najara
man dost thou not see in what perplexity of cogitation he is
involved yonder dull bernal rouse him with a quip now pierce him
with a jest come stir rub thy nose make thy wit as sharp as a goad
and prick the ox out of his slumber

ay good corcobado cried villafana turning from the procession and
mischievously eyeing their solitary and abstracted companion fling out
the legs of thy understanding like a rough horse and see if thou canst
not strike fire out of his flinty brain all the scratching in the world
will not do it

now were you not both besotted and bent upon self-destruction said
the deformed regarding the pair with a commiserating sneer you would
not ask me to disturb our immortality who is at this moment
meditating by what possible stretch of benevolence he can hand your
names down to posterity a thing which if he do not effect you may
be sure nobody else will señor guzman twas but a half-hour since
that he asked me if i could upon mine own knowledge acquaint him with
any act of thine worthy of commemoration

ay indeed said the cavalier laughing was bernal of this mind
then he asked thee this question by my faith have i not killed as
many indians as another have i not encountered as many risks and
endured as many knocks out upon the misbelieving caitiff he asked thee
this question thy reply now pr'ythee thy learned answer to this
foolish interrogatory what saidst thou now in good truth

in good truth then replied najara with a sour gravity i told him
i had it upon excellent authority though i believed it not myself
that thou wert a cavalier equal to any in the virtues of a
soldier bold quick and resolute cool and fiery a lover of peril
a relisher of blood one that had won more gold than he could pocket
more slaves than he could make marketable and more renown than he cared
to boast of a prudent captain yet a better follower because of the
ardour of his temper which was indeed upon occasion so hot that
sometimes it was feared he might take cortes by the beard for being
too faint-hearted

oh thou rogue thou merry thing of vinegar thou hast belied me
cried guzman thou knowest i would sooner eat my arms lance
buckler and all than lift my hand against the general i would by my
troth for i love him but come now thou saidst all this upon good
authority you jest you rogue we are all jealous and envious we have
good words from none but cortes what authority

marry upon that of thine own lips replied the hunchback for i know
not who else could have invented so liberally

out cried the cavalier somewhat intemperately you presume 

ha ha a truce a truce don francisco exclaimed villafana a fair
hit no quarrelling for captain though thou be thou knowest i am sworn
alguazil as well as head-turnkey chief executioner and the lord knows
what beside no wrath among friends a very justifiable fair hit
najara must have his ways thou wilt see by and by how he will lay
me by the ears come corcobado begin he who plays with colts must
look to be kicked come now be sharp fear not i am a dog and love
thee all the better for cudgelling

i know thou art and i know thou dost said najara for i remember
that ever since don hernan had thee scourged for abusing the tlascalan
woman thou hast been a more loving hound than any other of the
velasquez faction

fuego de dios pho good ha ha very good exclaimed villafana
laughing though somewhat disconcerted i confess the beating but then
i have a back to endure it hah a roland for an oliver a kick for a
buffet thou liest though as to the cause twas for taking the old
senator they call maxiscatzin by the beard when he had given me the
first sop of the maguey-liquor i was drunk sirrah broke rules
disobeyed orders and so deserved my guerdon wilt thou be satisfied by
this hand i grumble not i should trounce thee for the like
misdemeanour that is if i could find whereon to lay my scourge aha
wilt thou pull noses with me come what saidst thou of me to bernal i
bear thee no malice man no no more than the general drunk indeed
he should have struck my head off

i told him said najara that thou wert in some sense worthy to be
chronicled

many thanks for that said villafana were it only on account of the
beating

for though thou wert as naturally given to grovelling as a football
yet wouldst thou as certainly mount at every kick as that same bag of
wind

bravo bravo cried the alguazil with a roar of delight in which he
was joined by guzman thou art as witty and unsavoury as ever and thou
dingest me about the ears as with a pine-tree what else cielo mio
what else saidst thou to bernal

simply that thou hadst more boldness than would be thought of thee
more dreams than would be reckoned of thy dull brain and such skill at
rising notwithstanding the clog of thy folly that it was manifest thou
wouldst not be content till thy feet were two fathoms from the earth
and thy crown as near to the oak-bough as the rope would

oh fu fy said villafana hast thou no better trope for hanging
have you done am i despatched get thee to better game then and see
thou art more metaphoric hast thou no verjuice for our good friend
here camarga

the individual thus alluded to though giving his attention to the
conversation had maintained a profound and unsympathetic silence during
all he stood leaning against the tree folding over his breast and
even wrapping about his chin the long cloak of striped cotton
cloth the product of the country the bright and gaudy colours of
which contrasted unnaturally with the sickly hue of his visage
throughout all when not particularly noticed his countenance wore an
expression of as much mental as bodily pain but when thus accosted by
villafana it changed at once and in a remarkable degree from gloom to
good-humour and even to apparent gayety it is true that at the
moment when his name was pronounced he started quickly with a sort of
nervous agitation and a sudden rush of blood into his face mingling
with its bilious stain covered it with the swarthiest purple but this
immediately passed away perhaps before any of his comrades had noted
it

i cry you mercy señor villafana he said i am as unworthy to be
made the butt of wit as the subject of history my ambition runs not
beyond my conscience the month that i have spent in this land and it
is scarce a month has been wasted in disease and idleness a year
hence i shall be more worthy your consideration but tell me good
friends is it true as you say that yonder worthy soldier hath been
appointed the historian of your brave exploits by mine honour his head
seems to me better fitted to receive blows than to remember them and
his hand to repay them rather than to record

he is truly said villafana our immortality as we call him or our
historian as he denominates himself as to his appointment it comes of
his own will and not of our grace but we quarrel not with his humours
he conceives himself called to be our chronicler who cares he can do
no harm i am told he doth greatly abuse cortes especially in the
matter of the slaves and the gold we fetched from mexico in the flight
by'r lady i have heard some sharp things said about that

you said them yourself muttered najara it is well you are in
favour

ay by my troth cried guzman cuidado villafana don hernan will
be angry good luck to you you are the lion's small dog seize not his
majesty by the nose

pho friends here's a coil said the alguazil stoutly don hernan
knows me i will say what i think i have maintained to his face that
there was foul work with the gold and that we have been cheated
of our shares i have told him what ill work was made of both
repartimientos the partition of the slaves at segura-de-la-frontera
and here at tezcuco scurvy knavish work señores one may fetch
angels to the brand but ay de mi the iron turns them into beldames

ay there is some truth in that said guzman a little thoughtfully
no man honours don hernan more than myself and yet did he suffer me to
be choused out of the princess i fetched from iztapalapan

ay the whole army witnessed it and there was not a man who did not
cry shame on you for taking it so 

good-humouredly interrupted the cavalier rub me as thou wilt for a
jest villafana but touch me not in soberness

pshaw can i not abuse thee as a friend without the apology of a grin
thou hadst been used basely had not cortes made up the loss with
lerma's horse i have heard thee complain as much as another and even
now thou art as bitter as any against this mad scheme of the ships
demonios our general will have us rot in the lake like our friends of
the noche triste

thou errest said the cavalier gravely i have changed my mind on
this subject i perceive we shall conquer this city

wilt thou be sworn to that exclaimed the alguazil earnestly i tell
thee as a friend we are all mad and we are deluded to death if we
launch the brigantines we are but gods meat food for idols and
cannibals we were fools to come from tlascala would to heaven we had
departed with duero we are toiled on to our fate to make cortes
famous he will win his renown out of our corses what sayst thou
najara mi corcobado mi hacedor de tropos

even that the will-o-th-wisps the ignes-fatui rising out of our
decaying bodies will forsake each honest man's corse to gather
glory-wise about the head of our leader is that to thy liking

marvellously thy wit explains and gives tongue to my thoughts thou
seest things clearly i am glad thou art of my way of thinking this is
our destiny if we continue our insane enterprise

a pest upon thee clod cried the hunchback i did but supply thee a
simile in pity of thine own barrenness i of thy way of thinking
dost imagine i will hang with thee i see things clearly marry i do
give tongue to thy thoughts ratsbane

as najara spoke he bent his sour and piercing looks on the alguazil
who much to the surprise of camarga grew pale and snatched at his
dagger in an ecstasy of rage greatly disproportioned to the offence
if such there could be in what seemed idle and unmeaning sarcasms the
wrath of villafana however was checked by the mirth of the cavalier
don francisco who exclaimed with the triumph of retaliation

a fair knock by st dominic art thou laid by the heels now sirrah
alguazil if thou showest but an inch more of thy dudgeon i will have
thee in thine own stocks ay faith and on thine own block into the
bargain forgettest thou the decree death man very mortal death to
any one who draws weapon upon a christian comrade thy hidalgo blood
if thou hast any as thou art ever boasting will not save thee pho
thou art notoriously known to be a plotter why shouldst thou be angry

hombre i am not angry now but methinks corcobado hath the art
of inflaming whatever is combustible in man's body a good friend were
he for a poor man in the winter why thou bitter misjudging
remorseless male-shrew here is my hand in token i will not maul thee
why dost thou ever persecute me with thy hints by and by men will come
to believe thou art in earnest what dost thou see that i care not to
have exposed i am a plotter i grant ye so cortes hath called me to my
face a dozen times or more i am a grumbler so he avers and so i
allow i must speak what i think ay and i must growl too all this is
apparent but it harms me not with the general he scolds me very oft
but who stands better in his favour

thou takest the matter too seriously said guzman hast thou no
suspicion that thy self-commendations are tedious

in such case hadst thou ever any thyself demanded the unrelenting
najara pray let him go on let him draw his dagger if he will too
what care i i have a better fence than the decree

pshaw man said villafana why dost thou take a frown so bitterly i
will not quarrel with thee but i would thou couldst be reasonable in
thy fillips call me a knave openly if thou wilt thy insinuations have
the air of seriousness but come you have robbed the señor camarga of
his diversion with bernal lo you now if our wrangling have disturbed
him a jot he sits there like an old horse of a summer's day patient
and uncomplaining and all the time there are gadfly thoughts
persecuting his imagination

methinks señores said camarga you should be curious to know in
what manner the good man records your actions for my part i should be
well content to be made better acquainted with them especially with
those later exploits since the retreat from mexico of which i have
heard only confused and contradictory accounts will he suffer us to
examine his chronicles

suffer us cried guzman if you do but give him a grain of
encouragement never believe me but he will requite you with pounds of
his stupidity what have you any curiosity harkee bernal man you
shall see how i will rouse him bernal diaz historian immortality
what ho señor del castillo are you asleep zounds sirrah here are
three or four dull fellows who for lack of better amusement are
willing to listen to your history




chapter ii


at these words the worthy thus appealed to woke from his revery and
staring a moment in some little perplexity at his companions took up a
long copper-headed spear which rested on the ground at his side and
advanced towards them viewed at a little distance the gravity of his
countenance gave him an appearance of age which vanished on a nearer
inspection in reality if his own recorded account can be believed
and heaven forbid we should attach any doubt to the representations of
our excellent prototype he did not number above twenty-six or
twenty-seven years and was thus as he chose to call himself a
stripling young as he was however there was not a man in the army of
cortes who had seen more or more varied service than bernal diaz del
castillo his exploits in the new world had commenced seven years
before among the burning and pestilential fens of nombre de dios a
place made still more odious to an aspiring youth by the ferocious
dissensions of its inhabitants and that bloodthirsty jealousy of its
ruler which had rewarded with the block the man who disclosed to
spain the broad expanse of the pacific and led his subaltern pizarro
to the shores of peru with the two adventurers cordova and grijalva
who had preceded cortes in the attempt upon the lands of montezuma
discovered by the first bernal diaz shared the wounds and
misadventures of both expeditions and he was among the first to join
the standard of don hernan in the third and most successful of the
spanish descents

footnote vasco nuñez de balboa

the hardships he had endured the constant and unmitigated suffering to
which he had been exposed for seven years had given him much of the
weatherbeaten look of a veteran which added to the sombre gravity of
his visage caused him to present at the first sight the appearance of
a man of forty years or more his garments were of a dusky red cloth
padded into escaupil with back and breast-pieces of iron over which
was a long cloak of a chocolate colour well embroidered and though
much worn and tarnished obviously a holiday suit to these were added a
black velvet hat ornamented with three flamingo feathers striking up
like the points of a trident with the medal of a saint rudely wrought
in gold hanging beneath them his person was brawny his face full and
inexpressive his dull grey eyes indicated nothing but simplicity and
absence of mind or rather inattentiveness and it required the presence
of many scars of several wounds on his countenance to convince a
stranger that bernal actually possessed the fortitude to encounter such
badges of honour

he approached the group with a heavy and indolent tread bearing in his
hand a bundle of leaves of maguey paper such as served the purposes of
the native painters and chroniclers of anahuac and with which he was
fain to supply the want of a better material

dost thou hear señor inmortalidad cried don francisco de guzman as
the martial annalist took his seat serenely among the castilians art
thou deaf dumb or still wrapt in thy seventh heaven that thou
answerest not a word to my salutations zounds man i will not ask thee
a second time

what is your will said bernal diaz what will you have of me
señores he repeated surveying each member of the group one after the
other i did think that this being a day of license and rejoicing to so
many of us i might have an opportunity not often in my power of
putting down some things in my journal which it will be well to do
before setting out on the circuit of the lake wherein there may happen
some passages to drive from my memory those which are not yet recorded
but by my faith you have talked loud and much and so disturbed my
mind that i have entirely lost some things i intended to say i would
to heaven you would find some other place to your liking and leave me
alone for a few hours

why thou infidel said guzman if thou likest not our company why
dost thou not leave it dost thou forget thou hast the power of
locomotion wilt thou wait for us to depart before thou bethinkest thee
of thine own legs by'r lady thou art not yet in thy senses

by my faith so i can said the historian abruptly as if the idea
had just entered his mind i will go down to the lake shore where the
sound of the waves will drown your voices there is something
encouraging to contemplation in the dashing of water but as for men's
voices i could never think well when they were within hearing i beg
your pardon all señores i will go down

what when here are four fools who are in the humour of listening to
thee for some seven minutes or so ay man to thy crazy chronicles
when wilt thou expect such another audience lo you the señor camarga
has desired to be made acquainted with your learned lucubrations come
stir open thy lips exalt thyself while thou art alive for after
death there is no saying how short a time thou wilt sleep in cobwebs

you jeer me señor guzman you laugh at me gentlemen said the
soldier gravely and thereby you do yourselves as well as me much
wrong is it so great a thing for a soldier to write a history the
valiant julius cæsar of rome recorded with his own hand his great
actions in france britain and our own castile as i know full well
for when i was a boy at school i saw the very book and sorry i am that
the poverty of my parents denied me such instruction as might have
enabled me to read it then there was josephus the jewish captain who
wrote a history of the fall of jerusalem as i have heard from a learned
priest besides there were many greek soldiers who did the same thing
as i have been told but i never knew much concerning them

and hast thou the vanity to talk of julius cæsar cried guzman
laughing

why not said the soldier stoutly i have fought almost as many
battles and i warrant me my heart is as strong and were it my fate to
be a general and commander instead of a poor soldier of fortune in the
ranks i could myself as well as another lead you through these
mischievous mexicans who i will be sworn are much more valiant
heathens than ever cæsar found among the french as far as he was a
soldier then i boast to be as good a man as he ay by mine honour
and better too for i am a christian man whereas he was a poor
benighted infidel as for my history i will not make bold to compare it
in excellence with his for it has been told me that cæsar was a
scholar and possessed of the graces and elegancies of style whereas i
have myself none of these graces being ignorant of both latin and
greek and knowing nothing of any tongues except the castilian and
some smattering of this indian jargon which i have picked up with much
pains and as i may say at the expense of more beating than one gets
from the schoolmaster nevertheless i flatter myself that what i write
will be good because it will be true for this which i am writing is
not a history of distant nations or of past events nor is it composed
of vain reveries and conjectures such as fill the pages of one who
writes of former ages i relate those things of which i am an
eye-witness and not idle reports and hearsay truth is sacred and very
valuable in future days when men come to make histories of our acts in
this land their histories will be good because they will draw them
from me and not from those vain historiographers who stay at home and
write down all the lies that people at a distance may say of us this is
a good thing and will make my book when finished a treasury to men
but what is better and what should make it noticeable to yourselves it
will not like other histories say the great hero cortes did this
and the mighty commander did that giving all the glory to one man
alone but it will record our achievements in such a way as to show who
performed them relating that this thing was done by the señor don
francisco de guzman and this by the valiant soldier najara and this by
myself bernal diaz del castillo and so on each of us according to
our acts

footnote the historical reader will find that the worthy bernal has
incorporated many of these judicious sentiments in the work he was then
composing and some almost word for word

what the worthy del castillo says is just said camarga and whether
his history be elegant or unpolished he should be encouraged to
continue it for my own part i shall be glad when i have performed
anything worthy to be preserved to know we have with us a man who will
see that the credit of the act is not bestowed upon another and in
this frame of mind i will stand much indebted to the good señor if he
will permit me at once to be made acquainted with the true relation of
certain events with which i am not yet familiar

what will you have said bernal diaz much gratified by this proof of
approbation you shall hear the truth and no vain fabrication for i
call heaven to witness and i say amen to it that i have related
nothing which being an eye-witness i do not know to be true or
which having the testimony of many others actors and lookers-on to
the same i have not good reason to believe is true what then will
you have señor camarga is there any particular battle you choose to be
informed of perhaps i had better begin with the first chapter which i
have here written out in full and which 

fire cried guzman starting up will you drive us away zounds do
you think we will swallow all

read that chapter said najara in which you celebrate the exploits
of the señor guzman

i have not said diaz with much simplicity i have not yet had
occasion to come to don francisco

hear cried villafana clapping his hands with admiration in which
the cavalier after looking a little indignant thought fit to join

unless indeed continued the historian i should have resolved to
relate the quarrel betwixt his favour and the young cornet lerma whom
may heaven take to its rest for there were some good things in the
young man but as to this feud i thought it better for the honour of
both as well as of another whom i do not desire to mention with
dispraise that the matter should be forgotten

put it down if thou wilt said guzman with a stern aspect what i
have done i have done and i shame not to have it spoken if i did not
kill the youth never believe me if it was not out of pity for his
years and out of regard to cortes with whom he was a favourite

at these words which were delivered with the greatest gravity the
historian raised his eyes to don francisco and regarded him for a
moment with surprise then shaking his head and muttering the word
favourite with a voice of incredulity and even wonder he held his
peace with the air of one who locks up in his breast a mystery which
he has been on the point of imprudently revealing

a favourite i repeat the word exclaimed don francisco with angry
emphasis a favourite at least until his folly and baseness were made
apparent to cortes and so brought him to disgrace

strong words don francisco said villafana with a bold tone of
rebuke and somewhat too strong to be spoken of a dead enemy and
besides without referring to your share in the matter there are those
in this army who have other thoughts in relation to the lad it has
been whispered and the honour of cortes has suffered thereby it has
been whispered  

by villafana exclaimed the hunchback abruptly and sharply by
thyself certainly sir alguazil if there be anything in it against the
credit of the general

pshaw wilt thou buffet me again cried villafana springing up and
stamping on the earth though not in anger dost thou know now what
thou art like

like a thorn in the foot which the more you stamp the more it will
hurt

rather like a stupid ball tied to my leg said the alguazil which
without any merit of its own serves but the dead-weight purpose of
giving me a jerk turn whichsoever way i will

right cried najara with a sneer you have clapped the ball to the
right leg we do not so shot honest men

gentlemen with your leave said camarga willing to divert the storm
which it seemed najara's delight to provoke in the breast of the
alguazil with your leave señores i must not be robbed of my
curiosity it was my purpose to ask the señor del castillo to read me
such portions of his journal as treated first of occurrences that
happened after the noche triste and battle of otumba and then of the
history and fate of this very young man whose name is so efficacious in
laying you by the ears but as i perceive the latter subject is hateful
to you all  here he turned his eyes on guzman

you are deceived said don francisco drily i bear the young man no
malice the wolf and the dog may roll over carcasses i have no anger
for bones he slandered me being no longer alive i forgive him ask
bernal what you will and let him answer what he will i swear by my
troth i care not

what needs that we should look into noisome caves when we have green
wholesome lawns before us said bernal diaz hesitating for at that
moment the eyes of all except guzman were fastened eagerly on his own
i could speak of the quarrel to be sure between his favour don
francisco and the young colour-bearer for though as i said and for
the reasons stated i have not put it down in my history yet do i
remember it very well but should i get thus far i should even persist
with the whole story for i know not how it is i never begin a
relation and get well advanced in the same but i am loath to leave it
till i have recounted all

ay i'll be sworn thou art said villafana thy stories are much
like to a crane's neck tis but a head and bill at first and an ell or
two of nothing stretched out after

nor am i able said the worthy bernal without stopping to digest the
simile to read a full account of those actions the señor camarga
speaks of which took place subsequently to our flight from mexico and
our great victory on the plains of otumba for the good reason that i
have not yet composed them the failure of which is in a great measure
the consequence of your loud talking just now whilst i was addressing
my mind to the same but if you will have a verbal relation señor
camarga i will do my best to pleasure you and that right briefly and
in true words for i defy any man to detect falsehood or exaggeration in
what i write

ay by'r lady cried guzman who had recovered his good-humour and
now laughed heartily in what you write honest bernal but in what
you say you are not so infallible

you would not let me finish what i was about to say murmured the
historian

no faith you would make a day's work of it whereas i who am no
wire-drawer of conceits can despatch the whole thing in a minute do
you not see the rear of the procession is in sight in half an hour we
shall be summoned into camp be content then scribbler i quote thy
words which should be honour enough i defy any man to discover
falsehood or exaggeration in what i say know then señor
camarga after our victory at otumba nine months since we retreated to
tlascala four hundred and fifty in number at which city we rested five
months curing our wounds recruiting our forces and preparing to
resume the war during this time the only remarkable incidents
were first the meeting of those goodly knaves who had come with
narvaez sworn faith to cortes looked at mexico and now being
satisfied with blows and honour demanded to be sent back to cuba to
the great injury and almost destruction of all our hopes among the
foremost of these turbulent fellows was our friend here villafana
who although he came not with narvaez but was sent soon after us by
velasquez was ever found consorting with the disaffected until his
good saint in some dream of the gallows brought better thoughts into
his mind and converted him from an open enemy into a doubtful friend
peace villafana i am now playing the historian and must therefore
tell what i believe to be the truth

at these words villafana who had opened his mouth to speak checked
the impulse nodded laughed and composed himself to silence

the defection of these men resumed the cavalier and the reduction
of our numbers that followed for we were e'en forced to discharge the
more importunate of them were requited to us by happy reinforcements
of men horses and arms some of them sent by the foolish velasquez 

señor guzman said bernal diaz the governor velasquez is my
relation my father was an hidalgo and his wife my mother 

oh i forgot said guzman nodding to the historian some sent by
the sagacious velasquez to his captain narvaez who was in chains at
villa rica some by de garay adelantado of jamaica to rob us of our
northern province panuco and it is supposed that thou señor camarga
with thy crew of sick men though thou comest so late and apparently of
thine own good will wert equipt by the same inconsiderate commander
and some by the merchants of the canaries and of seville to be
exchanged for our superfluous spoils which were not then gathered no
by'r lady nor yet either in fine we became strong enough by these
means to recruit our forces among the natives of the land which we
did by attacking divers provinces in the neighbourhood of tlascala and
compelling their warriors to join our standard along with the
tlascalans who were willing enough all save their generalissimo
xicotencal thus then with no mean force of spaniards and with
several armies of indian confederates we came tis now more than three
months since to yonder city tezcuco and raised to the throne in
place of his brother who fled to mexico a king of our own choosing
of whom i have the honour to be chief counsellor and minister that is
to say guardian regent sponsor or master as you may think fit to
esteem me here it has been our good fortune to receive other and
stronger reinforcements and as villafana said from the king's own
royal bounty with commissions and orders priests and crown-officers
and so on which circumstances have caused our army to be reorganized
the whole reduced to a stricter discipline and civil officers to be
appointed for the better enforcing of martial law here too we have
been preparing for the siege and blockade of yonder accursed metropolis
by bringing ships they are on the shoulders of these crawling pagans
to give us the command of the lake and by attacking and destroying the
neighbouring towns so as to secure possession of the shores in the
meanwhile the young cub of an emperor guatimozin who has succeeded
cuitlahuatzin the successor of montezuma has been equally busy in
concentrating the warriors of all his faithful provinces in the island
and providing vast stores of corn and meat for their subsistence as
resolute to resist as we are to assail the materials for our vessels
being arrived it is now known that the time of constructing and
lanching them will be devoted to an expedition led by cortes himself
in which we will make the circuit of the whole lake destroying the
rebellious cities on the main and driving to the island all who may
think fit to resist when they are thus caged we shall have them like
pigeons in a net and good plucking there will be in store for
all this is my history and methinks it should satisfy you

it wants nothing to be complete save the episode of the cornet lerma
said villafana with a malicious grin and in requital for the good
turn you have done me when speaking of the mutiny tlascala i will
relate it ay by st james i will frown and storm as you may the
señor camarga has avowed his curiosity in the matter our dull bernal
who is so frequent at boasting he tells naught but truth has confessed
that he dares not tell all the truth which i think will be somewhat
of a qualification to the belief of his future admirers najara here
will say naught of any one but myself and that with a crusty and bitter
obstinacy wherein he seems to me to resemble a silly ox who rubs his
stupid head against a tree much less to the prejudice of the bark than
his skin and as for thyself señor don francisco thou hast but thine
own fashion of telling the story but i told thee before there are
those in the army who have another way of thinking and i am one i will
not boggle at a truth like diaz because it is somewhat discreditable
to cortes or to a chief officer

speak then said guzman gravely i have said already i care not i
know full well how your knavish companions belie me i say again i care
not what you aver as your own belief i will make free to hold in
consideration for the reported imputations of others i release you
from responsibility

oh i speak not on my own knowledge nor of my own personal belief
said villafana and therefore but more especially in consequence of
the decree señor the decree we will not forget the decree i shall
fear neither dagger nor black looks you called lerma a favourite of
the general pho even bernal smiled at that

what i have said in that matter replied guzman with composure i
will condescend to support with argument the young man was received
into the household of cortes while cortes was yet a planter of
santiago he picked him up heaven knows where how or why a poor
vagabond boy it is notorious to all that in those days don hernan
employed him less as a servant than as a son or younger brother and as
such bestowed upon him affection and confidence as well as the truest
protection thou knowest and if thou art not an infidel altogether
thou wilt allow that the sword-cut on the general's left hand was
obtained in a duel which he fought with a man twas the señor
bocasucia who had thrown some sarcasm on the youth's birth and then
ran him through the body when he sought for satisfaction

i allow all this said villafana i confess the youth was an ass to
match his boy's blade against the weapon of the best swordsman in the
island and i agree that it was both noble and truly affectionate in
cortes to take up the quarrel and so baste the bones of bocasucia
that he will remember the correction to his dying day i allow all this
and i add to it the greater proof of don hernan's love for the youth
that when velasquez granted him his commission to subdue these lands i
would the sea had swallowed them some good ten years since the
captain did forthwith entrust to the boy the honourable and
distinguished duty of recruiting soldiers for him in española in which
island he was born

ay quoth guzman dryly and one may find cause for the general's
anger in the diligence with which the urchin prosecuted his task and
the success that crowned it

by my faith said bernal diaz unable any longer to restrain his
desire to take part in a discussion of such historical moment the
young man sped well and that he came to us empty-handed was no cause of
don hernan's displeasure as i have heard don hernan say it was in the
first place our haste to embark when we discovered that the governor
was about to revoke our captain's commission that caused lerma to be
left behind us and secondly it was the governor's own act that lerma
was not permitted to follow us with the forces he had raised and
brought as far as santiago it is well known that these men were
arrested on their course and disbanded by velasquez for some of them
came afterwards with narvaez and have so reported the youth was thrown
into prison too where he fell sick for he had never entirely
recovered from the effects of his wound and it required all the
exertions of doña catalina our leader's wife backed by those of her
friends to procure his release his fidelity was afterwards shown in
his escape from cuba which was truly wonderful both in boldness of
conception and success of accomplishment

his fidelity truly and his folly too said villafana for i think
no one but a confirmed madman could have projected and undertaken a
voyage across the gulf in an open fusta by'r lady i have heard
twas nothing better than a piragua with a few beggarly indian
fishermen for his crew but this he did mad or not and if cortes were
angry he took but an ill way to punish since he gave him a horse and
standard and kept him for a long time near to his own person his
favourite for a time i grant you he may have been having heard it so
related but when i myself came to the land there were others much
better beloved

footnote fusta a sort of galley very small and open with lateen
sails

if i am not mistaken said don francisco he was in favour at that
time and i have heard it affirmed it was some news of thy bringing or
some good counsel of thy speaking which first opened the eyes of
cortes

i indeed my news and my counsel cried villafana with a
grin i was more like at that period to get to the bastinado than the
ears of don hernan i indeed i loved not the young man i confess
and who did he had even the fate of a fallen minion all spoke of him
with dispraise all hated him or seemed to hate him save only the
tlascalan chief xicotencal who loved him out of opposition and i
remember a saying of this very crabbed corcobado here on the subject
namely that a hedgehog was the best fellow for a viper

ay by my faith said najara yet i meant not xicotencal for the
animal but a worthy christian cavalier who was at that time rolling
the snake out of his dwelling as najara spoke he fixed his eyes on
guzman

i understand thee toad said the latter indifferently it was
natural the young man should be somewhat jealous but this leads us
from the story if it be needful to find a reason for don hernan's
change i can myself give a thousand in the first place mere human
fickleness might be enough for no man is master of his affections it
might be enough too to know that the youth was no longer the gay and
good-humoured lad he had been described but a sour gloomy and peevish
fool exceedingly disagreeable and quarrelsome and perhaps it might
be more than enough to remind you that as was currently believed
this change of temper was the consequence of certain villanous acts
committed after our departure and which were thought to furnish a
better and more probable reason for the voyage in the fusta than any
particular zeal he had in the cause of cortes if this be not enough
continued the cavalier looking round him with the air of one who feels
that his arguments are conclusive then i have but to mention what you
seem to have forgotten to wit that this petulant and meddlesome boy
did presume to make opposition to and very arrogantly censure certain
actions of the general and in particular the seizure and imprisonment
of king montezuma and the burning alive of the cholulan prisoners as
well as the seventeen warriors who had fought the battle with
escalante at vera cruz in the last of these instances don francisco
made reference to the barbarous and most unjust punishment of
quauhpopoco the military governor of a mexican province near to vera
cruz and of his chief officers who had presumed to resist with arms
and with fatal success the spanish commandant of the coast in an
unjustifiable attack

all this is true said villafana and it is all superfluous what i
desired to establish was that lerma was no favourite when sent on the
expedition as would have been inferred from your words i come now
señor camarga to speak of that occurrence in relation to this boy juan
lerma i call him a boy for at that time he was not thought to
exceed nineteen years of age which as bernal diaz says touches the
honour of don hernan and which others think bears as heavily upon
that of don francisco the señores must answer for themselves i only
give what is one version of the story

and i warrant thee it is the worst said najara thou hast very
much the appetite of a gallinaza who chooses her meat according to the
roughness of the savour

among the daughters of the captive montezuma said villafana nodding
to the hunchback in testimony of approbation was one the youngest of
all and in truth the prettiest as i have heard for i never beheld
her who was called cillahula 

zelahualla said bernal diaz it is a word that signifies 

it signifies nothing so long as you give it not the proper accent
said guzman with infinite composure her true name was citlaltihuatl
or at least it was by that the mexicans designated her for they of
the royal family have ordinarily a popular title in addition to that
used at court the name may be interpreted the maiden of the star or
the celestial lady for so much is expressed by the two words of which
it is compounded

i maintain said bernal diaz stoutly that the word zelahualla is
more agreeable of pronunciation as well as much more universal in the
army

i grant you that said guzman nor is the corruption so great as that
of many names you have recorded in your journal but i leave these
things to be examined by your admirers hereafter we will call the
princess then zelahualla that being the better and more common
title and now villafana man get thee on in god's name and start
not señor camarga at the damnable inventions of slander which will
now be told you

pho said the alguazil i will not abuse thee half so much as the
general know señor camarga that there arose between the young fool
lerma and the excellent cavalier don francisco de guzman a quarrel
very hot and deadly concerning this same silly daughter of montezuma
with whom don francisco chose to be somewhat rougher and more
tyrannical in displaying his affection than was proper towards a
king's daughter and a captive

dost thou speak this upon thine own personal averment demanded don
francisco with a countenance unchanged but with a voice
preternaturally subdued

no faith said villafana hastily and with an air that looked like
alarm i repeat the innuendoes of others which may be slanders or
not i know not but it is certain the young man so charged thee to
cortes affirming that but for his interference the villany
meditated but pho thou growest angry so much certainly he brought
against thee

he did replied guzman smiling as if in derision and i know not how
any could have been induced to believe him except that man each
man being naturally a rogue himself doth rather delight to entertain
those aspersions which bring down his neighbour to his own level than
the commendations which acquaint him with a superior he did he was a
fool i can explain this thing to your satisfaction

basta it does not need replied villafana the rear-guard is
passing there is a stir on the temple-top and presently we shall hear
the trumpet which like a curfew-bell will command us to put out the
fires of our fancy and the lights of our wit on pain of having them
somewhat of a sudden whipped out with switches i must tell mine own
story the señor camarga looks a little impatient the end of this
quarrel continued the alguazil was a duel in which neither of the
rivals in love and the general's favour came to much hurt since they
were speedily seized upon and introduced to the calabozo for fighting
against the express orders of the general then being released they
were separated our excellent friend don francisco being sent on some
duty to tlascala and the boy juan to heaven

saints exclaimed camarga he was not executed

not on the block or the gallows to be sure said villafana but in a
manner quite as effectual he was sent on some fool's errand of
discovery or exploration to the south sea which it was told us
washed the distant borders of this mighty empire his companions two
unlucky dogs of la mancha and one leonese of medina-del-campo 

ay said bernal diaz with a groan gaspar olea he was my beloved
friend and townsman and  but villafana was in no humour to be
interrupted

all three like himself out of favour he continued besides these
the young man had with him a band of knavish infidels from the western
province matlatzinco and his guide and counsellor was an old chief of
the ottomies a half-savage they called him ocelotl or ocelotzin
that is the tiger who had been domesticated among montezuma's other
wild beasts now señor you may make your own conclusions or you may
take those of men who are true friends of cortes and yet will speak
their mind it was said at the time that the young man was sent to his
death for the western tribes are fierce and barbarous it was an easy
way to get rid of him and so it has been proved this happened fourteen
months ago neither the young man nor any of his companions were ever
heard of more the thing was understood and it was called a cruel and
unchristian act

thou doest a foul wrong to cortes to say so exclaimed don francisco
imputing to him such sinister and perfidious motives such expeditions
were at that time common for we were then at peace and each explorer
was furnished by montezuma with some royal officer by way of
safe-conduct did not don hernan send his cousin the young pizarro to
explore the gold-lands of guaztepec at that very time were not others
sent to search for mines in the southern and northern provinces i
affirm that this expedition of lerma fatal though it has proved was
not thought more or much more dangerous than pizarro's thou
knowest pizarro lost three of his men moreover thou doest the
general an equal wrong in the matter of the three spaniards that went
with lerma olea at least gaspar olea the barba-roxa was
notoriously a favourite and trusted soldier and was sent with the
youth as being the fittest man who could be spared to aid his
inexperience

the history is finished said villafana rising the trumpet
flourishes and like hounds at the horn of the hunter we must e'en get
us to the general and add our howls to the yells of these curs of
tlascala the history is finished and i have only to add by way of
annotation that the hatred you bore the youth i have heard some say
he had the better in the duel will supply you good reasons for
defending his punishment

i say to you again cried guzman i have forgiven the youth and i
hate him not

oh the brown horse bobadil that was sent to him from santo domingo
a month since and given to your own excellent favour as to his proper
heir is a good peace-maker

thou art a fool said don francisco i lament his death as much as
another  

have masses then said for his soul for by heaven and st john his
spirit is among us

these words pronounced by the hunchback najara suddenly and with a
voice of extreme alarm caused the cavalier who with villafana and
camarga had already begun to walk towards the city to turn round when
he instantly beheld and with similar agitation the apparition which
had drawn forth the exclamation of the deformed




chapter iii


as the castilians followed the eyes of najara they beheld approaching
them from behind three men in whom but for the direction given to
their thoughts by the exclamation they would have seen nothing but the
persons of indians belonging to some tribe more wild and savage than
any which inhabited the valley their garments were coarse and singular
their gait at least the gait of two of them not unlike to that of
barbarians and the look of wonder with which they surveyed the long
train of the rear-guard in which the high penachos or plumes and the
copper-headed spears of tlascalan chiefs shone among the iron casques
of spanish cavaliers was similar to the childish admiration of natives
unused to such a spectacle their dark countenances and long hair their
vestments and arms were all of an aztec character yet a second and
more scrutinizing glance made it apparent that one at least if not
two of them was of another and nobler race

the foremost or leader of the little band was undoubtedly a savage
as was seen by the depressed forehead the high cheek-bones the eye of
a peculiar form and the skin of even uncommon swarthiness which
distinguished him from his companions his stature was short almost
dwarfish his toes were turned inwards and as he moved along with a
shuffling gait with advanced chest and head still more protruded his
long locks grizzled as with extreme age fell from either side of his
face like patches of gray moss from the bough of a tree and almost
swept the ground a coarse cloth was wrapped round his loins another of
a square shape its opposite corners tied round his neck hung like a
mantle or rather a shawl from his shoulders over which were also
strapped a bow and quiver of arrows and a thick mat of cane-work was
secured by thongs to his left arm in the manner of a buckler and swung
at his side or was laid upon his breast as suited his mood or
convenience in other respects he was naked though not without the
native battle-axe of obsidian this weapon consisted of a rod or
bludgeon of heavy wood it was sometimes of copper at the extremity
of which and on either side were fastened six or seven broad blades
or flakes of volcanic glass standing a little apart from each other
its native name maquahuitl was speedily corrupted by the spaniards
into macana a name that is applied in castile to a sabre of lath
and which being more practicable to civilized organs of speech than the
original title is worthy of being preserved the appearance of this
aged warrior presented none of the infirmities of years his stooping
carriage was rather the result of habit than feebleness his step was
quick and firm though ungainly and his eye rolled with the piercing
vivacity of youth over the scene which occupied so much of the
attention of his followers

of these that one whom the castilians at the cypress-tree hesitated
for a moment whether to esteem an indian or a christian man was of a
figure more remarkable for sturdiness than elegance the roll of cloth
round his body extended from his waist where it was secured by a
leathern girdle to his knees the mantle about his shoulders was more
capacious than his fellow's but it left his brawny chest in part
exposed and thereby revealed a skin fairer than belonged to the natives
of anahuac his hair though very long was of a reddish-brown colour
and waving rather than straight and a rough beard of a ruddy hue
though so short that its growth seemed to have been permitted for not
more than the space of a week was another phenomenon not to be looked
for in a barbarian but the indications of civilized origin offered by
these characteristics were set at naught by the step and bearing of the
stranger which were to the full as wild and peculiar as those of his
more ancient companion like whom he carried a buckler and macana
though without the bow and quiver his eye rolled with a like wildness
but his features were european and instead of being entirely barefoot
like the senior his feet were defended by stout sandals of untanned
skin

the third and by far the most remarkable of all was he who had first
caught the eye of najara and upon whom was now concentrated the gaze of
the whole party a figure of the most majestic height and noble
proportions though at the present moment greatly wasted was rather
set off to advantage than concealed by a costume as spare and primitive
as that of the red-bearded man his skin was much tawnier than his
companion's indeed it was of the darkest hue known among the southern
provinces of spain and portugal where the blood of europe has mingled
harmoniously with the life-tides of africa his lofty stature was more
obvious perhaps since he adopted not the bearing or gait of the
others but moved along erect with a graceful demeanour and a step of
natural ease and dignity he had but one characteristic of a mexican
and that was the long hair straight and of an intense blackness that
fell from his temples to his breast with much of a wild and savage
profusion concealing in part a cheek of the finest contour though
somewhat hollowed by hardship and perhaps suffering the puffs of
wind blowing aside this sable curtain disclosed an elevated forehead
crowning a visage in which every feature was of the mould of castile
and after the happiest model of that order of beauty each being
sculptured with a touch that preserved delicacy even while giving
boldness his age would have been a question wherewith to puzzle a
physiognomist there was much in the smoothness of his brow and the
unaltered freshness of a mouth over which was sprouting a mustache
short and bushy as if as lately submitted to the tonsure as the beard
of his companion that spoke of youth just verging into maturity while
on the other hand the complete developement of his frame and the
seriousness of his countenance would have conveyed the impression of an
age many years farther advanced this seriousness of expression was
indeed more than mere gravity it indicated a melancholy or even
sadness which though of a gentle cast was become a settled and
permanent characteristic

as he approached his eyes were like his companions fixed with
curiosity upon the long and dense body of tlascalans from whom they
were only withdrawn when the exclamation of najara attracted them
suddenly to the group at the cypress the confusion of these personages
was so manifest and they handled their arms with an air so indicative
of hostility that the old warrior and the red-bearded man came to an
instant halt and looked as if for instructions to their taller and
more noble-visaged companion he instantly stepped before them and
waving his hand to najara who was hastily fitting a bolt to his
crossbow and to the historian who presented his partisan with greater
alacrity of decision than would have been anticipated from his sluggish
appearance cried aloud

hold friends we are not enemies but christians and castilians

art thou juan lerma and art thou truly alive or do i look upon thy
phantom cried the hunchback with an agitated voice

out fool we are good living men exclaimed the red-bearded man
angrily and with flesh enough upon our bones to cudgel thee into
better manners i trow is this the way you receive old friends
returning from bondage among infidels what bernal diaz thou ass dost
thou not know gaspar olea thine old townsman of medina-del-campo thy
brother-in-arms and sworn friend nor yet the señor don juan lerma my
captain and friend in trouble nor ocelotzin the old ottomi rascal our
guide here

ay oho old rascal old friend all friends all rascals cried the
indian looking affectionately towards the castilians who still stood
in doubt and using the few spanish words with which he was familiar
good friends good rascals castellanos cristianos friends
rascals

while the rest were hesitating the cavalier don francisco de guzman
suddenly stepped out from among them and advancing towards the young
man lerma with a smiling countenance and extended hand said

though i am not thought to be the most loving of thy friends i will be
the first to bid thee welcome señor lerma in token that old feuds do
not mar the satisfaction with which i behold a christian man rescued so
happily and as it appears to me so marvellously from the grave

the emotions and changes of countenance with which the young man heard
these words were various and strongly marked at the first tones of
guzman he started back as if a serpent had suddenly crossed his path
and grew pale while his eyes flashed a ferocious and deadly fire at
the next the blood rushed over his visage and throbbed with a visible
violence in the vessels of his temples while he half raised the macana
which he carried in lieu of a better weapon as if to cleave the
speaker to the earth the next instant the angry suffusion departed
his brows relaxed their severity the deep melancholy gathered again in
his eyes and he surveyed the cavalier with a patient and grave
placidity until the latter had finished his salutation then bending
his head and folding his hands upon his breast he replied mildly and
without a shadow of anger

i have as thou sayest returned from the grave in the sight of which
i strove as a christian should to make my peace with man as well as
with heaven i have done so i am at peace with all i am at peace with
thee but i cannot give thee my hand

the cavalier don francisco received this rejection of his good-will with
no sign of dissatisfaction that was distinguishable by others beyond a
smile or sneer but inclining his head towards lerma he muttered in his
ear 

the strife is unequal but i accept thy defiance thou art but a
broken-legged wolf and wilt fight a fatted tiger i am content

so saying or rather whispering for his words were only caught by the
ears of juan the cavalier turned upon his heel and without
condescending to exhibit his mortification in the vain air of pride and
scorn assumed by ordinary men on such occasions he began to walk
towards the city he was presently followed by the señor camarga who
having fastened upon juan for a few moments a look of intense
curiosity flung when he had satisfied himself his cloak over the
lower part of his visage and thus departed

you give me but a cold welcome good friends said juan looking after
the retreating man with a sigh will no one else in this company offer
his hand to one who burns with joy at the sight of christian faces

when thou art better acquainted with the bounty of the compliment
doubtless but no sooner said the hunchback who had surveyed the
youth with an interest which was belied by his present scorn a good
day to you señor juan lerma and god keep you well there is a good
path over the mountains northward by the way of otumba if you like
not the company of heathens there are fair maids enow in cuba

with these hints which the young man listened to with a disturbed
aspect and which the hunchback accompanied with sour and contemptuous
looks he turned away and began to hobble after his companions

now god be our stay exclaimed juan with some emotion there is not
a man who has a tear for our sorrows or a smile for our joy it were
better we had perished gaspar

i am not ashamed to give thee my hand said bernal diaz shaking off
his amazement and advancing though i know not how far thou art
deserving of such countenance but i must first claim to embrace my old
friend and brother gaspar whom by my faith i can scarce believe that
i see living before me how didst thou thus learn to turn thy toes in
gaspar

away thou dog-eared ill-blooded block cried the red-bearded gaspar
who had watched the turn of proceedings with indignation and now poured
forth his accumulated wrath upon the worthy historian ashamed thou
ashamed thy countenance deserving of thy countenance thou
ill-mannered bog-brained churl and ass thou wilt give the young señor
thy hand if thou dost but lift it i will smite it off with my
battle-axe curmudgeon i thy friend and brother i discard thee and
forswear thee i do marry 

peace gaspar said lerma mildly quarrel not with thy friend on my
account thou hast no offence on thine own it is plain there is but
cold cheer in store for me make none for thyself

oh señor said gaspar sharply for his anger was waxing hot and
unrespective i am no servant no grinning lackey to be told do me
this and do me that by your excellent favour no by your leave
no i am your soldier not your foot-man i will quarrel when i like
and i will not be chidden i am your soldier señor your soldier 

my friend i think said the young man though thou dost now afflict
me more than those who seem my enemies

afflict enemies i afflict cried gaspar fiercely i quarrel
with your enemies ay à outrance as the frenchmen say i have
fought them in italy fuego enemies call this knave by the name and
if i do not smite him to the chine townsman though he be 

peace gaspar if thou art my friend as i trust this good bernal
is 

go to said bernal diaz in high dudgeon addressing himself to
gaspar thou art turned heathen or thou wouldst not so abuse me i
care for you not i have nothing to do with you nor with any of your
companions by and by you will repent god be with you and make you
wiser

with these words the historian followed the example of the others and
was straightway stalking with impetuous strides towards tezcuco

now art you not ashamed gaspar to have given way to this boy's wrath
wilt thou be womanish too

ay said gaspar shaking his head with the fury of a mastiff rending
some meaner animal and thus dashing away certain tears of rage or
mortification that were starting in his eyes it doth make a woman of
me to think we have escaped from dangers such as were never dreamed of
by these false traitors from infidel prisons and heathen maws and
come at last among christian men whom i could have hugged every ill
loon of them all and not one to stretch forth his hand and say god
bless me you were right señor it were better to have remained slaves
with the king of the humming-bird valley than to have left him for such
hangdog welcome

thou wouldst have had nothing to complain of hadst thou bridled thy
impatient temper these men meant not to provoke thee

bad friends bad rascals said the ottomi who during these several
passages had been staring from one christian to another in unconcealed
amazement bad friends no good rascals he muttered in spanish then
instantly changing to mexican which though not his native tongue was
more familiar to him and was besides well understood by juan he
continued

itzquauhtzin the great eagle for thus he chose to designate the
youth has settled upon the hill of kites where are his wings
malintzin is angry he sends his young men to frown here is another he
laughs with his eyes ocelotzin is an old tiger techeechee is a dog
without voice but the itzli is sharp in his hand shall he
strike

footnote itzli the obsidian or volcanic glass

the wild eyes of the barbarian for the ottomies or mountain indians
were the true savages of anahuac were bent with the subtle and
malignant keenness of the tiger whose name he bore upon the alguazil
villafana who standing a little aside and for a time unseen had
watched the salutations and finally the departure of his companions
without himself saying a word he now stepped forward disregarding the
evil looks of the indian as well as those of gaspar whose feelings of
mortification were thirsting for some legitimate object whereon to
expend their fury and stretching forth his hand in the most friendly
manner said to juan

how now señor drive this old cut-throat dog away i claim to be an
old acquaintance and at this moment not a cold one the foxes being
gone the goose may stretch her neck here am i one man at least
heartily glad to find you coming alive from the trap and not afraid to
say so does your favour forget me methinks you have the gift of
rejecting the hands that are offered howsoever you may covet those that
are withheld

you do me wrong i remember you well said juan taking the hand from
which he had first recoiled with a visible reluctance i thank you for
your kindness yes i remember you he repeated with extreme sadness
would i did not

come señor gaspar continued the alguazil turning to olea you and
i were never such friends as true men should be but notwithstanding i
give you my true welcome and most christian congratulations

i ever thought you a knave said gaspar clutching villafana's hand
with a sort of sulky thankfulness being but an eternal grumbler and
reviler at the general but i see you are more of a christian and man
than any other villain of them all fire and blood why do they treat us
thus

oh you shall soon know but how now señor lerma what is your will
will you walk with me to the city we have royal commanders now tis a
matter for the stocks and sometimes the strappado to loiter beyond
the lines after the trumpet's call will you walk to tezcuco or do you
choose rather to betake you to the hills as najara advised you cortes
is another man now señor and somewhat dangerous as you may have
inferred from the bearing of his favourites if you would be wise go
not near him it is not too late

señor villafana said juan what i have seen and heard has filled me
with trouble for like gaspar i looked for such reception as might be
expected by men returning from among heathen oppressors to christian
associates and old friends i know not well what has happened during the
fourteen months of my absence from the army save what was darkly spoken
to me by a certain king in whose hands i have remained with my
companions many months in captivity he gave me to believe that my
countrymen had all fallen in a war with montezuma whom i left in peace
and in strong though undeserved bonds i perceive that i have been
cajoled i rejoice that you are living men but i know not why i should
fear to join myself again among you i claim to be conducted to your
general

it shall be as you choose but señor you are no longer in favour as
for gaspar and the indian it will be well enough with them a good
soldier like gaspar is worth something more than hanging and such a
knave as this old savage can be put to good use señor shall i speak a
word with you bid the two advance i have somewhat to say to you in
private

the young man regarded the alguazil with an anxious countenance and
then desiring his companions to lead the way towards tezcuco followed
at a little distance with villafana




chapter iv


for a few moments the two walked together in silence and at a slow
pace until the others were beyond earshot when villafana suddenly
stopping and casting his eyes upon juan said with but little ceremony

señor juan lerma i am your friend and by st peter who was once a
false one you need one that is both plain and true does your memory
tax you with the commission of any act deserving death

to this abrupt demand the young man answered with an agitated voice
but without a moment's hesitation

it does thou knowest full well and perhaps all others know now that
i have shed the blood of my friend the son of my oldest and truest
benefactor

pho cried villafana hastily i meant not that your friend
indeed come you grieve too much for this at the worst it was the
mishap of a duel a fair duel and i am a witness it was in a
manner forced upon you you should not think of this there are but few
who know of it and none blame you what i meant to ask was this are
you conscious of any crime worthy of death at the hands of cortes

i am not said lerma firmly though very sadly no by mine honour
no i am conscious and it is a thing long since known to all that i
have entirely lost the favour with which he was used to befriend me
nay this was apparent to me before i was sent from his presence i
hoped that in the long period of my exile something might occur to show
him his anger was unjust and with this hope i looked this day to end
my wanderings joyfully i am deceived everything goes to prove that
neither my long sufferings and they were both long and many nor my
supposed death have made my appeal of innocence but i will satisfy him
of this i will demand to know my crime if it be indeed as i think
the death of hilario 

pho be wise he counts not this against thee he has been himself a
duellist say nothing of hilario neither no by the mass nor be thou
so mad as to question him of his anger thou art very sure then i must
be free with thee even to the dulness of repetition thou art very
sure thou hast done nothing to deserve death at his hands

i call heaven to witness said juan that save this unhappy
mischance in the matter of hilario which is itself deserving of death
i am ignorant of aught that should bring me under his displeasure

enough said villafana but i would thou shouldst never more speak of
hilario he is dead heaven rest his soul he was a knave too peace
then to his bones i am satisfied thou hast done naught to cortes
deserving death at his hand i have but one more question to ask
you has cortes done nothing to deserve death at thine

good heavens what do you mean cried juan starting as much at the
sinister tones as the surprising question of the alguazil

do you ask me what you said villafana come i am your friend

as the alguazil pronounced these words with an insinuating frankness
and earnestness he threw into his countenance an expression that seemed
meant to invite the confidence of the young man and encourage him to
expose the mystery of his breast by laying bare the secrets of his own
it was a transfiguration the mean person was unchanged the
insignificant features did not alter their proportions but the smile
that had contorted them was turned into a sneer of fiendish malignancy
and the peculiar sweetness that characterized his eyes was lost in a
sudden glare of passion so demoniacal that it seemed as if the flames
of hell were blazing in their sockets it was the look of but an
instant it made juan recoil with terror but before he could express a
word of this feeling of curiosity or of suspicion it had vanished
the alguazil touched his arm and said quickly though without any
peculiar emphasis

judge for yourself heaven forbid i should breed ill-will where there
is none or plant thorns in my friend's flower-garden judge for
yourself señor if being innocent of all crime cortes has yet doomed
you basely and perfidiously to death 

to death exclaimed juan with a voice that reached the ears of his
late companions and brought them to a sudden stand heaven be my help
and do i come back but to die

you went forth but to die said villafana and you may judge with
what justice come señor the thing is said in a moment the
expedition was designed for your death-warrant

villain exclaimed juan dare you impute this horrible treachery to
cortes

not no not if it appear at all doubtful to your own excellent
penetration replied the alguazil with a laugh i do but repeat you
the belief of some half the army had it been but before the noche
triste i might have said all but in truth we are now more than
half of us new men who know but little of the matter

does any one charge this upon the general said juan with a look of
horror

ay if you call them not villains replied the soldier

i will know the truth said juan i will find who has belied me

you will find that of any one but don hernan señor don juan i pity
you you have returned at an evil moment your presence will chill old
friends and sharpen ancient enemies

if he seek my life it is his but by heaven the man who has wronged
me 

get thy horse and arms first wilt thou be wise thou shalt have
friends to back thee listen a month since there came for thee in a
ship from the islands two very noble horses and a suit of goodly
armour sent as was said by some benevolent friend whom thou mayst be
quicker at remembering than myself

sent by heaven i think said lerma for i know not what earthly
friend would so supply my necessities

oh then said villafana the rumour is they were sent thee by the
lady catalina our general's wife

may heaven bless her exclaimed juan for she is mine only friend
and this bounty i have not deserved

in this matter said villafana dryly she will prove rather thine
enemy that is if thou art resolute to demand the restoration of her
gifts

the restoration

in good truth they were distributed among thine heirs the horse
bobadil thought by many to be the best in the army falling to the
share of thy good friend guzman

to guzman cried juan angrily could they find no better friend to
give him to i will have him back again yea by st juan he shall ride
no steed of mine

right exclaimed villafana for if thou hast an enemy he is the man
thou didst well to refuse his hand he offered it not in love but in
treachery thou wilt ask cortes for thy maligner it needs not remember
don francisco

i will do so said juan with a sigh i thought in my captivity
when i despaired of ever more looking upon a christian face that i had
forgiven my enemies i deceived myself i hate don francisco i will
proclaim him before the whole army if he refuse to do me reparation

i tell thee thou shalt have friends said the alguazil with an
insinuating voice to back thee in this matter as well as in all
others wherein thou hast been wronged but thou must be ruled speak not
to cortes in complaint he will do thee no justice send no defiance of
battle to guzman for this has been proclaimed a sin against god and the
king to be punished with loss of arms degradation and whipping with
rods sometimes with the loss of the right hand you stare oh señor
juan lerma you will find we have a master now a master by the king's
patent who makes his own laws beats and dishonours and gives us to
the gallows when the fit moves him without any necessity of cozening
us to death in expeditions to the gold mines or the south seas

señor villafana said juan firmly i do not believe that in this
thing cortes designed me any wrong nor will i permit myself to think
of it any more you seem to have something to say to me gaspar and the
indian are beyond hearing if you will advise me as a friend in what
manner i shall conduct myself in this difficult conjuncture i will
listen to you with gratitude and with thanks more hearty still if you
make me acquainted with a way to redeem my honour and faith in the eyes
of the general

i have but two things to counsel you make your report of adventures
good and bad to the general without words of complaint or suspicion
and this done demand of him and care not how boldly the restoration
of your horses and armour

if they be the gifts of his lady said juan with hesitation
methinks it will not become me to press this demand on him but rather
to leave it to his own honour and generosity

the alguazil gave the youth a piercing look but seeing in his visage no
embarrassment beyond that of a man who is debating a question of mere
delicacy replied coolly 

ask him then it is not certainly known that these horses came from
doña catalina and perhaps they do not yet it will be but courteous
in thee to say thou hast been so informed and that thou dost so
believe get thy horses by all means but again i say to thee do
nothing to incense the general if he provoke thee show not thy
displeasure at least show it not now i will give thee more reasons
for what i counsel as we walk through the city

by this time the speakers had reached the gates of the city where
gaspar and the ottomi stood in waiting for them




chapter v


the walls of mexico were the foaming surges of her lake the cities on
the shore when much exposed by defencelessness of site great wealth of
inhabitants or other causes to the attacks of enemies were surrounded
by walls commonly of earth though sometimes as in the case of
tezcuco of stone these were ordinarily of no great height or
strength but sufficient when well manned to repel the assaults of the
slingers and archers of america

the external fortifications of tezcuco were as became the ancient rival
of tenochtitlan of a more imposing order the walls were thick and
high with embattled parapets and deep ditches at the base the gates
were protected in the manner common to the land by the overlapping so
to speak of the opposite walls that is being made as they approached
each other to change from their straight to a circular course the one
traversing upon a greater radius than the other they thus swept by and
round each other in parallel curves leaving a long and narrow
passage between them commanded not only by the walls themselves but by
strong stone turrets built on their extremities

besides these defences there was erected within the walls and directly
opposed to each entrance a small pyramid elevated fifteen or twenty
feet above the walls and crowned with little sanctuaries thus serving
a religious as well as a military purpose in the one sense these
structures might be considered chapels of ease to the greater temples of
the quarters in which they stood in the other they were not unlike the
cavaliers or commanding mounds of european fortification from the
tops and sides of which the besieger could be annoyed whilst without
the walls and arrested on his course when within

thus then there were ready to his hands fortifications of which the
spanish commander now the captain-general of new spain as the
unsubdued mexico was already called was not slow to reap the full
advantage a strong guard of castilian soldiers was posted before each
gate a native watchman sat on each turret and a line of tlascalan
sentries stepping proudly along in their places of trust occupied the
lofty terrace of the walls

the edifices disclosed to juan when he had with his companions passed
through the staring warders into the town were similar to those of
mexico of stone and low though often adorned with turrets in all
cases the roofs were terraced and covered with shrubs and flowers and
the passion of the citizens for such delightful embellishments had
converted many a spacious square into gardens wherein fluttered and
warbled birds of a thousand hues and voices

over these open spaces were seen in different quarters the tops of
high pyramids and towers scattered about the town in vast and
picturesque profusion

the roaring sound of life that pervades a great city even when
unassisted by the thundering din of wheeled carriages gave proof enough
of the dense multitudes that inhabited tezcuco the eye detected the
evidences of a population still more astonishing in the myriads of
tawny bodies that crowded the streets the gardens the temple squares
and the housetops many of whom seemed to have no other habitation in
fact the introduction of the many thousands who composed the train or
as it was called the army of the brigantines added to the hosts of
other warriors previously collected by cortes and the presence of the
original inhabitants gave to tezcuco that appearance of an
over-crowded suffocating vitality which is presented by the modern
babylons of france and great britain the murmur of voices the
pattering of feet the rustling of garments with the sounds of
instruments wielded by artisans both native and christian made
together a din that seemed like the roar of a tempest to the ears of
one who like lerma had just escaped from the mute hills and the
silent forests of the desert at a distance beheld from the
cypress-tree the view of tezcuco seemed to embrace a scene made up of
tranquillity and repose the same thing is true of all other cities and
the same thing may be said of human life when we sit aloof and
contemplate the bright pageant in which we take no part if we advance
and mingle with it the picture is turned to life the peace to tumult
and we lose all the charms of the prospect in the distractions of
participation

as juan conducted by the alguazil made his way through the torrents of
bodies which poured through every street and became more accustomed to
move among them the excitement gradually subsided in his breast the
colour faded from his cheeks and by the time he had reached the end of
his journey there remained no expression on his visage beyond that of
its usual and characteristic sadness this was deepened perhaps by the
scene around him for it is the virtue of melancholy where it exists as
a temperament or has become a settled trait to be increased by the
excitements of a city or crowd perhaps it was darkened also by the
reflection as he raised his eyes to the vast palace in which cortes had
established his head-quarters that among all its crowds the military
guards at the door and the lounging courtiers within there was not a
single friend waiting to rejoice over his return

the house of nezahualcojotl who has been already mentioned as the most
famous and refined of the tezcucan kings possessed but little to
distinguish it from the edifices of nobles around except its greatness
of extent it was a pile or cluster of many houses built of vast blocks
of basalt well cut and polished surrounding divers courts and
gardens what might be termed the wings consisting of but a basement
story which was relieved from monotony by the presence of towers and
battlements and the sculptured effigies of animals and serpents on the
walls and particularly around the narrow loops which served for
windows the centre or principal portion had an additional story
loftier towers and more imposing sculptures the windows were carved of
stone so as to resemble the yawning mouths of beasts of prey the
battlements were crouching tigers and the pillars of the great door
were palm-trees round the trunks of which twined two immense serpents
whose necks met at the lintel among the interlocking branches and
embraced and supported a huge tablet on which was engraven the aztec
calendar according to the singular and yet just system of the ancient
native astronomers sixty years after this period the sages of
europe discovered and adopted a mode of adjusting the civil to the
astronomical time so as to avoid for the future the confusion the
utter disjointing of seasons which had been the consequence of the
julian computation at this very moment the barbarians of america were
in possession of a system which enabled them to anticipate and rectify
by proper intercalations the disorders not only of years but of
cycles and how much earlier the wisdom of civilization has not yet
divined

on the whole there was something not less impressive than peculiar in
the appearance of an edifice which had sheltered a long line of
autochthonous monarchs and as juan passed from the square in front of
the artillery that commanded it under the folds of the mighty serpents
at the door and into the sombre shadows of the interior he was struck
with a feeling of awe which was not immediately removed even by the
more stirring emotions of the instant

the hall or rather vestibule in which he now found himself was
distinguished rather than animated by the presence of many spaniards
of high and low degree some clustered together in groups some stalking
to and fro in haughty solitude while others bustled about with an air
of importance and authority but all as lerma quickly observed
preserving a decorous silence conversing in whispers and moving with
a cautious tread as if in the ante-room of a king instead of the hall
of a soldier-of-fortune like themselves

a few of them bent their eyes upon the strangers and stepped forward to
survey their savage equipments the keen glances which they cast towards
him the hurried and somewhat sonorous exclamations with which they
pointed him out to one another but more than all the presence of
najara of bernal diaz and of the stranger camarga among them
convinced juan that he was recognized but with this conviction came
also the sickening consciousness that not one had a smile of
satisfaction to bestow upon him in the way of welcome he remembered the
faces of many and once or twice he raised his hand and half stepped
forward to meet some one or other who seemed disposed to salute him he
was deceived those who came nighest were only the most curious they
nodded their heads familiarly to villafana a few returned the advances
of lerma with solemn and reverential bows but none raised up their
heads to meet the exile's advances

the curse of ingratitude follow you all cold knaves muttered gaspar
between his teeth the eyes of the ottomi twinkled upon the groups with
a mixture of wonder and malignant wrath juan smothered his sighs and
strode onwards

he stopped suddenly at a door wreathed like the outer with snakes
though carved of wood over which hung curtains of some dark and heavy
texture and behind which as it seemed to him from the murmuring of
voices was the apartment in which the captain-general gave audience to
his followers and the allied tribes of mexico who made up what may be
called as it seemed to be considered his court here juan paused and
turning to the alguazil said calmly and with a low voice

from what i have seen and now see i perceive it will not be fitting i
should approach the general especially in these weeds which can scarce
extenuate the coldness of my old companions without the ceremony of an
announcement and expressed permission

fear not whispered villafana with a grim smile thy friend
francisco will have done thee this good turn remember offend him not
now but still lay claim to the horses

as he spoke the alguazil pushed aside the curtain and in a moment
more the youth was in the presence of cortes




chapter vi


the apartment into which juan now found himself introduced was very
spacious and indeed had the height of the ceiling corresponded in
proportion with the length and breadth would have been esteemed vast
without being so low as to be decidedly mean it was yet depressed
enough to show how little the principles of taste had extended among the
natives to the art of architecture or what is equally probable how
wisely provision was made against the earthquakes and other convulsions
so naturally to be expected in a land of volcanoes

the huge rafters of cedar carved into strange and emblematic
arabesques were supported at intervals by a double row of pillars of
the most grotesque shapes on the walls were hung arras on which were
painted rude scenes of battle and of sacrifice with hieroglyphic
records of history as well as choice maxims of virtue and policy
selected from the compositions of that king who had finished and given
name to the habitation long since founded by his ancestors it was
lighted in a manner equally rare and magnificent a considerable space
in the further or western wall from which the tapestry was drawn aside
was occupied by stone mullions of strange forms between which were
fixed large translucent blocks of alabaster such as we now behold in
the church windows of puebla de los angelos upon these were painted
many incomprehensible figures which would have deformed the beauty of
the stone but for the brilliancy and delicacy of their hues as it was
the strong glare of the evening sun falling upon this transparent wall
came through it with the mellow lustre and harmonious tints of a
harvest-moon shedding a soft but sufficient light over the whole
apartment making what was harsh tender and what was lovely almost
divine

footnote windows of this rich material were discovered in a roman
villa at pompeii the effect of a lamp in an alabaster vase will be
familiar to the reader

on the left hand were several narrow doors opening upon a garden
which was seen sometimes when the breeze stirred aside the curtains
that defended them on the right were others leading to certain
chambers and carefully protected by a similar drapery

the floor of this hall of audience was covered with mats stained with
various colours

at the farther extremity of the apartment stood a group of spanish
cavaliers surrounding a platform of slight elevation on which
sumptuously dressed and leaning upon a camoncillo or chair of state
stood hernan cortes at his right hand sitting and supported by two
gallant cavaliers was his royal god-son ixtlilxochitl now don hernan
cortes the king of tezcuco a young man of mild aspect at whose feet
sat his younger and more manly brother suchel from whom was afterwards
derived one of the noble families of new spain on the left of the
general were two indians of a far nobler presence and known by the
singular loftiness of their plumes if not by the commanding sternness
of their visages to be tlascalans of high degree they were in fact
the military chieftains xicotencatl and chichimecatl men of renown not
only among their tribes but the spaniards behind each stood his page
or esquire bearing the great shield of ceremony whereon were
emblazoned in native heraldic devices the various exploits of his
master

besides these distinguished barbarians there were others of note among
the cavaliers at the side of the platform

all these several details of a spectacle both romantic and imposing
were seen by juan at a single glance for almost at the moment of his
entrance a movement was made among those who stood on the left of the
platform in the direction of the great conquistador as if they desired
to catch something that instant falling from his lips as they left the
view thus open juan saw that cortes instead of speaking was bending
his head and listening with eager interest to the señor guzman who had
ascended the platform and was now whispering in his ear at the same
moment a prodigiously large dog with shaggy coat hanging lips and
ferocious eyes roused by the motion of the general at whose feet he
had been sleeping raised his head and stared with the majestic gravity
of a lion upon the speaker and his master

there was something in the interested and agitated eagerness with which
the captain-general drank in the words of guzman that went to the heart
of lerma he doubted not that don francisco was at that moment
speaking of him of his return to the society of christians and to
the arms of his benefactor for such had cortes once been to him and
he read in the varying play of don hernan's features nothing but
refutation of the malign charges of villafana and full proof that the
general was not indifferent to the friend of former years

as these thoughts entered his mind he rushed forward under their
impulse with clasped hands and with an exclamation that brought the
looks of all instantly upon him the huge dog raised himself half up
from the platform and uttered a savage growl he advanced yet another
step and the ferocious beast with a roar that filled the whole
chamber dashed furiously from the platform as against an enemy not to
be doubted the young man paused but not at the opposition of the
animal he had that moment caught the eye of don hernan and his heart
failed as he beheld the frown of rage and as it seemed to him hate
with which he was regarded

down befo cried cortes with a voice of thunder

but befo who had leaped forward with such ferocious determination had
that instant stopped before juan whom he now eyed with a look of
wonder and recognition then suddenly fetching such a yelp of joy as
would have better become the playmate-cur of a child than the grim
bloodhound of a soldier he raised up his vast body flung his paws upon
juan's breast and strove evidently to throw them round his body in
the mode of human embrace whining all the time with the most expressive
delight

down befo thick-lips thou cub of a false wolf repeated the
general irefully yet with an expression that would have suited better
had he been commanding him to tear the youth to pieces down fool
down i will stick thee with my rapier

as he spoke he half drew his sword from the scabbard

harm him not call him not away cried juan with a thick voice for
by heaven and st mary he is all of a troop of christian men once my
friends who have any joy to see an old companion return from bonds and
the grave

as the young man spoke he flung his arms round the neck of the faithful
beast and bending his head upon befo's face gave way to a passion of
tears

the shame of foul knaves and false companions be on you all cried the
flaming gaspar without a whit regarding the presence in which he spake
his wrath was cut short before it had been noticed by any but the
ottomi who stood gaping at a distance with looks of visible alarm
first excited by the appearance of the dog

among most of the cavaliers now present juan had been once well known
and however their affections might be chilled and their respect
destroyed by untoward circumstances there was something so painfully
reproachful in the spectacle of his tears that a strong impression was
immediately produced among them all seemed at once to remember that
he had been once esteemed notwithstanding his youth of a bold heart
and manly bearing and all seemed to remember also that fourteen
months suffering among unknown pagans was worthy of some little
commiseration

but there was one present of more fiery feelings and determination more
hasty than any of the christians the elder and taller of the tlascalan
chiefs distinguished as much by a haughty and darkly frowning visage as
by an herculean frame stepped down from the platform and laid his hand
upon juan's shoulder in which position he stood without speaking a
word but expressing in his countenance the spirit of one who avowed
himself a patron and champion the tall plume rustled like a waving
palm as he raised up his head and the look that he cast upon cortes
seemed to mingle defiance with disdain but this hostile expression was
perhaps concealed by the approach of a cavalier of gallant appearance
who stepped suddenly from the throng and snatching up juan's left hand
from the dog's neck cried with hasty good-will

santiago and the devil take all of us that have no better hearts than
a cur or a wild indian i know no reason certainly why thou shouldst
be treated like a dog god be with thee juan lerma i am glad thou art
alive god bless thee and so hold up thy head if thou hast no better
raiment i will give thee my fustian breeches and liver-coloured mantle
as well as a good sword of iron which i have to spare

this quick-spoken and benevolent cavalier was no less a man than the
gallant don pedro de alvarado at this time called almost universally
in memory of his famous leap over the ditch of tacuba in the night of
sorrow the capitan del salto he gave place to another of still
greater renown who would have been perhaps the first to extend his
hand had he been as hasty of resolution as his more mercurial comrade
this was the good cavalier don gonzalo de sandoval better esteemed for
his skill in arms than any peculiar elegance of conversation

juan lerma said he i am not sorry thou art alive and well and if
thou wilt make any use of the same to put thee into more christian
bravery i will pray thee to take my gold chain as well as six good
cotton shirts which an indian woman made me

to these friendly salutations and bountiful offers as well as the
advances of other cavaliers who now bustled around him juan replied
with a manner more expressive of indignation than gratitude he was
ashamed of having exposed his weakness and sensible that it was this
alone which had obtained him a charitable notice he raised his head
proudly as one who would not accept such compelled kindness pushed
befo to the floor though still keeping a hand upon his neck
acknowledged the presence of xicotencal with a word and turned towards
cortes a countenance now quite composed though not without a touch of
sorrowful resentment

the emotion which had produced such an impression among the cavaliers
was not without its effect even upon the captain-general his features
relaxed their angry severity he stepped forwards and when juan lifted
up his eyes he beheld a hand extended towards him and heard the voice
of cortes say in tones of concession though of embarrassment

god be with you you do us wrong in this matter as a christian man
escaped from bondage we are not unrejoiced to see you as a soldier
returning from a delayed duty we will declare our thoughts of you
anon

there was nothing very gracious either in the words or tones of the
speaker but they were unexpected they swept away the proud and angry
resolutions of juan and restored to him the warm feelings of affection
and gratitude with which he had ever been accustomed to regard the
general he seized the proffered hand pressed it to his lips and
seemed about to throw himself at don hernan's feet when suddenly a
noise was heard at a curtained door hard by accompanied by what seemed
the smothered shriek of a woman at this sound the young man started up
with a look of fear and yielded up the hand which was abruptly snatched
from his own he gazed round him and plainly beheld the thick cloth
before the nearest passage shaking as if disturbed by the recent
passage of some one but nothing else he perceived no new countenance
added to those of the many in audience which were directed upon his
own with an universal stare of wonder his attention was recalled by
the voice of cortes he turned the general was seated a stern and iron
gravity had taken the place of relenting feeling on his visage and it
was evident to the unfortunate juan that the hour of reconciliation had
passed away and for ever the cavaliers retreated the tlascalan and
the dog were all that remained by his side and as if to make his
disgrace both undeniable and intolerable the señor guzman maintained
throughout the whole scene his post at the general's side confronted
face to face with his fallen rival

we are ready to hear thee juan lerma said the captain-general with
a voice at once cold and commanding you went hence to explore the
lands of the west and the sea that rolls among them we argue much
success and great discoveries from the time devoted to these purposes
and from the discretion you evinced in pursuing them for a whole year
and more rather than by returning with your forces to share in the
dangerous fights of mexico what have you to say you had some good
followers both christian and unconverted stand thou aloof gaspar
olea i will presently speak with thee hast thou brought none back
with thee but the barba-roxa gaspar of the red beard

there was not a word in this address which did not sting the young man
to the heart and the insulting insinuation which a portion of it
conveyed was uttered in a tone of the most cutting sarcasm he
trembled reddened clenched his hand in the shaggy coat of befo who
still though beckoned by cortes refused to leave the exile until the
animal whined with pain then smothering his emotions like one who
perceives that he is wronged and knowing that complaint will be
unavailing is resolute to suffer with fortitude he elevated his lofty
figure with tranquil dignity looked upon cortes with an aspect no
longer reproachful and replied

besides gaspar who is worthy of your excellency's confidence and
thanks no one returns with me save the ottomi ocelotzin the tiger a
man to whom should be accorded the praise of having saved the life of
gaspar which is valuable to your excellency and my own which is
worthless

as he spoke he pointed to the ancient barbarian who stepped forward
with the same affectionate smiles and grimaces which he had bestowed
upon the party at the cypress-tree and with many uncouth gestures of
reverence saying in imperfect castilian after he had touched the
floor with his hand and then kissed it

ottomi i good friend good rascal but ocelotzin no more
i am techeechee the silent dog the little dog without
voice techeechee

footnote techichi a native animal of the dog kind which does not
bark it was domesticated

as he spoke he cast his eyes with less of love than admiring fear
upon the gigantic beast whose voice was to him as well as to his
countrymen more terrible than the yell of the mountain tiger

i remember thee good fellow said the captain-general

then without bestowing any further present notice on him he turned
again to juan speaking with the same cold and magisterial tones

and where then are the two christians of la mancha and the seventy
warriors of matlatzinco who composed your party the arms you carried
and the four good horses entrusted to your charge

your excellency shall hear said juan calmly the two manchegos were
ill inclined to the expedition and therein were my followers but
unfortunately selected

they were mutineers cried gaspar whose anger was not mollified by
being made a witness to the ill fate of his young captain they were
mutineers and so the devil has them

hah exclaimed cortes starting up with what seemed angry joy didst
thou dare arrogate the privileges of a judge and condemn a christian
man to death

i am guiltless of such presumption said juan to their
dissatisfaction to their disobedience nay to their frequent threats
and open disregard of the commands your excellency had yourself imposed
upon us not to provoke the indians among whom we might be
journeying i adjudged no punishment but the assurance that your
excellency should certainly be made acquainted with their acts with
much persuasion i prevailed upon them to follow me until we had
reached the sea which it was your excellency's command i should first
examine

ay said cortes again starting up but with an air of exultation
thou hast found it then and a port that may give shelter to ships of
burthen

not one port only but many said juan with a faltering voice
mistaking the satisfaction of the leader for approbation in a space of
seventy leagues for so much of the coast was i able to survey there
are many harbours exceedingly spacious deep and secure and some of
such excellence that i question whether the world contains any others
to equal them near to some there is much good ship timber as well as
lands amazingly fertile and beautiful

this is well said the captain-general coldly thou hast well
devoted a year of time to the examination of seventy leagues of coast

had that been the only subject of your excellency's orders said
lerma you should have had no cause for dissatisfaction this
accomplished it became me as your excellency had commanded to explore
those gold lands to the northwest and discover that kingdom of
huitzitzila as it was erroneously called by montezuma which bordered
upon his dominions and had ever maintained its independence by force of
arms

at these words many of the cavaliers looked surprised as if made
acquainted with this article of juan's instructions for the first time
and some exchanged meaning glances which were not lost on cortes he
frowned and hastily exclaimed

you are wrong i commanded you not that kingdom being at enmity with
mexico it was not fit your lives should be endangered by rashly
adventuring within its confines you were advised if you should find we
had been deceived in the character of those infidels of huitzitzila to
make yourself acquainted with them and their country but this was left
to your discretion

it is true said juan mildly your excellency did so advise me and
the fault which i committed was in thinking that i should best please
you by penetrating to that land without much thought of difficulty or
danger in this as in other things as gaspar will be my witness i was
opposed by those unhappy manchegos who deserted from me in the night
carrying with them to replace a horse which they had lost in a river
the charger which your excellency had given to me for my own riding as
well as their arquebuses which was still more unfortunate for
gaspar's piece had been broken by a fall and we were thus left without
firearms with but one horse and no better weapon to procure us food
than mine own crossbow and the arrows of the matlatzincos

now by my conscience said cortes i know not which the more to
admire the good vigilance that allowed these knaves to escape or the
rash-brained folly which led you to continue the expedition without
them

the sarcasm produced no change in juan's visage he seemed to have made
up his mind not only to endure injustice but to expect it

their desertion was neither unforeseen nor unopposed he answered it
is my grief to say that they forgot the obligations both of discipline
and christianity and desperately fired upon gaspar and myself whereby
they killed our remaining horse and wounded myself in the side

and where then were thy knavish indians that thou didst not slay the
false traitors on the spot cried cortes with an indignation which
this time had the right direction

the answer to this added but another item of mischance to the young
man's story the arts of the manchegos had spread disaffection among his
indian followers many of whom had deserted with them following after
the mutineers he was shortly after abandoned by the rest and then
his little party consisting only of gaspar and the ottomi was
attacked by hostile tribes driven back upon the path and finally
forced to take refuge in the dominions of that native monarch whose
reputed grandeur and wealth had so long since excited the curiosity of
don hernan

the relation of lerma though of such thrilling interest that it
absorbed the attention of all present and even so wrought upon the mind
of cortes that he gradually discharged the severity of his countenance
and even at last ceased altogether to interrupt it with sarcasm or
commentary of any kind has too little or at least too indirect a
connexion with the present history to require it to be given in the
exile's words or at any length with the main facts his long
captivity and final escape the reader is already acquainted and it is
not perhaps necessary to add more than that the kingdom of which so much
has been said was that of mechoacan and that its capital tzintzontzan
the place of hummingbirds corrupted by the mexicans into huitzitzila
lies yet though dwindled into the meanest of villages upon the
beautiful lake pascuaro juan knew nothing of the fate of the manchegos
by a comparison of dates it was discovered that the sudden outbreaking
of hostilities which had driven him into this remote land had followed
almost immediately upon the tumults in mexico which had resulted in the
death of montezuma and the expulsion of the spaniards and it was not
doubted that the mutineers had met a miserable and speedy death with
the account of lands of unexampled beauty and fertility of rivers of
gold and hills of silver we have nothing to do except to remark that
it determined the fate of mechoacan as certainly as if the order had
been uttered for its immediate subjugation the whole account might have
been omitted except that it was necessary as the means of explaining
some of the feelings with which the young lerma was regarded by the
general and his chief followers

there is no eloquence so persuasive as that of distress uttered without
complaint and no story of hardship and peril fails of exciting
sympathy when recounted with truth and modesty accordingly the
narrative of the exile produced among the cavaliers a powerful
impression in his favour which was heightened into admiration by the
consciousness that nothing but the greatest constancy of purpose and
mental resources beyond those of ordinary men could have conducted him
through his long and perilous enterprise many of those who seemed to
remember with most interest the breach between the general and one who
had been formerly considered almost his adopted son kept their eyes
curiously bent on cortes and they did not doubt from the changes of
his countenance that his better feelings were deeply engaged and would
perhaps restore the young man to the confidence and affection which all
knew he had lost this belief became universal when at the close of
the story the captain-general arose and addressing the throng said

cavaliers and friends we will free all present from the tedium of this
audience saving only the gentlemen of the secret counsel and these our
returned friends nay by my faith gaspar of the red beard thou mayst
depart likewise to speak thy adventures to thine old friends which
thou art doubtless itching to do or if thou likest that better get
thee to antonio de quinones our master of the armory and choose
thyself a good sword buckler and breastplate thou art a true soldier
and by and by i have somewhat to say to thee the knave has the gait
of an infidel

at this signal for breaking up the audience which was pronounced with
the grave and easy authoritativeness of one long accustomed to command
the individuals present christian and heathen princes chieftains and
cavaliers took their departure leaving behind them sandoval alvarado
and a few other officers of high standing

as juan stood embarrassed between hope and doubt the señor guzman
descended from the platform and passing him said with a low voice and
a derisive smile

you mount señor and bobadil neighs for you it is better the war is
equal

so saying he passed on




chapter vii


señor juan lerma said cortes when the last of the assemblage had
reluctantly departed he had descended from the platform and spoke
with a voice which if not decidedly friendly was at least free from
every trace of sternness señor juan lerma i have to say that for
the result of your enterprise however it has been attended by calamity
you deserve both thanks and honours and it will rest upon your own
determination whether you shall obtain them or not some things there
are growing out of this affair of which it becomes me to speak and
thereby i shall give you an opportunity to remove certain stains not yet
washed from your good name and after that to take off others that are
thought to attach to mine hast thou not heard of those fierce and fatal
wars that broke out in mexico shortly after thy departure

i have said juan the king's spies brought the news to tzintzontzan
and they were not only lamentable to hear but they caused us to be cast
into cages and devoted as we feared to die the death of sacrifice
for know señor the sanguinary mexitli is the god of all this land

and hadst thou no suspicion before departing that these wars were
brewing and threatening us with destruction thou wert somewhat quicker
in catching the heathen tongue than others and wert not without
counsellors and friends even among the household of montezuma

to this demand the young man though embarrassed by the innuendo that
followed it did not hesitate to answer

i had such suspicions and i made them known to your excellency

you did indeed said cortes musingly and i derided them being
somewhat heated at the time but counsel to an irritated temper is even
sharper than salt on a wounded skin this knowledge señor he went
on some will impute to thee as good reason why thou shouldst loiter
fourteen months in the wilderness to avoid sharing in our perils which
were somewhat more horrible than have ever before beset christian men

this said juan firmly and a little dryly for there was something
in the tone of the speaker which though he knew not why impressed him
unpleasantly this is to make me a coward which your excellency will
not believe me to be

by my conscience no said cortes with emphasis without much
thought of this present expedition of which we speak there is no man
will accuse thee of fear who has heard of thy voyage in the fusta by
my conscience a most mad piece of daring he continued as if in
admiration although it was observable that while he spoke his
countenance darkened as though there were some disagreeable thought
associated with the recollection no he went on there will be more
said of anger and ambition than of terror thou knowest we have envy
and detraction about us that spare none i can hear already how
villafana and other knaves of his peevish malicious temper will speak
of thee they will speak of thy causes for resentment of the promised
favour of the plotting king a principality among the lakes with the
hope of loftier succession and the hand of the princely maiden of the
star  

and this cried juan interrupting the general this is to make me a
traitor and apostate señor i doubt not that the señor guzman is at the
bottom of all this slander and i therefore claim to defie 

peace wilt thou put thyself in opposition again if thou dost but
raise thy hand in wrath save against an infidel enemy thou wert better
never to have been born

the sudden sternness with which these words were uttered checked the
impetuosity of the youth and filled him again with anxious forebodings
the general instantly resuming the milder tones with which he had
spoken before continued

so much will be said of thee before i offer thee my hand in token
that i desire to forget everything of the past but that i once truly
loved thee and before i propose to thee a new and honourable
duty hear not what will be but what has been said of myself in
relation to thine expedition and to thee

here the general paused a moment eyeing the youth intently as if to
read his most secret thoughts then continuing he said with the utmost
gravity

it has been said of me señor juan lerma that i sent thee upon thy
enterprise of the south seas in the malicious thought that the blow of
savages might execute the sentence of vengeance i cared not to commit to
a christian assassin what thinkest thou of this

even that it is the blackest and insanest of slanders and that it
shows me i have little cause to marvel at my own loss of credit when i
find that malice can aim even at your excellency's whatever may have
been your anger i never believed your excellency would conceal it much
less expend it in secret vengeance upon a feeble wretch like myself

thou hast but little worldly knowledge said the captain-general half
smiling or thou wouldst know that revenge is of a reptile's nature
crawling rather in secret among dark thickets than openly over sunny
plains and none the less venomous that it can lie half a year torpid
neither put thou much trust in innocent looks which to a shrewd eye
are like sea-water the smoother they lie the deeper can they be
looked into

having pronounced these metaphorical maxims with much gravity his eye
all the time bent on the youth cortes paused for a moment as if for a
reply when receiving none for in truth juan not well comprehending
them knew not what to answer he continued

let us understand one another there has been strife between
us strife and ill-will i have perhaps done you injustice i thought i
had cause by my conscience young man i once loved you very well i
have been sorry for you

i have deserved your displeasure said juan hurriedly moved by the
earnestness with which the general spoke but i hope not beyond
forgiveness

surely not surely not said cortes but what i may forget as thy
friend i am still bound to consider as thy general i am now the king's
officer and it becomes me forgetting all private feelings to know no
friends but those who approve themselves true and valuable servants of
his majesty in this character i must remember some of thy past acts
with disfavour but in both it is not improper i should desire thou
shouldst have opportunity fully to retrieve thy good name and in spite
of envy and detraction to deserve such friendship as i have shown thee
in former years

the exile pondered a moment over the words of the general in more
indecision than before they spoke of friendship and kindness and
seemed to offer an apology for severity that was rather official than
personal and yet in this apology was a degree of reproach of which
it appeared cortes's resolution to keep him always sensible
nevertheless this very tone of complaint served to soothe the little
exasperation of feelings which had remained in juan's breast while
smarting under a sense of wrong and injustice anger both irritates and
hardens the heart reproach softens while it distresses it seemed
obvious to juan that cortes while apprizing him that a full
reconciliation had not yet taken place was willing nay anxious that
it should he answered therefore with the greatest fervour

if your excellency will but show me in what manner i may regain your
favour at least your belief that i have not wantonly rejected it i
call heaven to witness i will remember it as such an act of kindness as
that which this must ever keep me in memory of

as he spoke he touched with his finger a rapier-scar on his right
breast which the narrowness and peculiar fashion of his mantle scarcely
enabled him to conceal even when so disposed

at this sight cortes seemed disordered if not offended saying after
striding to and fro for an instant

let these follies be forgotten bury the past and think only of the
future it is true i avenged thy wrong it gives me no pleasure to
remember it did i think this when i made thee my son fed thee at my
board lodged thee on my couch advanced thee honoured thee fought thy
battles did i think this pho juan lerma thou hast not repaid me
well

señor said juan surprised and confounded by the sudden and
reproachful bitterness of these words when i presumed to speak to you
in opposition to your measures it was with the boldness the folly of
affection jealous for your excellency's your excellency's 

honour said cortes sharply let us speak of this no more to
business señor to business leave mine honour to mine own keeping
thou wilt find i have it even in my thoughts to business to business
what say ye councillors wilt thou truly steal my dog from me if you
rob me of naught else it is no matter what say you señor capitan del
salto what say you sandoval is this young man fit to be entrusted
with a captain's command he was a good cornet can we confide to him a
duty of danger and trust his pilgrimage to the hummingbird-land
methinks was well conducted what say you i have a goodly thought for
him but i will abide your better judgment

by st james said alvarado there is no braver lad in the army and
were he but of clear hidalgo lineage i should say give him a command
with the best but here is my thought he is a good sailor especially
in piraguas and galleys give him a brigantine i will crave to have him
in the squadron attached to mine own division

in my mind said sandoval he is good for the land service it is
needful we revenge the death of salcedo and his eighty loons who
suffered themselves to be killed before tochtepec lerma has the love of
the dog xicotencal who loves nobody else he can follow the young
señor with some twenty thousand or so of his bare-legs and they can
take the town among them

a good thought said cortes a good thought for this is a command
which nobody coveting there will be none to envy what sayst thou
señor lerma wilt thou adventure upon a deed thought to be both
dangerous and desperate choose for thyself i will compel thee to
nothing i tell thee the truth no captain seeks after this employment
and three have refused except upon condition that i give them besides
as many indians as they can raise three hundred picked spaniards thou
canst not look for more than twenty with some five or six horsemen

the eyes of the exile sparkled

your excellency honours me

never think so deceive not thyself said cortes with apparent
frankness the enterprise is dangerous nay as i have said desperate
and by my conscience it will be said of it as of the south sea
journey that it is devised for thy ruin if i honour thee i must
suffer thereby no evil can happen to thee that will not be maliciously
imputed to wicked and premeditated design by my conscience there are
many who think me but a hangman in disguise

i hope your excellency will not think of these things said juan
fervently i will do battle with any one who presumes 

peace have i not told thee already that the duel is forbidden under
heavy penalties i swear to thee they shall be enforced in all cases
of disobedience were it upon my own brother i tell thee again i can
advance thee to no service which will not make me the mark of slander
there are fools about us who i know not why have tortured anger into
hatred and will now interpret good-will into malignant treachery but i
care not for this the tall tree catches the bolts that pass by the
underwood the rock that rises above the sea is lashed by breakers
while the grovellers at the bottom lie in tranquillity it is thus with
the condition of man peace abides with the lowly envy shoots arrows
at the high think of this think of this juan lerma when thou hearest
me maligned

i shall not need said juan the more dangerous the duty the more
must i thank your excellency for your confidence i beseech therefore
that i may be permitted to undertake this present enterprise

wilt thou march them on foot and with no better arms than thy indian
battle-axe and buckler demanded the general gravely

i have heard said juan with hesitation that your excellency has in
charge certain horses and arms which of right are mine as being the
gifts of a bountiful friend

it is even so said cortes and the restoration of them which thou
canst justly claim will cause some heart-burnings i must crave your
pardon for having presumed to bestow them away as though they had been
mine own property

under your favour said juan considering that they were the gifts of
your excellency's ever honoured and beloved lady 

ha cried cortes with a darkening visage what fiend possessed thee
with this impertinent conceit

i beg your excellency's pardon for my presumption said juan which
was indeed caused no more by rumour than by a belief that there was no
other being in the world who could thus far have befriended me

why then said cortes if thou knowest not the donor it is the more
remarkable for nobody else does very strange two horses the worst of
which is worth full nine hundred crowns and bobadil almost
priceless a suit of armour so well chosen to thy stature that never a
man of us all but is as loose in the cuirass as a shrivelled walnut in
the shell all very positively sent to thee from santiago for thee
señor and for nobody else

they are saint's gifts said alvarado devoutly the young man has
suffered much and has found favour with heaven

señor said juan mildly you are jesting with me i will hope by
and by to discover this benevolent patron what i have to say now is
that my wants will be content with but one of the horses the return of
which will cause your excellency no trouble the same being in the
hands of the señor guzman who has already signified his intention to
restore him

ha has he so indeed why thy very enemies have become thy friends

as for the armour señor continued the youth without thinking fit to
notice the latter exclamation i will make no claim to it if you have
bestowed it away a simple morion and breastplate or indeed a good cap
and doublet of escaupil if iron be scarce will content me provided i
have but a good sword and steed

thou shalt have both said cortes and the plate-mail also which
being somewhat too gigantic for any cavalier and too good for a common
soldier i have preserved thinking some day to bestow it upon the
tlascalan xicotencal thou art not loath to undertake this business i
will give thee a day to think of it

not an hour señor said juan ardently give me but time to exchange
these heathen weeds and sandals for good armour and a warhorse and i
will depart instantly with whatsoever force you may think fit to
entrust to me

art thou really then so hot after danger

god is my protection said juan i thank heaven that this duty is
the most dangerous your excellency could charge me with it is for that
reason the most honourable

sayst thou so cried the captain-general quickly there is one
duty at least i could impose upon thee which thou wouldst not be so
hasty to accept no faith for the very name of it has caused the
boldest soldier in the army to turn pale get thee to the armory rest
and refresh thyself to-morrow thou shalt to tochtepec

señor for your love i will do what others will not i have years of
benefaction to repay i claim to be appointed to that task which is so
dreadful to others

by my conscience no said don hernan this would be sending thee
to execution indeed and yet i know none so well fitted as thyself thou
art fearless cunning discreet at least thou canst be so and thou
art a master of the barbarous language i think

your excellency once commended the success with which i laboured to
acquire it my year's wanderings in the west have made it familiar to me
almost as the tongue of castile

it is a good endowment said cortes what thinkest thou of an
embassage to tenochtitlan

as he spoke pronouncing each word with deliberate emphasis he bent his
eyes searchingly on juan and a smile crept over his features as he
perceived the young man lose colour and start

the man that would do me that duty he continued gravely would
indeed deserve well not only of myself but of his majesty the king of
spain but think not i mean to overtask thee or that i seriously
designed to try thee with this rack of probation there are bounds to
the courage of us all

your excellency mistakes me said juan dispelling all emotion with a
single effort and speaking with a voice as firm as it was serious if
there be but one good can come of such an embassy 

there might be many said the general not the least of which would
be the conquest of the city and thereby of the whole land without the
loss of christian lives could i but find speech with the prince
guatimozin i have that which will move him to peaceful submission but
this is impossible

again your excellency is deceived said juan with the composure of
one who has taken his resolution i will do your bidding i will carry
your message to mexico

pho i did but jest with thee three indian envoys have i sent already
the infidel slew them all

and cannot your excellency answer why your envoys were indians your
excellency's allies but his subjects who in the act of alliance had
committed the crimes of treason and rebellion for which he punished
them with death as seemed to him right and just a spanish ambassador
would be received with greater respect and perhaps dismissed without
injury i will not with a boastful vanity proclaim that i fear
nothing but such fears as i have are not enough to deter me and again
i say i will do your bidding

my bidding cried cortes i bid thee not heaven forfend i should bid
thee any such thing but if thou really thinkest the danger is not
great if thou art so persuaded  he paused his eyes sparkled he
strode to and fro in disorder then suddenly halting he exclaimed with
a faint laugh no by my conscience no by heaven no by st james of
compostella thou art the bravest fool of all but thou shalt not die
the death of a dog i will not catch thee with tiger-traps

to these extraordinary expressions juan answered with emotion but
still with unvarying resolution

i wait your excellency's orders i fear not death i am alone in the
world father or mother brother or sister kinsman or friend there is
not one to lament me should i come to disaster if i live i will as
your excellency has said have saved the effusion of christian blood if
i die heaven will remember the motive and none will miss me i will
go to tenochtitlan

thou art a fool said alvarado señor captain-general this embassy
may not be i protest against it the world will cry shame on us

i do oppose the same said sandoval as being the wilful throwing
away of a christian life

the other cavaliers present were about to add their voices against the
measure when cortes cut them short by saying sternly

are ye all mad señores think ye this thing was said seriously i did
but try the young man's mettle and i do think he hath somewhat less of
gaingiving about him as well as much more folly than any one here
present i must get me an ambassador but juan lerma thou art not the
man

to my thought said sandoval this old indian ocelotzin will be a
much safer emissary

apparently the ottomi who had listened throughout the whole conference
with great attention and who understood just enough of it to know the
course that affairs were taking did not at all relish the suggestion of
sandoval he started flung the gray curtain of hair from his visage
and began to pour forth a torrent of such objurgations and remonstrances
as he could find spanish to express

i am not ocelotzin the tiger he exclaimed very weak and old i
am no claw no tooth no roar and here the barbarian by way of
confirming his speech set up a yell so wild shrill and hideous that
the cavaliers started back catching at their swords in alarm and two
or three soldiers from the ante-room rushed in as if apprehending some
act of treason but the dog befo who had hitherto maintained his post
at the feet of lerma now rubbing against his knees now rearing against
his breast and sometimes when pushed down and too long neglected
expressing his impatience or affection by extending his vast jaws as
if to swallow the hand that repelled him the dog befo heard the cry of
the savage with such indignation as he would have bestowed upon the howl
of a rival he replied with a lion-like growl and stalking up to the
ottomi he stood watching him ever and anon writhing his lips so as to
disclose his huge fangs and seemed waiting the signal to attack
greatly to the terror of the orator

a wave of the general's hand dismissed the intruding soldiers from the
apartment and at the voice of lerma the dog returned to him

i am techeechee said the orator resuming his discourse but with
tones greatly subdued i am techeechee the silent dog the silent dog
i am techeechee the silent dog the silent dog i am techeechee 

all this time he kept his eyes fixed upon befo as if dreading an
assault and in fact his solicitude had somewhat overpowered his mind
so that he continued for some moments to reiterate the above phrases
without any seeming consciousness of their absurdity at last he fell
into his vernacular language and this happily releasing him from his
trammels he poured forth with amazing volubility a string of sounds
so harsh guttural inarticulate and unearthly that they seemed rather
the basso chatterings of an ape than the meaning accents of a human
being

what says the knave cried cortes

he says replied juan that he is the little dumb dog of the hills
and will harm nobody that montezuma was a big dog like befo wherein
he lies and that guatimozin the prince is bigger still and will eat
him which is to be understood figuratively he says he is the little
dog and therefore not fit to be an ambassador but ha what sayst
thou techeechee 

the young man spoke to the ottomi in his own tongue and receiving an
answer turned immediately to cortes saying

it becomes me to inform your excellency of his words for savage though
he be this old man i have ever found to be marvellously shrewd as well
as faithful it is his opinion that the prince guatimozin would not
injure me if i went on the embassy wherefore i beg your excellency
to reconsider your resolution he says too he will go with me

your destiny señor is to the rebellious and bloody town tochtepec
replied the general quickly and decidedly

he adds continued juan that he is techeechee and no ambassador but
that he is cousin to quimichin the ground rat and that he will be your
spy for quimichin is the word by which they express a spy throughout
the whole land

i am techeechee i will be quimichin said the indian as if to
confirm the words of juan and twisting his withered features into a
smile that was meant to express both cunning and affection

dost thou think him faithful said cortes i will find service for
him but go amigo i have kept thee till thou art as faint and weary as
myself get thee to quinones and the armory make thy preparations and
take thy rest i will see thee on the morrow perhaps to-night and
acquaint thee with thy force and instructions god be with you nay
heed not the dog adieu señores he has much of your own fidelity roam
he never so much take him with you

when the last of the cavaliers had departed from the chamber the
captain-general stepped upon the platform and throwing himself into
the chair of state sat or reclined thereon with the air of one worn
out by exertion of mind and body and on the eve of sinking into a
swoon




chapter viii


according to the apologue every man carries on his back a satchel in
which are deposited his infirmities and vices and which though thus
concealed from his own eyes lies very invitingly open to the inspection
of his friends not satisfied with this exposure of foibles there are
some good-natured moralists who would dive deeper into the secrets of
their neighbours and who lament with the old heathen metaphysician
that heaven had not clapped windows into their breasts so that they
might detect even the iniquity of thoughts this regret may be avoided
by all who are willing to satisfy curiosity at their own expense for
heaven has fitted most bosoms with private loopholes through which each
man may survey at his leisure the workings of his own spirit a peep
through the secret casement will disclose something startling if not
humbling to many who in the vanity of good works are disposed to
uplift themselves above their fellows such perhaps as rational
principles and even kindly feelings taking their hue from that
smooth-faced gentleman that biassing spirit which is more
comprehensively expressed in shakespeare's phrase of commodity than in
the more familiar one of interest for it is true of us all that
virtues are sometimes nothing but passions in disguise and that reason
has a marvellous facility in acquiring the tones of worldly-wisdom if
the mere grovelling villain the robber assassin or slayer of man's
peace can find some such spectacle near to his heart as the surgeon's
knife exposes in the breast of a cankered corse what may he detect
whose sublimer villany has led or is leading him to distinction upon
a highway paved with the miseries of mankind methinks the breast of
the ambitious man is a labyrinth of some such caverns as perforate the
bowels of a volcano in whose depths are lost all the petty details of
crime committed or meditated in which there is no light but that
which bubbles up from the lava of the vast passion and in which there
is even no grandeur that has not arisen from convulsions the most
disorganizing and unnatural such a heart is at least to the limited
ken of others a chaos but a chaos from which he who imbosoms it and
who alone can understand it calls up less like a god than a
demon the evil elements which create the lurid sphere his greatness

in the bosom of the conquistador there was a corner into which the
blaze of ambition had not yet penetrated and where the common passions
of our nature were left to rage and struggle as in the heart of a meaner
mortal as he looked therein he gave himself up to thoughts which
devoured him while his countenance betrayed for a time at least
nothing beyond such lassitude and faintness as may have characterized
the spartan boy while bleeding under the fangs of the beast he
concealed in his bosom

as he sat brooding in this apparently calm yet deeply suffering
lethargy there glided into the apartment from one of the curtained
doors on the right hand a figure which seen for the first time and in
the dusky twilight already darkening around might to superstitious
eyes have seemed an apparition it was so strange so fair so
majestic and so mournful it presented a stature taller than belongs to
the beauty of woman yet not inconsistent with the conception of a
divinity and to this a singular dignity was given by flowing and
voluminous robes of a grayish texture which both in hue and fashion
bore an air of monastic simplicity without precisely resembling those
of any one order a sort of hood or veil drawn a little aside and
resting upon the brow gave to view a female countenance of wonderful
loveliness and not without a share of that commanding dignity which
distinguished her figure her hair shorn or perhaps bound behind by a
fillet and thus almost altogether concealed by the hood gave yet to
the gaze two long locks broad and black which falling over either
cheek were lost among the folds of the veil which her right hand held
upon her bosom a complexion dark yet not tawny a chin and nostrils
carved like the most exquisite statuary lips of dusky crimson a brow
of marble and an eye of midnight made up a countenance both beautiful
and characteristic yet contradictory in the expression of its several
parts and sometimes even in the expression of the same features thus
the first impression made upon a spectator by the whole visage was such
as could only be effected by extreme gentleness of disposition while
the second he scarce knew why spoke of energy and decision none the
less striking for being concealed under a mask so captivating thus
also the eyes very large and set widely apart conveyed on ordinary
occasions the idea of a spirit passive melancholy and inanimate
though the slightest depression of the brow the smallest motion of the
lid transformed them at once into the brightest torches of passion if
one could conceive the spirit of a philomela a compound of sweet
tenderness and still sweeter melancholy dashed with the fire of a
penthesilea he might conjure up to his mind's eye a correct
representation of the mysterious being alluded to by villafana under
the name of la monjonaza or the nun the word being a sort of cant
augmentative of monja a nun whom an extraordinary destiny had
thrown among the warlike invaders of mexico

as she passed from the thick curtain and advanced towards the platform
on which sat the moody general her visage presented none of its
ordinary mildness on the contrary her brows were knit together her
lip retracted and the look with which she regarded him whom all others
were learning to fear was bold stern and even fiercely hostile

the rustling of the curtain the light sound of her footstep the bright
glance of her eye when she paused before him all alike failed to make
an impression on the general's senses she perceived that he was in a
waking dream absorbingly profound and painful and she stood in
silence from disdainful pride or perhaps with a woman's curiosity
endeavouring to trace the workings of his spirit from the revelations of
his countenance which by this time had changed from a stony
inexpressiveness to agitation and distortion at this moment the head
of the conqueror was bent forwards and his eyes directed upon the
floor but she saw enough in the writhing features and the forehead
almost impurpled with blood to know that the passions then convulsing
his bosom were dark and deadly

at this sight the frown gradually passed away from her own visage and
she stood regarding him for the space of several minutes with a calm
and melancholy intentness then perceiving that his lips though moving
as if in speech gave out no articulate sound she exclaimed with a
voice that thrilled to his soul though subdued to the lowest accents

arise assassin it is not just it is not expedient and he shall
not perish

it seemed as if she had read his heart he started up surprised and
confounded and his first act was to cross himself as if to exorcise a
fiend conjured up by the mere spell of evil thoughts he even gave
voice to two or three interjections of alarm before perceiving that the
rebuke came only from lips of earth

hah hah santa maria santos y angeles hah ho ho infeliz
magdalena fair conqueror of hearts bright converter of souls that
shalt be is it thou monja mia santisima most devout saint of the
veil he cried recovering his self-possession and banishing every
trace of passion with astonishing address by thy bright eyes of
heaven and thanks be thine for the good deed thou hast waked me from
a dream of night-mare a most horrible vision these naps o the
afternoon are but provokers of incubus ay and succuba into the
bargain i thank thee bright infeliz it is better to be waked by thy
voice than by sweet music

and dost thou think said the lady with a voice whose deep but not
unfeminine tones suited so well with the mournfulness of her
emphasis dost thou think i see not this moment into thy bosom
visions and sleep speak of visions to thy dull conquerors they who
dream of immortal renown can best appreciate a vision of bloodshed
speak of sleep to thy duller victims the stupid wretches who slumber
with the chain at their necks may well believe that the enslaver has
also his seasons of repose but talk not of these to me who look upon
thee neither with the eyes of follower nor of foe thou canst not sleep
thou dost not dream thy head is too full of fame thy foot too deep in
blood thy heart too black with evil thoughts no nevermore canst thou
sleep nevermore nevermore

the last words were uttered with a cadence so extremely melancholy and
with a manner so much like that of one who apostrophizes self that a
stranger overhearing them and marking the look and gesture the
upturned eye and the folding of arms on the breast would have naturally
supposed they referred rather to herself than to another this was
indeed a suspicion entertained in part by cortes who somewhat
confounded by the calm decision with which she rejected a deceitful
attempt to explain expressions of countenance so ominous as those he had
displayed now recovered himself and said with an air of grave
sympathy in which earnestness could not conceal a vein of sarcasm and
bagatelle that were parts of his nature

fair infeliz the unhappy since by this lugubrious epithet you choose
to be called it is now some two months since you dropped among us from
the clouds the fairest shrewdest and strangest as well as the most
broken-hearted and self-accusing of all the angels that have fallen
from paradise for mine own part however fervently i may thank heaven
for sending me such a minister i have not yet got over my amazement at
your presence which i indeed regard with much the same wonder wherewith
i should behold the sun of heaven take up his quarters at my tent-door

in this particular said the lady with the utmost tranquillity you
should have been satisfied had it accorded with your nature to believe
any solution of a problem that was not suggested by your own
imagination that the deceptions of others and no will of my own
brought me from santiago to mexico in a ship which should have carried
me to jamaica your allies do not fit out vessels openly for this land
under the eye of velasquez but why ask you me this hast thou no
better device to lure me from my purpose i came not to speak of
myself but of others thou couldst have played the lapwing more subtly
hadst thou dwelt upon the whispers the nods the smiles of contempt and
the words of scorn that heralded a compelled coming find which requite
an inevitable stay but learn if thou hast not yet learned it that
these things are felt more than they are feared and that she who has
not deserved it may sometimes have the courage to endure even a
degrading misconstruction why hast thou not insinuated this
continued the singular being with a voice that betrayed more feeling
than her pride confessed this would have drowned every other thought
in a true woman for to woman good name and fame are more than
life-blood yes more than life i save thee however the trouble i
am reminded of my condition a woman alone in thy camp alone in thy
hands and yet i return to my purpose which concerns not myself but
another wilt thou have me speak further of myself if it last till the
midnight be sure i will yet speak of that which i have in view

of thyself then beauteous infeliz said cortes admiringly for i
vow to heaven thou art the marvel of womankind whom i desire to
understand even more than to adore sit thou upon my barbarian throne
and i will fling me at thy feet in token that i acknowledge thy
supremacy in wit wisdom subtle observation determination and all
other virtues that can grace woman ay or man either for i swear by
my conscience i think thou art valiant also fearing nothing that walks
under heaven or above the abyss to the throne then as queen of my
mystery

i will answer thee where i stand said infeliz calmly disengaging the
hand which the conquistador had taken to lead her to the platform and
think not this gallant folly will make me a whit quicker of
apprehension or reply make thy demands and gain thereby what time
thou wilt to answer mine for this is thy purpose

well then said the captain-general with a look of not less respect
than curiosity make me acquainted with this wherefore as thy coming
hither was so much against thy will hast thou not once demanded to be
taken back to the islands

because it is not yet my will to be discharged from your presence
replied the lady calmly

be thou of this mind for ever said the general with an air of
sincerity now let me know i pray you why it is that i am somewhat
more forward in confiding to thy scrutiny my secret thoughts than to the
best and wisest of my bold cavaliers

because thou knowest i neither love thee nor hate thee because i lose
not good-will by asking honours and spoils nor by boasting of services
and ability but chiefly am i troubled with your confidence because i
am the only one who lists not to have it

by my faith thou art very right especially in the last reason of
all said cortes with a laugh for secrets are like gnats and
musket-bullets they ever crowd thickest after those who strive most to
avoid them tell me now fair and most provoking infeliz why when i
have flung thee open the whole book of my confidence thou givest me not
a single chapter of thine

because it extends not beyond that single chapter replied la
monjonaza patiently hath neither beginning nor end and is beside
in a language which thou canst not understand

pho you put me off with nothing said don hernan again taking the
hand of his remarkable guest i have but one more question to ask you
why is it and i pray you to forgive me the question that with the
consciousness that your situation in this mad land and knavish army
exposes you not only to degrading suspicion but even to absolute
personal danger you betray no apprehension of the wild reprobates among
whom you are placed that you show no dread even of me

because said the maiden removing her right hand which she had up
to this moment preserved upon her breast and drawing aside the thick
folds of veil and mantle because for the wretch who fears not the
woman's arms of modesty and helplessness i bear with me a weapon which
will secure his respect

and as she spoke the eye of don hernan fell upon a naked and glittering
poniard thrust through her girdle and worn as if it had long formed a
part of the habit

there was something inexpressibly impressive in the calm and simple
dignity with which in the very gesture that pointed out a protection so
insufficient she acknowledged a weakness in all other respects
unfriended cortes in the multitude of his base and graspingly selfish
attributes was not without some traits of a more generous character
and especially admiring a courage so self-relying so unaffectedly real
and perhaps so much akin to his own he had enough of the old leaven of
chivalric feeling to understand and appreciate the claims of the sex to
his compassion and protection that he had other reasons for treating la
monjonaza with respect cannot be denied

give me thy hand magdalena he said with an action and voice rather
indicating the familiarity of a patron than that of a presumptuous
suitor thou art right thou art a creature after mine own heart and i
swear to thee i will do thee no wrong nor suffer it to be done thee by
another heed not what may be said of thee my dogs would bay an angel
should one condescend to pay them a visit thy cloister-like garments
are not amiss there be more that venerate than malign thee for this
reason and thank heaven the padre olmedo finds no sin in thy wearing
them wilt thou be seated there is peace between us let there be
confidence what hast thou to ask of me magdalena thy revenge is at
hand

the maiden returned the scrutinizing look of the general with one which
if not so piercing was at least quite as steady

your excellency has thrice called me who call myself infeliz by a
name not authorized by any revealments of mine she said you speak
also of revenge of my revenge yes she muttered with a quivering
lip this is a thing to be thought of not spoken

she paused a moment and cortes casting a quick eye round the
apartment said in a voice confidentially low and insinuating

i would the story had come from yourself but it matters not i have
it and disguise is no longer availing you lose nothing by the change
for i see thy spirit hath the elements of mine own ah water in the
desert the first kiss of a lover breath to the suffocating such is
revenge to the soul of the mighty i know thee thy history and thy
purpose i have dandled the boy hilario upon my knee

the strong and meaning stress laid upon the last abrupt words only
served to drive the colour from the maiden's cheeks and lips in all
other respects she remained calm and collected and replied gravely 

the tale comes from the alguazil villafana 

hah said cortes in surprise how knowest thou that

because there is no other no other save one who will not speak
it in all this land who knows so much of me and because were there
twenty the man whom heaven has cursed with the industrious treachery of
a spider and the rage to entangle all things in his flimsy web would
be the first to betray me

thou sayst the truth of villafana said cortes with a laugh of
peculiar exultation in spirit and intention he is the insect you have
named but yet he spins his web less like the spider with the chance
of destroying than the silken-caterpillar that toils for his master
who will smother him in his work as soon as it is perfected ay thy
penetration is clear thy conception just the knave is in all things
a traitor a double a triple a centupled traitor

and you both spare him and give him the means of multiplying his
dangerous villanies

i do by my conscience said cortes vivaciously there is a charm in
it and no little policy dost thou think this little fly can deceive
can deceive me wert thou a man thou wouldst know that even above
the triumph of vengeance is the joy of him who watches the nets that
his foe is spreading and as he watches fastens them softly down upon
the ensnarer

and is the insect worthy to be toiled by the lion

ay when the lion is a man this is my diversion it is also my
profit i would not for a thousand crowns any harm should come to so
serviceable a tool a better decoy never circled the disaffected about
him he is the touchstone that reveals me the metal of the
doubtful the diamond that cuts me the adamant of malignancy i look
through him as through the philosopher's glass and behold the million
things of corruption that swarm in the hearts of the curs beneath
him by heaven it joys me that i have one to whom i can speak these
secret blisses thou art my vizier my very familiar know then that
this very night the dog meditates a treachery with which i will be
acquainted and yet seem unacquainted by my conscience it delights me
to tell thee with what exquisite industry the poor knave works me a
good while foolishly believing he is doing me an ill dost thou not
remember that i have told thee how much it concerns me to procure some
trusty envoy to go between me and the young infidel guatimozin of
tenochtitlan

i am familiar with your wishes

learn then that this night villafana himself procures me the
emissary i have myself sought after in vain a mexican noble of high
rank i could kiss the dog for his knavery

and wherefore does he this

faith in the amiable wish to reconcile some of the jarring elements of
his conspiracy to wit the tlascalans and mexicans the latter of whom
this night will with his good help show the black-cheeked xicotencal
the advantages to be gained by uniting with his mighty and royal enemy
of mexico to secure the destruction of my insignificant self ha ha
is not the thought absurdly delightful ah villafana villafana i have
no such merry conceited good-fellow as thou

la monjonaza beheld the exultation and listened to the mirthful laugh
of the conqueror with much interest and not a little surprise it did
indeed seem extraordinary that he should be so heartily diverted by the
audacity of a villany that aimed at his downfall and perhaps his life
but this very merriment indicated how many majestic fathoms he felt
himself elevated above the reach of any arts of human malevolence or
opposition it was as if the eagle flapping his wings among
thunder-clouds shrieked with contempt at schoolboys shooting up
birdbolts from the village-green it gave a clew to a characteristic
which infeliz was not slow to unravel a deep sigh from her lips
recalled the general from his diversion

thou sighest magdalena he cried

it was for thee she answered i sighed indeed to think how much
and how truly thou thus elevated by a touch of divinity above the
children of men dost yet resemble this miserable grovelling befooled
villafana

what i resemble him resemble villafana

deny it if thou canst said the maiden with rebuking severity and
if thou canst not then humble thyself and confess the base similitude
thou differest from him but in this that whereas in one quality
thou art uplifted miles above his head thou art in another sunk even
leagues below him thou frownest hast thou discovered that anger
adds aught to the state of dignity thou dost this moment even with
the crawling venom of villafana with a rage still more abased seek a
life thou hast not courage openly to destroy

santiago cried cortes in a heat by st peter you are over-bitter
but pho i will not be angry with thee dost thou think me this coward
thing

hast thou not doomed the young man juan lerma a second time to
death cried la monjonaza with an eye that trembled not a moment in
the gaze of the captain-general and was it not with the embrace of a
judas oh señor she continued firmly say not that villafana is
either base or craven he strikes at the strong man who sits armed
and with his eyes open but thou oh thou thou art content to aim at
the breast of the friendless and naked sleeper judge between thyself
and villafana

it is impossible to express the mingled effects of shame and rage that
disfigured the visage and convulsed the frame of the captain-general at
this powerful and altogether unexpected rebuke he smote his brow he
took two or three hasty steps over the floor when at last a thought
striking him he rushed back to the chider snatched up her hand and
said with an attempt at laughter painfully contrasted with his working
and even agonized visage

dost thou quarrel with me for fighting thy battles oh by st james
it is better to draw sword on a friend than for him ingratitude
always comes of it had i thought this of old i had been a happier man
and thou never hadst mourned the death of hilario no by'r lady
hilario had been a living man and thou happy with him in the island

as he hurried over these words the diversion they gave to his thoughts
enabled him rapidly to recover his self-command in which as in affairs
of less personal consequence he always exhibited wonderful power this
accomplished he continued with an earnest voice

concealment is now useless the time waxes when i must think of other
things let us shrive one another even as two friars and deceive one
another no further than they methinks what i do is for thy especial
satisfaction an ill loon i am to do so much for one who so bitterly
censures me who thou art and what thou art i know not thou wert an
angel couldst thou give over chiding the young hilario del milagro was
the son of mine old friend antonio a very noble boy i remember him
well by heaven thy hand is turned to ice art thou ill

do i look so said the maiden with a faint laugh her face had of a
sudden become very pale yet she spoke firmly though not without a
visible effort i listen to thy confession

to mine by my troth i am confessing thy sins and sorrows and not
mine well magdalena he continued thy emotion is not amiss it is
not every maiden can think calmly of the death of her lover knowing
that his slayer is nigh i knew hilario when a boy ay good faith
and juan lerma too his playmate and foster-brother or his young page
and varlet i know not which it was on antonio's recommendation that i
afterwards took this foundling knave to my bosom and made him no not
what he is for this is a thing of his own making i sent him to
española to recruit he loitered he returned to the house of
milagro shall i say more hilario his brother the son of his best
friend and patron was the betrothed husband of magdalena and him did
the wolf-cub slay wo betide me for it was i that taught him the use of
his weapon is not this enough accident hath brought thee to mexico
thou seest the killer of thy lover and like a true daughter of spain
thy heart is full of vengeance is not this true disguise thy wrath in
wild sarcasm no longer were he the king's son he should  pho recall
thy words is it not just is it not expedient

to these sinister demands magdalena replied with astonishing composure

all this is well shrive now thyself hast thou any cause
personally to desire his death

millions replied the general grinding his teeth millions
millions to which the death of hilario wringing at thy breast is but
as a gnat-bite to the sting of adders millions millions

give him then to death said magdalena with a voice so grave and
passionless that it instantly surprised the conquistador out of his
fury give him to death but let it be in thy name not mine

art thou wholly inexplicable he cried i read thee by the alphabet
of human passions and i make thee not out no not so much as a word
thy flesh warms and chills thine eye swims and flashes thy brow bends
thy lip curls thy breast heaves thy frame trembles and yet art thou
more than mortal or less when shall i understand thee

when thou canst look to heaven and say i have done no wrong no
no not to heaven for what child of earth can look thitherward and
unveil the actions of life when thou canst lay thy hand upon thy
bosom and appealing not to divine justice but to that of human
reason say what i do is just in other words never you are
surprised you bade me repeat my words i do it is not just it is
not expedient and juan lerma shall not die

now by my conscience said cortes this is the true dog-star madness
wert thou not behind the curtain and didst thou not shriek at sight of
him mystery that thou art unveil thyself wherefore tarriest thou in
this land suspected scorned degraded if not to have vengeance on
him wherefore i say wherefore

to save him replied the lady boldly to save him from the fury
that has brought thee to the level of the alguazil else had i long
since returned to the islands revoke therefore thy commission and in
any way thou wilt so that it carry with it neither secret malice nor
open insult contrive to discharge him from thy service his life is
charmed it is in my keeping

oho said the captain-general surveying la monjonaza with an exulting
sneer sits the wind in that quarter and thou art but a woman after
all now was i but a fool i trow not to bethink me how the wife of
uriah forgot the death of her husband when she saw a path open to the
arms of his murderer is it so indeed thou hast fallen from admiration
to pity

she who withstands evil thoughts and maligning words will not weep
even at the contempt of commiseration said magdalena with a sigh

villafana has then deceived me or rather poor fool has deceived
himself as is more natural said cortes with a malicious grin never
believe me but thou shalt rule me in this matter as in others juan
lerma shall thank thee for his life even for the sake of the maid of
mexico thy brown rival zelahualla

as he spoke thus he watched closely the effect of his words on
magdalena and beheld a sudden fire light up in her eyes succeeded by
such paleness as had always covered her visage when he referred to the
death of hilario nevertheless she did not avert her glance nor
exhibit any other manifestation of feeling except that she replied not
a single word

it is the truth that i tell thee he muttered in a low voice taking
up as if in compassion her hand which was yielded passively and was
again cold and dewy she is very lovely very and a king's daughter
he fought for her love with guzman so perhaps he fought hilario for
thine by my conscience he makes love over blood-thirstily when i
spoke to him of zelahualla nay i mentioned not her name i spoke only
of his friends in the palace of mexico yet the colour flushed over his
cheeks nevertheless thou shalt rule me thou shalt have time for
consideration the expedition to tochtepec can be delayed dost thou
think he would have consented to be mine envoy to tenochtitlan but for
the hope of seeing his princess i could tell thee another thing there
are more rivals than one but it matters not it matters not thou
wilt not be content with pity arouse thee and speak art thou
marble

at this moment and while it seemed indeed that the unhappy monjonaza
notwithstanding that her countenance was still inexpressively placid
had been turned to stone the curtain of the great door or principal
entrance was drawn aside and the cavalier don francisco de guzman
strode hastily into the apartment the sound of his footsteps more than
the warning gesture of cortes recalled her to her senses she raised
her hand to her brow and the long hood falling over her countenance
she turned to depart through the door by which she had entered the
evening was already closing fast and the shadowy obscurity of the
chamber perhaps concealed her from the eyes of the intruder
nevertheless cortes perceived as she glided away that her step was
altered and tottering and that her hands fumbled for a moment at the
door curtain as if she knew not how to remove it it yielded however
at last and she vanished from his eyes

poor fool he muttered with a feeling divided between scorn anger
and pity thou hast discovered to me the broken postern of thy spirit
the walls are strong but the citadel is in ruins this is somewhat
marvellous i will know more of it it is a new and another thing to be
remembered come amigo it is over dark here for thy business we will
walk in the open air

so saying he took guzman's arm and departed from the chamber




chapter ix


some two hours or more after he had been discharged from the presence of
the captain-general juan lerma sat musing in one of the many hundred
chambers which composed the vast extent of the palace of nezahualcojotl
a different being from that the reader beheld him returning from exile
the coarse tilmaltli or native cloak and the barbarous tunic had
been exchanged for raiment of a better material and fashion a part of
which the bragas and xaqueta at least were from the wardrobe of
the general while modesty or reluctance to accept any further of such
assistance than was absolutely necessary had induced him to substitute
for the plain but costly capa or mantle of velvet the long surcoat
of black cloth very richly embroidered which had as he was told
accompanied the suit of armour sent by his unknown friend this
valuable and well-timed gift lay upon a platform beside his matted and
canopied couch shining brilliantly in the light which a waxen candle
diffused throughout the apartment he sat upon a native stool carved of
a solid block of wood and his fine countenance and majestic figure
besides the advantages they received from becoming garments appeared
even of a more elevated beauty when seen by this solitary ray

his only companion was the dog befo whose shaggy coat yet gleaming
with moisture betrayed that he had shared with the young man his
evening bath in the lake the attachment of this beast was much more
natural than remarkable five years before when juan was but a boy in
santo domingo befo had been his playmate and companion had followed
him to cuba when the youth began to weary of dependence and long for a
life of activity and distinction and was finally presented by the
grateful adventurer to cortes as the only gift in his power to bestow
for at that time saving his youth health and good spirits befo made
up the sum of his worldly possessions in the change of masters
however befo did not trouble himself to acquiesce nor did he perceive
any necessity while treating cortes with all surly good-will and
respect to abate a jot of his love for the hand which had first
sustained and caressed him the dog is the only animal that shows
disinclination to be transferred from one master to another the horse
cares not the ox submits and man makes no opposition the dog has a
will of his own and acknowledges no change of servitude until
conscious of a change of affection

the stirring and harassing events of the day though they had exhausted
the spirit of the youth had yet brought with exhaustion that nervous
irritableness which drives away slumber from the eyes of the over-weary
twice or thrice juan had flung himself on the couch to repose but in
vain and as he now sat questioning himself how far the substitution of
soft mats and robes for a bed of earth might account for his inability
to sleep he began to revolve in his mind for the twentieth time his
change of fortunes and wonder at the inauspicious and as it seemed to
him unnatural sadness which oppressed his spirits

i have been restored he muttered half aloud and as he spoke
befo roused by the accents from the floor thrust his rough head over
his knees to testify his attention i have been restored to favour
and in great part to the friendship of the general thou whinest
befo i would i could read the heart of a man as clearly as thine yet
has he not distinguished me with a high command a captain's i trow
it is not every one who can so soon step into this dignity especially
when without the recommendation of birth as alvarado hinted i will
show this proud cavalier that god does not confine all merit to
hidalgos sons if he give me but a capable force twenty foot and six
horse tis but a weak array for a field where eighty men have
perished yet i care not if i have but xicotencal to back me with some
two or three xiquipils of his tlascalans it will be enough if i
fall perhaps that will be better i am too faint-hearted for these
wars villafana says that he brands the prisoners too and sells them
for slaves this is surely unjust he was another man at cuba

footnote xiquipil a military division of natives consisting of
eight thousand men

at this moment the dog raised his head and growled and juan heard
steps approaching through the long passage that ran by his door here
they stopped and befo continuing to give utterance to his displeasure
the voice of villafana whispered through the curtain

put thy hand on the beast's neck or box him o the ears he is no
friend of mine

enter said juan if thou art seeking me he will do thee no harm

ay marry said villafana coming in for at the worst and when
other things fail i will stop him with my dudgeon be he cortes's
thine or any one's else it stirs my choler to be growled at by so base
a thing as a dog

put up thy weapon nevertheless said juan observing that villafana
had a poniard in his hand thou seest the dog is quiet in this he
pays me the compliment of supposing i can protect myself what is thy
will with me villafana

first said the alguazil with a laugh to give thee my
congratulations touching thy sudden rise from the abyss and thy
meditated flight heaven-ward and secondly he continued when juan
had nodded his thanks to ask in the way of friendship from how high
a cliff thou canst tumble headlong without danger of breaking thy
neck

this is but a silly question friendly though it may be replied juan

oh señor said villafana you must remember the first night we
slept with the army at the base of el volcan the mighty popocatepetl
how much we admired the great stones that the devils therein flung up
against the stars you nod again good luck to your recollections did
you observe any one of those ignited masses stick against the vault and
there hang among the luminaries

surely not said juan those that fell not immediately back into the
crater rolled down among the snows on the mountain-side and were there
extinguished

very well señor when you are mounted you can remember the
fire-stones and make your choice whether to tumble back into the fire
of wrath that now sends you upward or to quench yourself for ever in
the frozen bed of degradation you go to tochtepec

i do said juan somewhat angrily and i warn thee thy malicious
metaphors will not make me less grateful for the kindness that sends
me

god rest you it were better you had accepted the embassy to
guatimozin

hah said juan how knowest thou of this it was spoken only in
secret council

oh said villafana with a second laugh if thou wilt but scratch on
one end of a long log be sure i will hear it at the other there is
something more in the world than magic

he spoke with marked exultation indeed juan had already observed that
his carriage was freer and bolder than common and that he bore himself
like a man who cares not wholly to conceal a triumph of spirit which he
thinks it not needful altogether to divulge

harkee señor don juan he went on abruptly and inquisitively thou
art good friends with xicotencal

so far as a christian man can be with one who though a very noble
being is yet a misbeliever

and thou wert sworn friends at mexico with the young prince
guatimozin

not so said juan the young man kept aloof from us all being of the
hostile party and there was scarce one of us who had ever seen his
face i must confess however if i can believe techeechee that my
preservation in the expedition was owing to his good act for techeechee
avers that it was through guatimozin's good will that he was sent with
me to secure me from the death which was designed for all the rest of
the party

designed dost thou allow it then cried the alguazil quickly

ay replied juan dryly designed by the mexican lords but not by
christian leaders

and art thou not sorry thou wert not despatched to him as envoy

why need we talk of this said juan hesitating guatimozin the king
may be different from guatimozin the prince

he is not yet the king said villafana he will not be crowned till
the day of the great war-festival and not then unless he can furnish a
spaniard for the sacrifice i'faith he loves not the blood of his red
neighbours

villafana said juan struck with certain uneasy suspicions thou
seemest better acquainted with these things than becomes a true follower
of don hernan

not a whit not a whit cried the alguazil hastily this is but the
common talk the common talk señor and i am but a fool to indulge in
it to the prejudice of other business more urgent come señor will
you walk in the garden there is a friend to speak with you

what friend said juan villafana i half suspect you are engaged in
some foul work i will have naught to do with it

lo you now said the alguazil impatiently this is wild work do you
think i will assassinate you ho this is a thing thy best friend would
entrust to another come señor you have your rapier you can take
your casque too if you have any fear it is a friend who has that to
say which it concerns your life to know you know not your danger god
be with you and your blood be upon your own head if you refuse you
will not repent you no faith you will not have time left for
lamentation farewell señor 

stay villafana exclaimed juan much disturbed friend or foe it
is not that which stays me but the fear of being entrapped into
something more to be dreaded than death thou art a schemer it is thy
nature i will have nothing to do with thy plots or with those who 

pho this concerns thyself alone not me my only plot is to help one
who desires to drag thee out of the fire thou art so bent to burn in i
take you to your friend and depart i have other things to occupy me i
am but a messenger will you go i must give you a token then you have
not forgotten hilario

at these words muttered under breath juan started and turned pale
exclaiming saints and angels and heaven forbid mine ears did not
then deceive me oh wo to us all alas for thine ill news have i not
pain enough of mine own

as he spoke with a trembling voice villafana handed him his cap and
sword saying as he put into his hand the latter which was a light
rapier

a good blade and has hung at don hernan's girdle leave the dog
behind he will but set up his cursed growling and so bring upon you
some one who may not relish the meeting

it is true then cried juan with tones and aspect of the greatest
distress so fair so young so noble so fallen

back cur thick-lips befo cried the alguazil as the two left the
chamber he grumbles at me as if to say ehem with disdain command
him thyself he is a superfluous companion

the young man waved his hand to befo at which signal befo threw himself
upon his haunches looking after juan till he beheld him issue from the
long passage into the open air then rising with the air of a servant
who understands his duty much better even than his master he followed
slowly after the pair into the garden




chapter x


the royal garden of tezcuco was an extensive piece of ground fenced on
three sides by the palace and its dependencies and bounded on the
fourth by the waters of the lake from which it was divided by a low
wall long since broken down by the conquerors by certain shadowy
buildings and by clumps of noble cypresses and other trees the moon
not yet near her full shone westward of the meridian in a sky
intensely azure and almost cloudless and her beams could be traced
through the wall of cypresses glittering and dancing on the light
waves as they rippled up merrily to the night-breeze what taste was
displayed in the plan and cultivation of the garden could not be
determined at this hour and in this insufficient though beautiful
light one could behold indeed obscurely flower-beds and shrubberies
winding alleys and hanging groves little still pools and even here and
there a jetting fountain scattered about in a manner which the
imagination might believe was designed and judicious but it seemed at
night rather a wilderness in which the nostrils had greater reason to
be gratified than the eyes a thousand odours fell from the trees a
thousand scents rose from the flowers as the heads of the one and the
petals of the other were shaken by the flitting gusts it was a scene
calculated at least to soothe exasperated feelings and induce sentiment
and melancholy in the breast of the contemplative

to juan's temperament it would have been at any other moment
saddening enough but his thoughts were at present far too much and
far too painfully engaged to permit any to be wasted upon it

as he followed hastily at the heels of the alguazil he made one or two
agitated attempts to draw from him some further tokens to remove or
confirm his boding suspicions but the alguazil had on the sudden grown
very cautiously or very maliciously silent and answered only by
pressing his finger on his lips eyeing the youth significantly and
hurrying him more rapidly along

he led him to a spot almost in the centre of the garden where a little
oval-shaped pool lay embosomed among schinus-trees whose long weeping
branches stirred by the wind swept gracefully over and in the water
which was only agitated when thus disturbed by the motion of a bough
or by the plunge of the fragrant berries the harvest of a former year
which dropped at intervals from the cluster a single moonbeam found its
way into this solitary inclosure falling upon a limited portion of a
path which seemed to surround the pool in other respects all was dark
and invisible and not a ray could be seen on the water save when the
spectator peering over the brink beheld some faint star of the zenith
glimmering down among the shadowy depths

upon this path and in this moonbeam the alguazil paused and pointing
hastily to a nook the darkest of all where all were dark juan
perceived obscurely what seemed a moving figure the next moment
villafana passed among the boughs retracing his steps and strode again
into the moonlight as he stood an instant shaking the dew-drops from
his cloak he beheld a dark object approaching slowly on the path it
was the faithful befo who with his head to the ground and his tail
draggling in the grass as if sensible of having committed a breach of
discipline yet crawled along after his master under the irresistible
instinct of fidelity

this is ill thought on and may be unlucky muttered villafana with a
subdued voice here befo you rascal come with me and you shall have
a bone ay thou ill devil he continued in the same whispered tones
as befo without stirring to the right or the left and merely showing
his teeth when the alguazil seemed disposed to check him with his hand
passed on towards the grove go thy ways and growl as thou wilt thou
art the only thing in the land incorruptible but thou wilt be
acquainted with my dagger yet if thou hast no better appetite for my
dinner

he resumed his path he had not taken a dozen steps before he became
sensible of the approach of another intruder but this time the intruder
was human there was something in the fashion and sweep of the garments
which even at a distance apprized him of the character of the comer

the devil take these prying priests monks friars and all he
muttered irreverently betwixt his teeth holy father  hah by the
mass is it thou camarga my brother of all orders monkish mendicant
martial and so on thy masking goes the wrong way i told thee to meet
me at the prison tis my palace man and the princes are in
waiting come these damp mazes are ill for thy years and diseased
liver we will walk together

señor gruñidor as they call you said camarga flinging back the
white cowl and revealing his sallow features in the moonshine señor
alguazil carcelero rogue conspirator devil and what-not how i came
to be so deep among your damnable devices in the short month i have
been in this land i know not except that i have like thyself a
greater aptitude to be groping among caverns than journeying on kings
highways but know sirrah that besides thy subtleties i have some
whimseys of my own to which when the wind stirs them yours must give
place were they ten thousand times more magnificent than your wit
strives to make them appear begone therefore get thee to thy scurvy
tlascalan whom thou art training to the gallows to thy mexican
magnifico who is an ass to trust his neck to thy keeping and to what
vagabond christians will give thee their countenance who are e'en
greater fools than thyself and the indians together get thee away i
have business of mine own and i will come to you when it is despatched
or i will not come just as the imp urges me so away with you and
leave me to myself

under your favour no said villafana apparently too well acquainted
with the man to be much surprised at a tone and manner so unlike to
those which camarga had used at the cypress-tree i must e'en have your
saintly cowl and leaden cross to swear the two infidels together
otherwise there is no trusting them they have much superstitious
reverence for our priests and ceremonies come señor i tell thee the
mexican will make our fortunes

thine rogue thine said the disguised camarga impatiently why
talkest thou to me in this stupid wise i am an older villain than
thou i have a fancy for this lad of the anakim this thick-witted
turtle-brained young magog thou makest a mystery of him too slid i
will penetrate it for i have a use to make of him as well as thou

demonios said villafana are you seeking juan lerma

ay marry i dogged thee hitherward i saw thee hide him in the bush
and by st dominic who will fry my soul to cinders for defiling his
garments peccavi i will know what's i the wind betwixt you ere i
stir a step further in your counsels dost thou think i will be thine
accomplice and have anything hidden from me thou swearest he is to be
murdered to-morrow too there is no time to be lost

thou art mad said villafana he is engaged on our business i make
no mystery i will tell you all it is well i met thee he has
company a good sword and would think no more of lunging through thy
holy lion's skin if he caught thee eavesdropping 

hark dost thou not hear tuck and corselet said camarga smiling
grimly and rattling the hilt of a sword against his concealed armour
i must know his companion too i tell thee i will have all thy
secrets or i drop thee perhaps denounce thee

thou shalt have them said villafana gradually drawing him further
from the pool his companion is la monjonaza

ha sits the wind there i must have a peep at her they say she is
lovely as a goddess

thou wilt incense her said villafana emphatically by heaven thou
knowest not the temper of this woman which is deadly leave the two
cooing fools to themselves our fortunes nay faith our lives depend
upon them la monjonaza is deep in our secrets 

knave muttered the pretended friar in a low but furious voice hast
thou trusted my life in the keeping of a woman

pho she is an older conspirator than thou a wiser too for she can
keep her temper out of her love for the young man we draw our truest
safety and quickest success

her love oh fu and is she of this corrupt fickleness that she will
have two lovers in one hour but it is the way with these creatures

they are old lovers very old lovers señor said villafana
endeavouring as he spoke but in vain to quicken the steps of camarga
you shall hear the story juan lerma's father was some low poor base
fellow killed in some tumult at isabela the old hidalgo antonio del
milagro took the boy out of charity first as a servant 

a servant dios mio is he of no better beginning

not a jot but the old fellow liked him and in the end treated him
full as well as his own son a knavish lad called hilario some two or
three years older than juan

slife said camarga tell me no granddam's tale with all tedious
particulars how came the youth into the hands of cortes

even by setting out to seek his fortune somewhat early and getting to
santiago where cortes took him into keeping you heard us say that don
hernan when he received his commission from velasquez sent juan back
to his native island to recruit forces it was natural he should visit
his old friends at isabela it was here he met with and quarrelled
about magdalena 

magdalena said camarga with surprise you swore her name was
infeliz

ay but the true one is magdalena when she came from spain 

from spain cried camarga starting is she not an islander

pho didst thou ever see a creature of her beauty born out of
andalusia

i have not seen her but i will yes by all the saints of heaven i
will i must how came she to the island

oh a-horseback i think said villafana for the ship was never seen
at isabela never question about that the two young dogs hilario and
juan found her somewhere brought her to old milagro and juan being
more favoured and better beloved than hilario who to say truth was
both ugly and vicious they fought about her and hilario was killed
thus juan was left the master of the beauty but being tired of her or
afraid of old milagro's vengeance or perhaps both he fled again to
cuba and thence as you heard came to mexico in a fusta what brought
magdalena after him i know not unless twas mad raging love yes
faith that's the cause for she cares not half so much for don hernan
but they did say at isabela she had a better cause for the ship it
was well known 

fool of all fools said camarga with a strange and unnatural laugh
didst thou not say the ship was never seen at isabela

ay truly but it was seen on the rocks at the point of alonso not
many leagues distant replied villafana and then added i would thou
couldst be more choice of thine epithets of endearment these knaves
rogues and fools do well enough among friends but one may season
discourse too strongly with them even for the roughest appetite the
ship was a wreck there was said to be foul work about it but that's
neither here nor there the girl was brought ashore by the young men
juan being good in the management of a skiff indeed a notoriously
skilful and fearless sailor what was said of magdalena was this
continued the alguazil with a low confidential voice it was
discovered or at least conjectured that the ship was no other than the
santa anonciacion a vessel sent from seville with a bevy of
nuns faith some worshippers of thine own good st dominic who were
to found a convent at the havana it was whispered that the fair
magdalena was even one of the number and therefore but the thing must
be plain to be a nun and to love young fellows par amours this is a
matter for the inquisition but thanks be to god we have no good
brothers in mexico i will tell thee more as we walk and show thee
if thou hast not the wit to see it how much it concerns us to have a
friend like la monjonaza

i have heard enough said camarga with tones deep and hoarse
enough and more than enough and this woman was then the leman of
juan lerma and now the creature of cortes here he muttered
something to himself then speaking with an audible voice he said

get thee to thy den and look to thyself there is danger afloat and
full enough to excuse me from meddling with thee to-night there is a
force of men concealed near to the prison and commanded by guzman ask
no questions look to thyself thou art suspected

at these words villafana became greatly alarmed and exchanging but a
few words more with camarga hastily departed he was no sooner gone
than camarga yielding to an emotion he had long suppressed fell upon
his knees and uttered wild prayers mingled with groans and
maledictions all the while beating his breast and brows then rising
and whipping out his sword as if to execute some deadly purpose of
vengeance he strode towards the pool




chapter xi


no sooner had the alguazil departed from the enclosure than the figure
which juan had beheld obscurely among the shadows stepped slowly into
the moonshine looking like a phantom because so closely shrouded from
head to foot that nothing was seen but the similitude of a human being
wrapped as it might be imagined in a gray winding-sheet the thick
hood and veil concealed her countenance and even her hands were hidden
among the folds

it seemed for a moment as if she were about to speak for low murmurs
came inarticulately from the veil as for juan himself he was kept
silent by the most painful agitation at last and when it appeared as
if the unhappy being was conscious that no other mode of revealment was
in her power she raised her hand to her head and the next moment the
hood falling back the moonbeams fell upon the exposed visage of la
monjonaza it was exceedingly indeed deadly pale and the gleaming of
her dewy forehead indicated how feebly even her powerful strength of
mind contended with a sense of humiliation she made an effort to
elevate her head to compose her features into womanly dignity but all
in vain her hands sought each other and were clasped together upon her
breast her lips quivered her head fell and her eyes after one wild
brief and supplicating glance were cast upon the earth

alas magdalena exclaimed juan with tones of the deepest feeling
do i see you here do i see you thus

at these words she raised her head with a sudden and convulsive start
as if the imputation they conveyed had stung her to the soul and as she
bent her eyes upon juan though they were filled with tears yet they
flashed with what seemed a noble indignation but this was soon changed
to a milder and sadder expression and the flush which had accompanied
it was quickly replaced by her former paleness

thou dost indeed see me here she replied summoning her resolution
and speaking firmly and thou seest me thus degraded not in thine
imagination only but in the suspicions of all down to the level of
scorn yes she continued bitterly and while thou pitiest me for a
shame endured only for thyself endured only that i may requite thee
with life for life thou art sorry thy hand ever snatched me from the
billows speak juan lerma is it not so

it had been better magdalena said the youth reproachfully for
besides that the act caused me to be stained with blood it afflicts me
with a curse still more heavy i do not mourn the death of hilario as i
mourn the downfall of one whom i once esteemed almost a seraph

villain that he was cried magdalena with vindictive impetuosity
mean and malignant in life and in death who with a lie living
destroyed the peace and the fame of the friendless and died with a lie
that both might remain blighted for ever o wretch o wretch there is
no punishment for him among the fiends for he was of their nature and
thou mournest his death too thou cursest the hand that avenged the
wrong of a feeble woman

i lament that i slew the son of my benefactor said juan with a deep
sigh and then added with one still deeper but sinner that i am i
rejoice while looking on thee in the fierce thought that i killed the
destroyer of innocence

the destroyer of innocence indeed replied magdalena with a voice
broken and suffocating yes innocence she exclaimed more wildly or
at least the fame of innocence for innocence herself he could not
harm no by heaven oh no for what i came from the sea that i am
now yes now i tell thee now and if thou darest give tongue to
aught else if thou darest think oh heaven this is more than i can
bear say juan lerma say dost thou too believe me the thing i am
called the base the fallen the degraded

alas magdalena replied juan to the wild demand with his dying
lips hilario  

with his dying lips he perjured his soul for ever exclaimed
magdalena for ever for ever she went on with inexpressible energy
and fury and may the curse of a broken-hearted woman destroyed by his
defaming malice cling to him as long scorching him with fresh
torments even when fiends grow relentful and forbearing mountains of
fire requite the coals he has thrown upon my bosom may god never
forgive him no never never

this is horrid said juan revoke thy malediction it is impiety
alas alas he continued moved with compassion as the singular being
passing at once from a sibyl-like rage to the deepest and most feminine
abasement of grief wrung her hands and sobbed aloud and bitterly
would indeed that thou hadst perished with the others

would that i had said magdalena more calmly but thou hadst then
been left to a malice like that which has slain me no not like that
for it is content with thy life i would ask thee more of myself
she went on more composedly after a little pause but it needs not
if i can show thee thou wrongest me concerning hilario canst thou not
believe i may be even here without stain well i care not one day
thou wilt know thou hast wronged me but let the shame rest upon me now
for it needs i should think not of myself but of thee listen to me
juan lerma for fallen or not yet am i thine only friend among a
thousand enemies give up thy service thy hopes of fame and fortune in
this land and leave it leave mexico return to the islands thou hast
marvellously escaped a death subtly and cruelly designed and now thou
art destined to an end as vengeful and perhaps even more inevitable
yet there is one way of escape and there is one moment to take
advantage of it leave mexico cortes is thy foe leave mexico

these are but wild words magdalena said juan with a troubled voice
i would do much to remove thee from a situation the thought whereof
is bitterer to me than my own misfortunes

wouldst thou said magdalena eagerly go then and i go likewise go
then and know that thy departure not only releases me from a situation
of disgrace but enables me to make clear a reputation which thou yes
thou believest to be sullied and lost i am not what i seem saints
of heaven that i should have to say it but by the grave of my mother
i swear juan lerma thou doest me as deep a wrong as others leave this
land and thou shalt see that the fame of an angel is not purer than
mine own scorned name no by heaven no freer from a deserved shame
thou shakest thy head i could kill thee juan lerma i could kill
thee she went on with a strange mingling of fierce resentment and
beseeching grief i could kill thee for i have not deserved this of
thee then changing her tone and clasping her hands submissively she
said but think not of me or rather continue to think me unworthy of
aught but pity think not above all that what i do is with any
reference to myself no heaven is my witness i claim of thee neither
affection nor respect i am content to be mistaken to be despised all
this i can endure and will uncomplaining so that i can rescue thee
from the danger in which thou art placed leave this land don hernan
deceives thee he hates thee and thirsts after thy blood he has
confessed it

god be my help said juan despairingly my life is in his hands if
this be true 

if it be true repeated magdalena it is known to all but thyself

it is not true exclaimed the young man vehemently i have done
him no wrong and he is not the detestable being you would make him if
he be i owe him a life let him have it it is in his hands

leave mexico reiterated magdalena if thou goest to tochtepec thou
art lost i have it in my power to aid nay to secure thy escape say
therefore thou wilt consent say thou wilt leave mexico

it cannot be said juan with a sad and sullen resolution i will
await my fate in mexico

and wilt thou stand like the fat ox till the noose is cast upon thy
neck till thou art butchered

my life is nothing i live not for myself the redemption of others
depends upon my acts i have a duty that speaks more urgently than fear
my lot is cast in mexico i cannot leave it

as he spoke with a firm voice he bent his looks expressively on his
companion her eyes flashed fire and they shone from her pale face like
living coals

sayst thou this to me she exclaimed her voice trembling with fury
sayst thou this to me then advancing a step and laying her hand upon
his arm she continued her accents sinking almost into whispers they
were so subdued or so feeble lay not upon thy soul a sin greater than
stains it already leave mexico resolve or die leave mexico or
perish oh thou art guiltier than thou thinkest thou hast cursed
hilario for my fall curse thyself not hilario but thyself for but
for thee but for thee i had been happy yes happy happy

to these words juan though greatly compassionating the distress of the
speaker would have replied with remonstrance but she gave him no
opportunity she continued to repeat over and over again with a kind of
hysterical pertinacity the words leave mexico leave mexico so that
juan was not only prevented replying but confounded he was relieved
from embarrassment by a sudden growl coming from the bushes at his
side la monjonaza started at the sound and in the moment of silence
that succeeded both could distinguish the steps of a man rapidly
approaching the pool at the same instant another growl was heard and
befo issuing from the leafy covert took a stand by his master's side
as if to defend him from an enemy the veil of magdalena fell over her
visage she paused but to whisper in tones of such energy that they
thrilled him to the soul leave mexico or die and then instantly
vanished among the boughs it was too late for juan to follow her he
had scarce time to lay his hand upon befo's neck and moderate his
ferocity before his eyes were struck with the strange spectacle of a
tall man in the garb of a dominican friar his face pale as death his
hand holding a naked sword who strode into the inclosure and upon that
part of the path which was illuminated by the moonbeams no sooner had
he cast his eyes upon juan than he exclaimed die wretch and made a
pass at him with his weapon had the lunge been skilfully made it must
have proved fatal for though juan still held the sheathless rapier he
had brought from his chamber he was so much surprised at the suddenness
of the apparition that his attempt to ward it could not have succeeded
against a good fencer a better protection was given by the faithful
befo who darting from juan's hand against the assailant's breast
attacked him with a shock so violent that in an instant the señor
camarga for it was he who played this insane part lay rolling upon his
back his grizzled locks streaming in the pool

in the name of heaven what dost thou mean and who art thou impostor
and assassin cried juan pulling off the dog and helping camarga to
his feet thou art mad i think

there was something in the man's countenance as well as in the
murderous attempt to confirm the idea for camarga's agitation was
singular and extreme and he seemed unable to answer a word

who art thou continued juan angrily impressed with the certainty
that he had seen the face of the assailant before yet without knowing
when or where confess thyself straight or i will have thee to the
alguazil and see the friar's frock scourged from thy base body

however eager and foreboding the young man's curiosity it was doomed to
be disappointed by a new interruption while he yet spoke he was
alarmed by a sudden discharge of firearms followed by shrieks and
cries at the bottom of the garden and presently the whole solitude was
transformed into a scene of tumult and uproar lights were seen flashing
among the trees and men were heard running confusedly to and fro
calling to one another

the last word had hardly parted from his lips before the boughs crashed
on the opposite side of the pool and a new actor was suddenly added to
the scene




chapter xii


as the bushes parted a tall figure sprang into the path and running
round the pool would instantly have been at the side of the two
castilians who were yet unobserved had it not been that befo his
ferocity greatly whetted by his former encounter darted forward as at
first with a sudden roar with equal violence and with similar
success as the stranger fell to the earth under an attack so impetuous
and unexpected he uttered an exclamation in which juan recognized the
language of mexico he ran forwards guided by the growls of the beast
and the stifled cries of the man for the spot on which the two
contended was covered with impenetrable gloom and by accident caught
the stranger's arm and felt that it wielded a heavy macana now
uplifted against the animal as his other hand was stretched forward
again to remove the victorious befo from a fallen antagonist it fell
upon the naked breast of a barbarian in a moment more he had torn the
dog away and dragged the savage into the moonshine where he had left
camarga standing but where camarga stood no longer he had fled away in
the confusion unobserved and now almost forgotten

here juan released the captive from his powerful grasp for his rapier
was in his hand and the macana of the mexican he had already cast into
the pool and thus standing confiding as much in the aid of befo as in
the menacing attitude of his weapon he began to address his prisoner

what art thou he demanded in the tongue which as he had boasted
was almost as familiar to him as the language of spain what art thou
and what dost thou here

instead of answering the mexican gazing over his conqueror's shoulder
seemed to survey with looks of admiration and alarm some spectacle
behind his back juan cast his eye in the direction thus indicated and
beheld the visage of magdalena recalled by the tumult gleaming hard
by in an instant more she had vanished and he turned again to the
captive who when the vision to him so inexplicable had faded away
now directed his attention to an object equally surprising and much more
formidable in his estimation than even the redoubtable juan as he
rolled his eyes in mingled wonder trepidation and anger on the huge
befo who now stood regarding him writhing his lips and showing his
tusks in the manner with which he was wont so expressively to intimate
his readiness to obey any signal of attack juan had full leisure to
observe that the indian was a young man not above twenty-three or
twenty-four years old of good and manly stature and limbs nobly
proportioned his only garments were a tunic and mantle of some
dark-coloured stuff but little ornamented the former extending from
the waist to the knees the latter knotted as usual about his throat
but so disordered and torn by the teeth of the dog as to leave the
upper part of his body nearly naked his only defensive armour was a
little round buckler of the skin of the danta or tapir not exceeding
fourteen inches in diameter strapped to his left arm the loss of the
macana had left him without any offensive weapon as he raised his head
at the second salutation of his capturer he flung back the long masses
of black hair from his forehead and displayed a visage as well at
least as it could be seen in the moonlight not unworthy his manly
person

olin the tongue of the teuctli is a prisoner

as he pronounced these words in his own language signifying that he
was an orator of his high class and that he confessed himself a
captive he touched the earth with his hand and kissed it in token of
submission the tones of his voice caused juan to start

he dropped his sword-point advanced nearer to him and perused his
features with intense curiosity his gaze was returned with a look of
equal surprise which betrayed a touch of fear for the mexican at once
exclaimed withdrawing a step backward

the great eagle fell among the archers of matlatzinco

the king is not wise guatimozin is in the hands of cortes said juan
with deep earnestness

olin is the orator the king is wise replied the indian hastily

it is in vain said juan thou art guatimozin and a captive too
ere a blow has been struck in the camp of thy foeman is this an end
for the king of mexico

quauhtimozin can die there are other kings for the free warriors of
tenochtitlan replied the young monarch boldly and haughtily avowing
his name which is here given in its original and genuine harshness
that the reader may be made acquainted with it though it is not
intended to substitute it for its more agreeable and familiar
corruption guatimozin is a prisoner he continued with a firm voice
and lofty demeanour but the king of mexico is free when did the
great eagle become the foe of guatimozin

i am not thy foe replied juan but thy friend so far at least as
it becomes a christian and spaniard to be i lament to see thee in this
place i am not thy foe

raise then thy weapon said the prince dropping his haughty manner
and ceremonious style and speaking as he laid his hand on juan's arm
with fierce emotion strike me through the neck and cast my body into
the pool it is not fit that guatimozin should wear the bonds of
montezuma

it must not be supposed that this conversation took place in quiet
during the whole time on the contrary the garden continued to resound
with the voices of men running from copse to copse from alley to alley
sometimes drawing nigh and at other moments appearing to be removed
to the furthest limits of the grounds at the moment when the mexican
made his abrupt and insane appeal to the friendship of his capturer a
party of spaniards rushed by at so short a distance and with so much
clamour that he had good reason to conceive himself almost already in
their hands they passed by however and with them fled a portion of
juan's embarrassment as soon as he perceived they were beyond hearing
he replied

this were to be thy foe indeed but oh unwise and imprudent what
tempted thee to this mad confidence

the craft of malintzin replied the mexican making use of a name
which his people had long since attached to cortes the craft of
malintzin who ensnares his foe like the wild ottomi hidden among the
reeds he scatters the sweet berry on the lake and steals upon the
feeding sheldrake so steals malintzin he sends words of peace to the
foe afar when the foe is asleep malintzin is a tiger

and thou hast been deceived by these perfidious and unworthy arts
said juan the innuendoes of villafana and the monitions of magdalena
recurring to his mind with painful force

deceived and trapped replied the infidel with fierce indignation
cajoled by lies circumvented by treachery seduced and betrayed is
the great eagle like malintzin as he spoke thus sinking his voice
which was indeed all the time cautiously subdued he again laid his hand
on the young christian's arm and continued

art thou such a man and dost thou desire the blood of thy friend what
shall be said to the little centzontli the mocking-bird the little
centzontli sang the song to guatimozin let not the great eagle die in
the trap what sings she now does the great eagle listen to the little
centzontli

he does replied juan on whom these metaphors however mysterious
they may seem to the reader produced a strong impression thou art
my prisoner not don hernan's and it rests with me to liberate or to
bind not with him answer me therefore truly for if thou hast been
trained by treachery into this present danger coming with thoughts of
peace and composition and not with an army to surprise and slay thou
shalt be made free even though the act cost me my life

i come in peace does the leader of an army walk bareheaded and naked
my canoe lies hid among the reeds my warriors are asleep on the island
the christian sent for a lord of the city to give his hand to the angry
men of tlascala guatimozin is not the king but he brought them the
hand of the king it was the lie of malintzin i am betrayed

if i suffer thee to depart said juan anxiously canst thou make
good thy escape

is not guatimozin a soldier replied the mexican with a gleaming eye
give me a sword and hold fast the christian tiger 

hark peace whispered juan drawing the prisoner suddenly among the
boughs we are beset hist befo hist

with a degree of uneasiness which approached almost to fear when he
found that befo instead of following him into his concealment remained
out upon the illuminated path where he attracted notice while
expressing fidelity by setting up an audible growl juan heard a man
crash through the boughs on the further side of the pool all the while
calling loudly and cheerily to his companions

hither knaves he cried the fox is in cover hither quick
hither

it was the voice of guzman he had caught the growl of the dog and
responded with a shout of triumph as he ran forward closely followed
by three or four soldiers armed with spears

the bloodhound for ever he has the fox in his mouth i know by his
growling hah befo fool he continued when he had reached the
animal art thou baying the moon then pass on pass on no indian
passes scotfree by befo at midnight pass on pass on

in a moment more the nook was left to its solitude and juan
reappeared with the prince the sight and voice of guzman had stirred
up his wrath and he took his measures with a quicker and sterner
resolution

he protects and loves this man who is a villain he muttered through
his teeth there is nothing else left follow me prince if we are
seen thy fate is not more certain than mine follow me in silence

the garden was still alive with men they could be seen running about in
different directions though the greatest numbers seemed to be collected
at the bottom near to the lake side it was not from this circumstance
however so much as from his ignorance of every portion of the grounds
except that by which he had approached the pool that he bent his steps
towards the wing of the palace he had so lately left he advanced
cautiously taking advantage of every clump of trees which could afford
concealment from any passing group and once or twice to allay
suspicion adding his voice to those of the others as if engaged in the
same duty in which latter stratagem he was ably seconded by the
unconscious befo whose bark excited by the shout of his master was a
sufficient warrant to all within hearing of the friendly character of
the party

thus assisted by the undesigned help of the dog and by the imitative
caution of the mexican he succeeded in reaching the wing of the palace
and the passage that led to his chamber which was illumined by torches
of resinous wood a door leading to the open square that surrounded the
palace opened opposite to that by which he entered from the garden it
was his intention if possible to pass through this into the city not
doubting that it would be easy to conceal the fugitive among the
thousand barbarians of his own colour and appearance who yet thronged
the streets after which it would not perhaps be impracticable to find
some way to discharge him from the gates but unfortunately as he
pressed towards it he found the outer door beset by armed men
thronging tumultuously in as if to join their comrades in the garden
there was nothing left him then but to seek his apartment as hastily
as he could and there conceal the mexican until the heat of pursuit was
over a motion of his hand apprized the fugitive of his change of
purpose and guatimozin darting quickly forward was already stealing
into the chamber when a harsh voice suddenly bawled behind

mutiny and miracles here runs the rat with the viper treason
treason

it was the hunchback najara whose quick eye detected the vanishing
hair and who now ran forward in pursuit followed by a confused throng
of soldiers from among whom suddenly darted the cavalier don francisco
de guzman

juan had reached the door the cry of najara assured him that he was
discovered and conscious that his act of generosity was or of right
ought to be considered little better than sheer treason the varied
passions of hope grief indignation and wrath which had been the
whole evening chasing one another through his bosom gave place at once
to the single feeling of despair he felt that he was now lost

at this very moment while his brain was confused and his heart dying
within him a laugh sounded in his ear and he heard even above the
clamorous shouts of the soldiers the voice of guzman exclaiming

what think'st thou now señor art thou conquered stand i arrest
thee

he turned the cavalier was within reach of his arm and the malignant
sneer was yet writhing over his visage the words of scorn the look of
exultation were intolerable the rapier was already naked in his hand
and almost before he was himself aware of the act it was aimed with a
deadly lunge at don francisco's throat

the deed has slain thee cried guzman leaping backwards so as to
avoid a thrust too fiercely sudden to be parried and then again rushing
forward before he could be supported by the soldiers who had also
recoiled at this show of resistance the act has slain thee and so
take the fate thou art seeking

as he spoke he advanced his weapon which was before unsheathed
against an adversary whom the recollection of a thousand wrongs had
inflamed to frenzy but who could scarcely be supposed to have retained
during a year of servitude and suffering the skill in arms which once
made him an equal antagonist nevertheless guzman's pass was turned
aside and returned with such interest that had the field been fair
and unincumbered it is questionable how long he might have lived to
repeat it as it was the combat was cut short by the interposition of
the bloodhound who whining at first as if unwilling to attack a
cavalier so long and so well known as don francisco and yet unable to
remain neuter at last added his fierce yell to the clash of the
weapons and decided the battle by springing against guzman's breast it
was perhaps fortunate for the cavalier that he did he had a breastplate
on and for this reason juan aimed the few blows that were made full
at his throat with the fatal determination of one who hopeless of
life himself had sworn a vow to his soul that his enemy should die it
was but the third thrust he had made they had scarce occupied so many
seconds and it was directed with such irresistible skill and violence
that the point of the weapon was already gliding through guzman's beard
and razing his skin when the weight of befo's assault for the third
time successful hurled him from his feet and thus saved his life at
the expense of a severe gash made through his right cheek and ear

the whole of this encounter from the first attack to the fall of
guzman had not occupied the space of twenty seconds and don francisco
was at the mercy of his rival before even the rapid najara could
advance a spear to protect him it was not improbable that juan would
have taken a deadly advantage of the mishap for as he had declared in
a cooler moment he hated don francisco and his blood was now boiling
if such however was his purpose he was prevented putting it into
execution by another one of those opposing accidents which seemed this
night to pursue him with such unrelenting rigour

before he could advance a single step a cavalier bareheaded and
unarmed save that he flourished a naked sword sprang from the throng
of soldiers followed by the señor camarga now without his masking
habit the latter of whom cried with fierce emphasis all the time
kill him cut him down kill him until the soldiers caught up the
cry and the whole passage echoed with their furious exclamations these
served but the end of still further exasperating the choler of the young
man thus beset as it seemed by the tyranny of numbers and seeing the
bareheaded cavalier advancing against him and already betwixt him and
his fallen rival he turned upon him with fresh fury

hah cried the new antagonist when juan's weapon clashed against his
own traitor dost thou provoke thy fate

the words were not out of his lips before juan perceived that he had
raised his rapier against the bosom of cortes he beheld in the
countenance which he had once loved the scowl of an evil spirit and
the fire flashing from the general's eyes was no longer to be mistaken
for aught but the revelation of the deadliest hatred he flung down his
sword resisting no longer and the next instant would have been run
through the body but that befo fearing to attack and yet unable to
resist the impulse of fidelity sprang up with a howl and seized the
weapon with his teeth before cortes could disengage it and again turn
it upon the unfortunate youth the mexican fugitive glided from the
apartment threw himself before the latter and taking the point of the
weapon in his hand placed it against his own naked breast then bowing
his head submissively he stood in tranquillity expecting his death

at his sudden appearance the soldiers set up a shout and cortes was
sufficiently diverted from his bloody purpose to smooth his frowning
brow into an air of official sternness

olin is the prisoner of the teuctli murmured the captive in words
scarce understood by any one present except juan

where bide mine alguazils demanded the captain-general without
condescending to notice the mexican any further than merely by removing
the rapier from his grasp hah guzman thou art hurt art thou by
heaven but he checked the oath when he observed that guzman already
on his feet notwithstanding the frightful appearance that was given him
by the blood running down his cheek and neck and drippling slowly from
his beard replied to the exclamation with a smile of peculiar coolness
get thee to a surgeon where bide the alguazils is there no officer to
rid me of a traitor

señor general said juan sullenly i am no traitor 

he was interrupted by the appearance of two men carrying batons who
bustled from among the crowd and laid hands upon him the readiest and
the most officious was villafana who concealed a vast deal of agitation
under an air of extravagant zeal

ha villafana art thou found at last cried don hernan with apparent
anger hast thou no better care of thy ward on the water-side but that
spies may come stealing into my garden

may it please your excellency said villafana recovering his wit i
was neither gambling nor asleep but slid this is a pretty piece of
villany oho señor mutineer this is hanging-work speak not a word
as you love life this was spoken apart into juan's ear what is
your excellency's will touching the prisoner

have him to prison and see that he escape not

these words were pronounced with a coolness and gravity that amazed all
who had witnessed the rage which but a moment before had shaken the
frame of the captain-general and you ye idle fellows he continued
addressing the soldiers get you to your quarters to your watch or to
your beds begone why loiter ye villafana conduct away the
prisoner

juan raised his eyes once more to the general and seemed as if he would
have spoken but confused and bewildered by the extraordinary
termination of the drama of the day chilled by frowns oppressed by a
consciousness of having provoked his fate his head sunk in a deep
dejection on his breast and he suffered himself to be led silently
away

a gleam of light such as flares up at night from a decaying brand just
lost in ashes sprang up in the leader's eyes as they followed the
steps of the unhappy youth until passing from that door which he had
so vainly sought to gain with the mexican he vanished from sight its
lustre was hidden from all but the captive who maintaining throughout
the whole scene the self-possession characteristic of all the american
race from the pygmies of the frozen sea to the giants of patagonia did
not lose the opportunity thus afforded of diving into the thoughts of
the invader

as soon as juan lerma had departed with the mass of the soldiers
cortes turned to the mexican and with a mild countenance and a gentle
voice which were designed to convey the proper interpretation of his
castilian speech said

let my young friend the tlatoani be at peace and fear not no harm
is designed him

then making a signal to those who remained to lead the captive after
him he passed into the garden and thence by a private entrance into
the hall of audience




chapter xiii


it has been already mentioned that the person of guatimozin was
familiar to few or none of the spaniards intensely and consistently
hostile to the invaders from the first moment of their appearance in
the valley he had ever kept aloof from them and was one of the few
princes of mexico whom neither force nor stratagem could reduce to
thraldom his youth indeed his want of authority for though of the
loftiest birth and the highest military fame he enjoyed at first no
independent command or government and hence his apparent
insignificance had made the possession of his person of no great
consequence and it was not until he was seen leading the incensed
citizens up against the guns of the garrison and directing the assault
which terminated in the life of montezuma that he began to be
considered an enemy worthy to be feared even then however he was but
one among the warlike followers of cuitlahuatzin the successor of
montezuma and on the famous battle-field of otumba he fought only as
a second in command but from that time until the present moment his
name was constantly before the spaniards first as the king of
iztapalapan then as a leader among those royal warriors sent forth by
cuitlahuatzin now to annoy the spaniards even among their fortresses
on the borders of tlascala and now to chastise those rebellious tribes
which were daily acknowledging allegiance to the spaniard and preparing
to march with him against tenochtitlan

the death of cuitlahuatzin had suddenly exposed him to view as the
probable successor to the imperial dignity and the act of the royal
electors the kings of mexico were chosen by the crowned vassals of the
empire in bestowing the mantle and sceptre had left nothing to be
done to confirm his authority save a solemn inauguration on the day of
an august religious and national festival

he had thus assumed the attitude which montezuma had once preserved in
the eyes of the conquistador and it was as much the policy of cortes to
attempt the acts of delusion with him as it had been with his
predecessor the craftier and haughtier guatimozin had however
rejected his overtures with disdain and justly appreciating the
character and designs of his enemy he prepared for war as the only
alternative of slavery he had already concentrated in his city and in
the neighbouring towns the whole martial force of the tribes yet
valiant and faithful he had laboured with an address that was not
always ineffectual to regain the false and rebellious and rising
above the weakness of national resentments he had even striven to unite
his hereditary foes in a league of resistance against the stranger who
whether frowning or smiling whether courting with friendship or
subduing with arms was yet and equally the enemy of all

enough has been said to explain the purpose for which he so rashly threw
himself into the power of the conqueror the certain assurance of
disaffection in the invader's camp not only among the allies but among
the spaniards themselves was enough to fire his heart with the desire
of employing against don hernan a weapon which his foe had used so
fatally against him and besides the opportunity of detaching the
tlascalans from the spanish interest was too captivating to be
rejected these were advantages to be investigated and promoted by
himself rather than by agents and confiding in his enemies ignorance
of his person in his cunning and in the interested fidelity of
traitors who had already grasped at bribes and were eager to be better
acquainted with his bounty he did not scruple to direct his midnight
skiff among the reeds on the lakeside and in the guise of a mere
noble trust himself alone in their power

if the reader desire to know what could induce any of the followers of
cortes to treat thus perfidiously with the infidel enemy whose wealth
was promised as the certain guerdon of war he may be answered almost in
a word the dangers of the war were manifold and obvious to all and
the horrors of the five days battles in the streets of mexico and more
than all the calamities of the midnight retreat had given such a
foretaste of what might be expected from a prosecution of the campaign
that full half the army looked forward to it with equal terror and
repugnance a majority of those who survived the noche triste were
followers of the unfortunate narvaez and some of them yet friendly to
the deceived velasquez they remained with cortes upon compulsion and
they hated him not only for their inability to return to their peaceable
farms among the islands for past calamities and coming misfortunes
but for the superior favours showered so liberally and indeed so
naturally upon those who had been his original and were yet his
faithful adherents in a word they regarded the reduction of the
mexican empire as hopeless and their own fate if they remained as
already written in characters of blood the bolder scowled and
complained the feeble and the crafty dissembled but evil thoughts and
fierce resolutions were common to all they burned to be released from
what was to them intolerable bondage and the means were not to be
questioned even though they might involve connivance and collusion with
the foe but such collusion was by no means known nor even suspected
by any save the few desperadoes who had risen to the bad eminence of
leaders even villafana was ignorant of the true character of his guest
and esteemed him to be only what he represented himself olin the
young noble an orator counsellor and confidential agent of
guatimozin it was not possible for the captain-general to regard him in
any other light

whatever may have been the young monarch's thoughts his secret
misgivings and self-reproaches as he strode closely environed by
cavaliers into the great hall now dimly lighted by tapers of vegetable
wax and torches of fragrant wood they were exposed by no agitation of
countenance or hesitation of step and when cortes ascended the platform
to his seat and turned his penetrating eye upon him he preserved an
air of the most fearless tranquillity for the space of several moments
the general regarded him in silence then commanding all to leave the
apartment excepting sandoval alvarado and another cavalier who
officiated as interpreter he said to alvarado with a mild voice very
strangely contrasted with the rudeness of his words

look into the face of this heathen dog and tell me if thou knowest
him

alvarado had been as the historical reader is aware left in mexico
the jailer of montezuma and the warden of the city during the absence
of cortes when he marched against narvaez it was supposed therefore
that don pedro was better acquainted with the persons of the principal
nobles than any other cavalier he examined the captive curiously and
at last said shaking his head

methinks his visage is not unknown and yet i wot not to whom it
belongs the knave is but a boy if he be a noble never trust me but he
is one of guatimozin's making and therefore not yet of consequence

at the sound of his own name the only word distinguishable by the
prisoner alvarado observed that his brow contracted a little but this
awoke no suspicion

demand of him said cortes to the interpreter his name and the
purpose of his coming to tezcuco

when this was explained to the mexican his brow contracted still
further but rather with inquisitiveness than embarrassment

i am olin-pilli that is olin the lord or lord olin he replied
the speaker of wise things to the king and the mouth of nobles

he then paused as if to examine with what degree of belief he was
listened to and being satisfied from the countenance of don hernan
that he was really unknown he continued with a more confident tone

and i come to the lord of the east the son of the god of air to hear
the words of his children did not the teuctli send for me

not i replied the captain-general sternly speaker of wise things
i look into thy heart and i see thy falsehood thou art a spy a
quimichin sent by guatimozin the king to speak dark things to the
men of tlascala

the captive though somewhat disconcerted maintained a fearless
countenance

the teuctli is the son of the gods and knows everything he answered

and charged also continued cortes to whisper in the ears of fools
who send good words to the king that the king may enrich them with
gold is not this true sir quimichin

is not malintzin the son of quetzalcoatl the white god with a beard
who proclaimed from the hill of shouting and from the speaking
mountain the coming of his offspring and shall olin know more
things than malintzin guatimozin thinks that the spaniard should not
slay his people

footnote tzatzitepec a mountain near tula

footnote catcitepetl a volcano

wherefore then sent he not thee to me demanded the
captain-general i will listen to his words it was not wise to send
his ambassador to the soldier when the general sat by in his
tent hearken to me friend olin he continued with gravity hadst
thou brought his discourse to me thou hadst then been listened to with
honour and dismissed in peace art thou a soldier

olin is a counsellor replied the mexican proudly but he has bled
in battle

and is not guatimozin a warrior

he is the king of the house of darts and he has struck his foe

when the lurking ottomi is found skulking in his camp when the angry
tlascalan creeps up to his fort what does guatimozin then with the
prisoner what says he to the ottomi what wills he with the tlascalan

he binds them to the stone and they die like the dogs of the altar
replied the barbarian with a fierce utterance

thou hast spoken thine own doom replied cortes sternly only that
instead of perishing according to thy damnable customs a sacrifice to
spirits accurst thou shalt have such death as we give to the dogs of
castile thou hast crept into my camp like the spying ottomi thou
comest with sword and shield like the bravo of tlascala and thou hast
addressed thyself to traitors and conspirators to make them mine
enemies why then should i not hang thee upon a tree or why he
continued with an elevated voice descending from the platform and
with a single motion unsheathing his rapier and aiming it against the
captive's breast why should i not kill thee thou cur upon the spot

i am a mexican replied the young king rather opposing his body to
the expected thrust than seeking to avoid it i look upon my death and
i spit upon thee spaniard

hah cried cortes whose desire was to intimidate not to slay and
who could not but admire the fearless air of defiance so boldly assumed
by the captive thou hast either a true heart or a penetrating
eye fear not thy life is in my hands but i design thee no wrong
death were but a just punishment for thy villany yet i mean not to
enforce it what wilt thou do if i discharge thee unharmed

i will know said the barbarian with a look of surprise as soon as
this was interpreted that malintzin is not always hungry for blood or
rather i will ask of my thoughts what mischief to mexico is meditated
in the act of mercy

a shrewd knave i'faith a shrewd knave cried cortes admiringly by
my conscience this fellow hath somewhat the wit of a christian
politician infidel he continued hearken to what i say i desire to
speak the words of peace with my young brother guatimozin wherefore
will he not listen to me

because his ears are open to the groans of his children replied the
mexican promptly when malintzin smiles the brand hisses on the flesh
of the prisoner when he talks of peace the great warhorse paws the
breast of the dead let this thing be not let his insurgent subjects be
sent to their villages and guatimozin will listen to the teuctli

he has slain my ambassadors said cortes

shall the slave say to his master i am the bondman of another and
laugh in the king's face let malintzin send a christian to guatimozin
i will row him in my skiff and he shall return unharmed

what thinkest thou of this i will send him such an envoy and thou
shalt remain a hostage in his place what will be said to him by the
king of mexico

this replied the captive without a moment's hesitation the
christian is in mexico and olin-pilli in the prisons of malintzin let
the christian therefore die

ay by my conscience he speaks well said cortes but were
friendship offered and twenty thousand hostages left behind i should
like to know what spaniard of us all would perform the pilgrimage there
is but one but that is naught by heaven and st john we will think
of other things we will think of other things is it not death by the
decree

señor cried alvarado in surprise cortes started in the moment of
entranced thought he had stridden away from the group to some distance
and he now perceived they were gazing at him with wonder

we will entrust this thing to him then as i said he cried
hurriedly and he shall return with the misbeliever's answer we have
no other choice what think ye of it my masters

of what said alvarado bluntly you have said nothing by'r lady
and with reverence to your excellency you are dreaming

pho cried the captain-general did i not speak it our thoughts
sometimes sound in our ears like words this is the philosophy of the
marvel hast thou never when thine eyes were shut yet beheld in them
the objects of which thou wert thinking if thou couldst think music
never believe me but thou wouldst also hear it this then is the
thought which i forgot to utter i will give this dog his freedom and
for lack of a better make him my envoy to guatimozin if he return it
will be well if not we are left where we were and we can hang him
hereafter

let us first know said sandoval coolly by what sort of charm he
prevailed on this mad young man juan lerma to peril limb and life for
him and what is more honour too

ay by my conscience said cortes hurriedly this thing i had
forgotten he shall die the death connive with a spy conceal him from
the pursuers draw sword upon a cavalier strike at an officer's life
were he mine own brother he should abide his doom who will say i wrong
him now hah what says the dog how came this thing to pass

while cortes was yet pursuing the subject nearest to his heart half
soliloquizing the question was asked and answered and the reply to
guatimozin's great relief was received with unexpected belief

he was caught by the bloodhound an excellent dog that befo said
alvarado and making his moan to lerma whom heaven take to its rest
for i know not how he can be so brave and yet an ass the young fool
fell to his old tricks when did an indian ever ask him for pity in
vain this is his story it is too natural to be false yet indians
are great liars but you said something of making this cur your envoy

ay replied cortes what sayst thou olin speaker of wise things
wilt thou bear my thoughts to thy master guatimozin

the lord of tenochtitlan shall hear them said guatimozin his eyes
gleaming with expectation

and thou wilt return to me with his answer swear this upon the cross
of my sword ay and swear it by thy diabolical gods also

guatimozin shall send back to malintzin a noble mexican or otherwise
olin will return how shall the mexican noble know that the teuctli will
not take his life

does that deter you said cortes i swear by the cross which i
worship that come thou or another or come guatimozin himself
provided he come to me in peace and with the king's message he shall
depart in safety with good-will and with favours such as this

as he spoke he took from his own neck and flung round the mexican's a
chain of beads which were neither of diamond sapphire nor ruby but
sufficiently resembling each and all to gratify the vanity of a
barbarian the young king smiled but it was at the thought of freedom

thou shalt have more such and richer said cortes misconceiving his
joy why is not olin the friend of malintzin

malintzin is a great prince said the prisoner softly

is olin content to be the slave of guatimozin pursued the
captain-general insidiously will olin do malintzin's bidding and be
the king of chalco

shall olin slay guatimozin cried the prisoner with a gleam of subtle
intelligence and so abruptly that cortes was startled

hah by my conscience he cried i understand thee thou art even
more knave than i thought thee kill the king indeed by no means harm
not a hair of his head we will have no assassination it is better this
young boy should be king than another this is a very proper knave
gentlemen by your leave i will bid you good-night i will see the dog
to the water-side antonio do thou walk with us and explain between
us a very excellent shrewd villain

so saying the captain-general turned to the door by which he had lately
entered and taking the prisoner's arm in the most familiar and
friendly manner he stepped forthwith into the garden the mexican's
flesh crept when it came in contact with that of the spaniard but
this the spaniard doubted not was the tribute of awe to his greatness
his voice became yet blander as walking onwards towards the lake he
poured into guatimozin's ear his wishes and instructions

as they passed by the little pool and its dark enclosure of
schinus-trees the infidel looked towards it anxiously and lingeringly
as if hoping to behold once more the pale and beautiful countenance
which had shone upon it it lay in deep silence and solitude

a few moments after the mexican had passed through the broken wall and
by the sentries who guarded it receiving the last instructions of the
invader the next instant he was alone stalking towards a little green
point where a fringe of reeds and water-lilies shook in the diminutive
surges he cast his eye backward to the two cavaliers and beheld them
pass into the garden then taking the chain of beads from his neck and
rending it with foot and hand he cast the broken jewels into the lake
a moment after his light skiff shot from its concealment and the sound
of his paddle startled the droning wild-fowl from their slumbers




chapter xiv


when ovid describes the memorable encounter between perseus and the
great sea-monster of ethiopia he is at the pains to narrate with what
fury the creature snapped at the shadow of the flying hero a
circumstance of trivial importance in itself though both striking and
characteristic nay he even relates how the warrior at the first sight
of the fair andromeda chained to the rock and waiting to be devoured
was so moved with admiration that he forgot for an instant to flap his
wings another detail of more fitness than moment thus stooping to the
consideration of trifles the poet does not scruple entirely to pass by
matters of the most palpable consequence he disdains for example to
tell us even whether the monster died or not in the encounter leaving
that to be inferred and in like manner he scorns even to answer the
question that might have been anticipated namely why perseus like a
sensible soldier did not whip out his gorgon's head instead of his
crooked sword and by turning the beast into stone save himself the
trouble of despatching him with his steel

the writer of historical works like the present must claim the
privilege of the poet and be allowed while expatiating on events of
interest so inferior that they have been almost rejected by his
predecessors to leave many others of manifest importance to be
supplied not indeed by the imagination but by the learning of the
reader our only desire is to follow the adventures of two individuals
so obscure and so unfortunate that the worthy and somewhat
over-conscientious bernal diaz del castillo has despatched the whole
history of the first in the few vague fragments which we have prefixed
to the story while he has scrupulously abstained from saying a single
word of the second

if the reader will turn to the pages of this conscientious historian of
de solis or of clavigero he will be made acquainted with the stirring
exploits of the eight or nine weeks that followed after the arrest of
juan lerma in this time the captain-general at the head of all the
spaniards save those who were left in garrison at tezcuco and the few
sailors and shipwrights who remained in the dock-yards to preside over
indian artificers compelled to work at the brigantines in this time
we say and at the head of this force assisted by many thousand
tlascalans cortes commenced and completed the circuit of the whole
valley storming and burning cities and towns without number resisted
valiantly in all that were not disaffected and sometimes as at the
city of tacuba repulsed with great loss and no little dishonour the
whole campaign abounds with singular and exciting incidents of which
however it does not suit our purpose to mention any but one and that
almost in a word at the city of xochimilco or the garden of flowers
for this is the signification of the word where the resistance was
sanguinary and noble though in the end ineffectual cortes was
wounded surrounded struck down from his horse which was killed and
he himself for a moment a prisoner and he owed his life and liberty
only to the extraordinary valour of gaspar olea of the red beard who
with the help of a few resolute tlascalans succeeded in bringing him
off the aid thus rendered by olea was the more remarkable since from
the moment of juan's arrest he had become sullen morose and was
sometimes even charged to be mutinous in this last imputation however
as far as it implied any treasonable thoughts or practices the rude
gaspar was wronged his dissatisfaction was caused solely by the fall
and anticipated fate of his young captain the heinousness of juan's
crime the drawing his sword upon an officer in the execution of his
duty as guzman had been and worse yet the aiming of that at the
breast of the general had left it apparently impossible to be
forgiven it was universally expected that juan would expiate the crime
with his life and the only wonder was that he had not been immediately
tried condemned and executed his destiny was therefore anticipated
with more curiosity than doubt and apparently with less pity than
either gaspar did not attempt to deny juan's guilt but when he
remembered the sufferings and perils they had shared together his heart
burned with fury to think how soon the brave and well-beloved youth
should die the death of a caitiff his dissatisfaction expended itself
in anger towards the captain-general and hence the surprise of his
comrades at his act of daring and generosity but gaspar had his own
ends in view when he saved the life of cortes

it was now many weeks since his arrest and juan yet lay in
imprisonment ignorant not so much of his fate as of the causes which
delayed it on the fourth day of his captivity he was apprized by the
sound of trumpets and artillery the cries of men and the neighing of
horses and in general by the prodigious bustle which accompanies the
setting-out of an army from a populous city that some enterprise was
meditated and begun but of its character he was kept wholly ignorant
the custody of his person seemed to be committed to villafana and the
hunchback najara conjointly but it was observable that although
najara frequently entered his den alone villafana never made his
appearance without being accompanied by the corcobado

from najara he gained not a word of intelligence the hunchback ever
replying to his questions with scowls or with pithy sarcasms in
allusion to the crimes of treason and mutiny from villafana attended
and as it seemed to juan watched by the jealous najara he obtained
nothing but unmeaning nods of the head and sometimes looks too
significant to be doubted and yet too oraculous to be understood

after the first fortnight villafana failed to visit him altogether and
he saw not the face of a human being except once each morning when
najara was accustomed to make his appearance followed by an indian
slave bearing food and a jar of water with this latter being a
decrepit old man on whose naked shoulder was imprinted the horrible
letter g for guerra indicating that he was a prisoner of war in
other words a branded bondman he endeavoured to speak using all the
native dialects with which he was acquainted but though najara made no
offer to prevent such conversation the barbarian replied only by
touching his ear and then his breast signifying thereby that though he
heard the words he did not understand them though najara permitted
these little attempts at speech with contemptuous indifference juan
perceived that he ever kept his eyes fastened upon the indian as if to
prevent any effort at communication of another sort thus if any
benevolent friend had endeavoured to convey a message by letter or
otherwise it was apparent that najara took the best steps to insure its
miscarriage

foiled thus in every attempt to exchange thoughts with a fellow-being
and reduced to commune only with his own the unhappy prisoner ceased
at last to make any effort and yielding gradually to a despair that
was not the less consuming for being entirely without complaint he
began in the end to be indifferent even to the coming and presence of
his jailer neither rising to meet him nor even lifting his eyes from
the floor on which they were fixed with a lethargic dejection

he became also indifferent to his food and once when najara entered
he perceived that the water-jar the dish of tortillas or
maize-cakes the savoury wild-fowl and the fragrant chocolatl for
in regard to food he was liberally supplied stood upon the little
table where they had been placed the day before untasted and even
untouched he cast his eyes upon the youth and for the first time
began to feel a sentiment of pity for his condition indeed the noble
figure of the young man was beginning to waste away his cheeks were
hollow his neglected beard was springing uncouthly over his lips and
his sunken eyes drooped upon the earth as if never more to gleam with
the light of hope and pleasure the hunchback hesitated for a moment
and then growled out a few words the first he had uttered for a week
but these though commiseration prompted them he succeeded in making
expressive only of scorn or anger

hark you señor juan lerma he said do you mean to starve

at the sound of his voice so unusual and so unexpected the young man
raised his eyes but with a vague wo-begone look and answered nothing

i say señor continued najara somewhat more blandly is it your
will to die by starvation rather than in any other way

ah najara is it thou said juan rising feebly or indolently to
his feet heaven give you a good-morrow

pshaw returned the jailer gruffly pray me no such prayers keep
them for yourself i ask you if it be your purpose to starve yourself
to death out of a mere unsoldierly fear of hanging

thou hast not said so much to me i know not when replied the youth
not with any intention of shuffling off the question but speaking of
what was uppermost in his mind his voice was very mild and najara by
no means without his weaker points felt it as a reproach

i care not he replied if i answer you any two or three questions
that may be nearest to your heart but first give me to know wherefore
you have eaten nothing are you sick

surely i am at heart but bodily i am well

and you are not resolute to die of hunger before the
judgment-day pho if you have that spirit perhaps it were better but
it is a death of great torment yet why should one be afraid of the
shame tis nothing when we are dead

is this thy fear then said juan patiently it is not permitted us
to commit suicide in any form i will eat to satisfy thee but food is
bitter in prison

what a pity muttered najara as juan ate a morsel of food that
heaven should give thee such a goodly and godlike body and such a brave
soul for o my life i believe thou art entirely without fear and
yet make thee a madman and traitor

a traitor said juan without taking any offence for indeed he
seemed to have been robbed of all the fire of his spirit it is not
possible anybody can believe me a traitor

pho did i not with mine own eyes see thee lunge at cortes it is
base of thee to deny it

i do not deny it said juan adding vehemently but i call heaven to
witness i saw not his face and knew him not he may persecute me to
death as i believe he is doing yet could i do him no wrong no i
think i could not but it is bitter to feel we are trampled on

well señor it is better you should be in a passion than a trance but
be not utterly without hope if you can truly make it appear you knew
not the general it is thought by one or two you may be pardoned i
have talked with guzman and i think he may be brought to forgive and
even intercede for you

i will neither receive his forgiveness nor his intercession said
juan frowning and i wonder you mention to me his detested name

oh señor said najara sharply you may choose your own friends and
hunt them again among heathen indians that you should sell your life
for this dog of a noble fare you well señor fare you well

stay najara said juan following him towards the door you said you
would answer me such questions as were nearest my heart give not over
the kindly thought there are many things which if i knew my lot would
not be so hard my dungeon not so killing to my spirit the army is
gone is mexico invested

not so replied the hunchback it has a month or two's grace
yet the troops have marched against the shore-towns but for this mad
fit thou mightst have been with them or making thyself famous at
tochtepec

juan sighed heavily

and the indian of whom you spoke the young noble olin the orator
he demanded at first not without hesitation

oh the cur replied najara i think cortes was even as mad as
thyself touching the knave but wit is like a river sometimes too
full washing away its own banks it may be said to drown itself he
made the dog his ambassador swore him to return faithfully from
guatimozin and waited three days for him in vain such rogues are like
arrows good weapons when you have the cast of them but not to be
expected in hand again unless shot back by a foeman

it was fortunate perhaps that najara had relaxed so far from his
austerity as to resume the vein of metaphor common to his softer
moments had he been as observant as usual he must have been struck
with suspicion at the sudden gleam of satisfaction with which juan
heard the good fortune of the mexican but he marked it not

tell me now said juan how thou comest to be my jailer and why it
is that villafana seems to have given up his trust to thee

at this question najara's good-humour immediately vanished and he
replied sourly

oh content you you shall be in good keeping

i doubt it not said juan calmly but villafana is or methinks he
is more friendly to me than you i did but desire to know what changes
had taken place in the government of the city from the watchman up to
the commandant since my imprisonment

ay indeed replied najara grimly such changes that hadst thou
fifty friends waiting to aid thee thou shouldst be caught before
getting twenty steps from the door know then that i am made alguazil
as well as villafana and what is more i am captain of the prison the
alcalde is antonio de quinones master of the armory and the corregidor
of the city is thy good friend guzman an honour thou gavest him by
hacking his face so freely and so leaving him in the hospital

you speak to me in sarcasm said juan mildly i have not deserved
it and methinks you should be more generous of temper than to oppress
with words of insult a fallen and helpless man well heed it not i
forgive you i have but one more question to ask you the lady this
lady la monjonaza 

ay cried najara with singular bitterness i have heard of that too
you were seen talking with her in the garden you will play chamberer
with cortes ay and rival too pho canst thou not be at peace meddle
with the general's fancy why that were enough to hang thee i had some
soft thoughts of thee but everything shows thou art unworthy farewell
think of these things no more but repent and make your peace with
heaven

so saying the hunchback flung out of the room and securing the thick
door of plank juan was again left to his meditations




chapter xv


then followed another period of silence and dejection in which the
prisoner wasted away as much in body as in spirit becoming so
listlessly indifferent to everything that he no longer betrayed any
desire to draw najara into conversation nor even to meet the advances
which his jailer now often made the thought of escaping from
confinement perhaps never entered his mind for had he been even less
resigned to his fate the strict watch kept over him and the condition
of his prison added to his apparent friendlessness must have been
enough to banish all such thoughts his chamber was neither dark nor
damp but made strong by its bulky door barred on the outside and by
windows high above the floor so very narrow that no human being could
hope to pass through them

narrow as they were however it was the jailer's custom to examine them
very closely each morning a degree of vigilance that juan had in the
earlier days of captivity remarked with some surprise he became
acquainted with najara's object at last one morning he was roused out
of his stupefaction by a harsh exclamation from his jailer and looking
up he beheld him take from the floor immediately under one of the
loopholes what seemed a slip of paper tied to a little stick which
appeared some time during the night to have been thus thrust into the
prison what were its contents he never could divine for najara had no
sooner cast his eyes over it than mingling a laugh of satisfaction at
its miscarriage with some natural compassion for the profound
wretchedness which had sealed the ears and eyes of the prisoner he
immediately departed with the prize

from this time juan became more vigilant and wary but the following
night he was admonished by the clank of armour and the occasional
sound of voices without that sentinels were now stationed under the
windows thus precluding all hope of friendly communication from that
quarter

before he had again entirely relapsed into his listless gloom he began
to have a vague consciousness that the indian slave who accompanied
najara was becoming more officious than of old in setting his meals
before him and particularly in placing the jar of water at his side
instead of depositing it on his table as he had done before his
suspicion was confirmed when one morning as najara was making his
wonted survey of the windows the slave gave him a quick impatient
look and shaking the jar as he set it down made him sensible by a
rattling sound within it that there was something besides the innocent
element concealed at the bottom as soon as najara had departed he made
an examination of the mystery and drew forth with some astonishment a
plate of transparent obsidian on which had been scratched by some hard
instrument or precious stone a few words which he was soon able to
decypher if thou wilt leave mexico and live take the stone from the
pitcher

he strode about the apartment for a moment in disorder then crushing
the glassy temptation under his heel and returning the fragments to the
jar he sat down again to brood over his despair the next morning the
pitcher contained nothing but water

thus then the time passed away in the ordinary listlessness of
confinement the dull and sleepy torture of solitude until najara
waxing more compassionate as his prisoner grew more obviously
indifferent to light to food and to speech bethought him of a mode of
indulgence from which no danger could be apprehended and accordingly
introduced the dog befo into the apartment

the loud yells of joy with which befo beheld his young master recalled
juan from his lethargy and najara was touched still further with
compunction at the sight of the animal's transports

he has been whining every day at the prison gate he muttered and
doubtless he would have whined full as much though he were to be let in
only to be beaten such a fond fool is this young juan himself he
returns to his master though he knows the scourge is ready it were
better he had taken my advice and passed to the sea by otumba he
should have known cortes would never forgive him

the presence of this faithful animal if it did not recall juan's
spirits at least preserved him from sinking further into stupefaction
and nothing gave him more evident delight than when each morning
having prevailed upon najara to lead his dumb companion into the air for
exercise he could hear befo in the joy of a liberty which he did not
share dashing frantically through the garden now coursing by the
water-side now prancing by the palace and all the time yelping and
barking with the most clamorous delight from these daily sorties the
dog was used to return with fresh spirits and increased attachment to
share for the remainder of the day the confinement of his master upon
whom at his entrance he jumped and fawned almost as boisterously as
when enjoying his sports in the garden

one day however he returned with a much graver aspect than usual and
stalking up to where juan sat he stood wagging his tail and gazing up
with a look exceedingly knowing and significant somewhat surprised at
this and finding that befo refused even when invited to begin his
usual rough expressions of friendship he took him by the leathern
collar by which the servants of cortes had been wont to secure him at
night and pulled him towards him the motion of the collar released a
little packet that had been carefully secured beneath it and which now
fell upon juan's knee as soon as the sagacious animal perceived that he
had accomplished a task not often committed to such a messenger he
returned to his usual demonstrations of satisfaction and for a moment
juan was unable to examine the singular missive when befo became
composed he opened it and read with no little agitation the
following words not for me but for thyself there is but a day
more to choose leave mexico and shed not thine own blood make not thy
friends curse thee return but a fragment of the paper or tie but a
hair round the collar and thou shalt be saved not for me but for
thyself

the morning came and juan taking the paper from his bosom tore it to
pieces when najara offered as usual to liberate the dog he perceived
that juan held him fast by the collar

how now señor shall the dog play

it is cruel to rob him of his hour's liberty said juan with a
subdued voice but this day suffer him to remain with me

well señor as you will said najara but i would you had some
better friend at least some one who could counsel you there are
runners arrived from the northern towns and at midday cortes will
march into the city

the better reason then that i should have this friend who have no
other said juan calmly

harkee señor said najara with a sort of petulant sympathy if you
would but curse yourself and your foes or bemoan your fate a little i
should like it better than this stupid womanish resignation hark
ye i care not if i tell you i thought you had come athwart the
fancies of don hernan in the matter of the doña not that don hernan
had wronged your own i knew not that there was any old love between
you

what art thou speaking of najara said juan with a hasty and
troubled voice

this does in some sense weaken the sin of drawing sword upon him
continued the hunchback for no man loves to be robbed of his
mistress well the señora is sorry for you she thought to bribe me
to let her speak with you bribe me and yet i pitied her for she was
sorely distressed

for god's sake exclaimed juan in extreme suffering speak me not a
word of her let me not hear her name

well be not cast down she has much power with the general and
doubtless she will plead for you well fare you well i did think to
let cortes know of her acts but that might harden him against you still
more why should i waste thought upon him muttered the deformed as he
passed from the prison it is hard or it seems hard that heaven
should give up a frame so beauteous and majestical to be marred by the
hangman's axe or rope and leave a deformed lump like me to scare
little indian girls and boys and to be jibed at by all the craven loons
of the army but this is naught if i am crooked i am neither fool
traitor nor coward as most others are in one degree or other and
sometimes in all

as najara had foretold the army returned to tezcuco about noon as was
made evident to juan by the sound of trumpets and cannon and other
warlike noises of rejoicing which continuing to fill the city for many
hours came to his ears like the tumult of a distant storm and began to
die away only when the last twinkle of sunset shooting through his
narrow windows had faded from the opposite wall




chapter xvi


it was now midnight audience after audience and council after council
in the great hall of the palace had shown how rapidly were approaching
to a climax the involved events and schemes which had for their object
the overthrow of the indian empire as well as some that looked to an
end equally dark though of less public import the captain-general had
despatched several audiences entirely of a private nature and hoped to
be relieved of his toil while discharging from his presence an
individual already known to the reader as gaspar of the red beard
whatever might have been the subject of the conference its conclusion
was unsatisfactory to both parties for olea departed with a visage both
sullen and vindictive while cortes strode to and fro evidently
affected by vexation and anger

as olea who had long since got rid of the infidel gait which had
drawn a remark from cortes and which doubtless assumed to assist his
disguise only adhered to him through habit as he vanished through the
great door another character made his appearance entering by one of
those doors which opened from the garden it was the señor camarga who
from the friar's habit again flung over his armour seemed to have been
engaged a second time in his maskings

what news señor what news hast thou demanded cortes in a low
voice making a sign to the visitor to imitate his cautiousness hast
thou gathered aught of my dog villafana by my conscience we are at a
fault the fox is scared into virtue najara hath seen no ill in him
guzman avers he hath detected no sign of guilt and not a spy is there
of all who does not swear that his fright in the matter of olin that
knave too cajoled me has reduced him into submission and honesty
hast thou found nothing

nothing to be thought of perhaps replied camarga villafana is
either returned to his allegiance as your excellency hints or he is
too deep in distrust to confer with me any further he swears if one
could believe him that he has thought better of his schemes and is now
resolved that they were foolish and unjust and therefore that he has
ended them

he lies the rogue said cortes you have pursued him too
closely it was an ill thought to league najara with him these things
have made him suspicious not penitent i have taken the hunchback away
restored villafana to his prisonward and in short taken all means to
seduce him into security you will see the cloven foot again and that
right shortly

perhaps what i have to say will make your excellency believe it is
displayed already he has admitted one to speak with the prisoner 

hah cried cortes a file of spearsmen but no it matters not
there is no fear of escape and this were too aimless an explosion know
you the person he has admitted

i do not said camarga but from the glance of the garment methought
twas some such godly brother as myself and yet twas a taller man than
olmedo

by my conscience said cortes quickly methinks i can divine the
mystery but of that anon hark thee friend camarga dost thou still
burn for this wretched man's life i tell thee there is much
intercession made for him it was but a moment since that the
barba-roxa a good soldier i'faith made certain fierce moans for
him mingled with divers mutinous reproaches i vow to heaven i could
have struck the knave dead but that he saved my life at xochimilco

i have heard that juan lerma did the same thing on the plains of
tlascala replied camarga dryly

thou art deceived exclaimed don hernan with a sudden shudder the
attempt i grant you the attempt be made but i needed no help yet do
i remember the act and by heaven i would i might forgive him i
would i might i would i might for the thought of judging him to death
is like a wolf in my bosom once i loved him as my son yes as my very
son he repeated with extraordinary agitation and when he played
with my little children i swear i looked upon him but as their elder
brother what will men say of the act since they cannot know the
cause

apparently camarga looked upon this burst of relenting feeling for
such it really was with too much dissatisfaction and alarm to notice
the allusion to a cause differing from any with which he was acquainted
he exclaimed hastily and with a darkening visage

if open mutiny and resistance be not excuse enough have i not spoken
an argument that should steel thy heart for ever shall i utter it
again i swear to thee then that this miserable creature
magdalena this wretch that even thou wouldst have made the slave of
thy pleasures and thereby added upon thy soul a sin never to be
forgiven no never is a true nun forsworn lost condemned wilt
thou refuse to punish the author of a horrible impiety would that i had
strangled her when an infant though with mine own hand thou talkest
of a wolf in thy bosom couldst thou feel one fang of the agony that
this act of horror has planted in mine thou wouldst deem thyself happy
let the wretch die ask not for further cause think not of any

the cause is indeed enough said cortes crossing himself with
dread to ensure not death only but a death at the stake of fire and
i am not one to think the punishment should be made easy i could tell
thee a story of the end of broken vows and the vengeance of god upon
the robber of convents but it needs not sleep in thy grave poor
wretch and be forgotten he muttered a few words to himself and then
banishing with an effort what seemed a mournful recollection he
resumed tell me but one thing camarga and i am satisfied the cause
is enough though this is a crime to be judged by ecclesiastics to
ensure the young man's fate but it is not enough to explain the
rancour of thy hatred speak me the truth is this unhappy creature
child of thine

think so if thou wilt said camarga with a lip ashy and quivering
but ask not ask not now give the young man to the block and commit
the girl into my hands with the means of leaving this land then if
thou hast the courage to listen thou shalt hear a story that will
freeze thy blood is he not guilty of this thing

is he not guilty of more muttered the captain-general it is enough
thou hast steeled my heart i leave him in the hands of the alcaldes and
de olid who have no such faintness of heart as confounds mine fare
thee well señor i know thee better and i like thee well turn not
thine eye from villafana

thus mingling the suggestions of a native policy with passions not the
less constitutional cortes dismissed his disguised visitant the
curtain of the great door had scarce concealed the retreating camarga
before he heard a footstep behind and looking round he beheld the
figure of la monjonaza steal in from the garden and cross the
apartment

what sayst thou now magdalena he cried striding up to her and
viewing with interest a countenance sternly composed yet bearing the
traces of recent and deep passions thou shouldst have told me of
this yet what sayst thou now

nothing replied the maiden calmly but with tones deeper than
usual nothing do thy work

with these brief and mystic expressions she passed among the secret
chambers and the captain-general stalking into the garden until the
chill breezes from the lake had cooled his feverish temples betook
himself at last to his couch to subdue in slumber imaginary
empires and contend with visionary foes




chapter xvii


the day after the feast of the holy ghost or whitsunday early in may
 opened upon the valley of mexico with clouds and vapours which
sweeping over the broad lake collected and lingered with boding fury
around the island city discharging thunder and lightning while the
sunbeams shone clear and uninterrupted over tezcuco and the rich
savannas which surrounded it it was the morning of a novel and
impressive ceremony a rivulet deepened by the labours of many thousand
indians into a navigable canal and bordered for the space of half a
league on either side by narrow meadows separated the city from
another scarce inferior in magnitude but which yet seemed only a
suburb the whole space thus extending between the two cities from the
lake as far as the eye could see was blackened by the bodies of indian
warriors armed and decorated as if for battle while the housetops in
the cities were equally thronged with multitudes of aged men and women
and children a narrow space was left vacant on each bank of the canal
from which the feathered barbarians two hundred thousand in number
were separated by the spanish army drawn up in extended lines on either
bank the companies of footmen alternating with little squadrons of
mounted cavaliers from whose spears waved bright pennons

as they stood thus in gallant array a flourish of trumpets drew their
eyes up the stream and they could behold over the housetops winding
with the sinuosities of the canal a line of masts and of sails half let
loose to the breeze advancing slowly towards the lake drawn as it
presently appeared by double rows of natives gayly apparelled who
occupied the space on the banks left vacant by the military

as they approached nigh and more nigh it was seen that each vessel bore
no little resemblance to some of those light and open brigantines which
have been from time immemorial the chosen delights of mediterranean
pirates and the scourge of the sea from barbary to the greek islands
each carried twenty-five men twelve of whom were rowers the others
musketeers crossbowmen cannoniers for a falconet frowned over the
prow of each and sailors besides a multitude of little pennons with
which they were covered two great banners waved over each the one
bearing the royal arms of spain the other being the private standard
which had been assigned along with an appropriate name and a solemn
benediction by a priest at the dock-yard after the celebration of the
mass of the holy ghost for with such ceremonies of religion and pomp
the fatal galleys were committed that morning to their proper element

one by one they passed into the lake and ranged in a line before the
mouth of the little river fourteen in number at this point the
mummeries of celebration were concluded by another and final
benediction pronounced from the shore which was succeeded by a
combined uproar of artillery trumpets and human voices more loud and
tumultuous than any which had yet shaken the borders of tezcuco

when the smoke of the cannon had cleared away the brigantines were seen
parting and flitting along in different courses like a flock of
wild-fowl frightened and separated by the explosion their evolutions
should be rather likened to the gambols of vultures escaped from some
dreary confinement and now fluttering their wings in the joy of
liberation and the expectation of prey castilian navigators were at
last launched upon the sea of anahuac and they seemed resolved at once
to confirm their dominion by ploughing through each rolling surge and
penetrating to every bay and creek as they divided thus some standing
out into the lake and others darting along the shores the admiring and
shouting spectators began to observe and point out to one another
certain pillars of smoke rising one after the other from the hills and
headlands by which was conveyed from town to town the intelligence of
an event long since expected by the watchful infidels

another spectacle however soon withdrew the eyes of the lookers on
from these signal fires from the bank of vapours which still concealed
the towers of tenochtitlan they beheld an indian piragua or gondola
of some magnitude and no little splendour come paddling into view
followed by three canoes of much lighter and plainer structure an
awning of brilliant cloths running from stem to stern over the piragua
overshadowed and almost hid the rowers

it was no sooner perceived from the fleet than three or four
brigantines gave chase as after an undoubted enemy and legal prize
still its voyagers advanced on their course fearlessly and to all
appearance disregardful of the commands of the captains to heave-to
even although one call was accompanied by a musket shot discharged
across their bows its director undoubtedly confided in his pacific
character indicated according to the customs of anahuac by a little
net of gold mingled with white feathers tied to the head of a spear
and displayed high above the awning

well done for the dog techeechee muttered cortes into the ear of an
hidalgo of stern appearance mounted like himself and at his side
well done for techeechee the silent dog he is worth twenty such
hounds as olin-pilli he has brought me an embassy by my conscience it
comes over late though and i know not what good can spring of it at
this hour these fools of the brigantines are over-officious tis a
confident knave see he steers for the palace garden i must ride
thither hark thee de olid he continued still addressing the grim
cavalier but aloud as if willing that all should hear let this thing
be despatched thou wilt make at the worst a just judge in this
trial it becomes neither my feelings nor perhaps my honour that i
should myself sit in judgment the chief alcaldes will give thee their
aid judge not in anger but with justice bring it not against the
young man that he turned his sword upon me and yet i see not how thou
canst avoid it nevertheless if thou canst do so let it be done there
is enough else to condemn him his life is in thine hands be just and
yet be not too rigid if thou canst by any justifiable leniency admit
him to mercy do so yes be merciful if thou canst be merciful

with these instructions which were pronounced not without discomposure
cortes put spurs to his steed and rode into the city and to the palace
followed by some half dozen cavaliers

he had scarcely assumed the state with which he thought fit to overawe
the envoys of the different barbaric tribes whom the fame of his power
and greatness was daily bringing to his court before an officer entered
the audience-chamber from the garden and acquainted him that
ambassadors from tenochtitlan humbly craved to be admitted to his
presence

let them be taken round to the front that the dogs may look upon the
artillery said the captain-general and perhaps added in his thoughts
that they may creep up to my footstool taking in my greatness from
afar until their humility dwindles into submissiveness

presently the curtain of the great door was pushed aside and the
mexicans entered preceded and followed by armed men the old ottomi
being in advance of all they were twelve in number the chief or
principal being a man of lofty stature and manly years wholly differing
from the orator olin for whom cortes looked in vain among the others
to indicate the high rank of the ambassador two attendants sustained
over his head on little rods a gay canopy or penthouse of feathers
his green mantle for that was the colour worn by an ambassador was of
the richest material the border being wrought into scroll-work with
little studs of solid gold his buskins for such they might be called
were of crimson leather and a crimson fillet was wound round his hair
which was otherwise almost covered with little tufts or tassels of
cotton-down of the same hue each of these singular decorations was the
evidence and distinguishing badge of some valiant exploit in battle and
it was therefore manifest to all in the slightest degree acquainted with
the customs of anahuac even at the first sight that the barbarian was
a man of renown among the mexicans a cluster of rattling grains of
gold suspended to his nostrils indicated that he belonged to the order
of teuctli a race of nobles inferior only to the tlamantli or
vassal-kings and the red fillets showed that he was a prince of the
house of darts the highest of the several chivalric branches into which
this order was divided the two next appertaining to the house of eagles
and the house of tigers in introducing these barbaric terms we have
no desire to inflict upon the reader a dissertation on aztec chivalry
but simply to make him aware that these singular infidels were in
their way nearly as well provided with the vanities of knighthood and
nobility as some of the european nations in the middle ages

the general appearance of the ambassador was commanding his features
were bold and harsh yet manly his forehead expanded though inclined
and furrowed as with the frowns of battle and his eye had a touch of
wildness and ferocity at variance with his modest bearing while
advancing towards the captain-general and still more strongly
contrasted with that melancholy sweetness of mouth which seems to be a
characteristic of all the children of america perhaps it is fitly
characteristic since the proclivity of their fate is equally mournful
throughout all the continent he bore in his hand the gold net and white
plume hanging to a headless spear which had been displayed and
distinguished afar in the piragua as well as a golden arrow both
being the emblems of a mexican envoy he was entirely without arms as
were all the rest

behind the canopy-bearers came three old men with tablets of dressed
skin or maguey paper in their hands known at once to be
writers secretaries or annalists who accompanied ambassadors and
other high officers in expeditions of importance to record their
actions and preserve the proofs of treaties

after these followed six tlamémé or common carriers bearing
presents which with mexicans of that day as with orientals of this
made no small share of the matériel of diplomacy

as this train was led forward up to the chair of state cortes fixed his
eye with a smile of approbation on the ottomi but did not think fit to
honour him with any further evidence of thankfulness he had other
matters to fill his thoughts for at the first glance he recognized in
the ambassador a noble famous even in the days of montezuma for skill
audacity and unconquerable aversion to the strangers and who under
the ominous title of masquaza-teuctli or the lord of death was
known to have commanded bodies of reinforcement sent to several
different shore-towns to oppose the arms of cortes in the late
campaign in especial he was known to have devised the plan of cutting
the dikes of iztapalapan after decoying the spaniards into that city
where they escaped drowning almost by a miracle it was equally certain
that he had commanded the multitudes of warriors who scarce ten days
since had repulsed the spaniards from tacuba with considerable loss
and he was even supposed to have been present in the sack of xochimilco
where cortes had been in such imminent peril the appearance of this man
was doubly disagreeable as being heartily detested himself and as
showing the temper of guatimozin's mind who chose to send an envoy so
little inclined to composition a murmur of dissatisfaction arose among
the spaniards present as soon as they were made aware of the
ambassador's character and if looks could have destroyed it is certain
the lord of death would have passed to the world of shades before
speaking a word of his embassy

footnote the name is corrupted as are all those handed down by the
early historians the suffixes pilli and teuctli indicate the
title and are therefore not a part of the name we translate both
lord though it would be more germain to the matter however ludicrous
it might seem to say at once duke death and earl olin

without however seeming to regard these boding glances any more than
he had done the hostile opposition of the brigantines he began without
delay the usual native forms of salutation but before he could pass to
those rhetorical and reverential flourishes of compliment which
constituted the exordium of an ambassador's speech he was interrupted
by cortes whose words were interpreted by the same cavalier who had
officiated before in the interview with olin

masquaza-teuctli lord of death said the captain-general sternly
what dost thou here in tezcuco

the infidel looked up with surprise and having eyed the spaniard a
moment replied with another question which was only remarkable as
indicating the composure of the speaker and as giving utterance to
tones exceedingly soft and pleasant

was olin deceived and did techeechee lie he said i bring the words
of guatimozin to malintzin son of quetzalcoatl and lord of the big
canoes with legs of crocodiles and wings of pelicans

art thou not stained with the blood of castilians rejoined cortes
but little pleased with the frank and unawed bearing of the envoy this
thing is ill of guatimozin why does he send me an enemy from
tenochtitlan

the lord of death replied with what seemed a lurking smile if such
could be traced in a peculiar and slight motion of lips always sedate
if not always melancholy

has the teuctli a friend in tenochtitlan let malintzin speak his
name i will return my little children are yet awkward with the bow
and arrow

hark to the hound exclaimed the captain-general struck more by the
hint conveyed by the last words than by the sarcasm so gently expressed
in the first he would have me believe the very boys of mexico are
training to resist us and that he thinks it better honour to encourage
the young cubs to malice than to speak to me for terms of
peace hearken infidel you spoke of the young man olin why returned
not he to tezcuco

malintzin was in a hurry for the blood of iztapalapan the king saw the
glitter of spears on the lakeside and said to his servant go not to
tezcuco with gold and sweet words but to iztapalapan with axes and
spears 

ay marry but olin what of olin-pilli i warrant me the knavish
king discovered the craft of the knavish noble and so killed him i
was a fool to give him the beads what sayst thou infidel what has
become of the speaker of wise things i sent him to guatimozin for an
envoy and lo you this old savage the silent dog has brought me what
olin could not or did not is olin living

how shall i answer ipalnemoani is the maker of life it is the
king who takes it olin-pilli is forgotten

footnote one of the titles of the supreme god teotl who was
not worshipped directly but through the medium of his agents the
inferior divinities

ay then let him sleep and to thy work infidel to thy work will
guatimozin have peace he is somewhat late of decision but the great
monarch of spain who sends me to speak with him and to enforce the
vassalage acknowledged by montezuma is merciful speak then and
quickly my ships are on the lake my soldiers are thicker than the
reeds on its banks and fiercer than its waters when the torrents rush
down from the mountains will he have the blood of his people flow
through the streets as the waters of an inundation when the dikes are
broken speak then lord of death will guatimozin acknowledge himself
the king's vassal pay tribute and govern his empire in peace

hear the words of guatimozin said the ambassador beckoning to the
tlamémé to open their packs the king sends you the history of his
land taking up from among many books which made the contents of the
first bundle a volume of hieroglyphics and displaying its pictured
pages he has searched for the time when the king of castile was the
lord of his people but it is not written how then shall he kiss the
earth before the teuctli he has sought to find to what race besides
the race of heaven the men of mexico have paid tribute it is not
written except this that once when his fathers were poor and few
the men of cojohuacan called on them for tribute and they paid it in
the skulls of their foes the men of castile call for tribute
guatimozin sends them such tribute as his fathers paid here it
is twelve skulls of the dogs of chalco taken in the act of rebellion
and as he spoke the grinning orbs rolled under his foot against the
platform

hah cried cortes starting up with as much admiration as wrath for
he was keenly alive to every burst of audacious and heroic daring is
not this a merlin of a royal stock that will try buffets with an eagle
but pho the young man is besotted

hear further the words of guatimozin continued the envoy taking
from the third bundle two more books and displaying them as he had
done the first the king remembers that the wild ottomies came down
from their hills saying that they were foolish and pitiful because
ipalnemoani had kept them in darkness so that they robbed one another
and were blasphemers against heaven the king gave them religion and
laws and behold those that live upon the skirts of the valley are
become wise and happy the king says have not the spaniards come like
the ottomies and are they not very ignorant and miserable these are
the king's words to malintzin take this book and learn how to worship
the gods religion is a good thing and will make you happy take this
book also and understand the laws of men justice is a good thing and
will make you happy

it would be difficult to express the varied feelings of wonder anger
scorn and merriment with which the spaniards hearkened to this
extraordinary exhortation some stared some frowned some smiled and a
few laughed outright but all immediately betook themselves to looks of
sympathetic anger when cortes again rising stamped upon the platform
crying with a fierceness that was in part unassumed

knave of a heathen and savage dost thou pass this scorn upon the
religion of christ this slight upon the laws of castile this slur upon
religious and civilized men look upon this cross and say to
guatimozin that not a spaniard shall leave his valley till every slave
that acknowledges his sway has knelt before it and abjuring the
fiendish idolatry of mexitli has sworn with a kiss to worship naught
else look too upon this sword and say to thine insolent prince that
it shall not cease to strike and slay until his whole people have
acknowledged it to be the abrogator of the old and the teacher of a new
law such as his brutish sages never dreamed of in one word give him
to know that my purpose in his land is to bestow upon it the cross of
heaven and the laws of spain and these i will bestow both so help
me the sword which i grasp and the cross that i worship

a murmur of satisfaction and responsive resolution passed through the
assemblage which had been considerably increased by the appearance of
such officers returning from the lakeside as were privileged to enter
the presence on such an occasion but the stern voice of the
captain-general produced no effect on the mexicans except indeed that
one of the three writers who had been all the time busily engaged as
they squatted upon the floor recording the speeches in their
inexplicable manner raised his eyes when the christian's voice was at
the highest and eyed him askant for a minute or two the lord of death
kept his glance firmly fixed on the aspect of the general while
listening to the interpretation of his angry vows then when cortes had
concluded he turned to the fourth pack and resumed his discourse as
if it were no part of his duty to reply to anything not immediately
touching his instructions

hear further the words of guatimozin he said pointing to an ear of
maize a bundle of cacao-berries a cluster of bananas and divers other
fruits as well as nuts and esculent roots which appeared in the pack
thus says the king of mexico is castile a naked rock where the food
of man grows not malintzin said to montezuma the land is like other
lands with earth over the flint-stone and with rivers to make it
fertile soil comes down from the mountains and heaven sends frequent
rains look at mexico the sun parches it till it becomes like sand
half the year the other half the sky turns to water and drowns the
gardens and corn-fields but is man a dog that he should howl when he
is hungry and run abroad for food god gave these good things to the
king the king gives them to the spaniard let him throw them upon the
earth and sit hard by in patience while the rain drops upon them and
by and by he will have food for himself and his children he will not
be hungry and run forth like a dog to strange lands seeking for
food hear further the words of the king continued the grave
barbarian observing the impatience of cortes and turning his anger
into admiration by suddenly displaying the contents of the fifth pack
which consisted of divers ornaments and jewels of gold with a huge
plate of extraordinary value representing the sun is there no yellow
dirt in castile to make playthings for the women and children thus
says the king let malintzin take these things to his women and
children and lest they should by and by cry for more let him send a
ship to guatimozin at the end of the tlalpilli and more shall be
given him thus it shall be while guatimozin lives and thus it shall be
hereafter if the king wills for what is guatimozin that he should
make a law for his successors

footnote tlalpilli the quarter-cycle or epoch of years

the admiration with which the captain-general surveyed the gorgeous
present greatly moderated his disgust at the mode of making it he
stepped down from the platform and taking the massive disk into his
hands gloated over its almost insupportable weight and dazzling
splendour with the relish of one who seemed never to have felt any
passion less sordid than that of avarice while thus engaged ruddy at
once with delight and with the effort of sustaining such a precious
burthen a paper was put into his hand or rather held out for him to
receive while a voice murmured in his ear

the award of the judges sent to your excellency for confirmation

the golden luminary fell with a heavy clang upon the floor the flush
fled from his cheeks and the look with which he turned to the untimely
and ill-omened messenger villafana was even more ghastly with affright
than that which distinguished the aspect of the alguazil

if your excellency thinks of mercy continued the alguazil in the
same low and hurried voice it is not yet too late they have him on
the square and are confessing him he has but a dog's life and a
gnat's death who puts them in the hands of de olid 

cortes cast his eye upon the paper and beheld besides the date a
preamble of two lines and the signatures of the judges the following
brief and pithy sentences

 concealing a spy and fugitive from justice guilty

 drawing sword upon a christian guilty

 resisting with arms an officer in the execution of his
 duty guilty

 sentence to be beheaded his right hand struck off and nailed
 to the prison-door to take effect in half an hour

 in the name of god and the king

 de olid

 marin

 de ircio

butchers cried cortes with accents of unspeakable horror what ho
a pen a pen knave a pen

the agitation and violence of his voice surprised even the stoical
mexicans and the writers looking up he became suddenly aware that the
implements with which they practised their rude art would answer all
his purpose darting forward he snatched from the hand of the nearest
one of the many reeds which he held the barbarian although apparently
the oldest and most infirm of the three mistaking the purpose of the
assault started to his feet with a vivacity of effort which at any
other moment would have drawn a sharp look of suspicion from the
captain-general but his thoughts were too much excited to be diverted
by any such seeming inconsistency

it happened by a natural accident for each reed was appropriated to
its peculiar colour that that which cortes had seized contained a dark
crimson ink still natural as the circumstance was it had no sooner
touched the paper than he shuddered and muttering blood blood
seemed as if he would have cast it away but recovering himself in an
instant with a faint and forced laugh he subscribed the few words

 confirmed respite for twenty-four hours

 cortes

and putting the paper into villafana's hands he dismissed him with the
hurried charge

away see to it

he then flung the reed back to the writer who had already resumed his
squatting attitude and reascended the platform

on those who surmised the cause of this sudden interruption the
agitation of don hernan had the good effect of banishing from their
minds any lingering suspicions of his entertaining personal ill-will
towards the unfortunate lerma all went to show that he was shocked at
the young man's fate and the necessity of ministering to it even in
the simple act of confirming a judgment awarded by others but
unhappily the same feeling that exonerated the judge still further
increased the odium attached to the criminal how great they thought
must be the guilt of him whom it causes cortes so much suffering to
condemn but the captain-general recovering himself gave them little
time for such speculations

well infidel thou speakest well he cried his voice becoming firmer
with each syllable what hidest thou in the sixth bundle or rather
what if i should accept thy master's niggardly offer and depart with
these baubles for women and children as thou hast rightly called them

hear the words of guatimozin replied the ambassador with a careless
emphasis as if properly understanding the futility of the proposal
and indeed with a look of scorn as if learning to despise one capable
of don hernan's late weakness if malintzin depart with the fifth pack
cast the sixth into the lake and tell him that in its place he shall
have sent after him to the seaside a thousand sacks of robes and four
thousand sacks of corn to clothe and feed his people as they sail over
the endless sea say to him besides 

pho interrupted cortes have done with this mummery and get thee to
the sixth sack which i am impatient to examine what hast thou there

the riches which are more precious to mexico than the trinkets of her
children replied the stately barbarian and as he spoke he rolled
upon the floor arrowheads and spearpoints of bright copper sharp
blades of itzli and heavy maces of flint which made up the contents of
the last bundle hear the words of guatimozin he continued with a
dignity of bearing that might have become a spartan envoy in the camp of
the persian thus says the king what is the lord of castile that
guatimozin should call him master what is malintzin that guatimozin
should make him his friend the teuctli burns my cities murders my
children and spits in the face of my gods his religion is murder his
law robbery he is strong yet very unjust he is wise yet he makes men
mad guatimozin has called together the chiefs and the planters of corn
the wise men and the foolish the strong and the feeble the old men
the women and the children he has spoken to them and they have
replied is not the sword better than the whip is not the arrow softer
than the brand is not the fagot of fire pleasanter than the chain of
captivity is not death sweeter than slavery thus says the old
man i am old wherefore then should i be a slave for a day thus
says the little infant i am a little child why should i be a slave
for many years this then is the word of the whole people it is
guatimozin who speaks it if the gods desert me what have i to yield
but life if they help me as they have helped my fathers what have i
to do but to drive away my foe let malintzin look at my weapons and
put two plates of the black-copper of castile on his bosom for i am
very strong in my sorrow and i will strike very hard let malintzin
fear the rebels of tezcuco and cholula the traitors of chalco and
otumba are but straws to help him can they look in the face of a
mexican let malintzin fear is he stronger than when he fled from
tenochtitlan in the month of mourning has not mexico more fighting
men than when the horn of the gods sounded at midnight and the teuctli
sat on the stone and wept on the stone of tacuba by the water-side
when the morning came and his people slept in the ditches if malintzin
will fight so will guatimozin these are the words of the king these
are the words of the people they are said the gods behold us

footnote embracing a portion respectively of june and july and
devoted to austere and penitential preparation for a coming festival

so spake the bold savage and as if to show that even the basest and
feeblest shared his courage and sanctioned his defiance the very
tlamémé looked around them with a show of spirit and the three old men
expressed their satisfaction with audible murmurs

the spaniards were surprised at the fearless tones of the lord of death
and not a few were impressed with alarm as well as anger when he
referred so unceremoniously to the events of the fatal noche triste as
for cortes himself though the frown with which he listened to the whole
oration had become darker and darker as the warrior-noble proceeded
yet apparently he had become sensible both from the tenor of the
discourse and the resolute bearing of the speaker that it should be
answered with gravity rather than anger hence when he came to reply
it was in terms briefly impressive and solemn

my young brother guatimozin is unwise and he is digging the grave of
his whole people he has evil counsellors about him i have somewhat to
say to him and to-morrow you shall be sent back with an answer which
will perhaps dispel his foolish dream of resistance he observed that
the lord of death looked displeased and even alarmed when the
interpreter made him sensible that he was to be detained until the
morrow be not alarmed he continued sternly when didst thou ever
hear of a christian aping the treachery of thy native princes and doing
wrong to an ambassador i tell thee fellow infidel though thou be i
will do thee honour in respect of thy young master to-morrow thou
shalt eat at my board for it is a day of banqueting and to-morrow
also shalt thou be made acquainted with my answer to the king's
message which it is not possible i should speak to-day rest you then
content hark thee villafana for the alguazil had returned have
thou charge of this bitter-tongued knave and his dumb companions
entreat them well but see that they neither escape nor communicate with
anyone in this army christian or misbeliever and look well to thy
prison too this knave techeechee bring him to me when thou changest
guards at the prison

then breaking up the audience he remained for a time in conference
with a few of the chief officers debating subjects of great importance
but which would be of no interest to the readers of this history




chapter xviii


some two hours after nightfall as the unhappy lerma lay in darkness and
solitude for befo was no longer permitted to be his companion the
door of the prison opened and the alguazil villafana entered bearing
a lantern which emitted just sufficient light to allow his features to
be distinguished together with what seemed a flask of wine a luxury
now to be occasionally obtained since vessels arrived not unfrequently
from the islands

how now what cheer señor he exclaimed setting down the flask upon
the table and turning the light full upon juan's face are you saying
your prayers here's that shall give you better comfort something from
the vineyards of xeres de la frontera stout sherry that shall make
your heart bounce were it broken twice over come faith it will make
you merry

i shall never be merry more said juan and why should i it is
better i should not i thank you for your good-will villafana but i
would that instead of this wine if it be not contrary to your duty
you would fetch me the good father olmedo to finish the confession
begun upon the block and so abruptly interrupted this morning

pho be not in such a hurry you have time enough the priest is busy
and knowing he must shrive you to-morrow he will be ill inclined to
trouble himself superfluously to-night come sit up drink laugh and
curse thy foes come now a merry god's blessing may you live a
thousand years dzoog bah dzoog now could i fight seven tigers

it is better thou shouldst drink it than i said juan observing the
strong and somewhat fantastic gestures with which the alguazil expressed
his approbation after having taken a hearty draught of the liquor yet
bethink thee villafana 

slid interrupted the jailer bethink thyself and bethink thee that
this will make thee a good fellow of a warhorse mettle whereas now
thou art but a sick lambkin what makes a beggar a king hah a tailor's
prentice a cid ruy diaz of castile a doughty campeador pho there is
more of this and to-morrow it will flow dost thou not know don
demonios our king has invited us to a banquet to-morrow thou shalt
hear this banquet spoken of for a thousand years ah the good ship the
good ship there is a better thing she brings us than wine but that is
neither here nor there why dost thou not drink

am i not condemned to death for the infraction of a decree said juan
somewhat sternly for he thought he perceived in villafana's levity a
symptom of undue excitement and dost thou not remember that there is a
decree also against drunkenness thou hast suffered somewhat from this
already

dost thou suppose there is a hell said villafana with some such look
as that which had appalled juan when he walked with him over the
meadows beyond the city for if thou dost know then that i make my
promise to the infernal fiend to broil with him seven times seven
thousand years if i do not with a stab for every lash make up my
reckoning with the man who degraded me ojala and amen so now
there's enough to keep thee quiet hast thou any gall any where but in
thy liver

thou art besotted or insane i think said juan angrily i am a
dying man begone and suffer me to make my peace with heaven

come you think i am drunk said villafana somewhat more rationally
i grant you but it is with a stuff stronger than strong drink ay
faith for to-morrow i see my way to heaven answer me truly have
you no thirst for vengeance on those who have brought you to this
pass you see i am sober hah one would not die like a sheep you may
play the wolf yet what if you had an opportunity 

tempt me not knave said juan turning away his face avoid thee
satan

what if i should knock open thy doors and put a sword into thy hand
said villafana bending over so as to whisper into his ear what
wouldst thou do with it

break it replied the prisoner wrapping his mantle about his head as
if to shut out all further temptation

thou art a fool said the alguazil with a growl and left the
apartment

juan heard his retreating steps followed by the clanking of the chain
which with a strong padlock on the outside secured the door of the
prison yet he neither raised his head nor removed the mantle from his
face but endeavoured to drive from his heart the thoughts of passion
excited by the words of the tempter from this gloomy task he was roused
by a soft voice murmuring as it seemed to him from the air for he was
not aware of the presence of any human being in the apartment 

does the great eagle fear the face of his friend

he started to his feet and beheld in the light of the lantern which
villafana had left on the table the figure of an ancient indian
standing hard by

techeechee he exclaimed but no thy speech is pure thy tongue is
another's who art thou gray-head of mexico

to-day cojotl the cunning fox of scribes yesterday olin the
tongue of nobles but before and hereafter guatimozin the friend of
the great eagle replied the indian and as he spoke he exchanged the
decrepit stoop of age for the lofty demeanour of youth and parted the
gray locks which had hitherto almost concealed his countenance

rash prince said juan will you yet wear the chains of montezuma
why dost thou again entrust thyself among spaniards

how came the great eagle into the place of guatimozin demanded the
young mexican expressively shall he die for guatimozin and
guatimozin stand afar off

alas prince said juan thy friendship is noble but can do me no
good leave this place where thou art in great danger and think of me
no more i am beyond the reach of help think of thyself of thy
people for surely it is thy duty to protect them and depart while
thou canst

and what am i that i should do this thing said guatimozin listen
to me son of the day-spring the children of spain are wolves and
reptiles the iztli is sharp for them and it must not spare but thou
the young eagle shalt remain the friend of guatimozin has not
malintzin eaten of thy blood is he not like the big tiger that takes by
the throat and who shall draw him away canst thou remain and smile on
another sunset i bring thee liberty

how said juan is villafana this traitor that he will permit me to
escape

he is a rat with two faces said the prince significantly he fears
the wrath of malintzin he loves gold but he says thou shalt not go
till to-morrow and to-morrow thou wilt be in mictlan the world of
caves but guatimozin can do what the traitor christian will not the
eagle is very brave he shall kill his foe

as guatimozin spoke he drew from his cloak a spanish dagger long
sharp and exceedingly bright a relic of the spoils won from the
invaders in the night of sorrow and offered it to the prisoner
adding

when i depart a soldier will fasten the door if thou art
strong-hearted thou canst rush by dealing him a blow at the water's
edge by the broken wall thou wilt find a friend with a canoe it is
techeechee is not tenochtitlan hard by guatimozin the king of mexico
will make his friend welcome

prince said juan sadly this thing cannot be why should i strike
down the poor sentinel he has done me no wrong what would become of
thee thou couldst not escape what would become of villafana who
knave though he be has yet done much to serve me and what to
conclude would become of me escaping from christians to take refuge
among thy unbelieving people i can die prince but i can be neither
renegade nor apostate

is there nothing in tenochtitlan that dwells in the thoughts of the
captive i will be very good to thee and thou shalt drink the blood of
thy foe

prince said juan firmly thine eye cannot search the soul of a
christian malintzin has done me a great wrong yet would i not harm a
hair of his head no heaven is my witness i can forgive him even my
death however unjust and cruel

it is a dove of cholula that speaks in the voice of my friend said
the infidel struck with as much disdain as surprise at the want of
spirit which his barbarous code of honour discovered in a lack of
vindictiveness is a man a worm that he should be trampled on

no said juan bitterly for he could not resist his feelings of
indignation when he suffered himself to consider his degradation in
this light had i resisted him in his first anger had i resented his
first injustice had i provoked him by any complaint then might i think
of his course with submission but i have not i have been indeed as
thou sayest a worm at all times helpless at all times unresisting
others have complained some have defied him but they passed
unpunished i who have yielded like a woman escape not i creep from
the path of his anger but his foot follows me turn which way i will
it crushes me even befo will show his teeth sometimes i have seen him
growl when cortes struck him and by mine honour i think he struck him
because he was once mine

how far by indulging such thoughts he might have wrought himself into
the very spirit which guatimozin was surprised to find absent we will
not venture to say he was interrupted by the sudden re-entrance of
villafana who immediately exclaimed

will you have my brother najara diving in upon you pho you talk too
loud tis well you were gabbling in mexican hark ye olin you knave
get you gone to your den sirrah pray señor juan tell this rascal
in his own gibberish that he cannot remain a moment longer from his
lock-up without being discovered come fellow come you shall have
more talk to-morrow

so saying the alguazil conducted the mexican away a few moments after
he returned alone juan still disordered and brooding over his wrongs
paced to and fro over the narrow limits of his cell his agitation
increased with each step and at last finding that villafana did not
speak he exclaimed

come villafana i know what thou wilt say am i not used dog-like
he disdained even to sit upon the trial to ask me what i had to urge in
excuse of my folly but left this to judges who were content to ask
didst thou this and didst thou that without permitting me a word
of defence surely i had much provocation in the matter of guzman and
as for the decree it should have been remembered that i was come into
the camp too short a time to have made it as fast in my mind as others
who had heard it daily proclaimed for months i must die for this die
like a hunted assassin my hand stuck against the prison-door my body
given perhaps to fatten the lean hogs that will fatten my judges oh
by heaven this is intolerable to think on

thou wilt believe now that thou wert sent to the south sea for no
good

ay i will believe anything said juan in increasing excitement and
this too scarce an hour returned from my sufferings endured for
him endured to regain his good-will ay and before i had done
speaking he would have sent me to mexico to be sacrificed
there before i had eaten and drunk before i had rested my wearied
body before i had recruited my exhausted strength tell me villafana
was it not by his design i was entrapped into giving shelter to but
no that could not be in that at least he must be innocent but in
the rest it is oppression grinding intolerable oppression

well i marvel he did not let thee off with a scourging said
villafana swallowing another draught from the neglected flask come
drink and we will discourse together

a scourging said juan seizing the alguazil's arm with a grasp which
showed that imprisonment and sorrow had not altogether robbed him of
strength dare you talk to me of scourging

ay marry said villafana whose object seemed to be to excite the
slumbering fury of the young man and who now in the effect of a word
used for another purpose discovered a point on which his equanimity was
not impregnable ay faith for the whole army cries out upon his
barbarity saying that he is murdering you so that he already talks of
letting you off with a scourging he was as good with me

by the saints of heaven cried juan snatching up the dagger which
guatimozin had left and striking it into the table with a fury which
split the plank in twain were it his own i would drive this steel
into the breast of the man that designed me such dishonour scourge me
thanks be to heaven that sends this weapon

oho señor said villafana with counterfeited indignation you will
resist will you hah and you have a dagger too come señor give it
up

fool said the prisoner thy bitter words have unchained me at last
and driven me to desperation i will not yield this weapon but with my
life wo betide him that comes to me with a scourge were it don hernan
himself

you will resist him then why now you are a man again sit down fear
not you shall have a better weapon come let us drink a little tis a
raw night and rainy here's success to our vengeance a quart of blood
apiece methinks you are more wronged than myself therefore you shall
strike the first blow i give you this privilege out of friendship the
second is mine

while villafana held forth in these extraordinary terms juan shocked
into composure became aware that the wine which the alguazil plied
with characteristic infatuation had already made serious inroads upon
his brain he ogled and smiled with a stupid contortion of countenance
which was meant to be significant his articulation was impeded and his
expressions coarser than usual and without being positively drunk he
was reduced to that condition in which the natural propensities get the
better of all artificial qualities hence he became fierce and
bloody-minded without displaying any of the subtle cautiousness and
cunning inquisitiveness that were common to him in his sober hours it
was for this reason that he proceeded to unfold the secrets of his
breast without being in any degree abashed by the looks of horror with
which juan heard him

know then brother juan said he that thou shalt lap the blood of
don demonios to-morrow morning at the banquet-table and afterwards
hang up guzman with thine own hands thou art too white-livered or thou
shouldst have known of the matter earlier also thou shalt have thy
fair nun again as before that is upon condition she likes thee
better than me which may be or may not for who can tell whether the
star will shoot into the marsh or fall upon the mountain bah it is a
pity i brought thee not another flagon busta i will drink no more for
this is no time to be thick-witted know then juanito querido we
have brought our conspiracy to a head and out of the nine hundred
christians in this town there are two hundred and forty sworn on dirk
buckler and crucifix to our whole game three hundred who will wink
and stand by till the play is over three hundred who will swear faith
to the devil himself when don demonios lies hid in his pocket and as
for the rest why we must e'en have some hanging and stabbing

in heaven's name said juan what dost thou mean art thou really
mad bethink thee what thou art saying

hah cried villafana wilt thou skulk backwards after all dost thou
pretend to oppose us we had some thoughts of making thee one of the
three chief captains this olea stands to for he swears thou art the
best leader in the camp

is gaspar sworn among you said juan with a faint voice his
detestation of the bloody scheme arousing him to the necessity of
sifting it to the bottom for he forgot his captivity and thought only
of arresting the progress of a treason so fearful

ay returned the alguazil and better men than he come clap thy
name to the paper and i swear thou shalt have a command among us
though i should kill thy rival-candidate gil gonzales with my own hand
dost thou not know these fellows we have hidalgos among us

as he spoke he pulled from his bosom a paper on which juan read with
affright the names of several men of rank mingled with those of common
soldiers with many of which he was familiar his first thought was to
secure this dreadful list and calling to the guards about the prison
arrest the alguazil upon the spot a moment's consideration determined
him to take further advantage of the communicativeness of the traitor
until made acquainted with all the details of the conspiracy he bridled
his anger therefore and concealing his horror under an appearance of
doubt and hesitation to which his trembling agitation gave no little
force he said

how is this are these names good and true 

see you not barba roxa's sign-manual near the bottom of the list he
subscribed it last night he draws the figure of a knife well as one
who knows how to use it but as for thee niño mio thou art able to
write thy signature in full

stay cried juan what are you to do you spoke of a banquet and the
morning assassination hah

did i not tell thee before look said the alguazil with a harsh
laugh displaying a letter well secured with wax and fillet on which
was written the name of the captain-general know that this letter
written carefully on the outside by mine own hand for there is
nothing within comes from the señor's sire old don martin whom the
devil take to his rest for fathering so ill-tempered a son this
letter thou must know he went on with a chuckle of self-approving
craft came in the ship of seville that brought this good wine and
was by an evil accident detained on the way know sirrah and this is
my device the general hath forgotten to invite me to his feast
to-morrow in honour of his saint-day or some other thing quien
sabe it is very rude but he has invited all my caballeros on this
paper and some four score soldiers who are down likewise the rest
will take their ease in the vestibule and on the square to be ready
what do i then marry this i break in upon the revel with the letter
in my hand and a dagger in my sleeve the others crowd round with
congratulations and i strike him under the ribs pho i forgot thou
canst not have the first blow as i promised thee but thou shalt
follow cloaked up to the eyes and be free to take the second what
dost thou think of my plot hah dear devil hah 

that it is the most damnable and dastardly ever devised by villain and
shall bring thee to a villain's death rogue didst thou think thou
couldst tell this to me and live i have thy treason in my hand and
will use it as it becomes an honourable man and christian what ho
guards treason treason

greatly astounded as villafana was by this unexpected defection the
shock served rather to sober than affright him he gave the prisoner a
look of unspeakable malice and whipping out his sword and calling for
help as clamorously as juan he assaulted him with the utmost fury at
the same time five or six of the guardsmen rushed in and to juan's
utter dismay instead of aiding him to secure the alguazil rushed upon
him some with their spears to transfix him against the wall while
others springing behind him secured him in their arms and hurled him
upon the floor in an instant he had lost both the fatal list and the
dagger of guatimozin and was at the mercy of villafana who knelt upon
his breast and shortened his sword to despatch him with a thrust but
at the very moment when he had given up all hope and was commending his
soul to his maker the savage and exulting laugh with which the alguazil
aimed at his throat was changed to an exclamation of alarm and pain up
started the assassin and juan springing also to his feet he beheld
with surprise the figure of la monjonaza standing betwixt him and the
assailants the gray mantle had fallen from her head and shoulders
revealing a form of the finest symmetry and a countenance convulsed
into beauty such as might have become a warring bellona to whom she
might have been well compared only that in place of the whip and torch
which a moralizing mythology has put into the hands of the goddess she
held an emblem equally expressive in a short dagger gleaming with
blood from the shoulder of villafana

villain she cried after looking as if she would have repeated the
blow art thou not yet requited begone

and the discomfited traitor scowling and pointing at the blood
trickling from his arm and yet obviously quailing before her stern
frown left the prison followed by the guards who seemed even more
terrified than himself




chapter xix


juan stood for a moment confounded in the presence of his preserver
and magdalena gradually exchanging her fierce expression for one more
becoming her sex appeared at last as he had seen her before pale
saddened and subdued as she sank into this softened temper her eye
fell upon the crimsoned blade and it was curious to see with what
feminine horror disgust and shame she cast it from her and to
contrast this display of undissembled feelings with her late amazonian
bearing and act

magdalena said juan a thousand emotions at once contending in his
bosom you have saved my life haste now and protect that of cortes
for be it dear to thee or not yet it is not fitting he should be left
to the knife of an assassin acquaint him from me nay bear it not from
me for i will not seem as if i sought to purchase my life with the
confession acquaint him that a dreadful conspiracy headed by the knave
villafana is about to burst upon his head if he seizes not the traitor
to-night let him beware who approaches the banquet to-morrow above
all let him be on his guard against any one who affects to bring
letters from his father haste maiden haste for perhaps villafana
wrought upon by his fears may discharge his train of horrors this very
night

dost thou thus seek to preserve him who has so basely compassed thine
own life said magdalena less with surprise than sorrowing admiration
think not of cortes but of thyself thou hast not many hours for
thought

alas magdalena said juan impatiently you do not believe me i
swear to you that what i say is true villafana is a traitor and is
now on the point of assassinating the captain-general

if he were about assassinating thee and the captain-general knew it
what aid wouldst thou expect from the captain-general rejoined la
monjonaza

maiden said juan frowning severely in this coldness of purpose
now that thou art acquainted with the act thou art conniving at
murder

apparently this reproof touched magdalena to the quick she started
shuddered and turned as if to leave the prison but changing her
purpose stepping up to the light and assuming a boldness which she did
not feel she falteringly asked

is there no case in which such connivance might be excusable but a
moment since and here she bent her head upon her bosom i was about
to commit murder had i slain villafana wouldst thou then have
thought the act criminal

surely not surely not said juan for in this case thou wert
arresting the blow of a cut-throat to kill whom in the act were but
sheer justice and according to law and yet i would that the blow had
been struck by another it is not seemly for a woman to carry a dagger
and still more improper that she should use it

what if she be attacked by a villain and no helper nigh demanded the
forlorn girl heaven has given me no protector my father my brother
and my friend they all lie in this little steel and as she picked up
the weapon from the floor as if no longer ashamed to bear it a ghastly
smile beamed from her visage like the flash of a medusa amid the foam
of a midnight billow

speak no more of cortes she continued observing that juan was about
to resume the subject of the conspiracy he is far better able to
protect himself than thou were there twenty poniards in villafana's
hand and were his arm as extended as his malice yet could he not reach
even to the heel of don hernan his fate is written yes more
inevitably than thine for thou hast yet one hope of deliverance and
villafana has none listen to me juan lerma it is perhaps the last
time on earth that i shall speak to thee if thou reject mine offer this
night i call heaven to witness that i will leave thee to thy fate

magdalena said juan firmly we have spoken of this before god
protect thee for there is a wall of adamant between us

be it so said the lady and let it be higher than thy wishes deeper
than thy scorn so thou wilt leave this land and return to it no more

on the morrow magdalena i die said lerma with unabated resolution
hear then the counsel of a dying man who can yet call himself your
friend do what you have recommended to me leave this land and in the
gloom of a cloister expiate 

yet again exclaimed the maiden with an eye of fire this is to
distract me oh if thou knew how unjustly thou hast planted daggers in
my bosom daggers to which this thing of steel is but as the thorn of a
rosebud thou wouldst kill thyself rather than speak them again but it
matters not whether thou livest or diest still must thou know that i
am wronged listen to me i will speak of hilario 

let it not be so said juan and then solemnly added learn that
yesternight the wretched villafana who by some magical science seems
acquainted with the secrets of all in this camp gave me to know what i
did not before dream magdalena when i plucked thee from the wreck i
dreamed for a moment that i loved thee  the maiden trembled from
head to foot and juan was himself greatly agitated i beheld one in
whom from the act of giving her a life i might fancy a tie such as
did not exist between me and any other human being from the time of the
death of my poor father up to that happy hour but had that affection
ripened even into such as hilario avowed here magdalena waved her
hand impatiently nay had i plighted with thee faith and troth and
did we stand this moment before the altar my passion would be at once
changed to awe and horror to know that i was wedding the spouse of
heaven magdalena a life of penitence can scarcely remove the sin of
broken vows

say not this exclaimed the unhappy magdalena vehemently what knew
i of earth or heaven when imprisoned in a cell from childhood upwards
i gave up the one for the other heaven broke the oath which oppressors
exacted else wherefore was i saved of all the sisters and thrown upon
a land where cloisters were unknown for these vows could i have
procured a dispensation hast thou never heard of such being dissolved

surely i have said juan mildly desiring to allay the agitation of
his visitor it was told to me by villafana that the señor camarga
an insane man who made an attempt on my life was once a monk of st
dominic and an inquisitor and permitted to revoke his vows for some
worldly purpose i know not what and i have heard it also said that
the sister of don hernan was allowed to leave a nunnery to wed some
great nobleman of andalusia

it is enough said magdalena calmly the vow was suspended not
broken it will be resumed when the purpose for which i now live is
accomplished and would have been before but for the accident which
brought me to this land juan lerma i will not ask thee why thou
refusest life at my hands but it is offered thee by one wronged and
defamed not degraded if thou live it is well thou shouldst know the
truth and remember me without contempt if thou die the grave shall
not cover thee in ignorance hilario start not frown not tremble not
for the truth must be spoken hilario abused thy belief that he might
break my heart and perhaps also thine for he hated me because i
repelled his love with contempt and thee because he knew because he
suspected that thou wert the cause you fought he fell and with
what seemed his dying lips for even in death his spite was not
diminished repeated the demoniacal falsehood boasting of the
degradation of one whose only shame was that she did not requite his
presumption with a dagger

again the figure of the unhappy girl was elevated by passion into the
port of a destroying deity but she perceived that juan was shocked by a
display of fire so unwomanly and indeed so fearful and this instantly
transformed her into another being

this too this too she cried shedding tears of humiliation this
too is a consequence of his malice for it has converted me into the
thing i am not into what seems a fury or a demon dost thou believe i
am dost thou believe i was a creature formed of passions that should
belong only to men no oh heaven oh no it is the madness that comes
from the viper's tooth stung vilified robbed of respect and
happiness how even can a woman sit down in peace unless she can die
unless she can die she will have her vengeance believe it and well is
it for her when it is won by the hands of a brother or sire yet
believe this if thou wilt for i am not what i was believe
aught anything save the lies of hilario with his dying lips he
defamed me with his dying hand he revoked the slander and avowed
himself a villain behold the refutation of calumny

as she spoke she drew from her bosom with a trembling grasp and put
into juan's a scrap of paper on which he read with extreme surprise
the following words traced with a hand feeble and agitated yet well
known to him 

 what i have said of magdalena del naufragio or magdalena of
 the wreck for by this name she was known at isabela is
 false in malice and folly i have laid perjury on my soul and
 as i now speak the truth i pray heaven to forgive me amen

 antonio del milagro

good heaven said juan is it possible antonio could commit this
dastardly crime alas magdalena i have done you a grievous wrong
and i beseech you pardon me this thing was not only wicked but
marvellous the paper is stained with blood the saints acquit me of his
death for it was i who shed it i am glad he died penitent what
brought him to this justice i held my dagger to his throat yet he
cried with a devilish malice and courage strike for  but i will
not repeat his sinful and exulting falsehoods alas that his blood
should be upon my soul the blood of his father's son

magdalena surveyed the self-accusing looks of the prisoner with much
emotion and twice or thrice she opened her lips to give him comfort
or to continue her dark and singular story and yet failed as many
times to speak at last she clasped her hands upon her bosom as if
by an effort of physical strength to give support and resolution to her
heart and said with low and interrupted accents

lament no more for a sin thou hast not committed thou wert
deceived hilario died not by thy hands

hah exclaimed juan dost thou tell me the truth is hilario yet
living god be thanked god be thanked for i am not a murderer

he fell upon his knees and looking up to heaven with joy beheld not
the grief and trepidation with which his companion surveyed his
raptures

i told thee not that he lived but that thou didst not slay him said
the nun with an effort had my father come to my side and looked
upon this paper after hearing the story of hilario's baseness what
think you he should have done

killed him i must allow said juan rising to his feet for even his
deep penitence could scarcely be permitted to stand as the sole penalty
of such an offence alas magdalena my mind is beset with sore
misgivings how was that paper obtained how did hilario die thou
growest pale heaven shield me didst thou didst thou 

he paused with terror the maiden replied instantly and almost with
firmness

hear the truth even to the last syllable for even thy good opinion
i will not purchase by subterfuge to villafana a wretch whose
manifold villanies thou couldst not dream for know that being a
sailor in the ship that bore the unlucky sisters he devised and
accomplished its destruction that he might impiously obtain the holy
vessels of silver and gold ay it was villafana and not the tempest
that drove us upon the rocks of alonso  to villafana from whom i
learned the cause of the duel and of thy flight i committed the charge
of obtaining this recantation was this wrong she exclaimed giving
way to affright for juan's looks of horror could not be mistaken they
were two fiends together the villain struck the villain the 

murderess murderess cried juan aloud recoiling from her

a ghastly smile passed over her countenance and it grew into a faint
laugh which to juan's mistaken eye for he thought it the merriment
of satisfaction or indifference seemed unnatural and dreadful while
she replied her voice hysterically belying her feelings as much as did
her countenance

thou dost not think i employed him to do murder i appeal to heaven i
did not dream he would do aught but compel the recantation from the
wounded man what bid him kill one so defenceless had he been strong
and well armed then perhaps indeed then perhaps i might have
thought it i sought but for the paper the rest was the deed of
villafana

oh heaven oh holy heaven cried juan speak not another word rather
let me die than hear more away avaunt thou art not a woman but a
fiend and all is now as it was and worse what blood-stained
blood-stained 

magdalena strode towards him striving to speak but could only utter
the words injustice injustice mingled with the charge leave
mexico that still made a part of her perturbed thoughts had not juan
been entirely overwhelmed by his horror he must have observed that her
mind was at this moment convulsed beyond the degree of any former
agitation that she was in fact in a condition both alarming and
pitiable her countenance was most deathlike her accents wholly
unnatural and there was something of delirium or idiotcy in the manner
with which while still muttering the broken reproof injustice and
the charge leave mexico she all the while extended the
blood-stained paper as if entreating him again to receive and peruse
it

as it was he gave utterance to his horror in the words 

miserable woman the denial forced from the lips of the murdered man
is of a piece with the spirit that compelled it false false all

at these words the paper dropped from her hands another vacant smile
distorted her visage and she turned to depart but before she had taken
two steps she tottered and fell to the floor with a dreadful scream
that instantly brought the guards into the prison

the absorbing nature of their conversation had for the last two or
three moments rendered both incapable of observing that some scene of
altercation had suddenly arisen at the dungeon door high voices might
be heard as of one alternately entreating and demanding admittance
which was gruffly denied by others the shriek of magdalena ringing in
their ears like a cry of death brought the contention to an end and
all rushing in together they beheld juan endeavouring to raise the
figure of his unhappy and lifeless guest from the floor

dios mio y peccavi i will kill him where he stands exclaimed one
rushing forward

not so fast señor camarga cried the hunchback who was at the head
of all snatching the weapon from the hands of this individual who
seemed peculiarly to thirst for the blood of the young islander here's
work for the bastinado where's villafana ye treacherous dogs that let
women into the prison he shall pay for it harkee señor camarga if
you have any interest in this fair lady you may help bear her to the
palace poor fool these women love as arquebuses shoot if you make
them any obstruction they burst in your hands and this is truer still
of a musket if you thrust it into the earth in mine own opinion the
young hound has scorned her

while najara gave vent to these growling observations magdalena was
carried out of the prison the hunchback had reached the door before
juan in the confusion of the moment thought of calling him back to
impart to him the secret of the treachery but najara replied only with
a malediction and departed with the lantern so that juan was again
left to night and solitude




chapter xx


meanwhile a scene of still more tragical character was on the point of
being represented within the walls of the palace

it was a tempestuous night the clouds which had all day enveloped the
pagan metropolis were at last gathered over tezcuco the wind blew in
gusts with frequent rain and as the distant thunderbolts rolled with a
rumbling cadence over mexico vast sheets of lightning shot up in the
west illuminating sky lake and mountain with a cadaverous glare

some five or six of the principal cavaliers were assembled with cortes
in the great hall of audience engaged in earnest and anxious debate it
happened by accident that the huge curtain which at night was
usually drawn over the window of alabaster had been this evening
neglected by the attendants so that it remained drooping in gigantic
festoons from the great beam carved into a serpent's head which held
it at the top down to the lesser ornaments that supported it on the
sides of the casement the strong cords by which it could be dragged
into its place hung over the central beam flapping occasionally
against the alabaster wall as the gust puffing in through the great
door whirled the smoke and flame of the lamps and torches from the
walls and pillars to which they were attached

thus though the alabaster slabs were too thick to transmit any ordinary
ray the brighter flashes of lightning made their way through and
added at times a ghastly glare to the light of the lamps in which the
countenances of the cavaliers perturbed as they were assumed such an
unnatural hue as might have beseemed the ghosts of dead heroes rising
to earth to meddle again in the sport of slaughter

the visage of the captain-general betrayed greater anxiety mingled with
sterner wrath than appeared on any other and when he spoke it was in
accents brief and low and exceedingly emphatic

i tell you cavaliers he cried the mystery that shrouds this
treason is more frightful than the treason itself we are at fault
señores we are at fault we behold enough to show us that the devils
are at work about us but not to discover in what mode they are toiling
it is clear enough that villafana is a dog and one day he shall hang
but i know not in what manner nor at what time he will bite this is
certain he has suffered one of the mexicans to leave his cell and
communicate with xicotencal it is certain also that this cur of
tlascala will leave the camp before day-dawn and how many of his
warriors will follow after him that i leave you to conjecture this i
have from a true mouth he is incensed first on account of juan lerma
and secondly i doubt not the mexican has made the most of his
growling temper and present discontent what sayst thou sandoval what
hinders thee to lie in wait and following at his heels so do with
him that his tlascalans who desert afterwards may be frightened on the
path and so return to us there are good trees on the wayside

ay replied don gonzalo grimly when there is any executioner's work
towards i am sure to play jack-ketch i am loath to deal with a man
that hath been so valiant but if he be a traitor it is right he should
die what if i give him the bastinado turk-wise methinks that would
bring him into a sounder temper

it would but inflame the choler of his proud people said the shrewder
general whereas his sudden death dealt upon him in the act of
desertion will strike them with fear take thou a rope with thee my
son and fear not to use it

the young cavalier nodded assent and the general went on

concerning the ambassadors thus secretly treating with a traitor
methinks they have forfeited all claim to protection

ay said alvarado and the bastinado of which sandoval spake may
serve the good purpose of opening their lips and thereby revealing not
only the depth of the tlascalan defection but the length to which
villafana and his curs have gone with them let us send for them and
try the experiment or stay here are cords enough on the curtain one
of these twisted round the brow with a sword-hilt i have known to
bring out a man's tongue as far as his eyes

the cavaliers turned to the window and the bitter smile of the
captain-general was made deathlike by a flash brighter than usual
shooting through the wall

a good thought he said but we will not be precipitate we have them
secured and however villafana may permit them to speak with others he
is somewhat too wise to set them free we will have this thing
considered in the morning

at this moment don francisco de guzman made his appearance in the
chamber his visage disfigured by a black patch and somewhat pale but
this as it was soon discovered was caused rather by care than
sickness

señor he exclaimed i have been to seek the ambassadors they have
escaped

escaped echoed cortes thou art beside thyself and the villain
alguazil has he fled with them i will tear his flesh with pincers
what release the infidels under my eye

so please you said guzman this i think was no resolved treachery
but an effect of infatuation the wine that came to us to-day was too
strong for the watchmen where they got it i know not but i found them
sound asleep at the open door

they shall be scourged till they drop more blood than they have drunk
wine said don hernan furiously and the prison-guards also hah the
prisoner has escaped

not so said the cavalier all's well there save 

and villafana speak me the word has he fled

señor mio no he is in the prison carousing with juan lerma as the
guards say i heard his voice through the door

carousing does juan lerma take his death so merrily by'r lady devil
as he is it is a sin to slay him

as to the prisoner said guzman i know not whether he be merry or
not but i myself for i had mine ear to the door heard villafana
smack his lips and vow he would drink no more this being no time to
be thick-witted but every one knows villafana his bibbing once
brought him to the strappado

ay and it shall bring him to the gallows it is the fate of the
can-clinker all spoken in three words drunk whipped and
gibbeted didst thou worm naught from the guards they were of his own
appointing

not a syllable replied guzman i do believe they have been too much
frightened and are now penitent men

it may be said cortes it may be but i would i could look into the
dreams of villafana if i punish him for the flight of the ambassadors
it may be that i disperse an imposthume before it comes to a head or it
may prove that i drive the matter into the more vital organs of this
body politic till all be corrupted and consumed what say ye to a
little torture inflicted on villafana himself yet he is a bold dog and
may not speak they say he winced not under the lash i swear to you my
friends i am in a strait

while cortes thus admitted the difficulty in which he felt himself
pressed and the cavaliers were divided in their counsels they
perceived a common soldier intrude himself into the chamber and boldly
approach them

hah cried alvarado ever hot of temper who art thou sir
gallows-bird that bringest thy knave's pate among cavaliers in
council

hold touch him not tis the barba-roxa exclaimed don hernan what
impertinence is this sirrah who bade thee hitherward

god and my good saint said gaspar flinging himself on his knees and
adding with the greatest impetuosity pardon señor pardon for two
unhappy men or if that cannot be why pardon then for one and i care
not how soon you hang up the others

what means the fool art thou distracted

señor cried the soldier wringing his hands i am a knave and
traitor grant me the life of juan lerma who meant you no wrong and i
will give you for the rope and sword two hundred and forty such
traitors as the world never saw and myself among them for i have
signed my name with knife and arrow and sworn myself to brotherhood
under the pains of hell which i care not how soon may came upon me

let some one of you look to the door said cortes quickly and see
that the sentinels keep their eyes open how now gaspar what is this
thou sayst art thou indeed a villain i should have struck on the mouth
any soldier that had said it of thee

i am what i said replied gaspar your excellency refused to listen
to me when i pleaded for juan lerma and i was incensed i said to
myself señor i have saved your life and yet you deny me the life of
my friend who in ignorance broke a decree yet knew no malice
besides señor you called me a dog an officious presuming dog
whereas i was not a dog then but now well señor while i was in a
passion the devil came to me and tempted me and i signed my name to
my perdition

what said alvarado recoiling with devout horror hast thou really
signed over thy soul to satan we will burn thee thou devil's penitent
in a hot fire

speak on said cortes what meanest thou by this mummery what devil
is this for though satan be walking now among us yet i think it
could not be he

it was villafana replied gaspar and heaven pardon me for i think
it must be apollyon in his likeness

at this communication the cavaliers all stared at one another and
cortes exclaimed

two hundred and forty men what are there so many knaves of his
party

ay and many more who will help but will not put down their names
upon paper replied gaspar but your excellency says nothing of juan
lerma if you will pardon him your excellency shall hear all

how sirrah cried cortes sternly do you avow yourself a sworn
traitor and yet dictate to me terms of mercy speak or you shall have
that to your brows which will bring out words with screams

gaspar sprang to his feet boldly fearlessly and even insolently
returning the look of the captain-general

your excellency has no heart and i have he cried do your will upon
us both and reckon my death to your conscience as you do that of juan
lerma you shall not have a word more here are my arms what cavalier
will demean himself to tie them i will meet your excellency at the
judgment-seat

thou art but a fool said cortes moderating his anger or at least
mollifying the severity of his accents for his countenance yet gleamed
with wrath thou knowest that having saved my life at xochimilco i
can in no case take thine

but i leave that to the laws without asking any mercy said the red
beard obstinately i ask the life of juan lerma condemned without
law

dost thou impugn my justice fellow cried the ferocious de olid i
swear to thee when thou art brought to be judged i will give thee a
double quantity for this very reason

while the cavalier gave utterance to so excellent a proof of his equity
alvarado with whom gaspar had been a favourite whispered in his ear

speak out and fear not it stands not with the captain's honour to
barter men's lives for knave's confessions yet he shall pardon the
young man thy friend as i am thy guarantee

what say ye cavaliers cried cortes does it become me to remit a
sentence of death at such mutinous intercession

before any of the officers could reply gaspar confiding in the promise
of alvarado threw himself again at the general's feet crying

señor i am not a mutineer but a penitent i am mad to think that
one so good a friend so valiant a soldier so true a follower for
there is no falsehood in juan lerma should die for a small
matter saving don francisco's presence when there are so many rogues
about us that go unpunished but i leave him to your excellency's
mercy trusting that your excellency will reconsider the judgment and
release him therefore i will speak in this trust and i pray heaven to
remember the act be it merciful or be it cruel this is what i have to
say in my passion i betook me to villafana who promising to save
lerma's life i signed with him though the first act of guilt was to
take your excellency's life holy mother of heaven pardon me but i was
very much incensed well señor i found on the paper the names of two
hundred and forty men and i will tell you such as i remember but if
you will send to the prison and suddenly seize the alguazil you will
find the list in his bosom 

quinones see thou to this said cortes turning to the master of the
armory who made one of the council take with thee none but hidalgos
and be sudden making no noise and shedding no blood yet stay this
will not do neither hark thee gaspar man when shall this precious
earthquake rumble into the upper air

to-morrow replied the soldier and then to the horror and
astonishment of all present he divulged the whole scheme of
assassination as villafana had himself spoken it in the prison

with a letter from my father too cried cortes apparently more
struck with the heartless barbarity of the stratagem than with anything
else in gaspar's communication this is indeed the judas-kiss
the faugh these were the words of magdalena

while he muttered these words to himself he was roused by a sudden
voice at the great door and heard distinctly the unexpected voice of
villafana saying as he wrangled with the guards

oh slid you take upon you too much i come at the order of the
general

admit villafana said cortes in tones that penetrated loudly to the
farthest limits of the room for the cavaliers were stricken into a
boding silence at the accents of the alguazil admit my trusty
villafana and villafana entered

he was evidently flushed with wine and it was for that reason
doubtless that he did not seem to observe the presence of his forsworn
associate nor the suspicious act of two cavaliers who stole from the
group and took possession of the door by which he had entered he
approached with a reckless and confident though somewhat stupid air
exclaiming after divers humble scrapes and salaams

i come at your excellency's bidding according to appointment this was
the hour please your excellency but tis a scurvy night with much
thunder and lightning

ay truly said cortes with a mild voice while all the rest stood in
the silence of death but being so observant villafana how comes it
you have not remarked that you are here without the indian techeechee
whom i commanded you to bring hither at this hour

señor said the alguazil a little confused that old ottomi is a sly
dog and i doubt me not over-honest

i doubt me so too said cortes in the same encouraging tones yet
honest or false sly or simple methinks thou shouldst not have suffered
him to escape

escape what techeechee escape cried villafana with unaffected
surprise ho no i did but give the gray infidel a sop of wine and
straightway he hid himself in a corner to sleep off his drunkenness
and and  continued he with instinctive though clumsy
cunning and i thought it would be unbeseemly to bring him to your
excellency in that condition i beg your excellency's pardon for making
him acquainted with such christian liquor but it was out of pity
together with some little hope of converting him to the faith and
besides i knew not his head was so weak i will fetch him to your
excellency in the morning

why this is well said the captain-general with such insinuating
gentleness as characterizes the snake when closing softly on his prey
and i doubt not thou canst give me as good an account of the
ambassadors it is said to me that they also have escaped

good god cried villafana startled not only out of his confidence
but in great measure out of his intoxication by such an announcement
the ambassadors escaped it cannot be

pho they have hurt thee more than i thought even to the point of
destroying thy memory rejoined the captain-general with the
blandishment of a smile there is blood upon thy shoulder i doubt not
thou wert severely hurt while attempting to prevent their flight no
one ever questioned the courage of villafana

yes señor yes no yes that is i mean to say saints of
heaven and here the alguazil paused completely sobered that is
restored to his senses but not to his wits for he perceived himself in
a difficulty and his invention pointed out no means of escape he
rolled his eyes haggard at once with debauch and alarm over the
cavaliers and though the lofty figure of alvarado concealed gaspar
from his view he beheld enough in the extraordinary sedateness of all
present to fill him with the most racking suspicions he turned again
to cortes and commanding his fears as much as he could went on with
an appearance of boldness

alas noble señor if the ambassadors be escaped i am a lost
man for i trusted too much to the vigilance of others and i should
not have done so alas señor he continued with more energy as his
mind began to work more clearly i have committed a great offence in
this negligence but i vow to heaven it was owing to my fears of juan
lerma who made many efforts to escape and had strong friends to help
him your excellency may see the necessity i was under to give all my
thoughts to him for some one having furnished him with a dagger he
foully attacked me not on my guard giving me this wound and had it
not been for the sudden rushing in of the guard i should certainly have
been killed

thus spoke the alguazil with returning craft mingling together fiction
and fact with an address which astonished even himself

yes señor he continued satisfied with the strength of his argument
and now elated with a prospect of providing against the effects of his
imprudent disclosures in the prison yes señor and the young man
besides thus wounding me swore he would have me hanged for a
conspiracy stating roundly as the guards will witness i am certain
that esteban the left-handed heard him that being a notorious
grumbler any such fiction would be believed of me as if this would
make me a conspirator whereas your excellency knows according to the
proverb barking dogs are no biters and the audacious ruffian
relapsing into security attested his innocence by a gentle laugh and
the sweetest of his smiles

again i say thou speakest well said cortes carelessly descending
from the platform on which he had mounted at the approach of villafana
thine arguments have even satisfied me of the folly of certain charges
brought against thee by this mad fellow here at thy elbow

as he spoke alvarado taking his instructions rather from a
consentaneous feeling of propriety than from any hint of don hernan's
moved aside and villafana's eyes fell upon the figure of gaspar

think of it good fellow said cortes laying his hand upon
villafana's shoulder as if to support himself a little the things he
said of thee are innumerable and excessively preposterous he averred
for instance that thou wert peevishly offended because i had not
invited thy presence to the festivities of the morning banquet and wert
resolved to come whether i would or not and that with a letter from my
father in one hand and a dagger in the other eh is not this
outrageous he said besides but o my life thou hast bled too much
from this wound juan lerma strikes deep when the fit is on him i hope
thou art not faint man

to these benevolent expressions the alguazil replied by turning upon
the general a countenance so bloodless and an eye filled with such
ecstacy of despair for if the poniards of all had been at his throat
he could not have been more perfectly apprized of his coming fate that
cortes must have been struck with some feeling of commiseration had not
his nature been somewhat akin to that of a cat which delights less to
kill than to sport with the agonies of a dying victim as it was he
continued to torment the abandoned wretch by adding pleasantly

and what thinkest thou of this too my villafana two hundred and
forty conspirators to rush in when the blow was struck doubtless to
carve their dinners from the ribs of my cavaliers ah villafana
villafana thou shouldst have a care of thy friends our enemies are
harmless but our friends are always dangerous what dost thou say to
all this villafana knave hadst thou twenty daggers in thy jerkin
thou wert still but an unfanged reptile

while he spoke in this jestful mood he was sensible that villafana
doubtless with an instinctive motion of which he was himself
unconscious being apparently turned to stone was stealing his hand up
towards his bosom as if to grasp a weapon the moment the member had
reached the opening of his garment cortes caught him by the throat and
giving utterance to his last words with a voice of thunder and
employing a strength irresistible by such a man as villafana he hurled
him to the floor at the same instant placing his foot on his throat
then stooping down and thrusting his hand into the traitor's bosom he
plucked out at a single grasp a poniard a letter and the fatal list
of conspirators he pushed the first aside read the superscription of
the second with a laugh and casting his eye upon the third devoured
its contents with an avidity that left him unconscious of the murmurs of
the fierce cavaliers and the groans of the wretched alguazil
strangling under his foot

what señor will you rob the gallows of its prey cried alvarado
pointing his sword at the prostrate traitor as indeed did all the
rest having drawn them at the moment when cortes seized him by the
throat his crime is manifest to all what need of trial every man
his steel through the dog

hold cried the captain-general this were a death for an hidalgo
up cur up and meet thy fate up and he spurned the wretch with his
foot

the alguazil rose up his face black with blood which not perfectly
dispersing even at release from strangulation remained in leopard-like
blotches over his visage ghastfully contrasted with the ashy hues that
gathered between them as he rose his arms were seized by two or three
cavaliers and sandoval as quick in action as he was sluggish in
speech snatching the rich sword-sash of samite from his own shoulders
instantly secured them behind his back

for the love of god señores cried villafana finding speech at last
what do you mean what do you design you will not kill an innocent
man will you judge me at the charge of a liar gaspar is my sworn foe
i will make all clear señor i have been drinking and my mind is
confused take me not at this disadvantage oh for god's sake what do
you mean the list what the list tis for a merry-making a
rejoicing for my birthday i will explain all to your excellencies i
am an innocent man gaspar is a forsworn caitiff a caitiff señores a
caitiff i claim trial by the civil judges 

gag him cried one

strike him on the mouth said another and villafana gasping for
breath uttered for a moment nothing but inarticulate murmurs

de olid marin de ircio cried cortes rapidly and with
inexpressible decision ye are judges of life and death sandoval and
alvarado by right of office ye can sit in judgment quinones guzman
and the rest i make you in the king's name special associates of the
others why here is a court not martial but civil and the dog shall
have judgment to his content he stands charged of treason guilty
señores or not guilty

guilty cried all with one voice and de olid added let us take him
into the garden and hang him to the cedar-tree

to the window said cortes pointing with his sword to the stout
cords hanging so invitingly from the serpent's-head and in an instant
the victim was dragged upon the platform

up to this moment his fears had been uttered rather in vehement
complaints than in outcries but now when he perceived that he was
condemned by a mockery of trial doomed without the respite of a
minute's space to pray the rope dangling before his eyes and already
in the hands of a cavalier who was bending it into a noose he uttered
a piercing scream and endeavoured to throw himself on his knees

mercy he cried mercy mercy i will confess i can save all your
lives mercy mercy

of all the sights of horror and disgust villany transformed at the
death-hour into its natural character and original of cowardice is
among the most appalling villafana was as brave as a ruffian could be
but when imagination is linked in the same spirit with vice courage
expires almost at the same moment with hope with a weapon in his hand
and that at liberty villafana perhaps would have manifested all the
valour in which despair perceives the only hope and died like a man as
it was bound and grasped in the arms of strong men entirely helpless
and equally without hope his death staring him in the face he gave
himself up at once to unmanly fears and wept screamed and prayed
until the guards at watch in the vestibule sank upon their knees and
conned over their beads to divert their senses from cries so agonized
and so horrible

as he strove to prostrate himself before his inexorable judges he was
pulled up by the cavaliers and among others by don francisco de guzman
whose countenance he recognized

save me guzman save me he cried for thou wert once of the
party save me

peace wolf 

mercy mercy noble señor he continued turning to cortes i am but
one of many guzman is as false as i i charge him with treason he has
abused your excellency's ear listen señores and spare me my life
give me a day give me but to-night to pray and confess and you shall
have all there are cavaliers among us mercy for the love of
heaven camarga the dominican don palmerino de castro muertazo of
toledo carabo of seville artiaga santa-rosa bravo aljaraz and an
hundred more 

peace lying villain cried the captain-general what ho the rope
quick the rope

a moment to repent a moment to repent shrieked the victim
struggling so violently to bring his hands before him as if to clasp
them in prayer that the silken band crackled behind him and his hands
turned black with congested blood a moment to repent for i am a
sinner what would you condemn my soul too saints hear me angels
plead for me a priest for the love of heaven i killed artiaga of
cadiz i scuttled the ship at alonso drowned the nuns and stole the
church-plate call magdalena where's magdalena you are murdering me
mercy mercy i killed hilario too i poniarded him in the old wounds
inflicted by juan lerma i have much to repent a priest for the love
of god a priest oh a priest

thus raved the villain stained with a thousand crimes and if aught had
been wanting to steel the hearts of his executioners enough was
divulged in the unavailing abandonment with which he accused himself of
misdeeds so many and so atrocious while his neck was yet free from the
rope he struggled violently but without any attempt to do a mischief
to his unrelenting murderers his resistance was indeed like that of a
cur under the chastisement of a cruel and brutal master which howls
and contends and yet fears to employ its fangs against the tyrant but
when he found at last that the cavaliers were actually putting the
hasty halter about his neck his struggles were not greater to escape
than to inflict injury he shook and tossed his head in distraction and
don francisco de guzman endeavouring to seize him by the beard he
caught the hand of the cavalier betwixt his teeth and held it with the
gripe of a tiger

hell confound thee wolf cried guzman groaning with pain and
striking him over the face with the hilt of his sword but in vain
help me cavaliers or he will have my hand off villain unlock thy
teeth 

stand aside this will unloose thee said one thrusting his rapier
into the thigh of the vindictive wretch who no sooner felt the cold
steel penetrate his flesh than he opened his mouth to utter a yell
whip him up now so much for traitors

it was the last scream of the assassin his lips uttered one more cry to
heaven the name of magdalena was cut short as the noose closed upon
his throat and ended in a hoarse rattling gulphing whine that did
not itself prevail beyond the space of a second as he shot up to the
top of the window an intense glare of lightning flashed through the
alabaster and his figure traced upon that lustrous and ghastly medium
was seen dangling and writhing in the death-agony the next moment the
huge curtain was drawn over the dreadful spectacle but those who paused
a moment to look back could behold the convulsions of the dying
miscreant giving motion and sometimes protrusion to the dark folds of
the drapery when all was silent in the darkness of the night the
watchmen in the vestibule could yet hear the pattering of blood-drops
falling from his mangled limb upon the sonorous wood of the platform

but there were other scenes now occurring which for a time drove from
their thoughts the memory of villafana




chapter xxi


the scene of death in which they were engaged had so employed the
thoughts of the cavaliers that they were for a time insensible to
many tumultuous noises in the city which beginning at the moment when
the struggles and outcries of villafana were fiercest and loudest
increased every instant until all was uproar

at first as they rushed in disorder to the doors they thought the din
was caused by a renewal of the storm or rather the sudden outbursting
of a tornado which overwhelming the houses of some of the poorer
citizens and burying them among the ruins might account for the
screams and yells that were mingled with other noises but they soon
exchanged this fear for one more stirring when as they rushed into the
air they heard an alarum ringing from the chapel-bell on the top of the
pyramid drums beating to arms arquebuses firing in several different
quarters and were made sensible that a conflict was raging in the town

dios cried one the conspirators are upon us let us back to the
hall and defend ourselves

my life upon it said gaspar the conspirators will not stir till
villafana opens his lips to them heaven rest his soul hark these
are the yells of indians

on friends exclaimed cortes perceiving the garden full of soldiers
rushing from various parts of the palace as if to seek the fray this
is tlascalan work a knavery of xicotencal hah hark see tis an
assault upon the prison ho castilians ho christians cavaliers and
soldiers to arms haste to arms

while the soldiers collecting together at the well-known voice of the
captain-general began to rush with him towards the prison over which
besides hearing the shouting of the watchmen at the doors they beheld
three blazing arrows shot up into the air their alarm was directed to
another quarter by a violent cannonade from the squadron moored yet at
the entrance of the little river and looking that way they perceived
to their astonishment and fear no less than four of the brigantines
suddenly enveloped in flames

guzman and quinones cried cortes with instant determination to the
prison with what force ye can pick up on the way shoot all fugitives
as well as all assailants the rest follow me to the river for i would
mine arms should be burned rather than my vessels

by this time all the spaniards who were capable of bearing arms were
in the open air and following not less the shouts of cortes than the
crash of the falconets ran hastily towards the fleet which it was now
evident was furiously beset by multitudes of indians in canoes the
flash of the explosions and the flames bursting ruddily out from sails
and cordage revealed them clustering with impetuosity around the
devoted vessels whose crews it was equally apparent were making a
gallant resistance in this light the houses bordering upon the water
were seen covered with citizens looking on with a tranquillity which
showed that their share in the unexpected hostilities if indeed they
had any was entirely passive a more agreeable sight was disclosed to
cortes as he ran onwards in the appearance of many thousand
tlascalans rushing down the narrow meadows which bordered the canal
with such alacrity of speed and such furious cries of tlascala and
castilla as convinced him of their fidelity and affection

it is a mexican device after all he muttered a plan of the
ambassadors well done for thee villafana bold varlets these what
down with your demi-culverins and sakers orozca where is my good
cannonier juan catalan we will aid the vessels from the shore

the mariners however hotly engaged replied to the cries of their
friends with shouts of courage and redoubling their exertions they
succeeded not only in repelling the assailants whose obvious aim was to
fire the whole fleet from those ships not yet ignited but even in
extinguishing the flames in the less fortunate four in this they were
doubtless materially assisted by the condition of the planks and
timbers which being of green wood the flames would perhaps have
confined their ravages to the more combustible sails and cordage and
soon expired for want of fuel they weighed anchor also and taking
advantage of the gusts which still blew over the lake six of the
largest and strongest set sail and boldly plunged among the canoes
overturning and sinking many while the others receiving assistance
from the shore betook themselves to the little harbour dragging with
them their disabled consorts

in this manner it soon became evident that the danger in this quarter
was over and cortes directing that the position of the brigantines
should be strengthened by a temporary battery at the mouth of the river
returned to inspect the condition of the city in the neighbourhood of
the palace

the sounds of contention were over and one passing through the garden
and listening to the moaning of the winds through the trees could
scarce have believed that half an hour before it had been a scene of
such warlike bustle the bell rang no longer the drums trumpets and
arquebuses were silent and the sentinels paced to and fro at their
stations as if nothing unusual had happened the only sounds indeed
that now vexed the calm of the night were the occasional explosion of a
falconet from some brigantine afar among the shadows of the lake still
pursuing the retreating canoes the attack was perhaps unpremeditated
or perhaps its only object was to taunt and defy at all events it
was now over and in less than an hour from the time of the first alarm
the cry of all's-well could be heard through the different quarters of
the city

before this satisfactory conclusion of an evening so eventful the
captain-general was doomed to have his equanimity put to the proof by a
new trial a double line of guards surrounded the prison and guzman
quinones and gaspar olea were among them the last wringing his hands
and bewailing but the prison-door was open a thin smoke issued from
it and he could see at a glance that the only persons in the
apartment were a few soldiers dashing water over its partly consumed
floor under the very threshold lay the bodies of two soldiers
fearfully mangled another was writhing gasping and dying in the arms
of his comrades and a fourth severely wounded was narrating to
quinones the particulars of an assault made as he averred by ten
thousand devils or mexicans who sprang suddenly out of the earth
killed or dispersed the whole guard carried off the prisoner or burned
him he knew not which for he lay upon the ground counterfeiting
death and then setting fire to the building vanished quite as
suddenly as they came

were these men mexicans or tlascalans demanded cortes without
betraying any sign of feeling

the soldier started at the sound of his leader's voice and hastily
replied

in good faith señor i know not for i was somewhat overcome with
fear

and with wine sirrah exclaimed the general but it matters
not thou art too stupid to answer now have this fellow into the den
quinones and let him be brought to me to-morrow señor don francisco
we will walk to the palace

he put his arm into guzman's and dragging him to a little distance
where no beam of torch or cresset illuminated his visage exclaimed
eagerly

tell me the truth francisco has he perished by fire in the prison
or has he escaped me

señor replied guzman his star or his devil has helped him

why then the fiends seize thee and all false friends who plague me
cried cortes giving way to passion is it thus i am to be cheated

señor said guzman moderately but without fear i have mine own
cause of distress for my hand is horribly mangled and i have heard
that the bite of a dying man causes mortification so with this pain of
body and mind i may not speak good counsel or good defence when i
reached the prison it was empty and on fire had not your excellency
interfered with the execution this day 

ay there again muttered the captain-general mine own hand is made
to befool me it pulls out of the pit faster than my foot tramples in
hark thee guzman dost thou not think this young man is protected by
some special providence

i señor

why look you what could have carried him through the tribes of the
west to the south sea and back again a device of thy scheming
too and didst thou not see i was about to run him through in the
very act of mutinous resistance when a brute and insensate dog seized
my sword-blade in his mouth and now for the third time what but his
angel could have brought to his prison-door yonder infidels of
mexico his only friends i think

let your excellency question if this circumstance will not without
removing him from punishment give a still stronger excuse for it the
scribe visited him in the dungeon a paction with the enemy sealed by
the act of flight with them to their stronghold has confirmed him
thrice over a traitor

ay by heaven it is true said cortes smiting his hands together
and by and by i will take him out of his hiding-place and crown the
day of victory with a double triumph

and who can affirm quoth don francisco that the misbelievers have
not taken him for a sacrifice it is said the coronation of guatimozin
is deferred only until he can provide a castilian victim to do honour to
the ceremony by my faith señor there is a pleasant twitch in my
cheek ay in the scar of the rapier-wound at the very thought of this
retribution

now by heaven said cortes with an altered voice villain as he is
i cannot rejoice that such a dismal fate should befall him death
indeed but not a death of horror dost thou think this then can be
his doom alas poor youth had he but some one to lament him or to
avenge i were better satisfied with what i have done i swear to thee
francisco we are e'en as base knaves as himself for we have employed
our strength our cunning and our strength against a creature that is
utterly friendless alas i say for i remember me of the days of old
and surely i loved him once as my own soul

this outbreaking of feeling did not at all surprise guzman who had been
familiar from the beginning with the ebbings and flowings of don
hernan's hate and who had several times seen him when the destiny of
juan seemed already closed affected so much that he shed tears as he
did at the present moment but guzman was acquainted with a spell which
never failed to banish all compunction from the general's breast and he
did not scruple to employ it now

it is enough muttered cortes through his clenched teeth heaven and
my conscience acquit me and i will think of it no more

with these words he seemed to discharge from his mind all thoughts of
the youth so deeply detested and addressing himself to the task of
inspecting in person the condition of all assailable points in the city
betook himself at last and at the day-dawn to his repose

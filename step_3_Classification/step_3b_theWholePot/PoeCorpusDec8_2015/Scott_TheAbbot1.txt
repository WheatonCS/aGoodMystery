i admit that my retrenchments have been
numerous and leave gaps in the story
which in your original manuscript would
have run well nigh to a fourth volume as
my printer assures me i am sensible besides
that in consequence the liberty 
curtailment you have allowed m e some parts
 the story have been huddled up without
the necessary details but after all it is
better that the travellers should have to step
over a drain than to wade through a morass
 that the reader should have to suppose
what may easily be inferred than be
obliged to creep through pages dull explanation
i have struck out for example
the whole machinery the white lady
and the poetry by which it is so ably supported
in the original manuscript but
you must allow that the public taste gives
little encouragement to those legendary superstitions
which formed the delight alternately
and the terror our predecessors
in like manner much is omitted illustrative
 the impulse enthusiasm in favour
introductory epistle ill
 the ancient religion in mother magdalen
and the abbot but we do not feel deep
sympathy at this period with what was
once the most powerful and animating principle
in europe with the exception that
 the reformation by which it was successfully
opposed
you rightly observe that these retrenchments
have rendered the title no longer applicable
to the subject and that some other
would have been more suitable to the work
in its present state than that the abbot
who made so much greater figure in the
original and for whom your friend the benedictine
seems to have inspired you with
a sympathetic respect i must plead guilty
to this accusation observing at the same
time in manner extenuation that though
the objection might have been easily removed
by giving a new title to the work
yet in doing so i should have destroyed
the necessary cohesion between the present
history and its predecessor the ivio
mastery which i was unwilling to do as
 introductory epistle
the period and several the personages
were the same
after all my good friend it is little
consequence what the work is called or on
what interest it tmns providing it catches
the public attention for the quality the
wine could we but ensure it may according
to the old proverb render the bush unnecessary
or little consequence
 congratulate you upon your having

x he time which passes over our heads so
imperceptibly makes the same gradual
change in habits manners and character
as in personal appearance at the revolution
 every five years we find ourselves
another and yet the same there is a
change views and no less the light in
 the abbot
which we regard them a change motives
as well as actions nearly twice that
space had glided away over the head 
halbert glendinning and his lady betwixt
the conclusion that narrative in which
they played a distinguished part and the
commencement the present
two circumstances only had embittered
their union which was otherwise as happy
as mutual affection could render it the
first these was indeed the common calamity
 scotland being the distracted state
 that unhappy country where every man's
sword was directed against his neighbour's
bosom glendinning had proved what murray
expected him a steady friend strong
in battle and wise in counsel adhering to
him from motives gratitude in situations
where by his own unblessed will he would
either have stood neuter or have joined
the opposite party hence when danger
was near and it was seldom far distant sir
halbert glendinning for he now bore the
rank knighthood was perpetually sumthe
abbot 
money to attend his patron on distant expeditions
or on perilous enterprizes or to
assist him with his counsel in the doubtful
intrigues a half barbarous court he was
thus frequently and for a long space absent
from his castle and from his lady and to
this ground regret we must add that
their union had produced no children to
occupy the attention the lady 
while she was thus deprived her
husband's domestic society
on such occasions she lived almost entirely
secluded from the world within the
walls her paternal mansion visiting
amongst neighbours was a matter entirely
out the question unless on occasion 
solemn festival and then it was chiefly
confined to near kindred these the
lady avenel had none who survived
and the dames the neighbouring barons
affected to regard her less as the heiress 
the house avenel than as the wife a
peasant the son a churchvassal raised
 the abbot
up to mushroom eminence by the capricious
favour murray
this pride ancestry which rankled in
the bosom the more ancient gentry was
more openly expressed by their ladies and
was moreover embittered not a little by
the political feuds the time for most 
the southron chiefs were friends to the authority
 the queen and very jealous 
the power murray the castle 
was therefore on all these accounts as
melancholy and solitary a residence for its
lady as could well be imagined still it
had the essential recommendation great
security the reader knows that the fortress
was built upon an islet in a small
lake and was only accessible by a causeway
intersected by a double ditch defended
by two drawbridges so that without artillery
it might in these days be considered
as impregnable it was only necessary
therefore to secure against surprise and
the service six able men within the casthe
abbot 
tie was sufficient for that purpose if
more serious danger threatened an ample
garrison was supplied by the male inhabitants
 a little hamlet which under the
auspices halbert glendinning had arisen
on a small piece level ground betwixt
the lake and the hill nearly adjoining
to the spot where the causeway joined the
mainland the lord avenel had found
it an easy matter to get inhabitants as he
was not only a kind and beneficent overlord
but well qualified both by his experience
in armes his high character for wisdom
and integrity and his favour with the powerful
earl murray to protect and defend
those who dwelt under his banner in leaving
his castle for any length time he
had therefore the consolation to reflect
that this village afforded on the slightest
notice a band thirty stout men which
was more than sufficient for its defence 
while the families the villagers as was
usual on such occasions fled to the recesses
 the mountains drove their cattle to the
 the abbot
same places shelter and left the enemy
to work their will on their miserable cottages

one guest only resided generally if not
constantly at the castle avenel this
was henry warden who now felt himself
less able to the stormy task imposed on the
reforming clergy and having by his zeal
given personal offence to many the leading
nobles and chiefs did not consider himself
as perfectly safe unless when within
the walls the strong mansion some assured
friend he ceased not however to
serve his cause as eagerly with his pen ashe
had formerly done with his tongue and
had engaged in a furious and acrimonious
contest concerning the sacrifice the
mass as it was termed with the abbot
eustatius formerly the subprior 
answers replies duchies trophies
quadruple followed thick upon each
other and displayed as is not unusual in
controversy fully as much zeal as christian
charity the disputation very soon bethe
abbot 
came as celebrated as that john knox
and the abbot corseraguel raged nearly
as fiercely and fraught i know the pieces
to which it gave rise may be as precious in
the eyes bibliographers but the engrossing
nature his occupation rendered
the theologian not the most interesting
companion for a solitary female and his
grave stern and absorbed deportment
which seldom shewed any interest except
in that which concerned his religious profession
made his presence rather add to
than diminish the gloom which hung over
the castle avenel to superintend the
tasks her numerous female domestics
was the principal part the lady's daily
employment her spindle and distaff her
bible and a solitary walk upon the battlements
 the castle or upon the causeway
or occasionally but more seldom upon the
banks the little lake consumed the rest
 th day but so great was the insecurity
 the period that when she ventured
a 
 the abbot
to extend her walk beyond the hamlet the
warder on the watchtower was directed to
keep a sharp outlook in every direction
and four or five men held themselves in
readiness to mount and sally forth from
the village at the slightest appearance 
alarm
thus stood affairs at the castle when
after an absence several weeks the
knight avenel which was now the title
most frequently given to sir halbert glendining
was daily expected to return home
day after day however passed away and
he returned not letters in those days were
rarely written and the knight must have
resorted to a secretary to express his intentions
in that manner besides intercourse
 all kinds was precarious and unsafe and
no man cared to give any public intimation
 the time and direction a journey since
it was always likely he might in that case
meet with more enemies than friends upon
the road the precise day therefore 
the abbot 
sir halbert's return was not fixed but that
which his lady's fond expectation had calculated
upon in her own mind was long
since passed and hope delayed began to
make the heart sick
it was upon the evening a sultry summer's
day when the sun was half sunk behind
the distant western mountains lauderdale
that the lady took her solitary
walk on the battlements a range 
buildings which formed the front the
castle where a flat roof flagstones presented
a broad and convenient promenade
the level surface the lake undisturbed
except by the occasional dipping a tealduck
or coot was gilded with the beams
 the setting luminary and reflected as if
in a golden mirror the hills amongst which
it lay embosomed the scene otherwise
so lonely was occasionally enlivened by
the voices the children in the village
which softened by distance reached the
ear the lady in her solitary walk or by
the distant call the herdsman as he
 the abbot
guided his cattle from the glen in which
they had pastured all day to place them
in greater security for the night in the
immediate vicinity the village the
deep lowing the cows seemed to demand
the attendance the milkmaidens
who singing shrilly and merrily strolled
forth each with her pail on her head to attend
to the duty the evening the lady
 avenel looked and listened the sounds
which she heard reminded her former
days when her most important employment
as well as her greatest delight was
to assist dame glendinning and tibi racket
in milking the cows at glendearg the
thought was fraught with melancholy
c why was i not she said the peasant
girl which in all men's eyes i seemed
to be halbert and i had then spent our
life peacefully in his native glen undisturbed
by the phantoms either fear or
 ambition his greatest pride had then
been to shew the fairest herd in the hali
dome his greatest danger to repel some
the abbot 
pilfering snatcher from the border and
the utmost distance which would have divided
us would have been the chase 
some outlying deer but alas what avails
the blood which halbert has shed and the
dangers which he encounters to support a
name and rank dear to him because he has
it from me but which we shall never transmit
to our posterity with me the name
 avenel must expire
she sighed as these reflections arose and
looking towards the shore the lake her
eye was attracted by a groupe children
 various ages assembled to see a little
ship constructed by some village artist perform
its first voyage on the water it was
launched amid the shouts tiny voices and
the clapping little hands and shot bravely
forth on its voyage with a favouring
wind which promised to carry it to the
other side the lake some the bigger
boys ran round to receive and secure it on
the farther shore trying their speed against
each other as they sprang like young fawns
j
 the abbot
along the shingly verge the lake the
rest for whom such a journey seemed too
arduous remained watching the motions 
the fairy vessel from the spot where it had
been launched the sight their sports
pressed on the mind the childless lady
 avenel
 why are none these prattlers mine 
she continued pursuing the tenor her
melancholy reflections their parents can
scarce find them in the coarsest food and
i who could nurse them in plenty i am
doomed never to hear a child call me mother

the thought sunk on her heart with a
bitterness which resembled envy so deeply
is the desire offspring implanted in the
female breast she pressed her hands together
as if she was wringing them in the
extremity her desolate feeling as one
whom heaven had written childless a
large staghound the greyhound species
approached at this moment and attracted
perhaps by the gesture licked her hands
the abbot 
and pressed his large head against them
he obtained the desired caress in return
but still the sad impression remained
wolf she said as if the animal could
have understood her complaints thou art
a noble and beautiful animal but alas i the
love and affection that i long to bestow is
 a quality higher than can fall to thy
share though i love thee much
and as if she were apologizing to wolf
for withholding from him any part her
regard she caressed his proud head and
crest while looking in her eyes he seemed
to ask her what she wanted or what he
could do to shew his attachment at this
moment a shriek distress was heard on
the shore from the playful groupe which
had been lately so jovial the lady looked
and saw the cause with great agony
the little ship the object the children's
delighted attention had stuck among
some tufts the plant which bears the laterally
that marked a little shoal in the
lake about an arrowflight from the shore
 the abbot
a hardy little boy who had taken the
lead in the race round the margin the
lake did not hesitate a moment to strip off
his wyliecoats plunge into the water and
swim towards the object their common
solicitude the first movement the lady
was to call for help but she observed that
the boy swam strongly and fearlessly and
as she saw that one or two villagers who
were distant spectators the incident
seemed to give themselves no uneasiness
on his account she supposed that he was
accustomed to the exercise and that there
was no danger but whether in swimming
the boy had struck his breast against a
sunken rock or whether he was suddenly
taken with the cramp or whether he had
overcalculated his own strength it so happened
that when he had disembarrassed
the little plaything from the flags in which
it was entangled and sent it forward on its
course he had scarce swam a few yards in
his way to the shore than he raised himself
suddenly from the water and screamed
the abbot 
aloud clapping his hands at the same time
with an expression fear and pain
the lady avenel instantly taking
the alarm called hastily to the attendants
to get the boat ready but this was an
affair some time the only boat permitted
to be used on the lake was moored
within the second cut which intersected the
canal and it was several minutes ere it could
be unmoored and got under way meantime
the lady avenel with agonizing
anxiety saw that the efforts which the poor
boy made to keep himself afloat were now
exchanged for a faint struggling which
would soon have been over but for aid
equally prompt and unhoped for wolf
who like some that large species 
a practised waterdog had marked
the object her anxiety and quitting
his mistress's side had sought the nearest
point from which he could with safety plunge
into the lake with the wonderful instinct
which these noble animals have so often displayed
in the like circumstances he swam
straight to the spot where his assistance was
 the abbot
so much wanted and seizing the child's 
in his mouth he not only kept him
afloat but towed him towards the causeway
the boat having put off with a couple
 men met the dog halfway and relieved
him his burthen they landed on the
causeway close by the entrance to the castle
with their yet lifeless burthen and were
met at the entrance the gate by the lady
 avenel attended by one or two her
maidens eagerly waiting to administer assistance
to the sufferer
he was borne into the castle deposited
upon a bed and every mode recovery resorted
to which the knowledge the times
and the skill henry warden who professed
some medical knowledge could dictate
for some time it was all in vain
and the lady watched with unspeakable
earnestness the pallid countenance the
beautiful child he seemed about ten years
old his dress was the meanest sort but
his long curled hair and the noble cast 
his features partook not that poverty
the abbor 
 appearance the proudest noble in scotland
might have been yet prouder could he
have called that child his heir while with
breathless anxiety the lady avenel gazed
on his wellformed and expressive features
a slight shade colour returned gradually
to the cheek suspended animation
became restored by degrees the child sighdeeply
opened his eyes which to the human
countenance produces the effect 
light upon the natural landscape stretched
his arms towards the lady and muttered
the word mother that epithet all
others which is dearest to the female ear
god madam said the preacher has
restored the child to your wishes it must
be yours so to bring him up that he may
not one day wish that he had perished in his
innocence
it shall be my charge said the lady 
and again throwing her arms around the
boy she overwhelmed him with kisses and
caresses so much was she agitated by the
terror arising from the danger in which he
 the abbot
had been just placed and by joy at his unexpected
deliverance
 eut you are not my mother said the
boy collecting his recollection and endeavouring
though faintly to escape from the
caresses the lady avenel you are
not my mother alas i have no mother 
only i have dreamt that i had one
i will read the dream for you my love
answered the lady avenel j and i will
be myself your mother surely god has
heard my wishes and in his own marvellous
manner hath sent me an object on which
my affections may expand themselves she
looked towards warden as she spoke the
preacher hesitated what he should reply
to a burst passionate feeling which perhaps
seemed to him more enthusiastic than
the occasion demanded in the meanwhile
the large staghound wolf which dropping
wet as he was had followed his mistress
into the apartment and had sate by
the bedside a patient and quiet spectator
 all the means used for resuscitation 
the abbot 
the being whom he had preserved now became
impatient remaining any longer
unnoticed and began to whine and fawn
upon the lady with his great rough paws
 yes she said good wolf and you
shall be remembered also for your day's
work and i will think the more you for
having preserved the life a creature so
beautiful
but wolf was not quite satisfied with the
share attention which he thus attracted 
he persisted in whining and pawing upon
his mistress his caresses being rendered still
more troublesome by his long shaggy hair
being so much and thoroughly wetted till
she desired one the domestics with whom
he was familiar to call the animal out the
apartment wolf resisted every invitation
to this purpose until his mistress positively
commanded him to begone in an angry
tone whenturningtowardsthebedon which
the boy still lay half awake to sensation
half drowned in the meanders a fluctuating
delirium he uttered a deep and savage
 the abbot
growl curled up his nose and lips shewing
his full range white and sharpened teeth
which might have matched those an actual
wolf and then turning round sullenly
followed the domestic out the apartment

sit is singular said the lady addressing
warden the animal is not only so goodnatured
to all but so particularly fond 
children what can ail him at the little fellow
whose life he has saved 
dogs replied the preacher are but
too like the human race in their foibles
though their instinct be less erring than the
reason poor mortal man when relying
upon his own unassisted powers jealousy
my good lady is a passion not unknown to
them and they often evince it not only
with respect to the preferences which they
see given by their masters to individuals 
their own species but even when their rivals
are children you have caressed that
child much and eagerly and the dog considers
himself as a discarded favourite
the abbot 
it is a strange instinct j said the lady
 and from the gravity with which you
mention it my reverend friend i would
almost say that you supposed this singular
jealousy my favourite wolf was not only
wellfounded but justifiable but perhaps
you speak in jest
 i seldom jest answered the preacher
 life was not lent to us to be expended in
that idle mirth which resembles the crackling
 thorns under the pot i would only
have you derive if it so please you this
lesson from what i have said that the best
 our feelings when indulged to excess
may give pain to others there is but one
in which we may indulge to the utmost
limit vehemence which our bosom is
capable secure that excess cannot exist
in the greatest intensity to which it can be
excited i mean the love our maker
 surely said the lady avenel weare
commanded by the same authority to
love our neighbour 
 the abbot
 ay madam said warden but our
love to god is to be unbounded we are to
love him with our whole heart our whole
soul and our whole strength the love
which the precept commands us to bear to
our neighbour has affixed to it a direct limit
and qualification we are to love our
neighbour as ourself as it is elsewhere explained
by the great commandment that
we do unto him as we would that he did
unto us here there is a limit and a bound
even to the most praiseworthy our affections
so far as they are turned upon
sublunary and terrestrial objects we are
to render to our neighbour whatever be
his rank or degree that corresponding portion
 affection with which we could rationally
expect we should ourselves be regarded
by those standing in the same degree
 relation to us hence neither
husband nor wife neither son nor daughter
neither friend nor relation are lawfully to
be made the objects our idolatry the
the abbot 
lord our god is a jealous god and will
not endure that we bestow on the creature
that extremity devotion which he who
made us demands as his own share i say
to you lady that even in the fairest and
purest and most honourable feelings our
nature there is that original taint sin
which ought to make us pause and hesitate
ere we indulge them to excess 
i understand not this reverend sir
said the lady nor do i guess what i can
have now said or done to draw down on
me an admonition which has something a
taste reproof
lady said warden i crave your
pardon if i have urged aught beyond the
limits my duty but consider whether
in the sacred promise to be not only a protectress
but a mother to this poor child
your purpose may meet the wishes the
noble knight your husband the fondness
which you have lavished on the unfortunate
and i own most lovely child
vol i b
 the abbot
has met something like a reproof in the
bearing your household dog displease
not your noble husband men as well as
animals are jealous the affections those
they love
this is too much reverend sir said
theladyof avenel greatly offended you
have been long our guest and have received
from the knight avenel and myself
that honour and regard which your character
and profession so justly demand
eut i am yet to learn that i have at anytime
authorized your interference in our
family arrangements or placed you as a
judge our conduct towards each other
i pray this may be forborne in future
 lady replied the preacher with the
boldness peculiar to the clergy his persuasion
at that time when you weary 
my admonitions when i see that my services
are no longer acceptable to you and
the noble knight your husband i shall
know that my master wills me no longer
to abide here j and praying for a continuthe

ance his best blessings on your family i
will then were the season the depth 
winter and the hour midnight walk out on

waste mountains as lonely and unaided
though far more helpless than when first
met your husband in the valley glendear
but while i remain here i will not
see you err from the true path no not an
hair'sbreadth without making the old man's
voice and remonstrance heard
 nay but said the lady who both
loved and respected the good man though
sometimes a little offended at what she
conceived to be an exuberant degree 
zeal we will not part this way my good
friend women are quick and hasty in
their feelings but believe me my wishes
and my purposes towards this child are
such as both my husband and you will approve
 the clergyman bowed and retreated
to his own apartment

when warden had left the apartment the
lady avenel gave way to the feelings 
tenderness which the sight the boy his
sudden danger and his recent escape had
inspired and no longer awed by the sternness
as she deemed it the preacher heaped
with caresses the lovely and interesting
child he was now in some measure recovered
from the consequences his accident
and received passively though not
without wonder the tokens kindness
with which he was thus loaded the face
the abbot 
 the lady was strange to him and her
dress different and far more sumptuous than
any he remembered but the boy was naturally
 an undaunted temper and indeed
children are generally acute physiognomists
and not only pleased by that which is
beautiful in itself but peculiarly acute in
distinguishing and replying to the attentions
 those who really love them if
they see a person in company though a
perfect stranger who is by nature fond 
children the little imps seem to discover it
by a sort freemasonry while the awkward
attempts those who make advances
to them for the purpose recommending
themselves to the parents usually fail in
attracting their reciprocal attention the
little boy therefore appeared in some degree
sensible the lady's caresses and it
was with difficulty she withdrew herself
from his pillow to afford him leisure for
necessary repose
to whom belongs our little rescued varro
the abbot
let was the first question which the lady
 avenel put to her handmaiden liiias
when they had retired to the hall
to an old woman in the hamlet said
liiias who is even now come so far as
the porter's lodge to enquire concerning
his safety is it your pleasure that she be
admitted 
is it my pleasure said the lady 
avenel echoing the question with a strong
accent displeasure and surprise can
you make any doubt it what woman
but must pity the agony the mother
whose heart is throbbing for the safety 
a child so lovely
 nay but madam said liiias this
woman is too old to be the mother the
child i rather think she must be his grand
mother or some more distant relation
be she who she will liiias replied
the lady she must have a sore heart
while the safety a creature so lovely is
uncertain go instantly and bring her hithe
abbot 
ther besides i would willingly learn something
concerning his birth
lilias left the hall and presently afterwards
returned ushering in a tall female
very poorly dressed yet with more pretension
to decency and cleanliness than was
usually combined with such coarse garments
the lady avenel knew her figure
the instant she presented herself it
was the fashion the family that upon
every sabbath and on two evenings in the
week besides henry warden preached or
lectured in the chapel the castle the
extension the protestant faith was upon
principle as well as in good policy a primary
object with the knight avenel
the inhabitants the village were therefore
invited to attend upon the instructions
 henry warden and many them were
speedily won to the doctrine which their
master and protector approved these sermons
homilies and lectures had made a
great impression on the mind the abbot
 the abbot
eustace or eustatius and were a sufficient
spur to the severity and sharpness his
controversy with his old fellow collegiate 
and he more than once threatened to levy
his vassals and assail and level with the earth
that strong hold heresy the castle 
but notwithstanding his impotent resentment
and notwithstanding also the disinclination
 the country to favour the new
religion henry warden proceeded without
remission in his labours and made weekly
converts from the faith rome to that 
the reformed church amongst those who
gave most earnest and constant attendance
on his ministry was the aged woman whose
form too tall and otherwise too remarkable
to be forgotten the lady had late remarked
frequently as being conspicuous
amongst the little audience she had indeed
more than once desired to know who
that tall statelylooking woman was whose
appearance was so much above the poverty
 her vestments but the reply had althe
abbot 
ways been that she was an english woman
who was tarrying for a season at the hamlet
and that no one knew more concerning
her she now asked her after her name
and birth
magdalen graeme is my name said the
woman i come the grammes head
in nicolforest a people ancient
blood
and what make you continued the
lady so far distant from your home 
i have no home said magdalen grime
it was burnt by your borderriders my
husband and my son were slain there is
not a drop's blood left in the veins anyone
which is kin to mine
 that is no uncommon fate in these wild
times and in this unsettled land said the
lady the english hands have been as
deeply dyed in our blood as ever those 
scotsmen have been in yours
you have right to say it lady answered
magdalen graeme for men tell
 a time when this castle was not strong
b 
 the abbot
enough to save your father's life or to afford
your mother and her infant a place 
refuge and why ask ye me then wherefore
i dwell not in mine own home and
with my own people 
it was indeed an idle question where
misery so often makes wanderers butchered
take refuge in a hostile country 
my neighbours were popish and massinger
said the old woman it has
pleased heaven to give me a clearer sight
 the gospel and i have tarried here to
enjoy the ministry that worthy man henry
warden who to the praise and comfort
 many teacheth the evangel in truth and
in sincerity
 are you poor again demanded the
lady avenel
you hear me ask alms no one answered
the englishwoman
here there was a pause the manner 
the woman was if not disrespectful at least
much less than gracious and she appeared
to give no encouragement to farther comthe
abbot s
medication the lady avenel renewed
the conversation on a different topic
you have heard the danger in which
your boy has been placed 
 i have lady and how by an especial
providence he was rescued from death may
heaven make him thankful and me 
 what relation do you bear to him 
 i am his grandmother lady if it so
please you the only relation he hath left
upon earth to take charge him
the burthen his maintenance must
necessarily be grievous to you in your deserted
situation pursued the lady
i have complained it to no one
said magdalen graeme with the same unmoved
dry and unconcerned tone voice
in which she had answered all the former
questions
 if said the lady avenel your
grandchild could be received into a noble
family would it not advantage both him
and you 
 the abbot
 received into a noble family said
the old woman drawing herself up and
bending her brows until her forehead
was wrinkled into a frown unusual severity
 and for what purpose i pray
you to be my lady's page or my lord's
jackman to eat broken victuals and contend
with other menials for the remnants
 the master's meal would you have
him to fan the flies from my lady's face
while she sleeps to carry her train while
she walks to hand her trencher when she
feeds to ride before her on horseback to
valk after her on foot to sing when she
lists and to be silent when she bids a very
weathercock which though furnished in
appearance with wings and plumage cannot
soar into the air cannot fly from the
spot where it is perched but receives all its
impulses and performs all its revolutions
obedient to the changeful breath a vain
woman when the eagle helvellyn
perches on the tower lanercost and
turns and changes to shew how the wind
the abbor 
sits roland grasme shall be what you would
make him
the woman spoke with a rapidity and
vehemence which seemed to have in it a
touch insanity and a sudden sense the
danger to which the child must necessarily
be exposed in the charge such a keeper
increased the lady's desire to keep him in
the castle if possible
 you mistake me dame she said addressing
the old woman in a soothing manner
 i do not wish your boy to be in attendance
on myself but upon the good
knight my husband were he himself the
son a belted earl he could not better
be trained to arms and all that befits a gentleman
than by the instructions and discipline
 sir halbert glendinning
 ay answered the old woman in the
same style bitter irony i know the
wages that service a curse when the
corslet is not sufficiently brightened a
blow when the girth is not tightly drawn
to be beaten because the hounds are at fault
 the abbot
to be reviled because the foray is unsuccessful
 to stain his hands for the master's
bidding in the blood alike beast and
 man to be a butcher harmless deer
a murderer and deface god's own image
not at his own pleasure but at that his
lord to live a brawling ruffian and a common
stabber exposed to heat to cold to
want food to all the privations an anchoret
not for the love god but for
the service satan to die by the gibbet
or in some obscure skirmish to sleep out
his life in carnal security and to awake in
the eternal fire which is never quenched
nay said the lady avenel but
to such unhallowed course life your
grandson will not be here exposed my
husband is just and kind to those who live
under his banner and you yourself well
know that youth have here a strict as well
as a good preceptor in the person our
chaplain
the old woman appeared to pause
you have named she said the onthe
abbot 
ly circumstance which can move me i
must soon onward the vision has said it 
i must not tarry in the same spot i must
on i must on it is my weird swear then
that you will protect the boy as if he were
your own until i return hither and claim
him and i will consent for a space to part
with him but especially swear he shall
not lack the instruction the godly man
who hath placed the gospeltruth high
above these idolatrous shavings the
monks and friars
be satisfied dame said the lady 
avenel j the boy shall have as much care
as if he were born my own blood will
you see him now 
no answered the old woman sternly
 to part is enough i go forth on
my own mission i will not soften my
heart by useless tears and failings as one
that is not called to a duty
will you not accept something to
aid you in your pilgrimage said the lady
 avenel putting into her hand two
 the abbot
crowns the sun the old woman flung
them down on the table
 am i the race cain she said
 proud lady that you offer me gold in
exchange for my own flesh and blood 
 i had no such meaning said the lady
gently nor am i the proud woman you
term me alas my own fortunes might
have taught me humility even had it not
been born with me
the old woman seemed somewhat to
relax her tone severity
you are gentle blood she said
 else we had not parleyed thus long together
 you are gentle blood and to
such she added drawing up her tall form
as she spoke pride is as graceful as is
the plume upon the bonnet but for these
pieces gold lady you must needs resume
them i need not money i am
well provided and i may not care for myself
nor think how or by whom i shall be
sustained farewell and keep your word
the abbot 
cause your gates to be opened and your
bridges to be lowered i will set forward
this very night when i come again i
will demand from you a strict account for
 have left with you the jewel my life i
sleep will visit me but in snatches food
will not refresh me rest will not restore my
strength until i see roland grseme once
more farewell
make your obeisance dame said
lilias to magdalen graeme as she retired
make your obeisance to her ladyship
and thank her for her goodness as is but
fitting and right
the old woman turned short round on
the officious waitingmaid let her make
her obeisance to me then and i will return
it why should i bend to her is it
because her kirtle is silk and mine 
blue lockers go to my lady's waitingwoman
know that the rank the man
rates that the wife and that she who
marries a churl's son were she a king's
daughter is but a peasant's bride
 the abbot
lilias was about to reply in great indignation
but her mistress imposed silence on
her and commanded that the old woman
should be safely conducted to the mainland

 conduct her safe exclaimed the incensed
waitingwoman while magdalen
graeme left the apartment i say duck
her in the loch and then we will see
whether she is witch or not as every body in
the village lochside will say and swear
i marvel your ladyship could bear so long
with her insolence but the commands
 the lady were obeyed and the old dame
dismissed from the castle was committed
to her fortune she kept her word and
did not long abide in that place leaving
the hamlet on the very night succeeding
the interview and wandering no one
asked whither the lady avenel enquired
under what circumstances she had
appeared among them but could only learn
that she was believed to be the widow
 some man consequence among the
the abbot 
grammes who then inhabited the debateable
land a name given to a certain portion
 territory which was the frequent
subject dispute betwixt scotland and
england that she had suffered great wrong
in some the frequent forays by which
that unfortunate district was wasted and
had been driven from her dwelling place
she had arrived in the hamlet no one knew
for what purpose and was held by some to
be a witch by others a catholic devotee
her language was mysterious and her
manners repulsive and all that could be
collected from her conversation seemed to
imply that she was under the influence
either a spell or a vow there was
no saying which since she talked as one
who acted under a powerful and external
agency
such were the particulars which the
lady's enquiries were able to collect concerning
magdalen graeme being far too
meagre to authorise any satisfactory deduction
in truth the miseries the time
 the abbot
and the various turns fate incidental to
a frontier country were perpetually chasing
from their habitations those who had not
the means defence or protection these
wanderers in the land were too often seen
to excite much attention or sympathy
they received the cold relief which was
extorted by general feelings humanity j a
little excited in some breasts and perhaps
rather chilled in others by the recollection
that they who gave the charity today might
themselves want it tomorrow magdalen
graeme therefore came and departed like
a shadow from the neighbourhood 
castle
the boy whom providence as she thought
had thus strangely placed under her care
was at once established a favourite with
the lady the castle how could it be
otherwise he became the object those
affectionate feelings which finding formerly
no object on which to expand themselves
had encreased the gloom the
the abbot 
castle and embittered the solitude its
mistress to teach him as far as her skill
went to attend to his childish comforts to
watch his boyish sports became the lady's
favourite amusement in her circumstances
where the ear only heard the lowing
 the cattle from the distant hills or
the heavy step the warder as he walked
upon his post or the half envied laugh
 her maiden as she turned her wheel the
appearance the blooming and beautiful
boy gave an interest which can hardly be
conceived by those who live amid gayer
or busier scenes young roland was to
the lady avenel what the flower which
occupies the window some solitary captive
is to the poor wight by whom it is
nursed and cultivated something which
at once excited and repaid her care and in
giving the boy her affection she felt as it
were grateful to him for releasing her from
the state dull apathy in which she had
usually found herself during the absence 
sir halbert glendinning
 the abbot
but even the charms this blooming
favourite were unable to chase the recurring
apprehensions which arose from her
husband's delayed return soon after roland
graeme became a resident at the
castle a groom dispatched by sir albert
brought tidings that business importance
still delayed the knight at the
court holyrood the more distant period
which the messenger had assigned for
his master's arrival at length glided away
summer melted into autumn and autumn
was about to give place to winter and yet
he came not
the abbot 
chapter iii
the waning harvestmoon shone broad and bright
the warder's horn was heard at dead night
and while the folding portals wide were flung
with tramping hoofs the rocky pavement rung
leyden
and you too would be a soldier roland
said the lady avenel to her
young charge while seated on a stone
chair at one the battlements she
saw the boy attempt with a long stick to
mimic the motions the warder as he alternately
shouldered or ported or sloped
pike
yes lady said the boy for he was
now familiar and replied to her questions
with readiness and alacrity a soldier will
i be for there ne'er was gentleman but
who belled him with the brand
 the abbot
 thou a gentleman said lilias who
as usual was in attendance such a
gentleman as i would make a bean cod
with a rusty knife
nay chide him not lilias said the
lady avenel for beshrew me but i
think he comes gentle blood see how
it musters in his face at your injurious reproofs

had i my will madam answered lilies
 a good birchen wand should make
his colour muster to better purpose still
on my word lilias said the lady
one would think you had received harm
from the poor boy or is he so far on the
frosty side your favour because he enjoys
the sunny side mine 
over heavens forbode my lady answered
lilias i have lived too long
with gentles i praise my stars for it to
fight with either follies or fantasies whether
they elate to beast bird or boy
lilias was a favourite in her own class
a spoiled domestic who was often accusthe
abbot 
toned to take more license than her mistress
was at all times willing to encourage
but what did not please the lady 
she did not chuse to hear and thus it
was on the present occasion she resolved
to look more close and sharply after the boy
who had hitherto been committed chiefly
to the management lilias he must she
thought be born gentle blood it were
shame to think otherwise a form so noble
and features so fair the very wildness
in which he occasionally indulged his contempt
 danger and impatience restraint
had in them something noble assuredly
the child was born high rank such
was her conclusion and she acted upon it
accordingly the domestics around her
less jealous or less scrupulous than lilias
acted as servants usually do following the
bias and flattering for their own purposes
the humour the lady and the boy soon
took on him those airs superiority which
the sight habitual deference seldom fails
vol i c
 the abbot
to inspire it seemed in truth as if to
command were his natural sphere so easily
did he use himself to exact and receive
compliance with his humours the chaplain
indeed might have interposed to
check the air superiority which roland
greene so readily indulged and most probably
would have willingly rendered him
that favour but the necessity adjusting
with his brethren some disputed points 
church discipline had withdrawn him for
some time from the castle and detained
him in a distant part the kingdom
matters stood thus in the castle 
when a winded bugle sent its shrill
and prolonged notes from the shore the
lake and was replied to cheerily by the
signal the warder the lady 
knew the sounds her husband and
rushed to the window the apartment in
which she was sitting a band about
thirty spearmen with a pennon displayed
before them winded along the indented
shores the lake and approached the
the abbot 
causeway a single horseman rode at the
head the party his bright arms catching
a glance the october sun as he moved
steadily along even at that distance the
lady recognized the lofty plume bearing
the mingled colours her own liveries
blended with the hollybranch and the
firm seat and dignified demeanour the
rider joined to the stately motion the
darkbrown steed sufficiently announced
halbert glendinning
the lady's first thought was that rapturous
joy at her husband's return her second
was connected with a fear which had
sometimes intruded itself that he might
not altogether approve the peculiar distinction
with which she had treated her orphan
ward in this fear there was implied
a consciousness that the favour she had
shewn him was excessive for halbert glendining
was at least as gentle and indulgent
as he was firm and rational in the intercourse
 his household and to her in
 the abbot
particular his conduct had ever been most
affectionately tender
yet she did fear that on the present occasion
her conduct might incur sir albert's
censure and hastily resolving that
she would not mention the anecdote the
boy until the next day she ordered him to
be withdrawn from the apartment by lilies

 i will not go with lilias madam answered
the spoiled child who had more
than once carried his point by perseverance
and who like his betters delighted in the
exercise such authority i will not
go to lilias's gouty room i will stay and
see that brave warrior who comes riding so
gallantly along the drawbridge
 you must not stay roland said the
lady more positively than she usually spoke
to her little favourite
 i will reiterated the boy who had
already felt his consequence and the probable
chance success
the abbot 
you will roland answered the lady
what manner word is that i tell you
you must go
wil answered the forward boy is
a word for a man and must is no word fora
lady
you are saucy sirrah said the lady 
lilias take him with you instantly
i always thought said lilias smiling
as she seized the reluctant boy by the arm
that my young master must give place to
my old one
and you too are malapert mistress
said the lady j hath the moon changed
that ye all you thus forget yourselves 
lilias made no reply but led off the boy
who too proud to offer unavailing resistance
darted at his benefactress a glance
which intimated plainly how willingly he
would have defied her authority had he possessed
the power to make good his point
the lady avenel was vexed to find
how much this trifling circumstance had
discomposed her at the moment when she
 the abbot
ought naturally to have been entirely engrossed
by her husband's return but we
do not recover composure by the mere
feeling that agitation is mistimed the
glow displeasure had not left the lady's
cheek her ruffled deportment was not yet
entirely composed when her husband unhelmet
but still wearing the rest his
arms entered the apartment his appearance
banished the thoughts every thing
else she rushed to him clasped his ironsheathed
frame in her arms and kissed his
martial and manly face with an affection
which was at once evident and sincere
the warrior returned her embrace and her
caress with the same fondness for the time
which had passed since their union had diminished
its romantic ardour perhaps but
had rather increased its rational tenderness
and sir halbert glendinning's long and frequent
absences from his castle had prevented
affection from degenerating into indifference

when the first eager greetings were paid
the abbot 
and received the lady gazed fondly on her
husband's face as she remarked
 you are altered halbert you have ridden
hard and far today or you have been
ill
 i have been well mary answered the
knight passing well have i been and a
long ride is to me thou well knowest but a
thing constant custom those who are
born noble may slumber out their lives within
the walls their castles and manorhouses 
but he who hath achieved nobility by his
own deeds must ever be in the saddle to
shew that he merits his advancement
while he spoke thus the lady gazed fondly
on him as if endeavouring to read his
inmost soul for the tone in which he spoke
was that melancholy depression
sir halbert glendinning was the same
yet a different person from what he had appeared
in his early years the fiery freedom
 the aspiring youth had given place
to the steady and stern composure the
approved soldier and skilful politician
 ihe abbot
there were deep traces care on those
noble features over which each emotion
used formerly lo pass like light clouds
across a summer sky that sky was now
not perhaps clouded but still and grave
like that the sober autumn evening the
forehead was higher and more bare than in
early youth and the locks which still clustered
thick and dark on the warrior's head
were worn away at the temples not by age
but by the constant pressure the steel
cap or helmet his beard according to
the fashion the times grew short and
thick and was turned into mustachios on
the upper lip and peaked at the extremity
the cheek weatherbeaten and embroiled
had lost the glow youth but shewed
the vigorous complexion active and confirmed
manhood halbert glendinning was
in a word a knight to ride at a king's
right hand to bear his banner in war and
to be his counsellor in time peace for
his looks expressed the considerate firmness
which can resolve wisely and dare boldly
the abbot 
still over these noble features there now
spread an air dejection which perhaps
the owner was not conscious but
which did not escape the observation his
anxious and affectionate partner
 something has happened or is about
to happen said the lady avenel this
sadness sits not on your brow without cause
misfortune national or particular must
needs be at hand
 there is nothing new that i wot 
said halbert glendinning j but there is
little evil which can befall a kingdom
which may not be apprehended in this unhappy
and divided realm
 nay then said the lady i see there
hath really been some fatal work on foot
my lord murray has not so long detained
you at holyrood save that he wanted
your help in some weighty purpose
i have not been at holyrood mary
answered the knight j i have been several
weeks abroad
c 
 the abbot
abroad and sent me no word replied
the lady
what would the knowledge have availed
but to have rendered you unhappy my
love replied the knight your thoughts
would have converted the slightest breeze
that curled your own lake into a tempest
raging in the german ocean
and have you then really crossed the
sea said the lady to whom that idea
conveyed notions terror and wonder j
really left your own native land and
trodden distant shores where the scottish
tongue is unheard and unknown 
really and really said the knight
taking her hand in affectionate playfulness
i have done this marvellous deed have
rolled on the ocean for three days and
three nights with the deep green waves
dashing by the side my pillow and buta
thin plank to divide me from it
indeed my halbert said the lady
 that was a tempting divine province
abbot 
hence i never bade you unbuckle the
sword from your side or lay the lance from
your hand i never bade you sit when
your honour called to rise but are not
blade and spear dangerous enough to one
man's life and why would you trust rough
waves and raging seas 
we have in germany and in the low
countries as they are called answered
glendinning men who are united with
us in faith and with whom it is fitting we
should unite in alliance to some these
i was dispatched on business as important
as it was secret went in safety and i
returned in security there is more danger
to a man's life betwixt this and holyrood
than are in all the seas that wash the lowlands
 holland
and the country my halbert and
the people said the lady are they like
our kindly scots or what bearing have they
to strangers 
 they are a people mary strong in
their wealth which renders all other nato
the abbot
tions weak and weak in those arts war
by which other nations are strong
 i do not understand you said the
lady
the hollander and the fleming mary
pour forth their spirit in trade and not in
war their wealth purchases them the arms
 foreign soldiers by whose aid they defend
it they erect dykes on the sea shore
to protect the land which they have won
and they levy regiments the stubborn
sitters and hardy germans to protect the
treasures which they have amassed and
thus they are strong in their weakness for
the very wealth which tempts their masters
to despoil them arms strangers in their
behalf
the slothful hinds exclaimed mary
thinking and feeling like a scotswoman 
the period have they hands and fight
not for the land which bore them they
should be notched off at the elbow
nay that were but hard justice answered
her husband for their hands
the abbot 
serve their country though not in battle
like ours look at these barren hills mary
and at that deep winding vale by which the
cattle are even now returning from their
scanty browse the hand the industrious
fleming would cover these mountains
with wood and raise corn where we now
see a starved and scanty sward heath
and ling it grieves me mary when i
look on that land and think what benefit
it might receive from such men as i have
lately seen men who seek not the idle
fame derived from dead ancestors or the
bloody renown won in modern broils but
tread along the land as preservers and improvers
not as tyrants and destroyers
 these amendments would be but a
vain fancy my halbert answered the lady
 avenel the trees would be burned
by the english foemen ere they ceased to
be shrubs and the grain that you raised
would be gathered in by the first neighbour
that possessed more riders than follow your
train why should you repine at this the
 the abbot
fate that made you scotsman by birth gave
you head and heart and hand to uphold
the name as it must needs be upheld
 it gave ene no name to uphold said
halbert pacing the floor slowly my arm
has been foremost in every strife my voice
has been heard in every council nor have
the wisest rebuked me the crafty lexington
the deep and dark morton have
held secret council with me and grange
and lindsay have owned that in the field i
did the devoir a gallant knight but let
the emergence be passed when they need
my head and hand and they only know meas
son the obscure portioner glendear

this was a theme which the lady always
dreaded for the rank conferred on her husband
the favour in which he was held by
the powerful earl murray and the high
talents by which he vindicated his right to
that rank and that favour were qualities
which rather encreased than diminished the
envy which was harboured against sir halthe
abbot 
bert glendinning as a person originally 
inferior and obscure birth who had risen to
his present eminence solely by his personal
merit the natural firmness his mind
did not enable him to despise the ideal advantages
 a high pedigree which were
held in such universal esteem by all with
whom he conversed and so open are the
noblest minds to jealous inconsistencies
that there were moments in which he felt
mortified that his lady should possess those
advantages birth and high descent which
he himself did not enjoy and regretted that
his importance as the proprietor avenel
was qualified by his possessing it only as
the husband the heiress he was not so
unjust as to permit any unworthy feelings
to retain permanent possession his mind
but yet they recurred from time to time
and did not escape his lady's anxious observation

 had we been blessed with children
she was wont on such occasions to say to
herself had our blood been united in a
f the abbot

son who might have joined my advantages
 descent with my husband's personal
worth these painful and irksome reflections
had not disturbed our union even fora
moment but the existence such an
heir in idiom our affections as well as our
pretensions might have centered has been
denied to us
with such mutual feelings it cannot be
wondered at that the lady heard her husband
with pain verging towards this topic
 mutual discontent on the present as
on other similar occasions she endeavoured
to divert her husband's thoughts from
this painful channel
 how can you she said suffer yourself
to dwell upon thoughts which profit nothing
 have you indeed no name to uphold
 you the good and the brave the
wise in council and the strong in battle
have you not to support the reputation your
own deeds have won a reputation more honourable
than mere ancestry can supply 
good men love and honour you the wickthe
abbot 
ed fear and the turbulent obey you and is
it not necessary you should exert yourself
to ensure the endurance that love that
honour that wholesome fear and that necessary
obedience 
as she thus spoke the eye her husband
caught from her's courage and comfort
and it lightened as he took her hand
and replied 
the abbot 
grasme the prejudices wolf were easily
overcome and in process time the dog
slept with bran loath and the celebrated
hounds ancient days but mr warden
the chaplain lived and retained his dislike
to the youth that good man singleminded
and benevolent as he really was entertained
rather more than a reasonable idea 
the respect due to him as a minister and
exacted from the inhabitants the castle
more deference than the haughty young
page proud his mistress's favour and
petulant from youth and situation was at
all times willing to pay his bold and free
demeanour his attachment to rich dress
and decoration his inaptitude to receive
instruction and his hardening himself
against rebuke were circumstances which
induced the good old man with more
haste than charity to set the forward page
down as a vessel wrath and to presage
that the youth nursed that pride and
haughtiness spirit which goes before
ruin and destruction most the attends
the abbot
ants and followers sir halbert glendining
entertained the same charitable
thought but while roland was favoured
by their lady and endured by their lord
they saw no policy in making their opinions
public
koland grasme was sufficiently sensible
 the unpleasant situation in which he
stood but in the haughtiness his heart
he retorted upon the other domestics the
distant cold and sarcastic manner in which
they treated him assumed an air superiority
which compelled the most obstinate
to obedience and had the satisfaction to
be dreaded at least if he was heartily hated

the chaplain's marked dislike had the
effect recommending him to the attention
 sir halbert's brother edward who
now under the conventual appellation 
father ambrose continued to be one 
the few monks who with the abbot eustathius
were still permitted to linger in the
cloisters at kennaquhair respect to sir
the abbot 
halbert had prevented their being altogether
driven out the abbey though their
order was now in a great measure suppressed
and they were interdicted the public
exercise their ritual and only allowed
for their support a small pension out
 their once splendid revenues father
ambrose thus situated was an occasional
though very rare visitant at the castle 
avenel and was at such times observed to
pay particular attention to roland graeme
who seemed to return it with more depth
 feeling than consisted with his usual habits

thus situated years glided on during
which the knight avenel continued to
act a frequent and important part in the
convulsions his distracted country while
young graeme anticipated both in wishes
and in personal accomplishments the age
which should enable him to emerge from
the obscurity his present situation
d 
 the abbot
chapter 
amid their cups that freely flow'd
their revelry and mirth
a youthful lord taxed valentine
with hase and doubtful birth
valentine and arson
when roland greene was a youth about
seventeen years age he chanced one
summer morning to descend to the mew in
which sir halbert glendinning kept his
hawks in order to superintend the training
 an eyass or young hawk which he himself
at the imminent risk neck and
limbs had taken from a celebrated eyrie
in the neighbourhood called gledscraig
as he was by no means satisfied with the
attention which had been bestowed on his
favourite bird he was not slack in testifythe
abbot 
ing his displeasure to the falconer's lad
whose duty it was to have attended upon
it
what ho sir knave exclaimed roland
 is it thus you feed the eyasse with
unwashed meat as if you were gorging the
foul branches a worthless hodie crow
by the mass and thou hast neglected its
castings also for these two days thinks
thou i ventured my neck to bring the bird
down from the craig that thou shouldst
spoil him by thy neglect and to add
force to his remonstrances he conferred a
cuff or two on the negligent attendant 
the hawks who shouting rather louder than
was necessary under all the circumstances
brought the master falconer to his assistance

adam woodcock the falconer avenet
was an englishman by birth but so
long in the service glendinning that he
had lost his national attachment in that 
which he had formed to his master he
 the abbot
was a favourite in his department jealous
and conceited his skill as masters the
game usually are for the rest his character
he was a jester and a parcel poet qualities
which by no means abated his natural
conceit a jolly fellow who loved a flagon
 ale better than a long sermon a stout
man his hands when need required true
to his master and a little presuming on his
interest with him
adam woodcock such as we have described
him by no means relished the freedom
used by young grime in chastising
his assistant hey hey my lady's page
said he stepping between his own boy and
roland fair and softly an it like your
gilt jacket hands off is fair play if my
boy has done amiss i can beat him myself
and then you may keep your hands soft
 i will beat him and thee too answered
roland without hesitation an you
look not better after your business see
how the bird is cast away between you
the abbot 
i found the careless lurdane feeding him
with unwashed flesh and she an eyass
 go to said the falconer thou art
but an eyass thyself child roland what
knowest thou feeding i say that the
eyass should have her meat unwashed until
she becomes a branches twere the ready
way to give her the trounce to wash her
meat sooner and so knows every one who
knows a gled from a falcon
it is thine own laziness thou false
english blood that doest nothing but drink
and sleep retorted the page and leaves
that lither lad to do the work that he minds
as little as thou
 and am i so idle then said the falconer
 that have three cast hawks to
look after at perch and mew and to fly
them in the field to boot and is my lady's
page so busy a man that he must take me
up short and am i a false english blood 
there is a difference amongst authorities how long the
nesting hawk should he fed with flesh which has previously
been washed
 the abbot
i marvel what blood thou art neither
englander nor scot fish nor flesh a bastard
from the debateable land without
either kith kin or ally marry out upon
thee foul kite that would fain be a tercel
gentle
the reply to this sarcasm was a box on
the ear so well applied that it overthrew
the falconer into the cistern in which water
was kept for the benefit the hawks up
started adam woodcock and seizing on a
truncheon which stood by would have soon
requited the injury he had received had not
roland laid his hand on his poniard and
sworn by all that was sacred that if he
offered a stroke towards him he would
sheath it in his bowels the noise was now
so great that more than one the houscr j
hold came in and amongst others the 
a grave personage already mentioned
whose gold chain and white wand
intimated his authority at the appearance
 this dignitary the strife was for the
present appeased he embraced however
the abbot 
so favourable an opportunity to read roland
grseme a shrewd lecture on the impropriety
 his deportment to his fellowmenials
and to assure him that should he
communicate this fray to his master who
though now on one his frequent expeditions
was speedily expected to return
which but for respect to his lady he would
most certainly do the residence the
culprit in the castle avenel would be
but brief duration but however
added the prudent master the household
 i will report the matter first to my lady
very just very right master wingate
exclaimed several voices together my
lady will consider if daggers are to be
drawn on us for every idle word and whether
we are to live in a wellordered household
where there is the fear god or
amongst drawn dirks and sharp knives
the object this general resentment
darted an angry glance around him and
suppressing with difficulty the desire which
urged him to reply in furious or in cons
the abbot
temp tous language returned his dagger into
the scabbard looked disdainfully around
upon the assembled menials turned short
upon his heel and pushing aside those who
stood betwixt him and the door left the
apartment
 this will be no tree for my nest said
the falconer if this cocksparrow is to
crow over us as he seems to do
he struck me with his switch yesterday
said one the grooms because
the tail his worship's gelding was not
trimmed altogether so as suited his humour

 and i promise you said the laundress
 my young master will stick nothing
to call you slut and quean if there
be but a speck soot upon his bandcollar

 if master wingate do not his errand
to my lady was the general result there
will be no tarrying in the same house with
koland graeme
the master the household heard them
the abbot 
all for some time and then motioning for
universal silence he addressed them with all
the dignity malvolio himself my masters
 not forgetting you my mistresses
do not think the worse me that i proceed
with as much care as haste in this
matter our master is a gallant knight
and will have his sway at home and abroad
in wood and field in hall and bower as the
saying is our lady my benison upon her
is also a noble person long descent and
rightful heir this place and barony and
she also loves her will as for that matter
shew me the woman who doth not now
she hath favoured doth favour and will favour
thisjackanape for what good part
about him i know not save that as one
noble lady will love a messan dog and another
a screaming popinjay and a third a
barbary ape so doth it please our noble
dame to set her affections upon this stray
elf a page for nought that i can think
off save that she was the cause his being
 the abbot
saved the more's the pity from drowning
and here master wingate made a
pause
i would have been his caution for a
grey groat against salt water or fresh said
his adversary the falconer marry if he
crack not a rope for stabbing or for snatching
i will be content never to hood hawk
again
peace adam woodcock said wingate
waving his hand i prithee peace
man snow my lady liking this springald
as aforesaid differs therein from my lord
whp likes never a bone in his skin now
is it for me to stir up strife betwixt them
and put as twere my finger betwixt the
bark and the tree on account a pragmatical
youngster whom nevertheless i
would willingly see whipped forth the
barony have patience and this boil will
break without our meddling i have been
in service since i wore a beard on my chin
till now that that beard is turned grey
and i have seldom known any one better
the abbot 
themselves even by taking the lady's part
against the lord's but never one who did
not dirk himself if he took the lord's
against the lady's
 and so said lilias we are to be
crowed over every one us men and
women cock and hen by this little upstart
 i will try titles with him first i promise
you i fancy master wingate for
as wise as you look you will be pleased to
tell what you have seen today if my lady
commands you
 to speak the truth when my lady
commands me answered the prudential
majordomo is in some measure my
duty mistress lilias always providing for
and excepting those cases in which it cannot
be spoken without breeding mischief
and inconvenience to myself or my fellowservants
 for the tongue a talebearer
breaketh bones as well as a jeddart staif
but this imp satan is none your
friends or fellowservants said lilias
 the abbor
 and i trust you mean not to stand up for
him against the whole family besides 
 credit me mrs lilias replied the
senior should i see the time fitting i
would with right good will give him a lick
with the rough side my tongue
 enough said master wingate answered
lilias then trust me his song
shall soon be laid if my mistress does not
ask me what is the matter below stairs before
she be ten minutes time older she
is no born woman and my name is not
lilias bradbourne
in pursuance her plan mistress lilies
failed not to present herself before her
mistress with all the exterior one who
is possessed an important secret that
is she had the corner her mouth turned
down her eyes raised up her lips pressed
as fast together as if they had been sewed
up to prevent her blabbing and an air 
prim mystical importance diffused over her
whole person and demeanour which seemthe
abbot 
ed to intimate i know something which
 am resolved not to tell you 
lilias had rightly read her mistress's temper
who wise and good as she was was yet
a daughter grandame eve and could not
witness this mysterious bearing on the part
 her waitingwoman without longing to ascertain
the secret cause for a space mrs
lilias was obdurate to all enquiries sighed
turned her eyes up higher yet to heaven
hoped for the best but had nothing particular
to communicate all this as was most
natural and proper only stimulated the lady's
curiosity neither was her importunity
to be parried with thank god i am no
makebate no talebearer thank god i
never envied any one's favour or was anxious
to people their misdemeanour only
thank god there has been no bloodshed
and murder in the house that is all
bloodshed and murder exclaimed the
lady what does the quean mean if you
speak not plain out you shall have something
you will scarce be thankful for
w
 the abbot
 nay my lady answered lilias eager
to disburse her mind or in chaucer's
phrase to unbuckle her mail if you bid
me speak out the truth you must not be
moved with what might displease you 
roland graeme has tired adam woodcock
 that is all
 good heaven said the lady turning
pale as ashes is the man slain 
 no madam replied lilias but slahi
he would have been if there had not been
ready help but may be it is your ladyship's
pleasure that this young esquire shall
poniard the servants as well as switch and
barton them
 go to minion said the lady you
are saucytell the master the household
to attend me instantly
lilias hastened to seek out mr wingate
and hurry him to his lady's presence speaking
as a word in season to him on the way
i have set the stone strolling look that
you do not let it stand still
the steward too prudential a person to
the abbot 
commit himself otherwise answered by a
sly look and a nod intelligence and presently
after stood in the presence the
lady avenel with a look great respect
for his lady partly real partly affected
and an air great sagacity which inferred
no ordinary conceit himself
how is this wingate said the lady
and what rule do you keep in the castle
that the domestics sir halbert blending
draw the dagger on each other as ina
cavern thieves and murtherers is the
wounded man much hurt and what what
hath become the unhappy boy 
there is no one wounded as yet madam
replied he the golden chain it
passes my poor skill to say how many maybe
wounded before pasche if some rule be
not taken with this youth not but the
youth is a fair youth he added corrective
himself and able at his exercise but
easter
 the abbor
somewhat too ready with the ends his
fingers the butt his riding switch and
the point his dagger
 and whose fault is that said the lady
 but yours who should have taught him
better discipline than to brawl or to draw
his dagger 
if it please your ladyship so to impose
the blame on me answered the steward
it is my part doubtless to bear it only i
submit to your consideration that unless i
nailed his weapon to the scabbard i could
no more keep it still than i could fix quicksilver
which defied even the skill raymond
nullius
tell me not raymond nullius said
the lady losing patience but send me the
chaplain hither you grow all you too
wise for me during your lord's long and
repeated absences i would to god his affairs
would permit him to remain at home
and rule his own household for it passes my
wit and skill 
 god forbid my lady said the old dothe
abbot 
mystic that you should sincerely think
what you are now pleased to say your old
servants might well hope that after so many
years duty you would do their service more
justice than to distrust their grey hairs because
they cannot rule the peevish humour
 a green head which the owner carries
it may be a brace inches higher than
becomes him
 leave me said the lady j sir albert's
return must now be expected daily
and he will look into these matters himself
leave me i say wingate without saying
more it i know you are honest and i
believe the boy is petulant and yet i think
it is my favour which hath set all you
against him
the steward bowed and retired after
having been silenced in a second attempt
to explain the motives on which he acted
the chaplain arrived but neither from
him did the lady receive much comfort
on the contrary she found him disposed
in plain terms to lay to the door her invol
i e
 tae abbot
dulgence all the disturbances which the
fiery temper roland graeme had already
occasioned or might hereafter occasion in
the family i would he said honoured
lady that you had deigned to be ruled by
me in the outset this matter sith it is
easy to stem evil in the fountain but hard
to struggle against it in the stream you
honoured madam a word which i do not
use according to the vain forms this
world bit because i have ever loved and
honoured you as an honourable and an
elect lady you i say madam have been
pleased contrary to my poor but earnest
counsel to raise this boy from his station
into one approaching to your own
 what mean you reverend sir said
the lady i have made this youth a page
is there aught in my doing so that does
not become my character and quality 
i dispute not madam said the pertinacious
preacher your benevolent purpose
in taking charge this youth or your
title to give him this idle character page
the abbor 
if such was your pleasure though what the
education a boy in the train a female
can tend to save to engraft foppery and
effeminacy on conceit and arrogance it
passes my knowledge to discover but i
blame you more directly for having taken
little care to guard him against the perils 
his condition or to tame and humble a spirit
naturally haughty overbearing and impatient
you have brought into your bower
a lion's cub delighted with the beauty 
his fur and the grace his gambols you
have bound him with no fetters befitting
the fierceness his disposition you have
let him grow up as unawed as if he had
been still a tenant the forest and now
you are surprised and call out for assistance
when he begins to ramp rend and
tear according to his proper nature
 mr warden said the lady considerably
offended you are my husband's ancient
friend and i believe your love sincere
to him and to his household yet let me
say that when i asked you for counsel i
 the abbot
expected not this asperity rebuke if i
have done wrong in loving this poor orphan
lad more than others his class i scarce
think the error merited such severe censure
 and if stricter discipline were required
to keep his fiery temper in order it
ought i think to be considered that i ama
woman and that if i have erred in this
matter it becomes a friend's part rather to
aid than to rebuke me i would these evils
were taken order with before my lord's return
he loves not domestic discord or
domestic brawls and i would not willingly
that he thought such could arise from
one whom i have favoured what do you
counsel me to do 
dismiss this youth from your service
madam replied the preacher
you cannot bid me do so said the
lady you cannot as a christian and a
man humanity bid me turn away an unprotected
creature against whom my favour
my injudicious favour if you will has
reared up so many enemies
i
the abbot 
it is not necessary you should altogether
abandon him though you dismiss him
to another service or to a calling better
suiting his station and character said the
preacher elsewhere he may be an useful
and profitable member the commonweal
 here he is but a makebate and a
stumblingblock offence the youth
has snatches sense and intelligence
though he lacks industry i will myself
give him letters commendatory to olearius
schinderhausen a learned professor at leyden
where they lack an underjanitor
where besides gratis instruction if god
give him the grace to seek it he will enjoy
five marks by the year and the professor's
castoff suit which he departs with
biennially
 this will never do good mr warden
said the lady scarce able to suppress a
smile we will think more at large upon
this matter in the meanwhile trust to
your remonstrances with the family for restraining
these violent and unseemly jean
the abbot
houses and bursts passion and i entreat
you to press on them their duty in
this respect towards god and towards
their master
 you shall be obeyed madam said
warden on the next thursday i exhort
the family and will with god's blessing
so wrestle with the daemon wrath
and violence which hath entered into my
little flock that i trust to hound the wolf
out the fold as if he were chased away
with bandogs
this was the part the conference from
which mr warden derived the greatest pleasure
the pulpit was at that time the same
powerful engine for affecting popular feel
ing which the press has since become and
he had been no unsuccessful preacher as
we have already seen it followed as a natural
consequence that he rather overestimated
the powers his own oratory and
like some his brethren about the period
was glad an opportunity to handle any
matters importance whether public or
thr abbor 
private the discussion which could be
dragged into his discourse in that rude age
the delicacy was unknown which prescribed
time and place to personal exhortations 
and as the courtpreacher often addressed
the king personally and dictated to him
the conduct he ought to observe in matters
 state so the nobleman himself or any 
his retainers were in the chapel the feudal
castle often incensed or appalled as the
case might be by the discussion their
private faults and by spiritual censures
directed against them specifically personally
and by name
the sermon by means which henry
warden proposed to restore concord and
good order to the castle avenel bore
for text the wellknown words he ivlio
strike with the sword shall perish by the
swyrdj and was a singular mixture good
sense and powerful oratory with pedantry
and bad taste he enlarged a good deal
on the word strike which he assured his
hearers comprehended blows given with
 the abbot
the point as well as with the edge and
more generally shooting with handgun
crossbow or longbow thrusting with a
lance or doing any thing whatsoever by
which death might be occasioned to the
adversary in the same manner he proved
satisfactorily that the word sword comprehended
all descriptions whether backsword
or baskethilt cutandthrust or rapier
falchion or scimitar but if he
continued with still greater animation
the text included in its anathema those
who strike with any those weapons
which man hath devised for the exercise 
his open hostility still more doth it comprehend
such as from their form and size
are devised rather for the gratification 
privy malice by treachery than for the destruction
 an enemy prepared and standing
upon his defence such he continued
looking sternly at the place where
the page was seated on a cushion at the
feet his mistress and wearing in his
crimson belt a gay dagger with a gilded
the abbot 
hit such more especially i hold to be
those implements death which in our
modern and fantastic times are worn not
only by thieves and cutthroats to whom
they most properly belong but even by
those who attend upon women and wait
in the chambers honourable ladies yes
my friends this unhappy weapon framed
for all evil and for no good is comprehended
under this deadly denunciation
whether it be a stile which we have bo
rowed from the treacherous italian 
dirk which is borne by the savage i 
landmen or a linger which is carried your
own borderthieves and cutthrow 
a dudgeondagger which was invented by
the devil himself for a ready implement 
deadly wrath sudden to execute and difficult
to be parried even the common
sword andbuckler brawler despises the
use such a treacherous and malignant
instrument which is therefore fit to be
used not by men or soldiers but by those
who trained under female discipline bee

 the abbot
come themselves effeminate hermaphrodites
having female spite and female cowardice
added to the infirmities and evil
passions their masculine nature
the effect which this oration produced
upon the assembled congregation 
cannot very easily be described the
lady seemed at once embarrassed and offended
 the menials could hardly contain
under an affectation deep attention the
joy with which they heard the chaplain
launch his thunders at the head the unpopular
favourite mrs lilias crested and
drew up her head with all the deepfelt
pride gratified resentment while the
steward observing a strict neutrality aspect
fixed his eyes upon an old scutcheon
on the opposite side the wall which he
seemed to examine with the most minute
accuracy more willing perhaps to incur
the censure being inattentive to the sermon
than that seeming to listen with
marked approbation to what appeared so
distasteful to his mistress
the abbot 
the unfortunate subject the harangue
whom nature had endowed with passions
which had hitherto found no effectual restraint
could not disguise the resentment
which he felt at being thus directly held
up to the scorn as well as the censure 
the assembled inhabitants the little world
in which he lived his brow grew red his
lip grew pale he set his teeth he clenched
his hand and then with mechanical readiness
grasped the weapon which the clergyman
had given so hideous a character 
and at length as the preacher heightened
the colouring his invective he felt his
rage become so ungovernable that fearful
 being hurried into some deed desperate
violence he rose up traversed the
chapel with hasty steps and left the congregation

the preacher was surprised into a sudden
pause while the fiery youth shot across
him like a flash lightning eyeing him ashe
passed as if he had wished to dart
from his eyes the same power blighting
 the abbot
and consuming but no sooner had he
crossed the chapel and shut with violence
behind him the door the vaulted entrance
by which it communicated with the
castle than the impropriety his conduct
supplied warden with one those
happier subjects for eloquence which
he knew how to take advantage for making
a suitable impression on his hearers
he paused for an instant and then pronounced
in a slow and solemn voice the deep
anathema he hath gone out from us because
he was not us the sick man hath
been offended at the wholesome bitter the
medicine the wounded patient hath flinched
from the friendly knife the surgeon
the sheep hath fled from the sheepfold
and delivered himself to the wolf because
he could not assume the quiet and humble
conduct demanded us by the great shepherd
 ah my brethren beware wrath 
beware pride beware the deadly and
destroying sin which so often shews itself
to our frail eyes in the garments light
the abbot 
what is our earthly honour pride and
pride only what our earthly gifts and
graces pride and vanity voyagers speak
 indian men who deck themselves with
shells and anoint themselves with pigments
and boast their attire as we do
 our miserable carnal advantages pride
could draw down the morning star from
heaven even to the verge the pit 
pride and self opinion kindled the flaming
sword which waves us off from paradise 
pride made adam mortal and a weary
wanderer on the face the earth which
he had else been lord pride brought
amongst us sin and doubles every sin it
has brought it is the outpost which the
devil and the flesh most stubbornly maintain
against the assaults grace and until
it be subdued and its barriers levelled
with the very earth there is more hope 
a fool than the sinner rend then from
your bosoms this accursed shoot the fatal
apple tear it up by the roots though
it be twisted with the cords your life
 the abbot
profit by the example the miserable sinner
that has passed from us and embrace
the means grace while it is called today
 ere your conscience is seared as with
a firebrand and your ears deafened like
those the adder and your heart hardened
like the nether millstone up then
and be doing wrestle and overcome resist
and the enemy shall flee from you 
watch and pray lest ye fall into temptation
and let the stumbling others be
your warning and your example above
all rely not on yourselves for such selfconfidence
is even the worst symptom 
the disorder itself the pharisee perhaps
deemed himself humble while he stooped
in the temple and thanked god that he
was not as other men and even as the
publican but while his knees touched
the marble pavement his head was as high
as the topmost pinnacle the temple
do not therefore deceive yourselves and
offer false coin where the purest you can
present is but as dross think not that
the abbot ill
such will pass the assay omnipotent wisdom
yet shrink not from the task because
as is my bounden duty i do not
disguise from you its difficulties selfsearching
can do much meditation can
do much grace can do all
and he concluded with a touching and
animating exhortation to his hearers to
seek divine grace which is perfected inhuman
weakness
the audience did not listen to this address
without being considerably affected 
though it might be doubted whether the
feelings triumph received from the disgraceful
retreat the favourite page did
not greatly qualify in the minds many
the exhortations the preacher to charity
and to humility and in fact the expression
 their countenances much resembled
the satisfied triumphant air a
set children who having just seen a
companion punished for a fault in which
they had no share con their task with
double glee both because they themselves
 the abbot
are out the scrape and because the culprit
is in it
with very different feelings did the lady
 avenel seek her own apartment she
felt angry at warden having made a domestic
matter in which she took a personal
interest the subject such public discussion
but this she knew the good man
claimed as a branch his christian liberty
as a preacher and also that it was vindicated
by the universal custom his brethren
but the selfwilled conduct her
protege afforded her yet deeper concern
that he had broken through in so remarkable
a degree not only the respect due to
her presence but that which was paid in
those days with such peculiar reverence
argued a spirit as untameable as his enemies
had represented him to possess and
yet so far as he had been under her own
eye she had seen no more that fiery
spirit than appeared to her to become his
years and his vivacity this opinion might
be founded in some degree on partiality j
the abbot 
in some degree too it might be owing to
the kindness and indulgence which she
had always extended to him but still she
thought it impossible that she could be totally
mistaken in the estimate she had
formed his character the extreme 
violence is scarce consistent with a course
 continued hypocrisy although lilias
charitably hinted that in some instances
they were happily united and therefore
she could not exactly trust the report 
others against her own experience and observation
the thoughts this orphan
boy clung to her heartstrings with a fondness
for which she herself was unable to
account he seemed to have been sent to
her by heaven to fill up those intervals 
languor and vacuity which deprived her 
so much enjoyment perhaps he was not
less dear to her because she well saw that
he was a favourite with no one else and
because she felt that to give him up was
to afford the judgment her husband and
others a triumph over her own j a circuit
the abbot
stance not quite indifferent to the best 
spouses either sex
in short the lady avenel formed the
internal resolution that she would not desert
her page while her page could be rationally
protected and with the view 
ascertaining how far this might be done
she caused him to be summoned to her
presence

old play
it was some time ere roland graeme appeared
the messenger his old friend
lilias had at first attempted to open the
door his little apartment with the charitable
purpose doubtless enjoying the
confusion and marking the demeanour 
the culprit but a square bit iron
ycleped a bolt was passed across the door
on the inside and prevented her charitable
purpose lilias knocked and called at intervals
 roland roland graeme 
roland graeme an emphasis on the
 the abbot
word master will you be pleased to do
up the door what ails you are you
at your prayers in private to complete the
devotion which you left unfinished in public
 surely we must have a screened seat
for you in the chapel that your gentility
may be free from the eyes common
folks still no whisper was heard in reply
 well master roland said the
waiting maid i must tell my mistress
that if she would have an answer she must
send those on errand to you who can beat
the door down
 what says your lady answered the
page from within
 marry open the door and you shall
hear answered the waitingmaid i trow
it becomes her message to be listened to
face to face and i will not for your idle
pleasure whistle it through a keyhole
your mistress's name said the page
opening the door is too fair a cover for
your impertinence what says my lady 
 that you will be pleased to come to
the abbot 
her directly in the withdrawing room
answered lilias i presume she has
some directions for you concerning the
forms to be observed in leaving chapel in
future
 say to my lady that i will directly
wait on her answered the page and returning
into his own apartment he once
more locked the door in the face the
waitingmaid
 rare courtesy muttered lilias and
returning to her mistress acquainted her
that roland graeme would wait on her
when it suited his convenience
 what is that his addition or your own
phrase lilias said the lady coolly
 nay madam replied the attendant
not directly answering the question he
looked as if he could have said much more
impertinent things than that if i had been
willing to hear them but here he comes
to answer for himself
roland graeme entered the apartment
with a loftier mien and somewhat a higher
 the abbot
colour than his wont there was embarrassment
in his manner but it was neither
that fear nor penitence
 young man said the lady what
trow you am i to think your conduct
this day 
 if it has offended you madam i am
deeply grieved replied the youth
 to have offended me alone replied
the lady were but little you have been
guilty conduct which will highly offend
your master violence to your fellowservants
and disrespect to god himself
in the person his ambassador
permit me again to reply said the
page that if i have offended my only
mistress friend and benefactress it includes
the sum my guilt and deserves
the sum my penitence sir halbert
glendinning calls me not servant nor do i
call him master he is not entitled to blame
me for chastising an insolent groom nor
do i fear the wrath heaven for treating
the abbot il
with scorn the unauthorized interference
 a meddling preacher
the lady avenel had before this seen
symptoms in her favourite boyish petulance
and impatience censure or reproof
but his present demeanour was 
a graver and more determined character
and she was for a moment at a loss how she
should treat the youth who seemed to have
at once assumed the character not only 
a man but a bold and determined one
she paused an instant and then assuming
the dignity which was natural to her she
said is it to me roland that you hold
this language is it for the purpose making
me repent the favour i have shewn
you that you declare yourself independent
both an earthly and a heavenly master 
have you forgotten what you were and
to what the loss my protection would
speedily again reduce you
 lady said the page i have forgot
nothing i remember but too much i
know that but for you i should have pes
the abbot
wished in yon blue waves pointing as he
spoke to the lake which was seen through
the window agitated by the western wind
your goodness has gone farther adam
you have protected me against the malice
 others and against my own folly you are
free if you are willing to abandon the orphan
you have reared you have left nothing
undone by him and he complains 
nothing and yet lady do not think i have
been ungrateful i have endured something
on my part which i would have borne for
the sake no one but my benefactress
 for my sake said the lady and
what is it that i can have subjected you to
endure which can be remembered with
other feelings than those thanks and gratitude

you are too just madam to require
me to be thankful for the cold neglect with
which your husband has uniformly treated
me neglect not unmingled with fixed aversion
you are too just madam to require
me to be grateful for the constant and un
the abbot 
ceasing marks scorn and malevolence
with which i have been treated by others
or for such a homily as that with which
your reverend chaplain has at my expence
this very day regaled the assembled householders

 heard mortal ears the like this 
said the waiting maid with her hands expanded
and her eyes turned up to heaven 
he speaks as if he were son an earl or
 a belted knight the least penny
the page glanced on her a look supreme
contempt but vouchsafed no other
answer his mistress who began to feel
herself seriously offended and yet sorry for
the youth's folly took up the same tone
 indeed roland you forget yourself so
strangely said she that you will tempt
me to take serious measures to lower you
in your own opinion by reducing you to
your proper station in society
 and that added lihas would be
best done by turning him out the same beggar's
brat that your ladyship took him in

 the abbot
lilias speaks too rudely continued the
lady but she has spoken the truth young
man nor do i think i ought to spare that
pride which hath so completely turned your
bead you have been tricked up with fine
garments and treated like the son a gentleman
until you have forgot the fountain
 your churlish blood
craving your pardon most honourable
madam lias hath spoken truth nor
does your ladyship know aught my descents
which should entitle you to treat it
with such decided scorn i am no beggar's
brat my grandmother begged from no
one here nor elsewhere she would have
perished sooner on the bare moor we
were harried out and driven from our
home a chance which has lapped elsewhere
and to others avenel castle with
its lake and its towers was not at all times
able to protect its inhabitants from want
and desolation
 hear but his assurance said lilias
 he upbraids my lady with the distresses
 her family 
the abbot 
it had indeed been a theme more gratefully
spared said the lady affected nevertheless
with the allusion
it was necessary madam for my vindication
said the page or i had not even
hinted at a word that might give you pain
but believe honoured lady i am no
churl's blood my proper descent i know
not but my only relation has said and my
heart has echoed it back and attested the
truth that i am sprung gentle blood
and deserve gentle usage
 and upon an assurance so vague as
this said the lady do you propose to expect
all the regard all the privileges due
to high rank and to distinguished birth
and become a contender for privileges
which are only due to the noble go to sir
know yourself or the master the household
shall make you know you are liable to
the scourge as a malapert boy you have
tasted too little the discipline fit for your age
and station
the master the household shall taste
 the abbot
 my dagger ere i taste his discipline
said the page giving way to his restrained
passion lady i have been too long the
vassal a pantoufle and the slave a
silver whistle you must find some other
to answer your call and let him be birth
and spirit mean enough to brook the scorn
 your menials and to call a church vassal
his master
 i have deserved this insult said the
lady colouring deeply for so long enduring
and fostering your petulance begone
sir leave this castle tonight i
will send you the means subsisting yourself
till you find some honest mode support
though i fear your imaginary grandeur
will be above all others save those 
rapine and violence begone sir and see
my face no more 
the page threw himself at her feet in
an agony sorrow my dear and honoured
mistress he said but was unable
to bring out another syllable
 arise sir said the lady and let go

the abbot 
my mantle hypocrisy is a poor cloak for
ingratitude
i am incapable either madam said
the page springing up with the exchange
 passion which belonged to his rapid and
impetuous temper think not i meant
to implore permission to reside here it
has been long my determination to leave
avenel and i will never forgive myself for
having permitted you to say the word hegone
j ere i said i leave you i did but
kneel to ask your forgiveness for an illconsidered
word used in the height displeasure
but which ill became my mouth as
addressed to you other grace i asked
not you have done much for me but i
repeat that you better know what you
yourself have done than what i have suffered

 roland said the lady somewhat appeased
and relenting towards her favourite
you had me to appeal to when you were
aggrieved you were neither called upon
 the abbot
to suffer wrong nor entitled to resent it
when you were under my protection
 and what said the youth if i sustained
wrong from those you loved and favoured
was i to disturb your peace with
idle talebearings and eternal complaints
no madam i have borne my own burthen
in silence and without disturbing you
with murmurs and the respect which you
accuse me wanting furnishes the only
reason why i have neither appealed to you
nor taken vengeance at my own hand in a
manner far more effectual it is well however
that we part i vas not born to be a
stipendiary favoured by his mistress until
ruined by the calumnies others may
heaven multiply its choicest blessings on
your honoured head and for your sake
upon all that are dear to you 
he was about to leave the apartment
when the lady called on him to return he
stood still while she thus addressed him 
 it was not my intention nor would it be
the abbot 
just even in the height my displeasure
to dismiss you without the means su
port take this purse gold
forgive me lady said the boy and
let me go hence with the consciousness
that i have not been degraded to the point
 accepting alms if my poor services
can be placed against the expense my
apparel and my maintenance i only remain
debtor to you for my life and that
alone is a debt which i can never repay 
put up then that purse and only say iiu
stead that you do not part from me m
anger
 no not in anger said the lady in
sorrow rather for your wilfulness but take
the gold you cannot but need it
may god evermore bless you for the
kind tone and the kind word but the oid
i cannot take i am able body and do
not lack friends so wholly as you may think 
for the time may come that i may yet shew
myself more thankful than by mere words
he threw himself on his knees kissed the
 the abbot
hand which she did not withdraw and
then hastily left the apartment
lilias for a moment or two kept her
eye fixed on her mistress who looked so
unusually pale that she seemed about to
faint but the lady instantly recovered herself
and declining the assistance which her
attendant offered her walked to her own
apartment
the abbot 
chapter 
lliou hast each secret the household francis
i dare be sworn thou hast been in the buttery
steeping thy curious humour in fat ale
and in the butler's tattle ay or chatting
with the glib waitingwoman o'er her comfits 
these bear the key to each domestic mystery
old play
upon the morrow succeeding the scene
we have described the disgraced favourite
left the castle and at breakfasttime the
cautious old steward and mrs lilias sate
in the apartment the latter personage
holding grave converse on the important
event the day sweetened by a small treat
 sweetmeats to which the providence 
mr wingate had added a little flask racy
canary
f
 the abbas
 he is gone at last said the abigail
sipping her glass and here is to his
good journey
amen answered the steward gravely
 i wish the poor deserted lad no ill
 and he is gone like a wildduck as he
came continued mrs lilias no lowering
 drawbridges or pacing along causeways
for him my master has pushed off
in the boat which they call the little herod
more shame to them for giving the name
 a christian to wood and iron and has
rowed himself by himself to the further side
 the loch and off and away with himself
and left all his finery strewed about his
room i wonder who is to clean his trumpery
out after him though the things are
worth lifting too
 doubtless mrs lilias answered the
master the household in the which
case i am free to think they will not long
cumber the floor
 and now tell me mr wingate continued
the damsel do not the very
the abbot 
cockles your heart rejoice at the house
being rid this upstart whelp that flung
us all into shadow 
why mrs lilias replied wingate
 as to rejoicing those who have lived as
long in great families as has been my lot
will be in no hurry to rejoice at any thing
and for roland grajtiie though he maybe
a good riddance in the main yet what
says the very sooth proverb seldom comes
a better 
seldom comes a better indeed echoed
mrs lilias i say never can come
a worse or one half so bad he might
have been the ruin our poor dear mistress
here she used her kerchief body
and soul and estate too for she spent more
coin on his apparel than on any four servants
about the house
 mrs lilias said the sage steward
 i do opine that our mistress requireth
not this pity at our hands being in all respects
competent to take care her own
body soul and estate into the bargain
 the abbot
you would not mayhap have said so
answered the waitingwoman had you
seen how like lot's wife she looked when
young master took his leave my mistress
is a good lady and a virtuous and a welldoing
lady and a wellspoken but i
would not sir halbert had seen her this
morning for two and a place
oh foy foy foy reiterated the
steward servants should hear and see
and say nothing besides that my lady is
utterly devoted to sir halbert as well she
may being as he is the most renowned
knight in these parts
 well well said the abigail i mean
no more harm but they that seek least renown
abroad are most apt to find quiet at
home that's all and my lady's lonesome
situation is to be considered that made her
fain to take up with the first beggar's brat
that a dog brought her out the loch
 and therefore said the steward i
say rejoice not too much or too hastily
mrs lilias for if your lady wished a favour
the abbot 
ite to pass away the time depend upon it
the time will not pass lighter now that he
is gone since she will have another favourite
to chuse for herself and be assured
she will not lack one
 and where should she chuse one but
among her own tried and faithful servants
said mrs lilias who have broken her
bread and drank her drink for so many
years i have known many a lady as high
as she that never thought either a friend
or favourite beyond their own waitingwoman
 always having a proper respect at
the same time for their old and faithful
master the household mr wingate
truly mrs lilias replied the steward
 i do partly see the mark at which
you shoot but i doubt your bolt will fall
short matters being with our lady as it
likes you to suppose it will neither be your
crimped pinners mrs lilias speaking 
them with due respect nor my silver hair
or golden chain that will fill up the void
which roland grme must needs leave in
 the abbot
our lady's leisure there will be a learned
young divine with some new doctrine a
learned leech with some new drug a bold
cavalier who will not be refused the favour
 wearing her colours at a running at the
ring a cunning harper that could harp the
heart out woman's breast as they say
signor david rizzio did to our poor queen
these are the sort folks who supply the
loss a wellfavoured favourite and not
an old steward or a middleaged waitingwoman

 well said lilias you have experience
master wingate and truly i would
my master would leave off his pricking hither
and thither and look better after the
affairs his household there will be a
papistrie among us next for what should
i see among master's clothes but a string 
gold beads i promise you aves and credos
both i seized on them like a falcon
 i doubt it not i doubt it not said the
steward sagaciously nodding his head i
have often noticed that the boy had strange
observances which savoured popery and
the abbot 
that he was very jealous to conceal them
but you will find the catholic under the
presbyterian cloak as often as the knave
under the friar's hood vhat then we are
all mortal right proper beads they are
he added looking attentively at them and
may weigh four ounces fine gold
 and i will have them melted down presently
she said before they be the misguiding
 some poor blinded soul
very cautious indeed mrs lilias said
the steward nodding his head in assent
i will have them made said mrs lilias
into a pair shoebuckles i would not
wear the pope's trinkets or whatever has
once borne the shape them one inch
above my instep were they diamonds instead
 gold but this is what has come
 father ambrose coming about the castle
as demure as a cat that is about to steal
cream
father ambrose is our master's brother
said the steward gravely
 very true master yvingate answered
 the abbot
the dame but is that a good reason why
he should pervert the king's liege subjects
to papistrie 
heaven forbid mrs lilias answered
the sententious majordomo but yet
there are worse folks than the papists
 i wonder where they are to be found
said the waitingwoman with some asperity
 but i believe mr wingate if one
were to speak to you about the devil himself
you would say there were worse people
than satan
 assuredly i might say so replied the
steward supposing that i saw satan standing
at my elbow
the waitingwoman started and having
exclaimed god bless us added i wonder
mr wingate you can take pleasure in
frightening one thus
nay mrs lilian i had no such purpose
was the reply but look you here
the papists are but put down for the present
but who knows how long this word
present will last there are two great pos

the abbot 
pish earls in the north england that
abominate the very word reformation i
mean the northumberland and westmoreland
earls men power enough to shake
any throne in christendom then though
our scottish king be god bless him a true
protestant yet here is his mother that was
our queen i trust there is no harm to say
god bless her too and she is a catholic 
and many begin to think she has had but
hard measure such as the hamiltons in the
west and some our border clans here
and the gordon in the north who are all
wishing to see a new world and if such a
new world should chance to come up it is
like that the queen will take back her own
crown and that the mass and the cross will
come up and then down go pulpits genevagowns
and black silk scullcaps
and have you mr jasper wingate
who have heard the word and listened unto
pure and precious mr henry warden have
you i say the patience to speak or but to
think popery coming down on us like a
 the abbot
storm or the woman mary again making
the royal seat scotland a throne abomination
 no marvel that you are so civil
to the cowled monk father ambrose when
he comes hither with his downcast eyes that
he never raises to my lady's face and with
his low sweettoned voice and his benedictines
and his bennisons and who so ready
to take them kindly as mr wingate 
mrs lilias replied the butler with an
air which was intended to close the debate
there are reasons for all things if i received
father ambrose debonair and suffered
him to steal a word now and then with
this same roland gramme it was not that i
cared a brass boodle for his benson or malison
either but only because i respected my
master's blood and who can answer if
mary come in again whether he may not be
as stout a tree to lean to as ever his brother
hath proved to us for down goes the earl
 murray when the queen comes by her
own again and good is his luck if he can
keep the head on his own shoulders and
down goes our knight with the earl his
the abbot 
patron j and who so like to mount into his
empty saddle as this same father ambrose 
the pope rome can soon dispense with
his vows and then we should have sir edward
the soldier instead ambrose the
priest
resentment and astonishment kept mrs
lilias silent while her old friend in his
self complacent manner was making known
to her his political speculations at length
her resentment found utterance in words
 great ire and scorn what master
wingate have you eaten my mistresses
bread to say nothing my master's so
many years that you could live to think 
her being dispossessed her own castle 
avenel by a wretched monk who is not a
drop's blood to her in the way relation 
i that am but a woman would try first
whether my rock or his covet were the better
metal shame on you master wingate
 if i had not held you as so old an acquaintance
this should have gone to my
lady's ears though i had been called 
the abbot
thank and taleyet for my pains as when
i told roland grseme shooting the wild
swan
master wingate was somewhat dismayed
at perceiving that the detail which he had
given his farsighted political views had
produced on his hearer rather suspicion 
his fidelity than admiration his wisdom
and endeavoured as hastily as possible to
apologize and to explain although internally
extremely offended at the unreasonable
view as he deemed it which it had
pleased mistress lilias bradbury to take
 his expressions and mentally convinced
that her disapprobation his sentiments
arose solely out the consideration
that though father ambrose supposing
him to become the master the castle
would certainly require the services a
steward yet those a waitingwoman
would in the supposed circumstances be
altogether superfluous
after his explanation had been received
as explanations usually are the two friends
the abbot 
separated lilias to attend the silver whistle
which called her to her mistress's chamber
and the sapient majordomo to the
duties his own department they parted
with less than their usual degree reverence
and regard for the steward felt that
his worldly wisdom was rebuked by the
more disinterested attachment the 
and mistress lilias bradbury
was compelled to consider her old friend
as something little if any thing better thana
timeserver

old sot
while the departure the page afforded
subject for the conversation which we
have detailed in our last chapter the late
favourite was far advanced on his solitary
journey without well knowing what was
its object or what was likely to be its 
he had rowed the skiff in which he left the
castle to the side the lake most distant
from the village vvith the desire escaping
the notice the inhabitants his pride
whispered that he would be in his discarded
state only the subject their wonder
the abbot 
and compassion and his generosity told
him that any mark sympathy which his
situation should excite might be unfavourably
reported at the castle a trifling incident
convinced him he had little to fear
for his friends on the latter score he was
met by a young man some years older than
himself who had on former occasions been
but too happy to be permitted to share in
his sports in the subordinate character his
assistant ralph fisher approached to greet
him with all the alacrity an humble friend
 what master roland abroad on this
side and without either hawk or hound 
 hawk or hound said roland i will
never perhaps hollo to again i have been
dismissed that is i have left the castle
ralph was surprised what you are
to pass into the knight's service and take
the blackjack and the lance 
indeed replied roland graeme i
am not i am now leaving the service 
avenel for ever
 the abbot
 and whither are you going then said
the young peasant
 nay that is a question which it craves
time to answer i have that matter to determine
yet replied the disgraced favourite

 nay nay said ralph i warrant you
it is the same to you which way you go 
my lady would not dismiss you till she had
put some lining into the pouches your
doublet
sordid slave said roland graeme
doest thou think i would have accepted
a boon from one who was giving me over
a prey to detraction and to ruin at the instigation
 a canting priest and a meddling
serving woman the bread that i had
bought with such an alms would have choked
me at the first mouthful
ralph looked at his quondam friend with
an air wonder not unmixed with contempt
 well he said at length no
occasion for passion each man knows his
the abbot 
own stomach best but were i on a black
moor at this time day not knowing whither
i was going i would be glad to have
a broad piece or two in my pouch come
by them as i could but perhaps you will
go with me to my father's that is for a
night for tomorrow we expect my uncle
menelaus and all his folk but as i said for
one night 
the coldblooded limitation the offered
shelter to one night only and that tendered
most unwillingly offended the pride
 the discarded favourite
 i would rather sleep on the fresh heather
as i have done many a night on less
occasion said roland graeme than in
that smoky garret your father's that
smells peat smoke and usquebaugh like a
highlander's plaid
 you may chuse my master if you are
so nice replied ralph fisher you maybe
glad to smell a peatfire and usquebaugh
too if you journey long in the fashion you
propose you might have said godamercy
vol i g
 the abbot
for your proffer though it is not every one
will put themselves in the way illwill by
harbouring a discarded serving man
 ralph said roland graeme i would
pray you to remember that i have switched
you before now and this is the same
riding wand which you have tasted
ralph who was a thickset clownish figure
arrived at his full strength and conscious
 the most complete personal superiority
laughed contemptuously at the threats 
the slight made stripling
it may be the same wand he said
but not the same hand and that is as
good rhyme as if it were in a ballad look
you my lady's page that was when your
switch was up it was no fear you but
 your betters that kept mine down and
i wot not what hinders me from clearing
old scores with this hazel rung and shewing
you it was your lady's livery coat which
i spared and not your flesh and blood
master roland
in the midst his rage roland graeme
the abbot 
was just wise enough to see that by continuing
this altercation he would subject
himself to very rude treatment from the
boor who was so much older and stronger
than himself and while his antagonist with
a sort jeering laugh defiance seemed
to provoke the contest he felt the full bitterness
 his own degraded condition and
burst into a passion tears which he in
vain endeavoured to conceal with both his
hands
even the rough churl was moved with
the distress his quondam companion
 nay master roland he said i did
but as twere jest with thee i would not
harm thee man were it but for old acquaintance
sake but ever look to a man's
inches ere you talk switching why
thine arm man is but like a spindle compared
to mine but hark i hear old adam
woodcock hollowing to his hawk come
along man we will have a merry afternoon
and go jolly to my father's in spite the
peatsmoke and usquebaugh to boot maybe
we may put you into some honest way
 the abbot
 winning your bread though it's hard to
come by in these broken times
the unfortunate page made no answer
nor did he withdraw his hands from his face
and fisher continued in what he imagined
a suitable tone comfort
 why man when you were my lady's
minions men held you proud and some
thought you a papist and i wot not what
and so now that you have no one to bear
you out you must be companionable and
hearty and wait on the minister's examinations
and put these things out folk's
head and if he says you are in fault you
must jour your head to the stream and if
a gentleman or a gentleman's gentleman
gives you a rough word or a light blow
you must only say thank you for dusting
my doublet or the like as i have done
by you but hark to woodcock's whistle
again come and i will teach you all the
trick on't as we go on
 i thank you said roland graeme endeavouring
to assume an air indifference
and superiority j but i have another
the abbot 
path before me and were it otherwise 
could not tread in yours
 very true master roland replied the
clown and every man knows his own
matters best and so i will not keep you
from the path as you say give us a grip
 your hand man for auld lang syne 
what not clap palms ere we part well
so be it a wilful man will have his way 
and so farewell and the blessing the
morning to you
 goodmorrow goodmorrow said
roland hastily and the clown walked
lightly off whistling as he went and glad
apparently to be rid an acquaintance
whose claims might be troublesome and
who had no longer the means to be serviceable
to him
roland graeme compelled himself to walk
on while they were within sight each
other that his former inmate might not augur
any vacillation purpose or uncertainty
 object from his remaining on the
same spot j but the effort was a painful one
 the abbot
he seemed stunned as it were and giddy 
the earth on which he stood felt as if unsound
and quaking under his feet like
the surface a bog and he had once or
twice nearly fallen though the path he trod
was firm greensward he kept resolutely
moving forward in spite the internal
agitation to which these symptoms belonged
until the distant form his acquaintance
disappeared behind the slope 
a hill when his heart gave way at once 
and sitting down on the turf remote from
human ken he gave way to the natural expressions
 wounded pride grief and fear
and wept with unrestrained profusion and
unqualified bitterness
when the first violent paroxysm his
feelings had subsided the deserted and
friendless youth felt that mental relief which
usually follows such discharges sorrow
the tears continued to chase each other
down his cheeks but they were no longer
accompanied by the same sense desolation
j an afflicting yet milder sentiment was
the abbot 
awakened in his mind by the recollection
 his benefactress the unwearied kindness
which had attached her to him in spite
 many acts provoking petulance now
recollected as offences a deep dye which
had protected him against the machinations
 others as well as against the consequences
 his own folly and would have
continued to do so had not the excess 
his presumption compelled her to withdraw
her protection
whatever indignity i have borne he
said has been the just reward my own
ingratitude and have i done well to accept
the hospitality the more than maternal
kindness my protectress yet to detain
from her the knowledge my religion 
but she shall know that a catholic has as
much gratitude as a puritan that i have
been thoughtless but not wicked that in
my wildest moments i have loved respected
and honoured her and that the orphan
boy might indeed be heedless but was never
ungrateful
 the abbot
he turned as these thoughts passed
through his mind and began hastily to retread
his footsteps towards the castle but
he checked the first eagerness his repentant
haste when he reflected on the
scorn and contempt with which the family
were likely to see the return the fugitive
humbled as they must necessarily suppose
him into a supplicant who requested
pardon for his fault and permission to return
to his service he slackened his pace
but he stood not still
i care not he resolutely determined 
let them wink point nod sneer speak
 the conceit which is humbled the
pride which has had a fall i care not it
is a penance due to my folly and i will
endure it with patience but if she also
my benefactress if she also should think
me sordid and weakspirited enough to beg
not for her pardon alone but for a renewal
 the advantages which i derived from her
favour r suspicion my meanness i
cannot i will not brook
the abbot 
he stood still and his pride rallying with
constitutional obstinacy against his more
just feeling urged that he would incur the
scorn the lady avenel rather than
obtain her favour by following the course
which the first ardour his repentant feelings
had dictated to him
if i had but some plausible pretext
he thought some ostensible reason for
my return some reason to allege which
might shew i came not as a degraded supplicant
or a discarded menial i might go
thither but as i am i cannot my heart
would leap from its place and burst
as these thoughts passed through his
mind something passed in the air so near
him as to dazzle his eyes and almost to
brush the plume in his cap he looked up
it was the favourite falcon sir halbert
which flying around his head seemed to
claim his attention as that a wellknown
friend roland extended his arm and gave
the wellknown whoop and the falcon 

 the abbot
scanty settled on his wrist and began to
prune itself glancing at the youth from
time to time an acute and brilliant glance
 its hazel eye which seemed to ask why
he caressed it not with his usual fondness
ah diamond he said as if the bird
understood him thou and i must be strangers
henceforward many a gallant stoop
have i seen thee make and many a brave
heron strike down but that is all over and
there is no hawking more for me
 and why not master roland said
adam woodcock the falconer who came
at that instant from behind a few alder
bushes which had concealed him from view
why should there be no more hawking
for you why man what were our life
without our sports thou know'st the jolly
old song
and rather would allan in dungeon lie
than live at large where the falcon cannot fly 
and allan would rather lie in sexton's pound
than live where he follow'd not the merry hawk and
hound
the abbot 
the voice the honest falconer was
hearty and friendly and the tone in which
he half sung half recited his rude ballad
implied honest frankness and cordiality
but remembrance their quarrel and its
consequences embarrassed roland and prevented
his reply the falconer saw his hesitation
and guessed the cause
what now said he master roland 
do you who are half an englishman think
that i who am a whole one would keep up
anger at you and you in distress that
were like some the scots my master's
reverence always excepted who can be
fair and false and wait their time and keep
their mind as they say to themselves and
touch pot and flagon with you and hunt
and hawk with you and after all when time
serves pay off some old feud with the point
 the dagger canny yorkshire has no
memory for such old sores why man an
you had hit me a rough blow maybe i
would rather have taken it from you thana
rough word from another j for you have a
 the abbot
good notion falconry though you stand
up for washing the meat for the classes
so give us your hand man and bear no
malice
roland though he felt his proud blood
rebel at the familiarity honest adam's
address could not resist its downright frankness
covering his face with the one hand
he held out the other to the falconer and
returned with readiness his friendly grasp
why this is hearty now said woodcock
 i always said you had a kind heart
though you have a spice the devil in
your disposition that is certain i came
this way with the falcon on purpose to find
you and yon halfbred hubbard told me
which way you took flight you ever
thought too much that kestrelkite master
roland and he knows nought sport
after all but what he caught from you i
saw how it had been betwixt you and i
sent him out my company with a wanton
i would rather have a rifler on my perch
than a false knave at my elbow and now
the abbot 
master roland tell me what way wing
ye 
 that is as god pleases replied the
page with a sigh which he could not suppress

 nay man never droop a feather for
being cast off said the falconer who
knows but you may soar the better and
fairer flight for all this yet look at diamond
there tis a noble bird and shews
gallantly with his hood and bells and jesses 
but there is many a wild falcon in norway
that would not change properties with him
 and that is what i would say you
you are no longer my lady's page and you
will not clothe so fair or feed so well or
sleep so soft or shew so gallant what 
all that if you are not her page you are
your own man and may go where you will
without minding whoop or whistle the
worst is the loss the sport but who knows
what you may come to they say that sir
halbert himself i speak with reverence
was once glad to be the abbot's forester
 the abbot
and now he has hounds and hawks his
own and adam woodcock for a falconer
to the boot
 you are right and say well adam
answered the youth the blood mantling in
his cheeks the falcon will soar higher
without his bells than with them though
the bells be made silver
that is cheerily spoken answered the
falconer and whither now 
 i thought going to the abbey 
kennaquhair answered roland grme
 to ask the counsel father ambrose
 and joy go with you said the falconer
 though it is like you may find the
old monks in some sorrow they say the
commons are threatening to turn them out
 their cells and make a devil's mass it
in the old church thinking they have forborne
that sport too long and troth i am
clear the same opinion
 then will father ambrose be the better
 having a friend beside him said the
page manfully
ay but my young fearnought rethe
abbot 
plied the falconer the friend will scarce
be the better being beside father ambrose
 he may come by the redder's lick
and that is ever the worst the battle
i care not for that said the page the
dread a lick should not hold me back 
but i fear i may bring trouble between the
brothers by visiting father ambrose i
will tarry tonight at saint cuthbert's cell
where the old priest will give me a night's
shelter and i will send to father ambrose
to ask his advice before i go down to the
convent
 by our lady said the falconer and
that is a likely plan and now he continued
exchanging his frankness manner
for a sort awkward embarrassment as if
he had somewhat to say that he had no
ready means to bring out and now you
wot well that i wear a pouch for my hawks
 meat and so forth but wot you what it is
lined with master roland 
with leather to be sure replied roland
somewhat surprised at the hesitation
 the abbot
with which adam woodcock asked a question
so simple
with leather lad said woodcock 
 ay and with silver to the boot that
see here he said shewing a secret slit in
the lining his bag office here they
are thirty good harry groats as ever were
struck in bluff old hall's time and ten 
them are right heartily at your service and
now the murder is out
roland's first idea was to refuse this assistance
 but he recollected the vows humility
which he had just taken upon him
and it occurred that this was the opportunity
to put his newformed resolution to
the test assuming a strong command 
himself he answered adam woodcock with
as much frankness as his nature permitted
him to wear in doing what was so contrary
to his inclinations that he accepted
thankfully his kind offer while to sooth
his own reviving pride he could not help
adding he hoped soon to requite the
obligation
the abbot ll
 that as you list that as you list
young man said the falconer with glee
counting out and delivering to his young
friend the supply he had so generously offered
and then adding with great chearfulness
 now you may go through the
world for he that can back a horse wind a
horn hollow a greyhound fly a hawk and
play at sword and buckler with a whole
pair shoes a green jacket and ten lilywhite
groats in his pouch may bid father
care hang himself in his own jesses farewell
and god be with you
so saying and as if desirous to avoid the
thanks his companion he turned hastily
round and left roland greene to pursue
his journey alone

chapter viii
the sacred tapers lights are gone
grey moss has clad the altar stone
the holy image is o'erthrown
the bell has ceased to toll
the long ribb'd aisles are burst and sunk
the holy shrines to ruin sunk
departed is the pious monk
god's blessing on his soul
rediviva
the cell saint cuthbert as it was
called marked or was supposed to mark
one those restingplaces which that venerable
saint was pleased to assign to his
monks when his convent being driven
from lindisfarne by the danes became a
peripatetic society religionists and bearing
their patron's body on their shoulders
transported him from place to place through
scotland and the borders england until
he was pleased at length to spare them
the abbot 
the pain bearing him farther and to
chuse his ultimate place rest in the lordly
towers durham the odour his
sanctity remained behind him at each place
where he had granted the monks a transient
respite from their labours and proud
were those who could assign as his temporary
restingplace any spot within their vicinity
few were more celebrated and honoured
than the wellknown cell saint
cuthbert to which roland graeme now
bent his way situated considerably to the
northwest the great abbey kenna
quhair on which it was dependent in the
neighbourhood were some those recommendations
which weighed with the experienced
priesthood rome in chusing
their sites for places religion
there was a well possessed some medicinal
qualities which course claimed
the saint for its guardian and patron and
occasionally produced some advantage to
the recluse who inhabited his cell since
 the abbot
none could reasonably be expected to be
benefited by the fountain who did not extend
their bounty to the saint's chaplain
a few roods fertile land afforded the
monk his plot garden ground an eminence
well clothed with trees rose behind
the cell and sheltered it from the north
and the east while the front opening to
the southwest looked up a wild but pleasant
valley down which wandered a lively
brook which battled with every stone
that interrupted its passage
the cell itself was rather plainly that
rudely built a low gothic building with
two small apartments one which served
the priest for his dwellingplace the other
for his chapel as there were few the
secular clergy who durst venture to reside
so near the border the assistance this
monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless
to the community while the catholic
religion retained the ascendancy as he
could marry christen and administer the
the abbot 
other sacraments the roman church 
late however as the protestant doctrines
gained ground he had found it convenient
to live in close retirement and to avoid as
much as possible drawing upon himself
observation or animadversion the appearance
 his habitation however when roland
graeme came before it in the close 
the evening plainly shewed that his caution
had been finally ineffectual
the page's first movement was to knock
at the door when he observed to his surprise
that it was open not from being left
unlatched but because beat off its upper
hinge it was only fastened to the doorpost
by the lower and could therefore no longer
perform its functions somewhat alarmed
at this and receiving no answer when
he knocked and called roland began to
look more at leisure upon the exterior 
the little dwellings before he ventured to
enter it the flowers which had been
trained with care against the walls seemed
to have been recently torn down and 
the abbot
ed their dishonoured garlands on the earth 
the latticed window was broken and dashed
in the garden which the monk had
maintained by his constant labour in the
highest order and beauty bore marks 
having been lately trod down and destroyed
by the hoofs animals and the feet 
men
the sainted spring had not escaped it
was wont to arise beneath a canopy ribbed
arches with which the devotion elder
times had secured and protected its healing
waters these arches were now almost
entirely demolished and the stones
 which they were built were tumbled into
the well as if with the purpose choking
up and destroying the fountain which as it
had shared in other days the honour the
saint was in the present doomed to partake
his unpopularity part the roof had
been pulled down from the house itself
and an attempt had been made with crows
and levers upon one the angles by
which several large cornerstones had been
the abbot 
forced out their place but the solidity
 ancient masonwork had proved too
great for the time or patience the assailants
and they had relinquished their task
 destruction such dilapidated buildings
after the lapse years during which nature
has gradually covered the effects violence
with creeping plants and with weather
stains exhibit amid their decay a melancholy
beauty but when the visible effects
 violence appear raw and recent
there is no feeling to mitigate the sense 
devastation with which they impress the
spectators and such was now the scene
on which the youthful page gazed with the
painful feelings it was qualified to excite
when his first momentary surprise was
over roland grseme was at no loss to conjecture
the cause these ravages the
destruction the popish edifices did not
take place at once throughout scotland but
at different times and according to the spirit
which actuated the reformed clergy 
some whom instigated their hearers to
s the abbot
these acts demolition and others with
better taste and feeling endeavoured to protect
the ancient shrines while they desired
to see them purified from the objects which
had attracted idolatrous devotion from
time to time therefore the populace the
scottish towns and villages when instigated
either by their own feelings abhorrence
for popish superstition or by the zealous
doctrines the more zealous preachers
resumed the work destruction and exercised
it upon some sequestered church
chapel or cell which had escaped the
first burst their indignation against the
religion rome in many places the vices
 the catholic clergy arising out the
wealth and the corruption that tremendous
hierarchy furnished too good an apology
for wreaking vengeance upon the
splendid edifices which they inhabited and
 this an old scottish historian gives a remarkable
instance
 t i u 
 the abbot
lady avenel said the page as thy
look and words seem to imply i have eaten
her bread i have experienced her favour
i will neither injure nor betray her
 that hereafter my son said she 
but learn this that it is not for thee to
capitulate in thy duty and to say this will
i do and that will i leave undone no
roland god and man vill no longer abide
the wickedness this generation seest
thou these fragments knowest thou what
they represent and canst thou think it is
for thee to make distinctions amongst a
race so cursed by heaven that they renounce
violate blaspheme and destroy
whatsoever we are commanded to believe
in whatsoever we are commanded to reverence

asshe spoke she bent her head towards
the broken image with a countenance in
which strong resentment and zeal were
mingled with an expression ecstatic devotion
 she raised her left hand aloft as in
the act making a vow and thus proceedthe
abbot 
ed bear witness for me holy saint within
whose violated temple we stand that as
it is not for vengeance my own that my
hate pursues these people so neither for
any favour or earthly affection towards any
amongst them will i withdraw my hand
from the plough when it shall pass over
the devoted furrow bear witness holy
saint once thyself a wanderer and fugitive
as we are now bear witness mother 
mercy queen heaven bear witness
saints and angels 
in this high strain enthusiasm she
stood raising her eyes through the fractured
roof the vault to the stars which
now began to twinkle through the pale twilight
while the long grey tresses which
hung down over her shoulders waved in the
jaightbreeze which the chasm and fractured
windows admitted freely
roland graeme was too much awed by
early habits as well as by the mysterious
import her words to ask for further explanation
 the purpose she obscurely hint
h 
 the abbot
ed at nor did she farther press him on the
subject j for having concluded her prayer
or obtestation by clasping her hands together
with solemnity and then signing
herself with the cross she again addressed
her grandson in a tone more adapted to
the ordinary business life
 thou must hence she said roland
thou must hence lout not till morning 
and now how wilt thou shift for thy night's
quarters thou hast been more softly bred
than when we were companions in the
misty hills cumberland and lauderdale

 i have at least preserved my good mother
the habits which i then learned can
lie hard and think it no hardship since
 have been a wanderer i have been a hunter
and fisher and fowler and each these
is accustomed to sleep freely in a worse shelter
than sacrilege has left us here
 than sacrilege has left us here said
the matron repeating his words and pausing
on them most true my son and
the abbot 
god's faithful children are now worst sheltered
when they lodge in god's own house
and the demesne his blessed saints we
shall sleep cold here under the night wind
which whistles through the breaches which
heresy has made they shall lie warmer
who made them ay and through a long
hereafter
notwithstanding the wild and singular
expressions this female she seemed to
retain towards roland graeme in a strong
degree that affectionate and sedulous love
which women bear to their nurslings and
the children dependent on their care it
seemed as if she would not permit him todo
aught for himself which in former days
her attention had been used to do for him
and that she considered the tall stripling
before her as being equally dependent on
her careful attention as when he was the
orphan child who had owed all to her affectionate
solicitude
what hast thou to eat now she said
as leaving the chapel they went into the
 the abbot
deserted habitation the priest or what
means kindling a fire to defend thee
from this raw and inclement air poor
child thou hast made slight provision fora
long journey nor hast thou skill to help
thyself by wit when means are scanty but
our lady has placed by thy side one to
whom want in all its forms is as familiar as
plenty and splendour have formerly been
and with want roland come the arts 
which she is the inventor
with an active and officious diligence
which strangely contrasted with her late
abstracted and high tone catholic devotion
she set about her domestic arrangements
for the evening a pouch which
was hidden under her garment produced
a flint and steel and from the scattered
fragments around those pertaining to the
image saint cuthbert scrupulously excepted
she obtained splinters sufficient to
raise a sparkling and cheerful fire on the
hearth the deserted cell
and now she said for needful food
the abbot 
think not it mother said roland
 unless you yourself feel hunger it is a
little thing for me to endure a night's abstinence
and a small atonement for the necessary
transgression the rules the
church upon which i was compelled during
my stay in the castle
hunger for myself answered the matron
 know youth that a mother knows
not hunger till that her child is satisfied
and with affectionate inconsistence totally
different from her usual manner she added
 roland you must not fast you have
dispensation you are young and to youth
food and sleep are necessaries not to be
dispensed with husband your strength
my child your sovereign your religion
your country require it let age macerate
by fast and vigil a body which can only
suffer j let youth in these active times
nourish the limbs and the strength which
action requires
while she thus spoke the scrip which
had produced the means striking fire
 the abbot
furnished provision for a meal which she
herself scarce partook but anxiously watched
her charge taking a pleasure resembling
that an epicure in each morsel
which he swallowed with a youthful appetite
which abstinence had rendered unusually
sharp roland readily obeyed her
recommendations and eat the food which
she so affectionately and earnestly placed
before him but she shook her head when
invited by him in return to partake the
refreshment her own cares had furnished 
and when his solicitude became more pressing
she refused him in a loftier tone rejection

young man she said you know
not to whom or what you speak they
to whom heaven declares its purpose must
merit its communication by mortifying the
senses they have that within which requires
not the superfluity earthly nutriment
which is necessary to those who
are without the sphere the vision to
them the watch spent in prayer is a rethe
abbot 
pressing slumber and the sense doing
the will heaven is a richer banquet than
the tables monarchs can spread before
them but do thou sleep soft my son
she said relapsing from the tone fanaticism
into that maternal affection and
tenderness j do thou sleep sound while
life is but young with thee and the cares
 the day can be drowned in the slumbers
 the evening different is thy duty and
mine and as different the means by which
we must qualify and strengthen ourselves
to perform it from thee is demanded
strength body from me strength 
soul
when she thus spoke she prepared with
ready address a palletcouch composed
partly the dried leaves which had once
furnished a bed to the solitary and the
guests who occasionally received his hospitality
and which neglected by the destroyers
 his humble cell had remained
little disturbed in the corner allotted for
them to these her care added some 
n
 the abbot
the vestures which lay torn and scattered
on the floor with a zealous hand she selected
all such as appeared to have made
any part the sacerdotal vestments laying
them aside as sacred from ordinary purposes
and with the rest she made with
dexterous promptness such a bed as a
weary man might willingly stretch himself
on j and during the time she was preparing
it rejected even with acrimony any attempt
which the youth made to assist her
or any entreaty which he urged that she
would accept the place rest for her
own use sleep thou said she roland
graeme sleep thou the persecuted
the disinherited orphan the son an illfated
mother sleep thou i go to pray in
the chapel beside thee
the manner was too enthusiastically earnest
too obstinately firm to permit roland
graeme to dispute her will any further yet
he felt some shame in giving way to it it
seemed as if she had forgotten the years
that had passed away since their meeting j
 
the abbot 
and expected to meet in the tall indulged
and wilful youth whom she had recovered
the passive obedience the child whom
she had left in the castle avenel this
did not fail to hurt her grandson's characteristic
and constitutional pride he obeyed
indeed awed into submission by the
sudden recurrence former subordination
and by feelings affection and gratitude
still however he felt the yoke
 have i relinquished the hawk and the
hound he said to become the pupil 
her pleasure as if i were still a child i
whom even my envious mates allowed to
be superior in those exercises which they
took most pains to acquire and which came
to me naturally as if a knowledge them
had been my birthright this may not and
must not be i will be no reclaimed 
who is carried hooded on a woman's
wrist and has his quarry only shewn
to him when his eyes are uncovered for his
flight i will know her purpose ere it is
proposed to me to aid it
 the abbot
these and other thoughts streamed
through the mind roland graeme and
although wearied with the fatigues the
day it was long ere he could compose himself
to rest
the abbot 
chapter 
kneel with me swear it tis not in words i trust
save when they're fenced with an appeal to heaven
old flay
after passing the night in that sound
sleep for which agitation and fatigue had
prepared him roland was awakened by
the fresh morning air and by the beams
 the rising sun his first feeling was
that surprise for instead looking
forth from a turret window on the waters
 the lake avenel which was the prospect
his former apartment afforded an
latticed aperture gave him the view 
the demolished garden the banished
anchorite he sate up on his couch 
leaves and arranged in his memory not
 the abbot
without surprise the singular events the
preceding day which appeared the more surprising
the more he considered them he
had lost the protectress his youth and
in the same day he had recovered the
guide and guardian his childhood the
former deprivation he felt ought to be matter
 unceasing regret and it seemed as if
the latter could hardly be the subject 
unmixed self congratulation he remembered
this person who had stood to him in
the relation a mother as equally affectionate
in her attention and absolute in
her authority a singular mixture love
and fear attended upon his early remembrances
as they were connected with her 
and the fear that she might desire to resume
the same absolute controul over his
motions a fear which her conduct yesterday
did not tend much to dissipate
weighed heavily against the joy this second
meeting
 she cannot mean said his rising pride
to lead and direct me as a pupil when i
the abbot 
am at the age judging my own actions
 this she cannot mean or meaning
it will feel herself strangely deceived
a sense gratitude towards the person
against whom his heart thus rebelled checked
his course feeling he resisted the
thoughts which involuntarily arose in his
mind as he would have resisted an actual
instigation the foul fiend and to aid
him in his struggles he felt for his beads
but in his hasty departure from the castle
 avenel he had forgotten and left them
behind him
 this is yet worse he said but two
things i learned her under the most
deadly charge secrecy to tell my beads
and to conceal that i did so and i have
kept my word till now and when she shall
ask me for the rosary i must say i have
forgotten it do i deserve she should believe
me when i say i have kept the secret
 my faith when i set so light by its symbol

 the abbot
he paced the floor in anxious agitation
in fact his attachment to his faith was 
a nature very different from that which animated
the enthusiastic matron but which
notwithstanding it would have been his last
thought to relinquish
the early charges impressed on him by
his grandmother had been instilled into a
mind and memory a character peculiarly
tenacious child as he was he was proud
 the confidence reposed in his discretion
and resolved to shew that it had not been
rashly entrusted to him at the same time
his resolution was no more than that a
child and must necessarily have gradually
faded away under the operation both
 precept and example during his residence
at the castle avenel but for the
exhortations father ambrose who in
his lay state had been called edward glendining
this zealous monk had been apprized
by an unsigned letter placed in his
hand by a pilgrim that a child educated in
the abbot 
the catholic faith was now in the castle 
avenel perilously situated so was the
scroll expressed as ever the three children
who were cast into the fiery furnace persecution
the letter threw upon father
ambrose the fault should this solitary
lamb unwillingly left within the demesnes
 the prowling wolf become his final prey
there needed no farther exhortation to
the monk than the idea that a soul might
be endangered and that a catholic might
become an apostate and he made his visits
more frequent than usual to the castle
 avenel lest through want the private
encouragement and instruction which
he always found some opportunity dispensing
the church should lose a proselyte
and according to the romish creed
the devil acquire a soul
still these interviews were rare and
though they encouraged the solitary boy
to keep his secret and hold fast his religion
they were neither frequent nor long enough
to inspire him with any thing beyond a
 the abbot
blind attachment to the observances which
the priest recommended he adhered to
the forms his religion rather because he
felt it would be dishonourable to change
that his fathers than from any rational
or sincere belief its mysterious doctrines
it was a principal part the distinction
which in his own opinion singled him out
from those with whom he lived and gave
him an additional though an internal and
concealed reason for contemning those 
the household who shewed an undisguised
dislike him and for hardening himself
against the instructions the chaplain
henry warden
the fanatic preacher he thought
within himself during some one the
chaplain's frequent discourses against the
church rome he little knows whose
ears are receiving his profane doctrine and
with what contempt and abhorrence they
hear his blasphemies against the holy religion
by which kings have been crowned
and for which martyrs have died
the abbot 
but in such proud feelings defiance
 heresy as it was termed and its professors
which associated the catholic religion
with a sense generous independence
and that the protestants with the
subjugation his mind and temper to the
direction mr warden began and ended
the faith roland gramme who independently
 the pride singularity
sought not to understand and had no one
to expound to him the peculiarities the
tenets which he professed his regret
therefore at missing the rosary which had
been conveyed to him through the hands
 father ambrose was rather the shame
 a soldier who has dropped his cockade
or badge service than that a religionist
who had forgotten a visible symbol 
his religion
his thoughts on the subject however
were mortifying and the more so from apprehension
that his negligence must reach
the ears his relative he felt it could
vol i i
f the abbor
be no one but her who had secretly transmitted
these beads to father ambrose for
his use and that his carelessness was but
an indifferent requital her kindness
nor will she omit to ask me about them
said he to himself for her's is a zeal which
age cannot quell and if she has not quitted
her wont my answer will not fail to incense
her
while he thus communed with himself
magdalen graeme entered the apartment
the blessing the morning on your
youthful head my son she said with a
solemnity expression which thrilled the
youth to the heart so sad and earnest did
the benediction flow from her lips in a tone
where devotion was blended with affection
and thou hast started thus early from thy
couch to catch the first breath the dawn
but it is not well my roland enjoy slumber
while thou canst the time is not far
behind when the waking eye must be thy
portion as well as mine
the abbot 
she littered these words with an affectionate
and anxious tone which shewed
that devotional as were the habitual exercises
 her minds the thoughts her nursling
yet bound her to earth with the cords
 human affection and passion
but she abode not long in a mood which
she probably regarded as a momentary dereliction
 her imaginary high calling 
 come she said youth up and be doing
 it is time that we leave this place
and whither do we go said the young
man or what is the object our journey
r
the matron stepped back and gazed on
him with surprise not unmingled with displeasure

to what purpose such a question she
said is it not enough that i lead the
way hast thou lived with heretics till
thou hast learned to instal the vanity 
thine own private judgment in place 
due honour and obedience 
 the abbot
the time thought roland graeme within
himself is already come when i must
establish my freedom or be a willing thrall
for ever i feel that i must speedily look
to it
she instantly fulfilled his foreboding by
recurring to the theme by which her
thoughts seemed most constantly engrossed
although when she pleased no one
could so perfectly disguise her religion
thy beads my son hast thou told thy
beads 
koland graeme coloured high he felt
the storm was approaching but scorned to
avert it by a falsehood
i have forgot my rosary at the castle
 avenel
 forgot thy rosary exclaimed she 
false both to religion and to natural duty
hast thou lost what was sent so far and at
such risk a token the truest affection
that should have been every bead it as
dear to thee as thine eyebails i
i
the abbot 
 i am grieved it should have so chanced
mother said the youth and much did i
value the token as coming from you for
what remains i trust to win gold enough
when i push my way in the world and till
then beads black oak or a rosary nuts
must serve the turn
 hear him said his grandmother 
 young as he is he hath learned already
the lessons the devil's school the rosary
consecrated by the holy father himself
and sanctified by his blessings is buta
few knobs gold whose value may be
replaced by the wages his profane labour
and whose virtue may be supplied by a
string hazel nuts this is heresy so
henry warden the wolf who ravages the
flock the shepherd hath taught thee to
speak and to think
 mother said roland graeme am
no heretic i believe and i pray according
to the rules our church this misfortune
i regret but i cannot amend it
 the abbot
 thou canst repent it though replied
his spiritual directress repent it in dust
and ashes atone for it by fasting prayer
and penance instead looking on me with
a countenance as light as if thou hadst lost
but a button from thy cap
 mother said roland be appeased 
i will remember my fault in the next 
confession which i have space and oppor 
tunitv to make and will do whatsoever the
priest requires me in atonement for
the heaviest fault i can do no more but
mother he added after a moment's pause
 let me not incur your farther displeasure
if i ask whither our journey is bound and
what is its object i am no longer a child
but a man and at my own disposal with 
down upon my chin and a sword by my
side i will go to the the world with
you to do your pleasure but i owe it to
myself to enquire the purpose and direction
 our travels
you owe it to yourself ungrateful boy 
the abbot 
replied his relative passion rapidly supplying
the colour which age had long chased
from her features to yourself you owe
nothing you can owe nothing to me you
owe every thing your life when an infant
your support while a child the means
 instruction and the hopes honour 
and sooner than thou shouldst abandon the
noble cause to which i have devoted thee
would i see thee lie a corpse at my feet
roland was alarmed at the vehement agitation
with which she spoke and which
threatened to overpower her aged frame 
and he hastened to reply i forget nothing
 what owe to you my dearest
mother shew me how my blood can testify
my gratitude and you shall judge if i
spare it but blindfold obedience has in it
as little merit as reason
 saints and angels replied magdalen
and do i hear these words from the child
 my hopes the nursling by whose bed i
have kneeled and for whose weal i have
wearied every saint in heaven with prayers 
 the abbot
roland by obedience only canst thou shew
thy affection and thy gratitude what avails
itthatyoumight perchance adopt recourse
i propose to thee were it to be fully explained
 thou wouldst not then follow
my command but thine own judgment 
thou wouldst not do the will heaven
communicated through thy best friend to
whom thou west thine all but thou wouldst
observe the blinded dictates thine own
imperfect reason hear me roland a lot
calls thee solicits thee demands thee 
the proudest to which man can be destined
and it uses the voice thine earliest thy
best thy only friend wilt thou resist it 
then go thy way leave me here my hopes
on earth are gone and withered i will
kneel me down before yonder profaned altar
and when the raging heretics return
they shall dye it with the blood a martyr

but my dearest mother said roland
grseme whose early recollections her
violence were formidably renewed by these
the abbot 
wild expressions reckless passion i
will not forsake you i will abide with you
worlds shall not force me from your side
i will protect i will defend you i will
live with you and die for you
 one word my son were worth all these
say only i will obey you
doubt it not mother replied the
youth i will and that with all my heart 
only
nay i receive no qualifications thy
promise said magdalen graeme catching
at the word the obedience which i require
is absolute and blessing on thee thou
darling memory my beloved child that
thou hast power to make a promise so hard
to human pride trust me well that in
the design in which thou doest embark
thou hast for thy partners the mighty and
the valiant the power the church and
the pride the noble succeed or fail
live or die thy name shall be among those
with whom success or failure is alike glow

 the abbot
rioiis death or life alike desirous forward
then forward ife is short and our plan
is laborious angels saints and the whole
blessed host heaven have their eyes even
now on this barren and blighted land 
scotland what say i on scotland their
eye is on isj roland on the frail woman
on the inexperienced youth who amidst
the ruins which sacrilege hath made in the
holy place devote themselves to god's
cause and that their lawful sovereign
amen so be it the blessed eyes saints
and martyrs vhich see our resolve shall
witness the execution or their ears which
hear our vow shall hear our deathgroan
drawn in the sacred cause
while thus speaking she held roland
greene firmly ith one hand while she
pointed upward with the other to leave
him as it were no means protest against
the obtestation to which he vas thus made
a party alien she had finished her appeal
to heaven she left him no leisure for farther
hesitation or for asking any explana
the abbot 
tion her purpose but passing with the
same ready transition as formerly to the solicitous
attentions an anxious parent
overwhelmed him with questions concerning
his residence in the castel avenel
and the qualities and accomplishments he
had acquired
 it is well she said when she had exhausted
her enquiries my gay goeshawk
hath been well trained and will soar high 
but those who bred him will have cause
to fear as well as to wonder at his flight let
us now she said to our morning meal
and care not though it be a scanty one a
few hours walk will bring us to more friendly
quarters
they broke their fast accordingly on
such fragments as remained their yesterday's
provision and immediately set out on
their farther journey magdalen gramme led
the way with a firm and active step much
beyond her years and roland grahame followed
pensive and anxious and far from
 the abbot
satisfied with the state dependence to
which he seemed again to be reduced
am i for ever he said to himself to be
devoured with the desire independence
and free agency and yet to be for ever led
on by circumstances to follow the will

she dwelt unnoticed and alone
 beside the springs dove 
a maid whom there was none to praise
and very few to love
wordsworth
in the course their journey the travellers
spoke little to each other magdalen
graeme chaunted from time to time ina
low voice a part some one those
beautiful old latin hymns which belong to
the catholic service muttered an ave or a
credo and so passed on lost in devotional
contemplation the meditations her
grandson were more bent on mundane matters
 and many a time as a moorfovvl arose
from the heath and shot along the moor uttering
his bold crow defiance he thought

where the low trees and bushes were intermingled
with tall fern furze and broom so
as to form a thick and intricate cover his
dreams were a roebuck and a brace 
gazehounds but frequently his mind returned
to the benevolent and kind mistress
whom he had left behind him offended justly
and unreconciled by any effort his
my step would be lighter he thought
and so would my heart could i but have
returned to see her for one instant and to
say lady the orphanboy was wild but not
ungrateful
traveling in these divers moods about
the hour noon they reached a small
straggling village in which as usual were
seen one or two those predominating
towers or peelhouses which for reasons
 defence elsewhere detailed were at that
time to be found in every border hamlet
a brook flowed beside the village and watered
the valley in which it stood there
was also a mansion at the the village
the abbot 
and a little way separated from it much
dilapidated and in very bad order but appearing
to have been the abode persons
 some consideration the situation was
agreeable being an angle formed by the
stream bearing three or four large sycamore
trees which being in full leaf served
to relieve the dark appearance the mansion
which was built a deep red stone
the house itself had been a large one but
was now obviously too big for the inmates 
several windows were built up especially
those which opened from the lower storey 
others were blockaded in a less substantial
manner the court before the door which
had once been defended with a species 
low outer wall now ruinous was paved
but the stones were completely covered
with long grey nettles thistles and other
weeds which shooting up betwixt the flags
had displaced many them from their
level even matters demanding more peremptory
attention had been left neglected
 the abbot
in a manner vhich argued sloth or poverty
in the extreme the stream undermining
a part the bank near an angle the ruinous
wall had brought it down with a corner
turret the ruins which lay in the bed
 the river the current interrupted by
the ruins which it had overthrown and
turned yet nearer to the site the tower
had greatly enlarged the breach it had
made and was in the process undermining
the ground on which the house itself
stood unless it were speedily protected by
sufficient bulwarks
all this attracted roland graeme's observation
as they approached the dwelling by
a winding path which gave them at intervals
a view it from different points
if we go to yonder house he said to
his mother i trust it is but for a short visit
it looks as if two rainy days from the
northwest would send the whole into the
brook
you see but with the eyes the body
the abbot 
said the old woman god will defend
his own though it be forsaken and despised
 men better to dwell on the sand
under his law than fly to the rock human
trust
as she thus spoke they entered the
court before the old mansion and roland
could observe that the front it had formerly
been considerably ornamented with
carved work in the same darkcoloured
freestone which it was built but all
these ornaments had been broken down
and destroyed and only the shattered vestiges
 niches and entablatures now strewed
the place which they had once occupied
the larger entrance in front was walled up
but a little footpath which from its appearance
seemed to be rarely trodden led
to a small wicket defended by a door well
clenched with ironheaded nails at which
magdalen grme knocked three times
pausing betwixt each knock until she heard
an answering tap from within at the last
knock the wicket was opened by a pale
 the abbor
thin female who said benedicite qui ver i
nient in nomine domini they entered
and the portress hastily shut behind them
the wicket and made fast the massive fastenings
by which it was secured
the female led the way through a narrow
entrance into a vestibule some extent
paved with stone and having benches
 the same solid material ranged around
at the upper was an oriel window but
part the intervals formed by the stone
shafts and mullions was blocked up so that
the apartment was very gloomy
here they stopped and the mistress 
the mansion for such she was embraced
magdalen graeme and greeting her by the
title sister kissed her with much solemnity
on either side the face
the blessing our lady be upon you
my sister were her next words and they
left no doubt upon roland's mind respecting
the religion their hostess even if
he could have suspected his venerable and
zealous guide resting elsewhere than in
the abbot f
the habitation an orthodox catholic
they spoke together a few words in private
during which he had leisure to remark
more particularly the appearance 
his grandmother's friend
her age might be betwixt fifty and sixty 
her looks had a mixture melancholy and
unhappiness that bordered on discontent
and obscured the remains beauty which
age had still left on her features her
dress was the plainest and most ordinary
sort a dark colour and like magdalen
greene's something approaching to a religious
habit strict neatness and cleanliness
 person seemed to intimate that if poor
she was not reduced to squalid or heartbroken
distress and that she was still sufficiently
attached to life to retain a taste for its
decencies if not its elegancies her manner
as well as her features and appearance argued
an original condition and education
far above the meanness her present appearance
la short the whole figure was
such as to excite the idea that female
 the abbot
must have had a history worth knowing
while roland grasme was making this very
reflection the whispers the two females
ceased and the mistress the mansion
approaching him looked on his face and
person with much attention and as it seemed
some interest
 this then she said addressing his
relative is the child thine unhappy
daughter magdalen and him the only
shoot from your ancient tree you are willing
to devote to the good cause
yes by the rood answered magdalen
graeme in her usual tone resolved determination
 to the good cause i devote him
flesh and fell sinew and limb body and
soul
 thou art a happy woman sister magdalen
answered her companion that
lifted so high above human affection and
human feeling thou canst bind such a victim
to the horns the altar had i been
called to make such sacrifice to plunge a
youth so young and fair into the plots and
the abbot 
bloodthirsty dealings the time not the
patriarch abraham when he led isaac up
the mountain would have rendered more
melancholy obedience
she then continued to look at roland
with a mournful aspect compassion
until the intentness her gaze occasioned
his colour to rise and he was about to move
out its influence when he was stopped
by his grandmother with one hand while
with the other she divided the hair upon
his forehead which was now crimson with
bashfulness while she added with a mixture
 proud affection and firm resolution
 ay look at him well my sister for on
a fairer face thine eye never rested i too
when first i saw him felt as the worldly
feel and was half shaken in my purpose
but no wind can tear a leaf from the withered
tree which has long been stripped
 its foliage and no mere human casualty
can awaken the mortal feelings which have
long slept in the calm devotion
while the old woman thus spokes her
 the abbot
manner gave the lie to her assertions for
the tears rose to lier eyes while she added
but the fairer and the more spotless the
victim is it not my sister the more worthy
 acceptance she seemed glad to escape
from the sensations which agitated her and
instantly added he will escape my sister
 there will be a ram caught in the
thicket and the hand our revolted brethren
shall not be on the youthful joseph
heaven can defend its own rights even by
means babes and sucklings women
and beardless boys
heaven hath left us said the other
female for our sins and our fathers the
succours the blessed saints have abandoned
this accursed land we may win
the crown martyrdom but not that 
earthly triumph one too whose prudence
was at this deep crisis so indispensable has
been called to a better world the abbot
eustatius is no more
may his soul have mercy said magdalen
graeme and may heaven too have
the abbot 
mercy upon us who linger behind in this
bloody land his loss is indeed a perilous
blow to our enterprize for who remains behind
possessing his farfetched experience
his self devoted zeal his consummate wisdom
and his undaunted courage he hath
fallen with the church's standard in his
hand but god will raise up another to lift
the blessed banner whom have the chapter
elected in his room 
it is rumoured no one the few remaining
brethren dare accept the office
the heretics have sworn that they will permit
no future election and will heavily punish
any attempt to create a new abbot 
saint mary's coiijuiavermit inter se 
dictates projiciamus jaques ejus
quotisquejdomine answered magdalen
 this my sister were indeed a perilous
and fatal breach in our band but i am
firm in my belief that another will arise
in the place him so untimely removed
where is thy daughter catherine
 the abbot
 in the parlour answered the matron
 but she looked at roland graeme
and muttered something in the ear her
friend
fear it not answered magdalen graeme
it is both lawful and necessary fear nothing
from him i would he were as well
grounded in the faith by which alone comes
safety as he is free from thought deed or
speech villainy therein is the heretics
discipline to be commended my sister
that they train up their youth in strong morality
and choak up every inlet to youthful
folly
 it is but a cleansing the outside 
the cup answered her friend a whitening
 the sepulchre but he shall see catherine
since you sister judge it safe and
meet follow us youth she added and
led the way from the apartment with her
friend these were the only words which
the matron had addressed to roland graeme
who obeyed them in silence as they paced
the abbot 
through several winding passaigesafifi wafe
apartments with a very slow step the young
page had leisure to make some reflections on
his situation reflections a nature which
his ardent temper considered as specially
disagreeable it seemed he had now got
two mistresses or buttresses instead one
both elderly women and both it would
seem in league to direct his motions according
to their own pleasure and for the
accomplishment plans to which he was
no party this he thought was too much 
arguing reasonably enough that whatever
right his grandmother and benefactress had
to guide his motions she was neither entitled
to transfer her authority or to divide
it with another who seemed to assume
without ceremony the same tone absolute
command over him
but it shall not long continue thus
thought roland i will not be all my life
the slave a woman's whistle to live
upon her exhibition go when she bids and
vol i k
 the abbot
come when she calls no by saint andrew
 the hand that can hold the lance is
above the controul the distaff i will
leave them the slip'd collar in their hands
on the first opportunity and let them execute
their own devices by their own proper
force it may save them both from a peril
for i guess what they meditate is not like
to prove either safe or easy the earl 
murray and his heresy are too well rooted
to be grubbed up by two old women
as he spoke thus they entered a low
room in which a third female was seated
this apartment was the first he had observed
in the mansion which was furnished
with moveable seats and with a wooden
table over which was laid a piece tapestry
a carpet was spread on the floor
there was a firegrate in the chimney and
in brief the apartment had the air being
habitable and inhabited
but roland's eyes found better employment
than to make observations on the acthe
abbot 
commendations the chamber for this
second female inhabitant the mansion
seemed something very different from anything
he had yet seen there at his first
entry she had greeted with a silent and
low obeisance the two aged matrons then
glancing her eyes towards roland she adjusted
a veil which hung back over her
shoulders so as to bring it over her face 
an operation which she performed with
much modesty but without either affected
haste or embarrassed timidity
during this manoeuvre roland had time
to observe that the face was that a girl
not much past sixteen apparently and that
the eyes were at once soft and brilliant
to these very favourable observations was
added the certainty that the fair object to
whom they referred possessed an excellent
shape bordering perhaps on evibonpointy
and therefore rather that a hebe than 
a sylph but beautifully formed and shewn
to great advantage by the close jacket and
 the abbot
petticoat which she wore after a foreign
fashion the last not quite long enough absolutely
to conceal a very pretty foot which
rested on a bar the table at which she
sate her round arms and taper fingers very
busily employed in repairing the piece 
tapestry which was spread on it which exhibited
several deplorable fissures enough to
demand the utmost skill the most expert
seamstress
it is to be remarked that it was by stolen
glances that roland grasme contrived to
ascertain these interesting particulars and
he thought he could once or twice notwithstanding
the texture the veil detect
the damsel in the act taking similar cognizance
 his own person the matrons
in the meanwhile continued their separate
conversation eyeing from time to time the
young people in a manner which left roland
in no doubt that they were the subject
 their conversation at length he distinctly
heard magdalen graeme say these
the abbot 
words nay my sister we must give them
opportunity to speak together and to become
acquainted they must be personally
known to each other or how shall they
be able to execute what they are entrusted
with 
it seemed as if the matron not fully satisfied
with her friend's reasoning continued
to offer some objections but they
were borne down by her more dictatorial
friend
 it must be so she said my dear
sister let us therefore go forth on the
balcony to finish our conversation and
do you she said addressing roland and
the girl become acquainted with each
other
with this she stepped up to the young
woman and raising her veil discovered
features which whatever might be their
ordinary complexion were now covered
with a universal blush
libitum sit said magdalen looking at
the other matron
 the abbor
 viw licittun replied the other with reluctant
and hesitating acquiescence and
again adjusting the veil the blushing girl
she dropped it so as to shade though not
to conceal her countenance and whispered
to her in a tone loud enough for the page
to hear remember catherine who thou
art and for what destined
the matron then retreated with magdalen
greene through one the casements
 the apartment that opened on a large
broad balcony which with its ponderous
balustrade had once run along the whole
south front the building which faced to
the brook and formed a pleasant and commodious
walk in the open air it was now
in some places deprived the balustrade
in others broken and narrowed but ruinous
as it was could still be used as a pleasant
promenade here then walked the
two ancient dames busied in their private
conversation yet not so much so but what
roland could observe the matrons as their
the abbor 
thin forms darkened the casement in passing
or repassing before it dart a glance into
the apartment to see how matters were
going on there
 the ajbbpt
chapter xi
life hath its may and all is mirthful then 
the woods are vocal and the flowers all odour 
its very blast has mirth isn't and the maidens
the while they don their cloaks to skreen their kirtles
laugh at the rain that wets them
old flay
catherine was at the happy age innocence
and buoyancy spirit when after
the first moment embarrassment was over
a situation awkwardness like that in which
she was suddenly left to make acquaintance
with a handsome youth not even known to
her by name struck her in spite herself
in a ludicrous point view she bent her
beautiful eyes upon the work with which
she was busied and with infinite gravity
sate out the two first turns the matrons
upon the balcony j but then glancing her
the abbot 
deep blue eye a little towards roland and
observing the embarrassment under which
he laboured now shifting on his chair and
now dangling his cap the whole man evincing
that he was perfectly at a loss how
to open the conversation she could keep
her composure no longer but after a vain
struggle broke out into a sincere though
a very involuntary fit laughing so richly
accompanied by the laughter her merry
eyes which actually glanced through the
tears which the effort filled them with
and by the waving her rich tresses
that the goddess smiles herself never
looked more lovely than catherine at that
moment a court page would not have
left her long alone in her mirth but roland
was countrybred and besides having
some conceit as well as bashfulness
he took it into his head that he was himself
the object her inextinguishable laughter
his endeavours to sympathize with catherine
therefore could carry him no further
than into a forced giggle which had more
k 
 the abbot
 displeasure than mirth in it and which
so much enhanced that the girl that it
seemed to render it impossible for her ever
to bring her laughter to an with whatever
anxious pains she laboured to do so
for every one has felt that when a paroxysm
 laughter has seized him at a misbecoming
time and place the efforts which
he makes to suppress it nay the very sense
 the impropriety giving way to it tends
only to augment and prolong the irresistible
impulse
it was undoubtedly lucky for catherine
as well as for roland that the latter did
not share in the excessive mirth the former
for seated as she was with her back
to the casement catherine could easily
escape the observation the two matrons
during the course their promenade 
whereas graeme was so placed with his
side to the window that his mirth had he
shared that his companion would have
been instantly visible and could not have
failed to give offence to the personages in
the abbot 
question he sate however with some impatience
until catherine had exhausted
either her power or her desire laughing
and was returning with good grace to the
exercise her needle and then he observed
with some dryness that there seemed no
great occasion to recommend to them to
improve their acquaintance it seemed that
they were already tolerably familiar
catherine had an extreme desire to set
off upon a fresh score but she repressed it
strongly and fixing her eyes on her work
replied by asking his pardon and promising
to avoid future offence
roland had sense enough to feel that
an air offended dignity was very much
misplaced and that it was with a very different
bearing he ought to meet the deep
blue eyes which had borne such a hearty
burthen in the laughing scene he tried
therefore to extricate himself as well as he
could from his blunder by assuming a tone
 correspondent gaiety and requesting to
know the nymph how it was her pleads
the abbot
sure that they should proceed in improving
the acquaintance which had commenced so
merrily
that she said you must yourself
discover perhaps i have gone a step too far
in opening our interview
 suppose said roland graeme we
should begin as in a talebook by asking
each others names and histories
 it is right well imagined said catherine
 and shews an argue judgment do
you begin and i will listen and only put
in a question or two at the dark parts the
story come unfold then your name and
history my new acquaintance
i am called roland graeme and that
tall old woman is my grandmother
 and your tutoress good who are
your parents 
 they are both dead replied roland
 ay but who were they you had parents
i presume 
 i suppose so said roland but i
have never been able to learn much their
the abbot 
history my father was a scottish knight
who died gallantly in his stirrups my mother
was a grseme heather gill in the
debateable land most her family were
killed when the debateable country was
burned by lord maxwell and berries 
caerlaverock
 is it long ago said the damsel
 before i was born answered the page
that must be a terrible while since
said she shaking her head gravely look
you i cannot weep for them
 it needs not said the youth they
fell with honour
 so much for your lineage fair sir replied
his companion whom i like the
living specimen a glance at the casement
far more than those that are dead your
much honoured grandmother looks as if she
could make one weep in sad earnest and
now fair sir for your own person if you
tell not the tale faster it will be cut short
in the middle mother bridget pauses longi
er and longer every time she passes the
 the abbot
window and with her there is as little mirth
as in the grave your ancestors
my tale is soon told i was introduced
into the castle avenel to be page to the
lady the mansion
she is a strict huguenot is she not 
said the little maiden
as strict as calvin himself but my
grandmother can play the puritan when it
suits her purpose and she had some plan
 her own for quartering me in the castle
it would have failed however after we
had remained several weeks at the hamlet
but for an unexpected master ceremonies

and who was that said the girl
 a large black dog wolf by name who
brought me into the castle one day in his
mouth like a hurt wildduck and presented
me to the lady
a most respectable introduction truly
said catherine and what might you learn
at this same castle i love dearly to know
what my acquaintances can do at need
the abbot 
to fly a hawk hollow to a hound back
a horse and wield lance bow and brand
 and to boast all this when you have
learned it said catherine which in
france at least is the surest accomplishment
 a page but proceed fair sir how
came your huguenot lord and your no less
huguenot lady to receive and keep in the
family so perilous a person as a catholic
page 
 because they knew not that part 
my history which from a child i had been
taught to keep secret and because my
granddame's former zealous attendance on
their heretic chaplain had laid all this suspicion
to sleep most fair callipolis said
the page and in so saying edged his chair
towards the seat the fair querist
 nay but keep your distance most gallant
sir answered the blueeyed maiden
 for unless i greatly mistake these reverend
ladies will soon interrupt our amicable
conference if the acquaintance they recommend
shall seem to proceed beyond a certain
point so fair sir be pleased to abide
 the abbot
by your station and reply to my questions
by what achievements did you prove the
qualities a page which you had thus
happily acquired 
roland who began to enter into the tone
and spirit the damsel's conversation replied
to her with becoming spirit
in no feat fair gentlewoman was i
found inexpert wherein there was mischief
implied i shot swans hunted cats frightened
servingwomen chased the deer and
robbed the orchard i say nothing tormenting
the chaplain in various ways for
that was my duty as a good catholic
 now as i am a gentlewoman said catherine
 i think these heretics have done
catholic penance in entertaining so allaccomplished
a servingman and what fair
sir might have been the unhappy event
which deprived them an inmate so altogether
estimable 
 truly fair gentlewoman answered the
youth your real proverb says that the
longest lane will have a turning and mine
was more it was in fine a turning off
the abbot 
 good said the merry young maiden
 it is an apt play on the word and what
occasion was taken for so important a catastrophe
 nay start not for my learning
i do know the schools in plain phrase
why were you sent from service 
the page shrugged his shoulders while
jft replied
 a short tale is soon told and a short
horse soon curried i made the falconers
boy taste my switch the falconer threatened
to make me brook his cudgel he is s
kindly clown as well as a stout and i would
rather have been cudgelled by him than
any man in christendom to chuse but i
knew not his qualities as then so i threatened
to make him brook the stab and my
lady made me brook the begone so
adieu to the page's office and the fair castle
 avenel i had not travelled far before i
met my venerable parent and so tell your
tale fair gentlewoman for mine is done
a happy grandmother said the maiden
 who had the luck to find the stray
 the abbot
page just when his mistress had slipped his
leash and a most lucky page that has jumped
at once from a page to a gentlemanusher

 all this is nothing your history answered
roland grseme who began to be
much interested in the congenial vivacity 
this facetious young gentle woman tale
for tale is fellowtraveller's justice
 wait till we are fellowtravellers then
replied catherine
 nay you escape me not so said the
page if you deal not justly by me i will
call out to dame bridget or whatever your
dame be called and proclaim you for a
cheat
 you shall not need answered the
maiden my history is the counterpart
 your own the same words might almost
serve change but dress and name i am
called catherine seyton and i am an orphan

 have your parents been long dead 
 that is the only question said she
throwing down her fine eyes with a sudden
the abbot 
expression sorrow that is the only question
i cannot laugh at
and dame bridget is your grandmother

the sudden cloud passed away like that
which crosses for an instant the summer
sun and she answered with her usual lively
expression worse by twenty degrees
dame bridget is my maiden aunt
over gods forebode said roland 
alas that you have such a tale to tell 
and what horror comes next 
 your own history exactly i was taken
upon trial for service
 and turned off for pinching the duenna
or affronting my lady's waitingwoman

nay our history varies there said the
damsel our mistress broke up house or
had her house broke up which is the same
thing and i am a free woman the forest
and i am as glad it as if any one
had lined my doublet with cloth gold
said the youth
 the abbot
i thank you for your mirth said she
but the matter is not like to concern
you
nay but say on said the page for
you will be presently interrupted the two
good dames have been soaring yonder on
the balcony like two old hooded crows
and their croak grows hoarser as night
comes on they will wing to roost presently
 this mistress yours fair gentlewoman
who was she in god's name 
 o hp has a fair name in the world
replied catherine seyton few ladies
kept a fairer house or held more gentlewomen
in her household my aunt bridget
was one her housekeepers we never
saw her blessed face to be sure but we
heard enough her were up early and
down late and were kept to long prayers
and light food
 out upon the penurious beldame 
said the page
 for heaven's sake blaspheme not
said the girl with an expression fear
the abbot 
god pardon us both i meant no harm
i speak our blessed saint catherine 
sienna may god forgive me that i spoke
so lightly and made you do a great sin and
a great blasphemy this was her nunnery
in which there were twelve nuns and an
abbess my aunt was the abbess till the heretics
turned all adrift
and where are your companions
asked the youth
 with the last year's snow answered
the maiden east north south and west
some to france some to flanders some
i fear into the world and its pleasures
we have got permission to remain or rather
our remaining has been connived at
for my aunt has great relations among the
kerr and they have threatened a deathbed
if any one touches us and bow and
spear are the best warrant in these times
nay then you sit under a sure shadow
said the youth and i suppose you
wept yourself blind when saint catherine
broke up housekeeping before you had taken
arles in her service 
ifflicleiirnestmnney
 the abbot
 hush for heaven's sake said the
damsel crossing herself no more that j
but i have not quite cried my eyes out
said she turning them upon him and instantly
again bending them upon her work
it was one those glances which would
require the threefold plate brass around
the heart more than it is needed by the
mariners to whom horace recommends it
our youthful page had no defence whatever
to offer
what say you catherine he said if
we two thus strangely turned out service
at the same time should give our two
most venerable duennas the torch to hold
while we walk a merry measure with each
other over the floor this weary world 
 a goodly proposal truly said catherine
 and worthy the madcap brain a
discarded page and what shifts does your
worship propose we should live by by
singing ballads cutting purses or swaggering
on the highway for there i think
you would find your most productive exchequer

the abbot 
 chuse you proud peat said the page
drawing off in huge disdain at the calm and
unembarrassed ridicule with which his wild
proposal was received and as he spoke
the words the casement was again darkened
by the forms the matrons it opened
and admitted magdalen grme and the
mother abbess so we must now style her
into the apartment
 the abbot
chapter xii
nay hear me brother i am elder wiser
and homer than thou and age and wisdom
and holiness have peremptory claims
and will be listened to
old play
when the matrons reentered and put
an to the conversation which we have
detailed in the last chapter dame magdalen
graeme thus addressed her grandson
and his pretty companion have you
spoke together my children have you
become known to each other as fellowtravellers
on the same dark and dubious road
whom chance hath brought together and
who study to learn the tempers and dispositions
 those by whom their perils are to
be shared 
the abbot 
it was seldom the lighthearted catherine
could suppress a jest so that she often
spoke when she would have acted more
wisely in holding her peace
your grandson admires the journey
which you propose so very greatly that he
was even now preparing for setting out
upon it instantly
 this is to be too forward roland
said the dame addressing him as yesterday
you were over slack the just mean
lies in obedience which both waits for the
signal to start and obeys it when given 
but once again my children have you so
perused each other's countenances that
when you meet in whatever disguise the
times may impose upon you you may recognize
each in the other the secret agent
 the mighty work in which you are to
be leagued look at each other know
each line and lineament each other's
countenance learn to distinguish by the
step by the sound the voice by the movol
i l
 the abbot
tionof the hand by the glaticeof the eye
the partner whom heaven hath sent to aidin
working its will wilt thou know that
maiden whensoever or wheresoever you
shall again meet her my roland graeme 
as readily as truly did roland answer
in the affirmative and thou my daughter
wilt thou again remember the features
 this youth 
 truly mother replied catherine seyton
 i have not seen so many men late
that i should immediately forget your grandson
though i mark not much about him that
is deserving special remembrance
 join hands then my children said
magdalen graeme but in saying so was
interrupted by her companion whose conventual
prejudices had been gradually giving
her more and more uneasiness and
who could remain acquiescent no longer
nay my good sister you forget said
she to magdalen catherine is the betrothed
bride heaven these intimacies cannot
be 
the abbot 
it is in the cause heaven that i command
them to embrace said magdalen
with the full force her powerful voice j
the sister sanctifies the means we
must use
 they call me lady abbess or mother
at the least who address me said dame
bridget drawing herself up as if offended
at her friend's authoritative manner the
lady heathergill forgets that she speaks
to the abbess saint catherine
when i was what you call me said
magdalen you indeed were the abbess
 saint catherine but both names are now
gone with all the rank that the world and
that the church gave to them and we are
now to the eye human judgment two
poor despised oppressed women dragging
our dishonoured old age to a humble grave
but what are we in the eye heaven 
ministers sent forth to work his will in
whose weakness the strength the church
shall be manifested before whom shall be
humbled the wisdom murray and the
 the abbot
dark strength morton and to such
wouldst thou apply the narrow rules thy
cloistered seclusion or hast thou forgotten
the order which i shewed thee from thy
superior subjecting thee to me in these matters

on thy head then be the scandal and
the sin said the abbess sullenly
on mine be they both said magdalen
 i say embrace each other my children

but catherine aware perhaps how the
dispute was likely to terminate had escaped
from the apartment and so disappointed
the grandson at least as much as the old
matron
she is gone said the abbess to provide
some little refreshment but it will
have little savour to those who dwell in the
world for i at least cannot dispense with
the rules to which i am vowed because it
is the will wicked men to break down the
sanctuary in which they wont to be observed

the abbot 
it is well my sister replied magdalen
 to pay each even the smallest tythes
 mint and cummin which the church demands
and i blame not thy scrupulous observance
 the rules thine order but
they were established by the church and
for the church's benefit and reason it is
that they should give way when the salvation
 the church herself is at stake
the abbess made no reply
one more acquainted with human nature
than the inexperienced page might have
found amusement in comparing the different
kinds fanaticism which these two females
exhibited the abbess timid narrowminded
and discontented clung to ancient
usages and pretensions which were ended
by the reformation and was in adversity
as she had been in prosperity scrupulous
weakspirited and bigotted while the fiery
and more lofty spirit her companion suggested
a wider field effort and would not
be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary
schemes which were suggested by her
 the abbot
bold and irregular imagination but roland
graeme instead tracing these peculiarities
 character in the two old dames
only waited with great anxiety for the return
 catherine expecting probably that
the proposal the fraternal embrace would
be renewed as his grandmother seemed disposed
to carry matters with a high hand
his expectations or hopes if we may
call them so were however disappointed
 for when catherine reentered on the
summons the abbess and placed on the
table an earthen pitcher water and four
wooden platters with cups the same materials
the dame heathergill satisfied
with the arbitrary mode in which she had
borne down the opposition the abbess
pursued her victory no farther a moderation
for which her grandson in his heart
returned her but slender thanks
in the meanwhile catherine continued to
place upon the table the slender preparations
for the meal a recluse which consisted
almost entirely cole wort boiled
the abbot 
and served up in an earthen platter having
no better seasoning than a little salt and no
better accompaniment than some coarse
barleybread in very moderate quantity
the waterpitcher already mentioned furnished
the only beverage after a latin
grace delivered by the abbess the guests
sat down to their spare entertainment the
simplicity the fare appeared to produce
no distaste in the females who ate it moderately
but with the usual appearance 
appetite but roland grseme had been
used to better cheer sir halbert glendining
who affected even an unusual degree
 nobleness in his housekeeping maintained
it in a style genial hospitality
which rivalled that the northern barons
 england he might think perhaps that
by doing so he acted yet more completely
the part for which he was not born 
that a great baron and a leader two
bullocks and six sheep weekly were the
allowance when the baron was at home
and did not greatly diminish during his ab
 the abbot
sence a boll malt was weekly brewed
into ale which was used by the household
at discretion bread was baked in proportion
for the consumption his domestics
and retainers and in this scene plenty
had roland graeme now lived for several
years it formed a bad introduction to lukewarm
greens and spring water and probably
his countenance indicated some sense
 the difference for the abbess observed
 it would seem my son that the tables
 the heretic baron whom you have so
long followed are more daintily furnished
than those the suffering daughters the
church and yet not upon the roost solemn
nights festival when the nuns were permitted
to eat their portion at mine own table
did i consider the cates which were
then served up as half so delicious as these
vegetables and this water on which i prefer
to feed rather than do aught which may
derogate from the strictness my vow it
shall never be said that the mistress this
house made it a house feasting when days
the abbot 
 darkness and affliction were hanging
over the holy church which i am an
unworthy member
well hast thou said my sister replied
magdalen graeme but now it is not only
time to suffer in the good cause but to act
in it and since our pilgrim's meal is finished
let us go apart to prepare for our journey
 tomorrow and to advise on the
manner in which these children shall be employed
and what measures we can adopt to
supply their thoughtlessness and lack discretion

notwithstanding his indifferent cheerthe
heart roland graeme bounded high at
this proposal which he doubted not would
lead to another teteastute betwixt him and
the pretty novice but he was mistaken
catherine it would seem had no mind sofar
to indulge him for moved either by delicacy
or caprice or some those indescribable
shades betwixt the one and the other
with which women love to teaze and at the
same time to captivate the ruder sex she
l
 the abbot
reminded the abbess that it was necessary
she should retire for an hour before vespers
 and receiving the ready and approving
nod her superior she arose to
withdraw but before leaving the apartment
she made obeisance to the matrons
bending herself till her hands touched her
knees and then made a slighter reverence
to roland which consisted in a slight bend
 the body and gentle depression the
head this she performed very demurely 
but the party on whom the salutation was
conferred thought he could discern in her
manner an arch and mischievous exultation
over his secret disappointment the devil
take the saucy girl he thought in his
heart though the presence the abbess
should have repressed all such profane imaginations
 she is as hardhearted as the
laughing hyaena that the storybooks tell 
she has a mind that i shall not fot her
this night at least
the matrons now retired also gvx the
page to understand that he was on no acthe
abbot 
count to stir from the convent or to shew
himself at the windows the abbess expressing
as a reason the readiness with which
the rude heretics caught at every occasion
 scandahzing the religious orders
this is worse than the rigour mr henry
warden himself said the page when
he was left alone j for to do him justice
however strict in requiring the most rigid
attention during the time his homilies
he left us to the freedom our own wills
afterwards ay and would take a share in
our pastimes too if he thought them entirely
innocent but these old women are
utterly wrapt up in gloom mystery and
selfdenial well then if i must neither
stir out the gate nor look out at window
i will at least see what the inside the
house contains that may help to pass away
one's time peradventure i may light on
that blueeyed laugher in some corner or
other
going therefore out the chamber by
the entrance opposite to that through which
 the abbot
the two matrons had departed for it maybe
readily supposed he had no desire to
intrude on their privacy he wandered
from one chamber to another through the
deserted edifice seeking with boyish eagerness
some source interest or amusement
here he passed through a long gallery
opening on either hand into the little cells
 the nuns all deserted and deprived 
the few trifling articles furniture which
the rules the order admitted
the birds are flown thought the page
but whether they will find themselves worse
oflt in the open air than in these damp
narrow cages i leave my lady abbess
and my venerable relative to settle betwixt
them i think the lark which they have
left behind them would like best to sing
under god's free sky
a winding stair strait and narrow as
if to remind the nuns their duties fast
and maceration led down to a lower suite
 apartments which occupied the ground
story the house these rooms were even
the abbot 
more ruinous than those which he had left 
for having encountered the first fury the
assailants by whom the nunnery had been
wasted the windows had been dashed in
the doors broken down and even the partitions
betwixt the apartments in some
places destroyed as he thus stalked
from desolation to desolation and began to
think returning from so uninteresting a
research to the chamber which he had left
he was surprised to hear the low a cow
very close to him the sound was so unexpected
at the time and place that roland
graeme started as if it had been the voice
 a lion and laid his hand on his dagger
while at the same moment the light and
lovely form catherine seyton presented
itself at the door the apartment from
which the sound had issued
 good even to you valiant champion 
said she since the days guy warwick
never was one more worthy to encounter
a dun cow
cow said roland grme by my
 the abbot
faith i thought it had been the devil that
roared so near me who ever heard a
convent containing a cowhouse 
cow and calf may come hither now
answered catherine for we have no means
to keep out either but i advise you kind
sir to return to the place from whence you
came
 not till i see your charge fair sister
answered roland and made his way into
the apartment in spite the half serious
half laughing remonstrances the girl
the poor solitary cow now the only severe
recluse within the nunnery was quartered
in a spacious chamber which had once
been the refectory the convent the roof
was graced with groined arches and the wall
with niches from which the images had
been pulled down these remnants architectural
ornaments were strangely contrasted
with the rude crib and manger constructed
for the cow in one corner the
apartment and the stack fodder which
was piled beside it for her food
the abbot 
 by my faith said the page crosbie
is more lordly lodged than any one here
you had best remain with her said
catherine and supply by your filial attentions
the offspring she has had the ill luck
to lose
 i will remain at least to help you to
prepare her night's lair pretty catherine
said roland seizing upon a pitchfork
by no means said catherine for
besides that you know not in the least todo
her that service you will bring a chiding
my way and i get enough that in the
regular course things
 what for accepting my assistance 
said the page for accepting m assistance
who am to be your confederate in
some deep matter import that were
altogether unreasonable and now i think
on it tell me if you can what is this mighty
emprize to which i am destined 
 robbing a bird's nest i should suppose
said catherine considering the
champion whom they have selected
 the abbot
by my faith said the youth and
he that has taken a falcon's nest in the
scars polmoodie has done something
to brag my fair sister but that is allover
now a murrain on the nest and the
classes and their food washed or unwashed
for it was all anon cramming these
worthless kites that i was sent upon my
present travels save that i have met with
you pretty sister i could eat my daggerhilt
for vexation at my own folly but as
we are to be fellowtravellers
 fellowlabourers not fellowtravellers
answered the girl j for to your comfort
be it known that the lady abbess and
i set out earlier than you and your respected
relative tomorrow and that i partly endure
your company at present because it
may be long ere we meet again
by saint andrew but it shall not
though answered roland i will not
hunt at all unless we are to hunt in couples

 i suspect in that and in other points
the abbot 
we must do as we are bid but hark i
hear my aunt's voice
the old lady entered in good earnest
and darted a severe glance at her niece
while roland had the ready wit to busy
himself about the halter the cow
the young gentleman said catherine
gravely is helping me to tie the cow up
faster to her stake for i find that last night
when she put her head out window and
lowed she alarmed the whole village and
we will be suspected sorcery among the
heretics if they do not discover the cause
 the apparition or lose our cow if they
do
relieve yourself that fear said the
abbess somewhat ironically the person
to whom she is now sold comes for the
animal presently
good night then my poor companion
said catherine patting the animal's
shoulders i hope thou hast fallen into
kind hands for my happiest hours late
have been spent in tending thee i would
i had been born to no better task
 the abbot
 now out upon thee meanspirited
wench said the abbess is that a speech
worthy the name seyton or the
mouth a sister this house treading the
path election and to be spoken before
a stranger youth too go to my oratory
minion there read your hours till i
come thither when i will read you such a
lecture as shall make you prize the blessings
which you possess
catherine was about to withdraw in silence
casting a half sorrowful half comic
glance at roland gramme which seemed to
say you see to what your untimely visit
has exposed me when suddenly changing
her mind she came forward to the page
and extended her hand as she bid him good
evening their palms had pressed each
other ere the astonished matron could interfere
and catherine had time to say 

 the abbot
ry's men who dare worship where their predecessors
prayed while alive and were interred
when dead follow me this way my
son
roland graeme followed accordingly 
and magdalen casting a hasty glance to
see whether they were observed for she had
learned caution from the danger the
times commanded her grandson to knock
at a little wicket which she pointed out to
him but knock gently she added with
a motion expressive caution after a
little space during which no answer was
returned she signed to roland to repeat
his summons for admission and the door
at length partially opening discovered a
glimpse the thin and timid porter by
whom the duty was performed skulking
from the observation those who stood
without but endeavouring at the same time
to gain a sight them without being himself
seen how different from the proud
and dignified consciousness with which the
porter ancient days offered his important
brow and his goodly person to the pile
abbot 
grins who repaired to kennaquhair his
solemn ingrate meijiui was exchanged
for a tremulous you cannot enter now 
the brethren are in their chambers bat
when magdalen graeme asked in an undertone
 voice hast thou forgotten me my
father he changed his apologetic refusal
to enter my honoured sister enter speedily
for evil eyes are upon us
they entered accordingly and having
waited until the porter had with jealous
haste barred and bolted the wicket were
conducted by him through several dark and
winding passages as they walked slowly
on he spoke to the matron in a subdued
voice as if he feared to trust the very walls
with the avowal which he communicated
our fathers are assembled in the chapterhouse
worthy sister yes in the chapterhouse
 for the election an abbots 
ah benedicite there must be no ringing
 bells no high mass no opening the
great gates now that the people might see
and venerate their spiritual father our
 the abbot
fathers must hide themselves rather like
robbers who chuse a leader than godly
priests who elect a mitred abbot
 regard not that my brother answered
magdalen graeme the first successors
 saint peter himself were elected not in
sunshine but in tempests not in the halls
 the vatican but in the subterranean
vaults and dungeons heathen rome 
they were not granulated with shouts and
salvos cannonshot and musketry
and the display artificial fire no my
brother but by the hoarse summons 
victors and praetors who came to drag the
fathers the church to martyrdom from
such adversity was the church once raised
and by such will it now be purified and
mark me brother not in the proudest days
 the mitred abbey was a superior ever
chosen whom his office shall so much honour
as he shall be honoured who now
takes it upon him in these days tribulation
on whom my brother will the choice
fall 
the abbot 
on whom can it fall or alas who
would dare to reply to the call save the
worthy pupil the sainted eustatius the
good and valiant father ambrose 
i know it said magdalen my heart
told me long ere your lips had uttered his
name stand forth courageous champion
and man the fatal breach rise bold and
experienced pilot and seize the helm while
the tempest rages turn back the battle
brave raiser the fallen standard i wield
crook and sling noble shepherd a scattered
flock 
i pray you hush my sister said the
porter opening a door which led into the
great church the brethren will he presently
here to celebrate their election with
a solemn mass i must marshall them the
way to the high altar all the offices this
venerable house have now devolved on one
poor decrepit old man
he left the church and magdalen and
roland remained alone in that great vaulted
space whose style rich yet chaste
 the abbot
architecture referred its origin to the early
part the fourteenth century the best period
 gothic building but the niches
were stripped their images in the inside
as well s the outside the church and
in the pellmell havoc the tombs warriors
and princes had been included in
the demolition the idolatrous shrines
lances and swords antique size which
had hung over the tombs mighty warriors
 former days lay now strewed among reliques
with which the devotion pilgrims
had graced those their peculiar saints 
and the fragments the knights and dames
which had once lain recumbent or kneeled
in an attitude devotion where their mortal
reliques were reposed were mingled
with those the saints and angels the
gothic chisel which the hand violence
had sent headlong from their stations
the most fatal symptom the whole appeared
to be that though this violence had
now been committed for many months the
fathers had lost so totally all heart and resolve
abbot 
lotion that they had not adventured even
upon clearing away the rubbish or restoring
the church to some decent degree order
this might have been done without much
labour but terror had overpowered the
scanty remains a body once so powerful
and sensible they were only suffered to remain
in this ancient seat by connivance and
from compassion they'd not venture upon
taking any step which might be construed
into an assertion their ancient rights
contenting themselves with the secret and
obscure exercise their religious ceremonial
in as unostentatious a manner as was
possible
two or three the more aged brethren
had sunk under the pressure the times
and the ruins had been partly cleared away
to permit their interment one stone had
been laid over father nicholas which recorded
 him in special that he had taken
the vows during the incumbency abbot
ingelramthe period to which his memory so
frequently recurred another flag stone yet
more recently deposited covered the body
 the abbot
 peter the sacristan eminent for his aquatic
excursion with the phantom avenel 
and a third the most recent all bore the
outline a mitre and the words hicjacet
eustatius ahhas for no one dared to add
a word commendation in favour his
learning and strenuous zeal for the roman
catholic faith
magdalen graeme looked at and perused
the brief records these monuments successively
and paused over that father
eustace in a good hour for thyself she
said but oh in an evil hour for the church
wert thou called from us let thy spirit be
with us holy man encourage thy successor
to tread in thy footsteps give him thy
bold and inventive capacity thy zeal and
thy discretion even tk piety exceeds
not his as she spoke a side door which
closed a passage from the abbot's house
into the church was thrown open that the
fathers might enter the choir and conduct
to the high altar the superior whom they
had elected
in former times this was one the most
the abbot 
splendid the many pageants which the
hierarchy rome had devised to attract
the veneration the faithful the period
during which the abbacy remained vacant
was a state mourning or as their emblematical
phrase expressed it widowhood 
a melancholy term which was changed into
rejoicing and triumph when a new superior
was chosen when the foldingdoors
were on such solemn occasions thrown
open and the new abbot appeared on the
threshold in fullblown dignity with ring
and mitre and dalmatia and crosier his
hoary standardbearers and his juvenile dispensers
 incense preceding him and the
venerable train monks behind him withall
besides which could announce the supreme
authority to which he was now raised
his appearance was a signal for the magnificent
jubilate to rise from the organ and
musicloft and to be joined by the corresponding
bursts hallelujah from the whole
assembled congregation now all was changed
in the midst rubbish and desolation
 the abbot
seven or eight old men bent and shaken as
much by grief and fear as by age shrouded
hastily in the proscribed dress their order
wandered like a procession spectres from
the door which had been thrown open up
through the encumbered passage to the
high altar there to instal their elected superior
a chief ruins it was like a band
 bewildered travellers chusing a chief in
the wilderness arabia or a shipwrecked
crew electing a captain upon the barren
island on which fate has thrown them
they who in peaceful times are most
ambitious authority among others shrink
from the competition at such eventful periods
when neither ease nor parade attend
the possession it and when it gives only
a painful preeminence both in danger and
in labour and exposes the ill fated chieftain
to the murmurs his discontented associates
as well as to the first assault the
common enemy but he on whom the office
 the abbot saint mary's was now
conferred had a mind fitted for the situathe
abbot 
tion to which he was called bold and enthusiastic
yet generous and forgiving 
wise and skilful yet zealous and prompt 
he wanted but a better cause than the support
 a decaying superstition to have
raised him to the rank a truly great man
but as the crowns the work it also
forms the rule by which it must be ultimately
judged and those who with sincerity
and generosity fight and fall in an
evil cause posterity can only compassionate
as victims a generous but fatal error
amongst these we must rank ambrosius
the last abbot kennaquhair whose designs
must be condemned as their success
would have rivetted on scotland the chains
 antiquated superstition and spiritual tyranny
 but whose talents in themselves
commanded respect and whose virtues
even from the enemies his faith extorted
esteem
the bearing the new abbot served 
itself to dignify a ceremonial which was deprived
 all other attributes grandeur
 the abbot
conscious the peril in which they stood
and recalling doubtless the better days
they had seen there hung over his brethren
an appearance mingled terror and
grief and shame which induced them to
hurry over the office in which they were
engaged as something at once degrading
and dangerous
but not so father ambrose his features
indeed expressed a deep melancholy
as he walked up the centre aisle
amid the ruins things which he considered
as holy but his brow was undetected
and his step firm and solemn he
seemed to think that the dominion which
he was about to receive depended in no
sort upon the external circumstances under
which it was conferred and if a mind
so firm was accessible to sorrow or fear it
was not on his own account but on that 
the church to which he had devoted himself

at length he stood on the broken steps
 the high altar barefooted as was the
the abbot 
rule and holding in his hand his pastoral
staff for the gemmed ring and jewelled
mitre had become secular spoils no obedient
vassals came man after man to make
their homage and to offer the tribute which
should provide their spiritual superior with
palfrey and trappings no bishop assisted
at the solemnity to receive into the
higher ranks the church nobility a dignitary
whose voice in the legislature was
as potential as his own with hasty and
maimed rites the few remaining brethren
stepped forward alternately to give their
new abbot the kiss peace in token
 fraternal affection and spiritual homage
mass was then hastily performed but in
such precipitation as if it had been hurried
over rather to satisfy the scruples ol
a few youths who were impatient to set
out on a hunting party than as if it made
the most solemn part a solemn ordination
the officiating priest faultered as he
spoke the service and often looked around
 the abbor
as if he expected to be interrupted in the
midst his office and the brethren listened
as to that which short as it was they
wished yet more abridged
these symptoms alarm increased as
the ceremony proceeded and as it seemed
were not caused by mere apprehension
alone for amid the pauses the hymn
there were heard without sounds a very
different sort beginning faintly and at a
distance but at length approaching close
to the exterior the church and stunning
with dissonant clamour those engaged in
the service the winding horns blown
with no regard to harmony or concert the
jangling bells the thumping drums
the squeaking bagpipes and the clash 
cymbals the shouts a multitude now
as in laughter now as in anger the shrill
tones female voices and those children
mingling with the deeper clamours 
men formed a babel sounds which first
drowned and then awed into utter silence
the abbot 
the official hymns the convent the
cause and result this extraordinary interruption
will be explained in the next
chapter
 the abbot
chapter xiv
not the wild billow when it breaks its barrier 
not the wild wind escaping from its cavern 
not the wild fiend that mingles both together
and pours their rage upon the ripening harvest
can match the wild freaks this mirthful meeting 
comic yet fearful droll and yet destructive
the conspiracy
the monks ceased their song which like
that the choristers in the legend the
witch berkeley died away in a quaver 
consternation j and like a flock chickens
disturbed by the presence the kite they
at first made a movement to disperse and
fly in different directions and then with
despair rather than hope huddled themselves
around their new abbot who retaining
the lofty and undismayed look which
had dignified him through the whole cerethe
abbot 
mony stood on the higher step the altar
as if desirous to be the most conspicuous
mark on which danger might discharge itself
and to save his companions by his selfdevotion
since he could afford them no
other protection
involuntarily as it were maid ale gram e
and the page stepped from the station which
hitherto they had occupied unnoticed and
approached to the altar as desirous sharing
the fate which approached the monks
whatsoever that might be both bowed reverently
love to the abbot and while magdalen
seemed about to speak the youth
looking towards the main entrance at which
the noise now roared most loudly and which
was at the same time assailed with much
knocking laid his hand upon his dagger
the abbot motioned to both to forbear 
 peace my sister he said in a low tone
but which being in a different key from the
tumultuary sounds without could be distinctly
heard even amidst the tumult 
 peace he said my sister j let the new
vol i n
 the abbot
superior saint mary's himself receive and
reply to the grateful acclamations the
vassals who come to celebrate his installation
and thou my son forbear i charge
thee to touch thy earthly weapon if it 
is the pleasure our protectress that her
shrine be this day desecrated by deeds 
violence and polluted by bloodshedding
let it not i charge you happen through the
deed a catholic son the church
the noise and knocking at the outer gate
became now every moment louder and
voices were heard impatiently demanding
admittance the abbot with dignity and
with a step which even the emergency 
danger rendered neither faultering nor precipitate
moved towards the portal and demanded
to know in a tone authority who
it was that disturbed their worship and what
they desired 
there was a moment's silence and then a
loud laugh from without at length a voice
replied we desire entrance into the
church and when the door is opened you
will soon see who we are
the abbot 
by whose authority do you require entrance
 said the father
 by authority the right reverend lord
abbot replied the voice from without 
and from the laugh which followed it seemed
as if there was something highly ludicrous
couched under this reply
i know not and seek not to know your
meaning replied the abbot since it is
probably a rude one but begone in the
name god and leave his servants in
peace i speak this as having lawful authority
to command here
 open the door said another rude
voice and we will try titles with you sir
monk and shew you a superior we must all
obey
 break open the doors if he dallies any
longer said a third and down with the
carrion monks who would bar us our privilege
a general shout followed ay
ay our privilege our privilege down with
the doors and with the lurdane monks if
they make opposition
the knocking was now exchanged for
 the abbot
blows math great hammers to which the
doors strong as they were must soon have
given way but the abbot who saw resists
ance would be vain and who did not wish
to incense the assailants by an attempt at
offering it besought silence earnestly and
with difficulty obtained a hearing my
children said he i will save you from
committing a great sin the porter will
presently undo the gate he is gone to fetch
the keys meantime i pray you to consider
if you are in a state mind to cross
the holy threshold
 tillyvalley for your papistry was answered
from without we are in the mood
 the monks when they are merriest and
that is when they sup beef brewis for lane
so if your porter hath not the
gout let him come speedily or we heave
away readily said i well comrades 
bravely said and it shall be as bravely
done said the multitude and had not
the keys arrived at that moment and the
porter in hasty terror performed his office
and thrown open the great door the popu
the abbot 
lace without would have saved him the trouble
the instant he had done so the affrighted
janitor fled like one who has drawn
the bolts a floodgate and expects to be
overwhelmed by the rushing inundation
the monks with one consent had withdrawn
themselves behind the abbot who
alone kept his station about three yards from
the entrance shewing no signs fear or
perturbation his brethren partly encouraged
by his devotion partly ashamed to
desert him and partly animated by a sense
 duty remained huddled close together
at the back their superior there was
a loud laugh and huzza when the doors were
opened j but contrary to what might have
been expected no crowd enraged assailants
rushed into the church on the
contrary there was a cry a halt a
halt to order my masters and let the two
reverend fathers greet each other as beseems
them
the appearance the crowd who were
thus called to order was grotesque in the
extreme it was composed men women
 the abbot
and children ludicrously disguised in various
habits and presenting groupes equally
diversified and ludicrous here one fellow
with a horse's head painted before him and
a tail behind and the whole covered with
a long footcloth which was supposed to
hide the body the animal ambled caracoled
pranced and plunged as he performed
the celebrated part the hobbiehorse
so often alluded to in our ancient drama 
and which still flourishes on the stage in
the battle that concludes bayes's tragedy
to rival the address and agility displayed by
this character another personage advanced
in the more formidable character a huge
dragon with gilded wings open jaws and
a scarlet tongue cloven at the which
made various efforts to overtake and devour
a lad dressed as the lovely sabsea daughter
 the king egypt who fled before him 
while a martial saint george grotesquely
armed with a goblet for a helmet and a
spit for a lance ever and anon interfered
and compelled the monster to relinquish
his prey a bear a wolf and one or two
the abbot 
other wild animals played their parts with
the discretion snug the joiner for the
decided preference which they gave to the
use their hind legs was sufficient without
any formal annunciation to assure the
most timorous spectators that they had to do
with habitual bipeds there was a groupe
 outlaws with robin hood and little
john at their head the best representation
exhibited at the time and no great wonder
since most the actors were by profession
the banished men and thieves whom they
presented other masqueraders there were
 a less marked description men were
disguised as women and women as men 
children wore the dress aged people and
tottered with crutchsticks in their hands
furred gowns on their little backs and caps
on their round heads while grandsires assumed
the infantine tone as well as the
dress children besides these many hat
their faces painted and wore their shirts
over the rest their dress while coloured
pasteboard and ribbands furnished out decorations
for others those who wanted
c the abbot
all these properties blacked their faces and
turned their jackets inside out and thus
the transmutation the whole assembly into
a set mad grotesque mummers was at
once completed
the pause which the masqueraders made
waiting apparently for some person the
highest authority amongst them gave those
within the abbey church full time to observe
all these absurdities they were at
no loss to comprehend their purpose and
meaning
few readers can be ignorant that at an
early period and during the plenitude 
her power the church rome not only
connived at but even encouraged such saturnalian
licenses as the inhabitants 
and the neighbourhood had now
in hand and that the vulgar on such occasions
where not only permitted but encouraged
by a number gambols sometimes
puerile and ludicrous sometimes immoral
and profane to indemnify themselves for
the privations and penances imposed on
tiem at other seasons but all other
the abbot 
topics for burlesque and ridicule the rites
and ceremonial the church itself were
most frequently resorted to and strange
to say with the approbation the clergy
themselves
while the hierarchy flourished in full
glory they do not appear to have dreaded
the consequences suffering the people to
become so irreverently familiar with things
sacred they then imagined the laity to
be much in the condition a labourer's
horse which does not submit to the bridle
and the whip with greater reluctance because
at rare intervals he is allowed to
frolic at large in his pasture and fling out
his heels in clumsy gambols at the master
who usually drives him but when times
changed when doubt the roman catholic
doctrine and hatred their priesthood
had possessed the reformed party the
clergy discovered too late that no small inconvenience
arose from the established practice
 games and merrymakings in which
they themselves and all they held most 
the abbot
cried were made the subject ridicule it
then became obvious to duller politicians
than the romish churchmen that the same
actions have a very different tendency when
done in the spirit sarcastic insolence and
hatred than when acted merely in exuberance
 rude and uncontrollable spirits
they therefore though the latest endeavoured
where they had any remaining
influence to discourage the renewal these
indecorous festivities in this particular the
catholic clergy were joined by most the
reformed preachers who were more shocked
at the profanity and immorality many 
these exhibitions than disposed to profit by
the ridiculous light in which they placed the
church rome and her observances but
it was long ere these scandalous and immoral
sports could be abrogated the rude multitude
continued attached to their favourite
pastimes and both in england and scotland
the mitre the catholic the rocket
 the reformed bishop and the cloak and
band the calvinistic divine were in
turn compelled to give place to these jocu
the abbot 
lar personages the pope fools the boybishop
and the abbot unreason
it was the latter personage who now in
full costume made his approach to the great
door the church st mary's accoutred
in such a manner as to form a caricature
or practical parody on the costume and
attendants the real superior whom he
came to beard on the very day his installation
in the presence his clergy and
in the chancel his church the mock
dignitary was a stoutmade undersized fellow
whose thick squab form had been rendered
grotesque by a supplemental paunch
well stuffed he wore a mitre leather
with the front like a grenadier's cap adorned
with mock embroidery and trinkets 
tin this surmounted a visage the nose 
which was the most prominent feature being
 unusual size and at least as richly
gemmed as his headgear his robe was 
from the interesting novel entitled anastatius t
seems the same burlesque ceremonies were practiced
in the greek church
 the abbot
buckram and his cope canvass curiously
painted and cut into open work on
one shoulder was fixed the painted figure
 an owl and he bore in the right hand
his pastoral staff and in the left a small
mirror having a handle to it thus resembling
a celebrated jester whose adventures
translated into english were whilom extremely
popular and which may still be procured
in black letter for about one pound
per leaf
the attendants this mock dignitary
had their proper dresses and equipage bearing
the same burlesque resemblance to the
officers the convent which their leader
did to the superior they followed their
leader in regular procession and the motley
characters which had waited his arrival
now crowded into the church in his train
shouting as they came a hall a hall for
the venerable father howleglas the learned
monk misrule and the right reverend
abbot unreason 
the discordant minstrelsy every kind
renewed its din the boys shrieked and
the abbot 
howled and the men laughed and halloed
and the women giggled and screamed and
the beasts roared and the dragon galloped
and hissed and the hobbyhorse neighed
pranced and capered and the rest frisked
and frolicked clashing their hobnailed shoes
against the pavement till it sparkled with
the marks their energetic caprioles
it was in fine a scene ridiculous confusion
that deafened the ear made the eyes
giddy and must have altogether stunned
any indifferent spectator whilst personal
apprehension and a consciousness that
much the popular enjoyment arose from
the ridicule being addressed against them
dismayed the monks who were moreover
little comforted by the reflection that
bold in their disguise the mummers who
whooped and capered around them might
on slight provocation turn their jest into
earnest or at least proceed to those practical
pleasantries which at all times arise
so naturally out the frolicsome and mischievous
disposition the metropolis 
they looked to their abbot amid the tusoi
the abbot
must with such looks as landsmen cast upon
the pilot when the storm is at the highest
 looks which express that they are devoid
 all hope arising from their own exertions
and not very confident in any success
likely to attend those their paulinus

the abbot himself specified at a stand 
he felt no fear but he was sensible the
danger expressing his rising indignation
which he was scarcely able to suppress he
made a gesture with his hand as if commanding
silence which was at first only replied
to by redoubled shouts and peals 
wild laughter when however the same
motion and as nearly in the same manner
had been made by howleglas it was immediately
obeyed by the riotous companions
who expected fresh food for mirth
in the conversation betwixt the real and
mock abbot having no small confidence
in the vulgar wit and impudence their
leader accordingly they began to shout
 to it fathersto it fight monk
the abbot 
fight madcap abbot against abbot is fair
play and so is reason against unreason and
malice against monkery 
 silence my mates said howleglas 
cannot two learned fathers the church
hold communing together but you must
come here with your beargarden whoop
and hollow as if you were hounding forth
a mastiff upon a mad bull i say silence 
and let this learned father and i confer
touching matters affecting our mutual state
and authority
my children said father ambrose
 mis children too and happy children
they are said his burlesque counterpart 
many a wise child knows not its own father
and it is well they have two to chuse
betwixt
 if thou hast aught in thee save scoffing
and ribaldry said the real abbot
 permit me for thine own soul's sake to
speak a few words to these misguided men
 aught in me but scoffing mayest thou 
retorted the abbot unreason why
reverend brother i have all that becomes
 the abbot
mine office at this time aday i have beef
ale and brandywine with other condiments
not worth mentioning and for
speaking man why speak away and we
will have turn about like honest fellows
during this discussion the wrath magdalen
graeme had risen to the uttermost 
she approached the abbot and placing herself
by his side said in a low and yet distinct
tone wake and arouse thee father
 the sword saint peter is in thy
hand strike and avenge saint peter's patrimony
 bind them in the chains which
being rivetted by the church on earth are
rivetted in heaven's
 peace sister said the abbot let
not their madness destroy our discretion 
i pray thee peace and let me do mine 
it is the first peradventure it may bethe
last time i shall be called on to discharge
it
nay my holy brother said howleglas
 i read you take the holy sister's advice
never throve convent without woman's
counsel s
the abbot 
 peace vain man said the abbot 
 and you my brethren 
nay nay said the abbot unreason
 no speaking to the lay people until you
have conferred with your brother the
cowl i swear by bell and candle
that not one my congregation shall listen
to one word you have to say so you had as
well address yourself to me who will
to escape a conference so ludicrous
the abbot again attempted an appeal to
what respectful feelings might yet remain
amongst the inhabitants the halidome
once so devoted to their spiritual superiors
alas the abbot unreason had only to
flourish his mock crosier and the whooping
the hallooing and the dancing were
renewed with a vehemence which would
have defied the lungs stentor
 and now my mates said the abbot
 unreason once again dight your gabs
and be hushed let us see if the cock 
kennaquhair will fight or flee the pit
there was again a dead silence expectation
 which father ambrose availed
 the abbot
himself to address his antagonist seeing
plainly that he could gain an audience on
no other terms wretched man said
he hast thou no better employment for
thy carnal wit than to employ it in leading
these blind and helpless creatures into the
pit utter darkness 
truly my brother replied howleglas
 i can see little difference betwixt your
employment and mine save that you make
a sermon a jest and i make a jest a
sermon
 unhappy being said the abbot who
hast no better subject pleasantry than
that which should make thee tremble no
sounder jest than thine own sins and no
better objects for laughter than those who
can absolve thee from the guilt them 
 verily my reverend brother said the
mock abbot what you say might be true
if in laughing at hypocrites i meant to
laugh at religion o it is a precious thing
to wear a long dress with a girdle and a
cowl we become a holy pillar mother
church and a boy must not play at ball
the abbot 
against the walls for fear breaking a
painted window
and will you my friends said the
abbot looking round and speaking with a
vehemence which secured him a tranquil
audience for some time will you suffer
a profane buffoon within the very church
 god to insult his ministers many 
you all you perhaps have lived under
my holy predecessors who were called upon
to rule in this church where i am called
upon to suffer if you have worldly goods
they are their gift and when you scorned
not to accept better gifts the mercy and
forgiveness the church were they not
ever at your command did we not pray
whileyouwerejovialwake while you slept
some the good wives the hali
dome were wont to say so said the abbot
 unreason but his jest met in this instance
but slight applause and father ambrose
having gained a moment's attention
hastened to improve it
 what said he j and is this grateful is
 the abbot
it seemly is it honest to assail with scorn
a few old men from whose predecessors you
hold all and whose only wish is to die in
peace among these fragments what was
once the light the land and whose daily
prayer is that they may be removed ere that
hour comes when the last spark shall be extinguished
and the land left in the darkness
which it has chosen rather than light we
have not turned against you the edge the
spiritual sword to revenge our temporal persecution
 the tempest your wrath has despoiled
us land and deprived us almost
 our daily food but we have not repaid
it with the thunders excommunication 
we only pray your leave to live and die
within the church which is our own invoking
god our lady and the holy saints
to pardon your sins and our own undisturbed
by scurril buffoonery and blasphemy

this speech so different in tone and termination
from that which the crowd had
expected produced an effect upon their
the abbot 
feelings unfavourable to the prosecution 
their frolic the more ice dancers stood
still the hobbyhorse surceased his capering
 pipe and tabor were mute and silence
like a heavy cloud seemed to descend
on the once noisy rabble several the
beasts were obviously moved to compunction
 the bear could not restrain his sobs
and a huge fox was observed to wipe his eyes
with his tail but in especial the dragon
lately so formidably rampant now relaxed
the terror his claws uncoiled his tremendous
rings and grumbled out his fiery
throat in a repentant tone by the mass
i thought no harm in exercising our old
pastime but an i had thought the good
father would have taken it so to heart i
would as soon have played your devil as
your dragon
in this momentary pause the abbot
stood amongst the miscellaneous and grotesque
forms by which he was surrounded
triumphant as saint anthony in ballots
temptations but howleglas would not so
resign his purpose
 the abbot
 and how now my masters said he 
 is this fair play or no have you not chosen
me abbot unreason and is it lawful
for any you to listen to common sense today
was i not formally elected by you in
solemn chapter held in luckier martin's
changehouse and will you now desert me
and give up your old pastime and privilege 
play out the play and he that speaks the
next word sense or reason or bids us
think or consider or the like that which
befits not the day i will have him solemnly
ducked in the milldam 
the rabble mutable as usual huzza'd
the pipe and tabor struck up the hobbyhorse
pranced the beasts roared and even
the repentant dragon began again to coil
up his spires and prepare himself for fresh
gambols but the abbot might have still
overcome by his eloquence and his entreaties
the malicious designs the revellers
had not dame magdalen graeme given
loose to the indignation which she had long
suppressed
the abbot 
 scoffers she said and men belial
blasphemous heretics and truculent tyrants

your patience my sister entreat and
i command you said the abbot let me
do my duty disturb me not in mine own
office 
but dame magdalen continued to thunder
forth her threats in the name popes
and councils and in the name every
saint from saint michael downward
my comrades said the abbot unreason
 this good dame hath not spoke a
single word reason and therein may
esteem herself free from the law but
what she spoke was meant for reason and
therefore unless she confesses and avouches
all which she has said to be nonsense it
shall pass for such so far as to incur the
penalty our statutes wherefore holy
dame pilgrim or abbess or whatever thou
art be mute with thy mummery or beware
the milldam we will have neither spiritual
nor temporal scolds in our diocese
 unreason 
 the abbot
as he spoke thus he extended his hand
towards the old woman while his followers
shouted a doom a doom and prepared
to second his purpose when lo it was suddenly
frustrated roland graeme had witnessed
with indignation the insults offered
to his old spiritual preceptor but yet had
wit enough to reflect he could render him
no assistance but might well by ineffective
interference make matters worse but when
he saw his aged relative in danger personal
violence he gave way to the natural
impetuosity his temper and stepping
forward struck his poniard into the body
 the abbot unreason whom the blow
instantly prostrated on the pavement
the abbot 
chapter xv
as when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd
mad are their motions and their tongues are loud
and stones and brands in rattling holies fly
and all the rustic arras which fury can supply 
then if some grave and pious man appear
they hush their noise and lend a listening ear
dryden's virgil
a dreadful shout vengeance was raised
by the revellers whose sport was thus
so fearfully interrupted but for an instant
the want weapons amongst the multitude
as well as the inflamed features and
brandished poniard roland grasme kept
them at bay while the abbot horrorstruck
at the violence implored with uplifted
hands pardon for bloodshed committed
within the holy sanctuary magdalen
grasme alone expressed triumph in the
vol i o
s the abbot
blow her descendant had dealt to the scoffer
mixed however with a wild and anxious
expression terror for her grandson's safety
 let him perish she said in his
blasphemy let him die en the holy pavement
which he has insulted
but the rage the multitude the grief
 the abbot the exultation the enthusiastic
magdalen were all mistimed and unnecessary
the mortally wounded howled
as he was supposed sprung alertly up
from the floor calling aloud a miracle
a miracle my masters as brave a miracle
as ever was wrought in the kirk kenna
quhair and i charge you my masters as
your lawfully chosen abbot that you touch
no one without my command you wolf
and bear will guard this pragmatic youth
but without hurting him and you reverend
brother will with your comrades
withdraw to your cells for our conference
has ended like all conferences leaving each
 his own mind as before and if we fight
both you and your brethren and the kirk
the abbot 
will have the worst on't wherefore pack
up your pipes and begone
the hubbub was beginning again to awaken
but still father ambrose hesitated as
uncertain to what path his duty called him
whether to face out the present storm or
to reserve himself for a better moment his
brother unreason observed his difficulty
and said in a tone more natural and less affected
than that with which he had hitherto
sustained his character we came hither
my good sir more in mirth than in mischief
 our bark is worse than our bite
and especially we mean you no personal
harm wherefore draw off while the play
is good j for it is ill whistling for a hawk
when she is once on the soar and worse to
snatch the quarry from the ban dog let
these fellows once begin their brawl and
it will be too much for madness itself let
alone the abbot unreason to bring them
back to the lure
the brethren crowded around father
ambrosius and joined in urging him to
 the abbot
give place to the torrent the present revel
was they said an ancient custom which his
predecessors had permitted and old father
nicholas himself had played the dragon
in the days the abbot ingram
 and we now reap the fruit the seed
which they have so unadvisedly sown said
ambrosius they taught men to make a
mock what is holy what wonder that the
descendants scoffers become robbers and
plunderers but be it as you list my bred
towards the contour and
you dame i command you by the authority
which i have over you and by your
respect for that youth's safety that you go
with us without farther speech yet stay
what are your intentions towards that
youth whom you detain prisoner wot ye
he continued addressing howleglas in a
stern tone voice that he bears the livery
 the house avenel they who fear
not the anger heaven may at least dread
the wrath man
 cumber not yourself concerning him
the abbot 
answered howleglas we know right well
who and what he is
 let me pray said the abbot in a tone
 entreaty that you do him no wrong
for the rash deed which he attempted in
his imprudent zeal
i say cumber not yourself about it
father answered howleglas but move
off with your train male and female or i
will not undertake to save yonder shesaint
from the duckingstool and as for bearings
malice my stomach has no room for
it it is he added clapping his hand on
his portly belly too well untasted outwith
straw and buckram gramercy to them
both they kept out that madcap's dagger
as well as a milan corslet could have done
in fact the homedriven poniard roland
graeme had lighted upon the stuffing
 the fictitious paunch which the abbot
 unreason wore as a part his characteristic
dress and it was only the force 
the blow which had prostrated that reverend
person on the ground for a moment
satisfied in some degree by this man's
 the abbot
assurances and compelled to give way to
superior force the abbot ambrosius retired
from the church at the head the
monks and left the court free for the revellers
to work their will but wild and
wilful as these rioters were they accompanied
the retreat the religions with none
 those shouts contempt and derision
with which they had at first hailed then
the abbot's discourse had affected some
 them with remorse others with shame
and all with a transient degree respect
they remained silent until the last monk
had disappeared through the sidedoor
which communicated with their dwellingplace
and even then it cost some exhortations
on the part howleglas some caprioles
 the hobbyhorse and some gallops
 the dragon to rouse once more the rebuked
spirit revelry
 and how now my masters said the
abbot unreason and wherefore look
on me with such blank jack a lent visages 
will you lose your old pastime for an oldwife's
tale saints and purgatory why
the abbot 
i thought you would have made all split
long since come strike up tabor and harp
strike up fiddle and beck dance and be
merry today and let care come tomorrow
bear and wolf look to your prisonerprance
hobby hiss dragon and halloo
boys we grow older every moment we
stand idle and life is too short to be spent
in playing mischance
this pithy exhortation was attended with
the effect desired they fumigated the
church with burnt wool and feathers instead
 incense put foul water into the
holywater basins and celebrated a parody
on the churchservice the mock abbot
officiating at the altar they sung ludicrous
and indecent parodies to the tune church
hymns they violated whatever vestments
or vessels belonging to the abbey they
could lay their hands upon and playing
every freak which the whim the moment
could suggest to their wild caprice at length
they fell to more lasting deeds demolition
pulled down and destroyed some 
the abbot
vet woodwork dashed out the painted
windows which had escaped former violence
and in their rigorous search after
sculpture dedicated to idolatry began to
destroy what ornaments yet remained entire
upon the tombs and around the cornices
 the pillars
the spirit demolition like other tastes
increases by indulgence from these lighter
attempts at mischief the more tumultuous
part the meeting began to meditate destruction
on a more extended scale let
lis heave it down altogether the old crow's
nest became a general cry among them 
 it has served the pope and his rooks too
long and up they struck a ballad which
was then popular among the lower classes
the pain that pagan full pride
hath blinded us over lang
for where the blind the blind doth lead
no marvel faith gae wrong
like prince and king
he led the ring
 all iniquity
sing hay trix trim go trix
under the greenwood tree
the abbot 
the bishop rich he could not preach
for sporting with the lasses
the silly friar behoved to fleece
for awmous as he passes
the curate his creed
he could not read
shame fa the company
sing hay trin trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
thundering out this chorus a notable
hunting song which had been pressed into
the service some polemical poet the followers
 the abbot unreason were turning
every moment more tumultuous and
getting beyond the management even 
that reverend prelate himself when a knight
in full armour followed by two or three
menatarms entered the church and in a
stern voice commanded them to forbear
their riotous mummery
his visor was up but if it had been lowered
the cognizance the hollybranch
sufficiently distinguished sir halbert glendining
who on his homeward road was
passing through the village kennaquhair
o 
 the abbot
and moved perhaps by anxiety for his brother's
safety had come directly to the
church on hearing the uproar
 what is the meaning this he said
my masters are ye christian men and
the king's subjects and yet waste and destroy
church and chancel like so many heathens

all stood silent though doubtless there
were several disappointed and surprised at
receiving chiding instead thanks from so
zealous a protestant
the dragon indeed did at length take
upon him to be spokesman and growled
from the depth his painted maw that
they did but sweep popery out the
church with the besom destruction
 what my friends replied sir albert
glendinning think you this mumming
and masking has not more popery
in it than have these stone walls take the
leprosy out your flesh before you speak
 purifying stone walls abate your insolent
license which leads but to idle vanity
the abbot 
and sinful excess and know that what you
now practise is one the profane and unseemly
sports introduced by the priests 
rome themselves to mislead and to brutish
the souls which fell into their net
 marry come up are you there with
your bears muttered the dragon with a
draconic sullenness which was in good
keeping with his character we had as
good have been romans still if we are to
have no freedom in our pastimes 
doest thou reply to me so said sir
halbert glendinning or is there any pastime
in grovelling on the ground there like
a gigantic kail worm get out thy
painted case or by my knighthood i will
treat you like the beast and reptile you have
made yourself
beast and reptile retorted the offended
dragon setting aside your knighthood
i hold myself as well a born man as
thyself
the knight made no answer in words
but bestowed two such blows with the butt
 the abbot
 his lance on the petulant dragon that
had not the hoops which constituted the
ribs the machine been pretty strong they
would hardly have saved those the actor
from being broken in all haste the masquer
crept out his disguise unwilling to
abide a third buffet from the lance the
enraged knight and when the exdragon
stood on the floor the church he presented
to halbert glendinning the wellknown
countenance dan the howletfirst
an ancient comrade his own ere
fate had raised him so high above the rank
to which he was born the clown looked
sulkily upon the knight as if to upbraid
him for his violence towards an old acquaintance
and glendinning's own good
nature reproached him for the violence he
had acted upon him
 i did wrong to strike thee he said
dan but in truth i knew thee not
thou wert ever a mad fellow come to 
castle and we will see how my hawks
fly
the abbot 
and if we shew him not falcons that
will mount as merrily as rockets said the
abbot unreason i would your honour
laid as hard on my bones as you did on his
even now
 how now sir knave said the knight
and what has brought you hither 
the abbot hastily ridding himself the
false nose which mystified his physiognomy
and the supplementary belly which
made up his disguise stood before his master
in his real character adam woodcock
the falconer avenel
how varlet said the knight hast
thou dared to come here and disturb the
very house my brother was dwelling in 
 and it was even for that reason craving
your honour's pardon that i came hir
ther for i heard the country was to be upto
chuse an abbot unreason and sure
thought i i that can sing dance leap
backwards over a broadsword and am as
good a fool as ever sought promotion have
all chance carrying the office and if i
gain my election i may stand his honour's
 the abbot
brother in some stead supposing things fall
roughly out at the kirk saint mary's
 thou art but a cogging knave said
sir halbert and well i wot that love 
ale and brandy besides the humour riot
and frolic would draw thee a mile when
love my house would not bring thee a
yard but go to carry thy roisterers elsewhere
 to the alehouse if they list and
there are crowns to pay your charges 
make out the day's madness without doing
more mischief and be wise men tomorrow
and hereafter learn to serve a good cause
better than by acting like ruffians
obedient to his master's mandate the
falconer was collecting his discouraged followers
and whispering into their ears 
 away away tace is latin for a candle 
never mind the good knight's puritanism
we will play the frolic out over a stand
 double ale in dame martin the brewster's
barn yard draw off harp and tabor
bagpipe and drum mum till you are out
 the churchyard then let the welkin ring
again move on wolf and bear keep the
the abbot 
hind legs till you cross the kirkstyle and
then shew yourselves beasts mettle 
what devil sent him here to spoil our holiday
 but anger him not my heart his
lance is no goose feather as dan's ribs can
tell
 by my soul said dan had it been
another than my ancient comrade i would
have made my father's old fox fly about
his ears 
hush hush man replied adam
woodcock not a word that way as you
value the safety your bones what man 
we must take a clink as it passes so it is not
bestowed in downright illwill
but i will take no such thing said
dan the howletfirst sullenly resisting
the efforts woodcock who was dragging
him out the church when the quick
military eye sir halbert glendinning
detecting roland graeme betwixt his two
guards the knight exclaimed so ho 
falconer woodcock knave hast thou
brought my lady's page in mine own 
the abbot
very to assist at this hopeful revel thine
with your wolves and bears since you
were at such mumming you might if
you would have at least saved the credit
 my household by dressing him up as a
jackannales bring him hither fellows 
adam woodcock was too honest and
downright to permit blame to light upon
the youth when it was undeserved i
swear he said by saint martin bull
lions 
 and what hast thou to do with saint
martin 
nay little enough sir unless when he
sends such rainy days that we cannot fly a
hawk but i say to your worshipful knighthood
that as i am a true man
 as you are a false varlet had been the
better obtestation
 nay if your knighthood allows me not
to speak i can hold my tongue but the
boy came not hither by my bidding for all
that
but to gratify his own malapert pleathe
abbot 
sure i warrant me said sir halbert glendining
 come hither young springald
and tell me whether you have your mistress's
license to be so far absent from the castle
or to dishonour my livery by mingling in
such a maygame 
sir halbert glendinning answered
roland grasme with steadiness i have
obtained the permission or rather the commands
 your lady to dispose my time
hereafter according to my own pleasure i
have been a most unwilling spectator 
this maygame since it is your pleasure so
to call it and i only wear your livery until
i can obtain clothes which bear no such
badge servitude
 how am i to understand this young
man said sir halbert glendinning speak
plainly for i am no reader riddles that
my lady favoured thee i know what hast
thou done to disoblige her and occasion
thy dismissal 
nothing to speak said adam woods
the abbot
cock answering for the boy a foolish
quarrel with me which was more foolishly
told over again to my honoured lady cost
the poor boy his place for my part i
will say freely that i was wrong from beginning
to except about the washing
 the eyass's meat there i stand to it
that i was right
with that the goodnatured falconer
repeated to his master the whole history 
the squabble which had brought poland
graeme into disgrace with his mistress butin
a manner so favourable for the page that
sir halbert could not but suspect his generous
motive
 thou art a goodnatured fellow he
said adam woodcock
 as ever had falcon upon fist said
adam and for that matter so is master
roland but being half a gentleman by
his office his blood is soon up and so is
mine
well said sir halbert be it as it
the abbot 
will my lady has acted hastily for this was
no great matter offence to discard the
lad whom she had trained up for years j
but he i doubt not made it worse by his
prating it jumps well with a purpose however
which i had in my mind draw off
these people woodcock and you roland
grseme attend me
the page followed him in silence into
the abbot's house where stepping into
the first apartment which he found open
he commanded one his attendants to let
his brother master edward glendinning
know that he desired to speak with him
the menatarms went gladly off to join
their comrade adam woodcock and the
jolly crew whom he had assembled at dame
martin's the hostler's wife and the page
and knight were left alone in the apartment
sir halbert glendinning paced the
floor for a moment in silence and then
thus addressed his attendant
thou mayest have remarked stripling
 the abbot
that i have but seldom distinguished thee
by much notice i see thy colour rises but
do not speak till thou hearest me out i
say i have never much distinguished thee
not because i did not see that in thee
which i might well have praised but because
i saw something blameable which
such praises might have made worse thy
mistress dealing according to her pleasure
in her own household as no one hath better
reason or title had picked thee from
the rest and treated thee more like a relation
than a domestic and if thou didst
shew some vanity and petulance under such
distinction it were injustice not to say
that thou hast profited both in thy exercises
and in thy breeding and hast shown
many sparkles a gentle and manly spirit
moreover it were ungenerous having bred
thee up freakish and fiery to dismiss thee
to want or wandering for shewing that very
peevishness and impatience discipline
which arose from thy too delicate nurture
therefore and for the credit my own
the abbot 
household i am determined to retain thee
in my train until i can honourably dispose
 thee elsewhere with a fair prospect 
thy going through the world with credit to
the house that brought thee up
if there was something in sir halbert
glendinning's speech which flattered roland's
pride there was also much that according
to his mode thinking was an
alloy to the compliment and yet his conscience
instantly told him that he ought to
accept with grateful deference the offer
which was made him by the husband his
kind protectress and his prudence however
slender could not but admit he would
enter the world under very different auspices
as a retainer sir halbert blending
so famed for wisdom courage and
influence from those under which he might
partake the wanderings and become an
agent in the visionary schemes for such
they appeared to him magdalen his relative
still a strong reluctance to reenter
 the abbot
a service from which he had been dismissed
with contempt almost counterbalanced
these considerations
sir halbert looked on the youth with
surprise and resumed you seem to hesitate
young man are your own prospects
so inviting that you should pause ere
you accept those which i offer to you t or
must i remind you that although you have
offended your benefactress even to the
point her dismissing you yet i am convinced
the knowledge that you have gone
unguided on your own wild way into a
world so disturbed as ours scotland
cannot in the upshot but give her sorrow
and pain from which it is in gratitude
your duty to preserve her no less than it
is in common wisdom your duty to accept
my offered protection for your own sake
where body and soul are alike endangered
should you refuse it
roland graeme replied in a respectful
tone but at the same time with some spirit
the abbot 
i am not ungrateful for such countenance
as has been afforded me by the lord 
and i am glad to learn for the first
time that i have not had the misfortune to
be utterly beneath his observation as i had
thought and it is only needful to shew
me how i can testify my duty and my gratitude
towards my early and constant benefactress
with my life's hazard and i will
gladly peril it he stopped
these are but words young man answered
glendinning large protestations
are often used to supply the place effectual
service i know nothing in which the
peril your life can serve the lady 
 i can only say she will be pleased to
learn you have adopted some course which
may ensure the safety your person and
the weal your soul what ails you that
you accept not that safety when it is offered
you 
my only relative who is alive answered
roland at least the only relative whom
i have ever seen has rejoined me since i
sc the abbot
was dismissed from the castle avenel 
and i must consult with her whether i can
adopt the line to which you now call me
or whether her encreasing infirmities or the
authority which she is entitled to exercise
over me may not require me to abide with
her
 where is this relation said sir albert
glendinning
in this house answered the page
 go then and seek her out said the
knight avenel more than meet it is
that thou shouldst have her approbation
yet worse than foolish would she shew herself
in denying it
roland left the apartment to seek for his
grandmother and as he retreated the abbot
entered
the two brothers met as brothers who
love each other fondly yet meet rarely together
such indeed was the case their
mutual affection attached them to each
other but in every pursuit habit or sentiment
connected with the discords the
the abbot s
tides the friend and counsellor murray
stood opposed to the roman catholic priest
nor indeed could they have held very much
society together without giving cause 
offence and suspicion to their confederates
on each side after a close embrace on
the part both and a welcome on that
 the abbot sir halbert glendinning expressed
his satisfaction that he had come
in time to appease the riot raised by howhellas
and his tumultuous followers
and yet he said when i look on
your garments brother edward i cannot
help thinking there still remains an abbot
 unreason within the bounds the monastery

and wherefore carp at my garments
brother halbert said the abbot it is
the spiritual armour my calling and as
such beseems me as well as breastplate and
baldric become your own bosom
 ay but there were small wisdom methinks
in putting on armour where we have
vol r p
oi
 the abbot
 power to fight it is but a dangerous
temerity to defy the foe whom wee cannot
resist
for that my brother no one can answer
said the abbot until the battle be
fought and were it even as you say methinks
a brave man though desperate 
victory would rather desire to fight and
fall than to resign sword and shield on some
mean and dishonourable composition with
his insulting antagonist but let not you
and i make discord a theme on which vie
cannot agree but rather stay and partake
though a heretic my admission feast
you need not fear my brother that your
zeal for restoring the primitive discipline
 the church will on this occasion be offended
with the rich profusion a conventual
banquet the days our old friend
abbot boniface are over and the superior
 saint mary's has neither forests nor fishings
woods nor pastures nor cornfields 
neither flocks nor herds bucks nor wildthe
abbot 
fowl granaries wheat nor storehouses
 oil and wine ale and mead the
refectioners office is ended and such a
meal as a hermit in romance can offer to
a wandering knight is all we have to set
before you bat if you will share it with
us we will eat it with a cheerful heart and
thank you my brother for your timely protection
against these rude scoffers
 my dearest brother said the knight
 it grieves me deeply i cannot abide with
you j but it would sound ill for us both were
one the reformed congregation to sit
down at your admission feast and if i can
ever have the satisfaction affording you
effectual protection it will be much owing
to my remaining unsuspected countenancing
or approving your religious rites
and ceremonies it will demand whatever
consideration i can acquire among my own
friends to shelter the bold man who contrary
to law and the edicts parliament
has dared to take up the office abbot 
saint mary's
 the abbot
 trouble not yourself with the task my
brother replied father ambrosius i
would lay down my dearest blood to know
that you defended the church for the
church's sake but while you refrain unhappily
her enemy i would not that you
endangered your own safety or diminished
your own comforts for the sake my individual
protection but who comes hitherto
disturb the few minutes fraternal
communication which our evil fate allows
us
the door the apartment opened as the
abbot spoke and dame magdalen graeme
entered
 who is this woman said sir halbert
glendinning somewhat sternly and what
does she want 
 that you know me not said the ma
tron signifies little i come by your own
order to give my free consent that the
stripling leland graeme return to your
service j and having saidso i cumber you
no longer with my presence peace be with
you she turned to go away but was
the abbot 
stopped by the enquiries sir halbert
glendinning
 who are you what are you and
why do you not await to make me answer 
i was she replied while yet i belonged
to the world a matron no vulgar
name now i am magdalen a poorpilgrim
er for the sake holy kirk
 yea said sir halbert art thou a catholic
 i thought my dame said that roland
graeme came reformed kin
 his father said the matrons was a
heretic or rather one who regarded neither
orthodoxy nor heresy neither the temple
 the church or antichrist i too for
the sins the times make sinners have
seemed to conform to your unhallowed
rites but i had my dispensation and my
absolution
you see brother said sir halbert
with a smile meaning towards his brother
 that we accuse you not altogether
grounds mental equivocation
 my brother you do us injustice rep

 the abhor
plied the abbot this woman as her bearing
may itself warrant you is not in her
perfect mind thanks i must needs say
to the persecution your marauding barons
and your latitudinarian clergy
 i will not dispute the point said sir
halbert the evils the time are unhappily
so numerous that both churches may
divide them and have enow to spare so
saying he leaned from the window the
apartment and winded his bugle
why do you sound your horn my brother
 said the abbot we have spent but
few minutes together
alas said the elder brother and
even these few have been sullied by disagreement
i sound to horse my brother 
the rather that to avert the consequences 
this day's rashness on your part requires
hasty efforts on mine dame you will
oblige me by letting your young relative
know thatwe mount instantly i intend not
that he shall return to avenel with me it
would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and
my household j at least to taunts which his
the abbor 
proud heart could ill brook and my wish
is to do him kindness he shall therefore
go forward to edinburgh with one ray retinue
whom i shall send back to say what
has chanced here you seem rejoiced at
this he added fixing his eyes keenly on
magdalen greene who returned his gaze
with calm indifference
 i would rather she said that roland
a poor and friendless orphan were
the jest the world at large than the
menials at avenel
 fear not dame he shall be scorned
by neither answered the knight
 it may be she replied it may well
be but i will trust more to his own bearing
than to your countenance she iefc
the room as she spoke
the knight looked after her as she departed
but turned instantly to his brother
and expressing in the most affectionate
terms his wishes for his welfare and happiness
craved his leave to depart my
knaves he said are too busy at the 
the abbot
stand to leave their revelry for the empty
breath a bugle horn
you have freed them from higher restraint
halbert answered the abbot and
therein taught them to rebel against your
own
 fear not that edward exclaimed
halbert who never gave his brother his
monastic name ambrosius j none obey
the command real duty so well as those
who are free fiom the observance slavish
bondage
he was turning to depart when the abbot
said let us not yet part brother 
here comes some light refreshment leave
not the house which i must now call mine
till force expel me from it until you have
at least broken bread with me
the poor lay brother the same who acted
as porter now entered the apartment
bearing some simple refreshment and a
flask wine he had found it he said
with officious humility by rummaging
through every nook the cellar
the abbot 
the knight filled a small silver cup and
quaffing it off asked his brother to pledge
him observing the wine was bacharac 
the first vintage and great age
ay said the poor lay brother it
came out the nook which old brother
nicholas may his soul be happy was wont
to call abbot ingram's corner and abbot
ingram was bred at the convent 
wartburg which i understand to be near
where that choice wine grows 
 true my reverend sir said sir haubert
 and therefore i entreat my brother
and you to pledge me in a cup this orthodox
vintage
the thin old porter looked vith a wish
i'll glance towards the abbot do venial
said his superior and the old man
seized with a trembling hand a beverage
to which he had been long unaccustomed
drained the cup with protracted delight as
if dwelling on the flavour and perfume
and set it down with a melancholy smile
and shake the head as if bidding adieu
 the abbot
in future to such delicious potations the
brothers smiled but when sir halbert motioned
to the abbot to take up his cup and
do him reason the abbot in turn shook his
head and replied this is no day for the
abbot saint mary's to eat the fat and
drink the sweet in water from our lady's
well he added filling a cup with the limpid
element i wish you my brother all
happiness and above all a true sight 
your spiritual errors
and to you my beloved edward replied
glendinning wish the free exercise
 your own free reason and the discharge
 more important duties than are
connected with the idle name which you
have so rashly assumed
the brothers parted with deep regret y
and yet each confident in his own opinion
felt somewhat relieved by the absence 
one whom he respected so much and with
whom he could agree so little
soon afterwards the sound the knight
 avenei's trumpets were heard and the
the abbot st
abbot went to the top a tower from
whose dismantled battlements he could
soon see the horsemen ascending the riship
ground in the direction the drawbridge
as he gazed magdalen graeme
came to his side
 thou art come he said to catch
the last glimpse thy grandson my sister
yonder he wends under the charge the
best knight in scotland his faith ever excepted

 thou canst bear witness my father
that it was no vish either mine or roland's
replied the matron which induced
the knight avenel as he is called
again to entertain my grandson in his households
 heaven which confounds the wise
with their own wisdom and the wicked with
their own policy hath placed him wherefor
the service the church i would most
wish him to be
i know not what you mean my sister
said the abbot
reverend father replied magdalen
 hast thou never heard that there are spits
the abbot
its powerful to rend the walls a castle
asunder when once admitted which yet
cannot enter the house unless they are invited
nay dragged over the threshold 
twice hath roland grseme been thus
drawn into the household avenel by
those who now hold the title let them
look to the issue
so saying she left the turret and the
abbot after pausing a moment on her
words which hf imputed to the unsettled
state her mind followed down the winding
stair to celebrate his admission to his
high office by fast and prayer instead 
revelling and thanksgiving

the publishers the collection standard
novels are extremely desirous that i should furnish
them with a few lines by way introduction to the
appearance st leon in its present form i am
however at a loss how to oblige them in the original
 i frankly stated the sources upon which i had
drawn for the idea and conduct the work i have
therefore no remarks to offer but these which follow
in i produced the novel caleb williams i
believed myself fortunate in the selection i had made
 the groundplot that work an atrocious
crime committed by a man previously the most
exemplary habits the annoyance he suffers from the
immeasurable and everwakeful curiosity a raw youth
who is placed about his person the state doubt in
which the reader might for a time be as to the truth
 the charges and the consequences growing out 
these causes seemed to me to afford scope for a narrative
 no common interest i was not disappointed
caleb williams was honoured with the public favour
the consequence was that i was solicited to try my
hand again in a work fiction i hesitated long i
despaired finding again a topic so rich interest
and passion in those days it was deemed a most
daring thought to attempt to write a novel with the
hope that it might hereafter rank among the classics
 a language the most successful english writers

in that province literature had scarcely gone
beyond three it had not then been conceived that the
same author might produce twenty or thirty at the
rate two or three per annum and might still at least
retain his hold upon the partiality his contemporaries
to sir walter scott we are indebted for this
discovery
at length after having passed some years in a
state diffidence and irresolution i ventured on the
task it struck me that if i could mix human feelings
and passions with incredible situations i might
thus attain a sort novelty that would conciliate the
patience at least even some the severest judges
to this way thinking st leon was indebted for a
local habitation and a name
one my most valued friends mr northcote
has often told me that the public may sometimes be
interested in the perusal a but that they never
give themselves any trouble about the author he
therefore kindly advised me on no occasion to say anything
in print about myself the present race 
readers seem scarcely disposed to verify this maxim
they are understood to be desirous to learn something
 the peculiarities the life character and behaviour
 an author before they consign him to the
gulph oblivion and are willing to learn from his own
testimony what train thoughts induced him to adopt
the particular subject and plan the work upon the
perusal which they are engaged
june 

the following passage from a work said to be written by
the late dr john campbel and entitled hermippus re
divivusj suggested the first hint the present performance

there happened in the year an odd accident at
venice that made a very great stir then and which i
think deserves to be rescued from oblivion the great
freedom and ease with which all persons who make a good
appearance live in that city is known sufficiently to all
who are acquainted with it such will not therefore be surprised
that a stranger who went by the name signor
gualdi and who made a considerable figure there was
admitted into the best company though nobody knew who
or what he was he remained at venice for some months
and three things were remarked in his conduct the first
was that he had a small collection fine pictures which
he readily showed to any body that desired it the next
that he was perfectly versed in all arts and sciences and
spoke on every subject with such readiness and sagacity as
astonished all who heard him and it was in the third place
observed that he never wrote or received any letter never
desired any credit or made use bills exchange but
paid for every thing in ready money and lived decently
though not in splendour
cf this gentleman met one day at the coffeehouse with
a venetian nobleman who was an extraordinary good judge
 pictures he had heard signor gualdi's collection and
in a very polite manner desired to see them to which the
other very readily consented after the venetian had

viewed signer gualdi's collection and expressed his satisfaction
by telling him that he had never seen a finer considering
the number pieces which it consisted he cast
his eye by chance over the chamberdoor where hung a
picture this stranger the venetian looked upon it and
then upon him this picture was drawn for you sir
says he to signor gualdi to which the other made no answer
but by a low bow you look continued the venetian
 like a man fifty and yet i know this picture to
be the hand titian who has been dead one hundred
and thirty years how is this possible it is not easy
said signor gualdi gravely to know all things that are
possible but there is certainly no crime in my being like
a picture drawn by titian the venetian easily perceived
by his manner speaking that he had given the stranger
offence and therefore took his leave

there is nothing that human imagination can figure
brilliant and enviable that human genius and skill do not
aspire to realize in the early ages antiquity one 
the favourite topics speculation was a perfect system 
civil policy and no sooner had plato delineated his imaginary
republic than he sought for a spot earth upon
which to execute his plan in my own times and for
upwards a century before them the subject which has
chiefly occupied men intrepid and persevering study
has been the great secret nature the opus magnum in
its two grand and inseparable branches the art multiplying
gold and defying the inroads infirmity and
death
it is notorious that uncommon talents and unparalleled
industry have been engaged in this mighty task it has
i know been disputed by the audacious adversaries 
all sober and reasonable evidence whether these talents
and industry have in any case attained the object they
sought it is not to my purpose to ascertain the number
 those whose victory over the powers and inertness 
matter has been complete it is enough that i am a living
instance the existence such men to these two secrets
if they are to be considered as two i have been for
years in the habit resorting for my gratification i have
in my possession the choice being as wealthy as i please
and the gift immortal life every thing that i see
almost i can without difficulty make my own for what
palaces pictures parks or gardens rarities art or nature
have not a price at which their owner will consent to yield
b
 travels st leon
them the luxuries every quarter the world are
emptied at my feet i can command to an extent almost
inconceivable the passions men what heart can withstand
the assault princely magnificence what man is
inaccessible to a bribe add to these advantages that i am
invulnerable to disease every sun that rises finds the
circulations my frame in the most perfect order decrepitude
can never approach me a thousand winters want
the power to furrow my countenance with wrinkles or
turn my hairs to silver exhaustless wealth and eternal
youth are the attributes by which i am distinguished from
the rest mankind
i do not sit down now to write a treatise natural philosophy
the condition by which i hold my privileges is
that they must never be imparted i sit down purely to
relate a few those extraordinary events that have been
produced in the period my life which is already elapsed
by the circumstances and the peculiarity to which i have
just alluded
it is so obvious as to make it almost improper to specify
it that the pursuit in which so many my contemporaries
are engaged and the which i have so singularly
achieved is in its appearance infinitely more grand and
interesting than that which occupied the thoughts plato
and the most eminent writers antiquity what is political
liberty compared with unbounded riches and immortal
vigour the immediate application political liberty is
to render a man's patrimony or the fruits his industry
completely his own and to preserve them from the invasion
 others but the petty detail preservation or gradual
acquisition can never enter into competition with the great
secret which endows a man in a moment with everything
that the human heart can wish considered in this
light how mean and contemptible does the ambition the
boasted ancients appear compared with ours what adept
or probationer the present day would be content to
resign the study god and the profounder secrets 
nature and to bound his ardour to the investigation his
miserable existence 
it may seem perhaps to many that the history a per
travels op st leon 
son possessed advantages so unparalleled as mine must
be like the history paradise or the future happiness
 the blessed too calm and motionless too much one
invariable texture and exempt from vicissitude to excite
the attention or interest the passions the reader if he
will have patience and apply to the perusal my narrative
he will in no long time perceive how far his conjecture
is founded in sagacity and reason
some persons may be curious to know what motives can
have induced a man such enormous wealth and so every
way qualified to revel in delights to take the trouble 
penning his memoirs the immortality with which i ani
endowed seems to put out the question the common motives
that relate to posthumous fame
the curiosity here mentioned if it really exists i cannot
consent to gratify i will anticipate nothing in the
progress my story my motive for recording it will probably
become evident
i am descended from one the most ancient and honourable
families the kingdom france i was the only
child my father who died while i was an infant my
mother was a woman rather a masculine understanding
and full the prejudices nobility and magnificence
her whole soul was in a manner concentrated in the ambition
to render me the worthy successor the counts de
st leon who had figured with distinguished reputation in
the wars the holy land my father had died fighting
gallantly in the plains italy under the standard louis
the twelfth a prince whose name was never repeated tome
unaccompanied with the praises due to his military
prowess and to the singular humanity disposition by
which he acquired the title the father his people my
mother's mind was inflamed with the greatness my ancestors
and she indefatigably sought to kindle in my bosom
a similar flame it has been a longestablished custom for
the barons and feudal vassals the kings france to
enter with great personal expense into the brilliant and
dazzling expeditions their sovereigns and my father
greatly impaired his fortune in preparations for that very
campaign in which he terminated his life my mother
b 
 travels st leon
industriously applied herself to the restoration my patrimony
 and the long period my minority afforded her
scope for that purpose
it was impossible for any boy to be treated with more
kindness and considerate indulgence than i was during the
period my adolescence my mother loved me to the
very utmost limits perhaps human affection i washer
darling and her pride her waking study and her nightly
dream yet i was not pampered into corporeal imbecility
or suffered to rust in inactivity mind i was provided
with the best masters i was excited and successfully excited
zealously to apply myself to the lessons they taught
i became intimately acquainted with the italian writers 
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries i was initiated in the
study the classics to the cultivation which the revival
 letters at this time gave particular ardour i was instructed
in the principles the fine arts there was no
species accomplishment at that time in vogue that my
mother was not anxious i should make my own the only
science i neglected was the very science which has since
given rise to the most extraordinary events my life but
the object to which my attention was principally called
was the pursuit military exercises and the cultivation 
every thing that could add to the strength agility or grace
 my body and to the adventurousness and enterprise 
my mind my mother loved my honour and my fame
more than she loved my person
a circumstance that tended perhaps more than any other
to fix the yet fluctuating character my youthful mind
was my being present as a spectator at the celebrated meeting
between francis the first and henry the eighth king
 england in a field between ardres and guineas my
mother refused to accompany me being already arrived at
an age in which curiosity and the love festive scenes are
usually diminished and the expenses incurred by all the
nobility who attended upon this scene being incompatible
with the economy to which she rigidly adhered i was
therefore placed under the protection the marquis de
villeroy her brother and with two servants who attended
me formed a part his suite
travels st leon o
i was at this time fifteen years age my contemplations
had been familiar with ideas magnificence and
grandeur but my life had been spent in the most sequestered
retirement this contrast had a particular effect
upon my disposition it irritated to a very high degree my
passion for splendour and distinction i lived in the fairy
fields visionary greatness and was more than indifferent
to the major part the objects around me i pined for
every thing the reverse my present condition i cultivated
the exercises in which i was engaged only as they
were calculated to prepare me for future achievements
by the incident i have mentioned i was transported at
once from a scene modest obscurity to a scene the
most lavish splendour that the world perhaps ever contemplated
i never remembered to have seen even paris itself
the prevailing taste europe has for some time led very
much to costliness in dress this taste in its present profusion
i believe took its rise in the field the vale 
ardres the two kings were both in the vigour their
youth and were said to be the handsomest men the age
in which they lived the beauty henry was sturdy and
muscular that francis more refined and elegant without
subtracting in any considerable degree from the firmness
 his make henry was four years older than his
brother monarch the first them might have been taken
as a model to represent a youthful hercules and the last an
apollo
the splendour dress that was worn upon this occasion
exceeds almost all credibility every person distinction
might be said in a manner to carry an estate upon his
shoulders nor was the variety garments inferior to the
richness wolsey a man whose magnificence disposition
was only surpassed by the pride his soul was for the
most part the director the whole he possessed the most
absolute ascendancy over the mind his master at the
same time that francis artfully indulged his caprice that
he might claim from him in return a similar indulgence in
weightier matters
the pomp processions and the ceremony opening
this memorable festival went first a sort solemn and
b 
travels st leon
halfmoving pageant which the eye took in at leisure and
took in till it was filled this was succeeded by everything
that was rapid animated and interesting masques
and exhibitions ah kinds and which was still more tome
and which my soul devoured with indescribable ardour
hustings tilts and tournaments without the beauty
 the armour the caparisons the steeds the mettle 
the animals themselves and the ardour and grace the
combatants surpassed every thing that my fancy had ever
painted these scenes were acted in the midst a vast
amphitheatre spectators where all that was noble and
eminent either country was assembled the manliness 
aspiring youth and the boundless varieties female attraction
all were in their gayest attire every eye was
lighted up with complacency and joy if heraclitus or
any other morose philosopher who has expatiated on the
universal misery mankind had entered the field ardres
he must have retracted his assertions or fled from the
scene with confusion the kings were placed at either 
 the lists surrounded with their courtiers every eye
through this vast assembly was fixed upon the combatants 
the body every one present was inclined this way or that
in unconscious sympathy with the redoubled knights from
time to time as the favourites either party prevailed the
air was rent with shouts and acclamations
what added to the fascination all that i have yet
mentioned was that now for the first time in an equal
degree perhaps for centuries the stiffness unwieldy form
was laid aside and the heart man expanded itself with
generosity and confidence it burst the fetters ages 
and having burst them it seemed to revel in its newfound
liberty it is well known that after a few days idle
precaution and specious imprisonment on both sides francis
one morning mounted his horse and appeared without
guards or any previous notice before the tent henry
the example was contagious and from this time all ceremony
was laid aside the kings themselves entered personally
into the combats their subjects it was a
delightful and a ravishing spectacle to witness the freedom
 the old roman manners almost the old roman saturn
 st leon 
alia polished and refined with all that was graceful and
humane in the age chivalry
it may easily be imagined what an effect a scene like
this was calculated to produce upon a youth my age and
my education i recollected with anguish that the immaturity
 my years precluded me from taking any active
part in the spectacle my appearance however was sufficiently
advantageous i was presented to francis the
first he did me the honour to question me respecting
my studies and finding in me some knowledge those
arts and that literature which he was himself so zealous
a favourer he expressed to my uncle a great satisfaction
with my figure and acquisitions i might from this time
have been taken to court and made one the pages to
this illustrious monarch but the plan my mother was
different she did not wish for the present that my eye
should be satiated with public scenes or that the public
should grow too familiarly acquainted with my person she
rightly judged that my passion for the theatre glory
would grow more impetuous by being withheld for sometime
from the gratifications for which it panted she wished
that i should present myself for the first time among
the nobility france an accomplished cavalier and not
suffer the disadvantage having exposed in the eye the
world those false steps and frailties from which the inexperience
 youth is never entirely free these motives being
explained to the king he was graciously pleased to
sanction them with his approbation i accordingly returned
to finish the course my education at my paternal chateau
upon the banks the garonne
the state my mind during the three succeeding years
amply justified the sagacity my mother i was more
eager for improvement than i had ever yet been i
had before formed some conceptions the career honour
from the books i had read and from the conversation 
this excellent matron but my reveries were impotent and
little compared with what i had now seen like the author
 our holy religion i had spent my forty days without
food in the wilderness when suddenly my eyes were
opened and i was presented with all the kingdoms the
b 
travels st leon
world and all the glory them the fairy scene continued
for a moment and then vanished leaving nothing
behind it on all sides but the same barrenness and gloom
by which it had been preceded i never shut my eyes
without viewing in imagination the combats knights and
the train ladies i had been regarded with distinction
by my sovereign and francis the first stood before my
mind the abstract and model perfection and greatness
i congratulated myself upon being born in an age and
country so favourable to the acquisition all that my soul
desired
i was already eighteen years age when i experienced
the first misfortune that ever befel me it was the death
 my mother she felt the approach her dissolution
several weeks before it arrived and held repeated conversations
with me respecting the feelings i ought to entertain
and the conduct it would become me to pursue when she
should be no more
my son said she your character and the promise
 your early years have constituted my only consolation
since the death your excellent father our marriage
was the result a most sincere and exclusive attachment 
and never did man more deserve to be loved than reginald
de st leon when he died the whole world would have
been nothing to me but one vast blank if he had not left
behind him the representative his person and the heir
to his virtues while i was busied in your education i
seemed to be discharging the last duty to the memory 
my husband the occupation was sacred to the honour 
the dead even before it became so peculiarly pleasing tome
upon its own account as i afterwards found it i hope
i have in some measure discharged the task in the manner
in which my lord your father would have wished it to have
been discharged if he had lived i am thankful to heaven
that i have been spared so long for so dear and honourable
a purpose
you must now my son stand by yourself and be the
arbitrator your own actions i could have wished that
this necessity might have been a little further deferred 
but i trust your education has not been that sort which
travels st leon 
is calculated to render a young man helpless and contemptible
you have been taught to know your rank in society
and to respect yourself you have been instructed in everything
that might most effectually forward you in the career
 glory there is not a young cavalier among all the nobility
 france more accomplished or that promises to do
greater honour to his name and his country i shall not
live to witness the performance this promise but the
anticipation even now pours a long stream sunshine on
my departing hour
farewell my son you no longer stand in need 
my maternal care when i am gone you will be compelled
more vividly to feel that singleness and selfdependence
which are the source all virtue be careful yourself
be careful that your career may be both spotless and
illustrious hold your life as a thing no account when
it enters into competition with your fame a true knight
thinks no sacrifice and suffering hard that honour demands
be humane gentle generous and intrepid be prompt
to follow wherever your duty calls you remember your
ancestors knights the holy cross remember your
father follow your king who is the mirror valour 
and be ever ready for the service the distressed may
providence be your guardian may heaven shower down
a thousand blessings upon your innocence and the gallantry
 your soul 
the death my mother was a severe blow to my heart
for some time all the visions greatness and renown which
had hitherto been my chosen delight appeared distasteful
to me i hung over her insensible corpse when it had
been committed to the earth i repaired every day to the
spot where it was deposited at the hour dusk when all
visible objects faded from the eye when nature assumed
her saddest tints and the whole world seemed about to be
wrapped in the darkness the tomb the dew night
drizzled unheeded on my head and i did not turn again
towards the turrets the chateau till the hour midnight
had already sounded through the stillness the scene
time is the healer almost every grief particularly in
the sprightly season early youth in no long period
 travels st leon 
i changed the oppression inactive sorrow for the affectionate
and pious recollection my mother's last instructions
i had been too deeply imbued with sentiments 
glory for it to be possible when the first excess grief
was over that i should remain in indolence the tender
remembrance my mother itself in no long time furnished
a new stimulus to my ambition i forgot the melancholy
spectacle the last struggles her expiring life
i even became accustomed no longer to hear her voice no
longer to expect her presence when i returned to the chateau
from a short excursion her last advice was now all that
survived the author my existence
chapter ii
i was in this state mind when early one morning in the
beginning summer soon after i rose i was startled by
the sound trumpets in the plain near the chateau the
bugle at the gate was presently sounded the drawbridge
was let down and the marquis de villeroy entered the
courtyard accompanied by about thirty knights in complete
armour i saluted him with respect and the tenderness
excited by recent grief he took me by the hand
after a short repast in the hall and led me to my closet
my son said he it is time to throw off the effeminacy
 sorrow and to prove yourself a true soldier 
the standard france
i trust my lord replied i with modest earnestness
 that you well know there is nothing after which my heart
so ardently aspires there is nothing that i know worth
living for but honour show me the path that leads to it
or rather show me the occasion that affords scope for the
love honour to display itself and you shall then see
whether i am backward to embrace it i have a passion
pent up within me that feeds upon my vitals it disdains
speech it burns for something more unambiguous and substantial

travels st leon 
it is well rejoined my uncle i expected to find
you thus your reply to my admonition is worthy the
blood your ancestors and the maternal instructions
 my sister and were you as dull as the very stones
you tread on what i have to tell you might even then rouse
you into animation and ardour
after this short my uncle proceeded to relate a
tale every word which inflamed my spirits and raised
all my passions in arms i had heard something imperfectly
 the state my country but my mother carefully
kept me in ignorance that my ambition might not be excited
too soon and that when excited it might be with the
fullest effect while i impatiently longed for an occasion
 glory i was far from apprehending what i now found
to be true that the occasion which at this period presented
itself was such that all the licence fiction could scarcely
have improved it
the marquis de villeroy described to me the league now
subsisting against france he revived in my memory by
terms the most fervent loyalty the accomplishments and
talents my royal master he spoke with aversion the
phlegmatic and crafty disposition his imperial rival 
and with the language glowing indignation inveighed
against the fickleness the capricious henry t he described
the train disasters which had at length induced
the king to take the field in person he contrasted with
great effect the story the gallant chevalier bayard the
knight without fear and without reproach whose blood was
still fresh in the plains the milanese with that the
constable bourbon the stain chivalry whom inglorious
resentment and ungoverned ambition had urged to join the
enemies his country in neglect his loyalty and his
oath he stimulated me by the example the one and
the infamy the other and assured me that there never
was an opportunity more favourable for acquiring immortal
renown
i wanted no prompter in a passion this sort and immediately
set about collecting the whole force my clients
and retainers i shook off the inglorious softness my
charles v f henry viii
 travels st leon
melancholy and was all activity and animation the lessons
 my youth were now called into play i judged it
necessary to invite the assistance some person experience
to assist me in marshalling my men but i did much
 what was to be done myself and i did it well it was
my first employment in the morning and the last that was
witnessed by the setting sun my excellent mother had
left my revenues in the best order and i spared no expense
in the gratification my favourite passion
however eager i felt myself to take the field the desire
to appear in a manner worthy a count de st leon restrained
me and i did not join the royal army till the
imperialists having broken up the siege marseilles and
retreated with precipitation into italy the king had already
crossed the alps entered the milanese and gained un contested
possession the capital
from milan francis proceeded to pavia glory was the
idol his heart and he was the more powerfully excited
to the attack that place because it was the strongest and
best fortified post in the whole duchy the more he displayed
 military prowess the more firmly he believed he
should fix himself in his newly acquired dominions the
inhabitants would submit to him the more willingly and
the enemy be less encouraged to enter into a fresh contention
for what he had acquired such at least were the
motives that he assigned for his proceedings in reality
perhaps he was principally induced by the brilliancy which
he conceived would attend on the undertaking
it was a few weeks after the opening the siege that
i presented myself to my royal master he received me
with those winning and impressive manners by which he
was so eminently distinguished he recollected immediately
all that had passed at our interview in the vale 
ardres and warmly expressed the obligations which france
had at various times owed to my ancestors he spoke with
earnest respect the virtues and wisdom my mother
and commended the resolution by which she had in former
instances held me back from the public theatre young
gentleman said the king i doubt not the gallantry 
your spirit i see the impatience a martial temper writ 
travels op st leon 
ten in your face i expect you to act in a manner worthy
 your illustrious race and the instructions a woman
who deserved to be herself a pattern to all the matrons 
france fear not that i shall suffer your accomplishments
to rust in obscurity i shall employ you i shall assign
you the post danger and renown fill it nobly and
from that hour i shall rank you in the catalogue my
chosen friends
the siege pavia proved indeed to be a transaction in
the course which military honour might well be acquired
it was defended by a small but veteran garrison and by
one the ablest captains that europe at that time possessed
he interrupted the approaches the besiegers
by frequent and furious sallies in vain by the aid our
excellent artillery did we make wide and repeated breaches
in the fortifications no sooner did we attempt to enter by
the passage we had opened than we found ourselves encountered
by a body composed the choicest and bravest
soldiers the garrison the governor the city who
though greyheaded and advanced in years was profuse 
every youthful exertion was ordinarily at the head this
body if we deferred our attack or not having succeeded
in it proposed to commence it anew with the dawn the
following day we were sure to find a new wall sprung up
in the room the other as if by enchantment frequently
the governor anticipated the success our batteries 
and the old fortification was no sooner demolished than we
beheld to our astonishment and mortification a new wall
which his prudence and skill had erected at a small interval
within the line the former
one these attacks took place on the second day after
my arrival at the camp our sovereign every thing that
i saw was new to me and inflamed me with ardour the
noise the cannon which had preceded the attack and
which was now hushed the inspiring sounds martial
music which succeeded that noise the standards floating
in the air the firm and equal tread the battalion that
advanced the armour the knights the rugged resolute
and intrepid countenances the infantry all swelled my
antonio de leyva
travels op st leon
soul with transport hitherto unexperienced i had beheld
the smoke the artillery in the midst which everything
was lost and confounded i had waited in awful
suspense till the obscurity should be dissipated i saw with
pleasure and surprise the ruin the wall and the wideness
 the breach all that had been recorded the military
feats christian valour seemed then to stand crowded in
my busy brain the generosity the condescension the kindness
with which the king had addressed me the day before
urged me to treble exertion i was in the foremost rank
we surmounted the ditch we were resisted by a chosen
body spaniards the contention was obstinate brave
men generous and enterprising spirits fell on the one side
and the other i seized the cloth a standard as in the
playing the wind it was brought near to my hand between
me and the spaniard that held it there ensued an obstinate
struggle i watched my opportunity and with my
sword severed the flag from its staff at this moment the
trumpets the king sounded a retreat i had received
two severe wounds one in the shoulder and the other in
the thigh in the contest i felt myself faint with the loss
 blood a french officer a rude appearance and gigantic
stature accosting me with the appellation boy
commanded me to surrender the standard to him i refused
and to convince him i was in earnest proceeded
to wrap it round my body and fastened it under my arm
soon after i became insensible and in this situation was
accidentally found by my uncle and his companions who
immediately took me and my prize under their care as
soon as i was a little recovered my wounds the king
seized an opportunity after having bestowed loud commendations
upon my gallantry conferring the honours
 knighthood upon me in the face the whole army
while our tents were pitched under the walls pavia
i was continually extending the circle my acquaintance
among the young gentry france who like myself had
attended their sovereign in this memorable expedition i
had some enemies made such by the distinctions i obtained
during the siege but they were few the greater
part courted me the more the more i showed myself worthy
a v q i
travels st leon
 their attachment envy is not a passion that finds easy
root in a frenchman's bosom i was one the youngest
 those who attended on the siege but my brothers in
arms were generous rivals who in the field obstinately
strove with me for superior glory but over the convivial
board forgot their mutual competitions and opened their
hearts to benevolence and friendship let us not was
a sentiment i heard often repeated forget the object that
led us from our pleasant homes to pour from the heights
 the alps upon the fields italy it is to humble the
imperious spaniard to punish the disloyal bourbon to
vindicate the honour our beloved and illustrious monarch
those walls cover the enemy yonder mountains serve to
hide them from our assault let no frenchman mistake
him who marches under the same standard for an adversary

the trenches had not been opened before pavia till about
the beginning november the winter overtook us and
the siege was yet in progress with some apparent advantage
indeed to our side the question but by no means
promising an instant conclusion the season set in with
unusual severity and both officer and soldier were glad
as much as possible to fence out its rigour by the indulgences
 the genial board my finances as i have said
were at the commencement the expedition in excellent
order i had brought with me a considerable sum and it
was not spared upon the present occasion
there were however other things to be attended to beside
the demands conviviality the king became impatient
 the delays the siege the garrison and the
inhabitants were reduced to great extremities but the governor
discovered no symptoms a purpose to surrender
in the mean time intelligence was brought that bourbon
was making the most extraordinary exertions in germany
and promised to lead to the enemy a reinforcement 
twelve thousand men from that country while the imperial
generals by mortgaging their revenues and pawning their
jewels and still more by their eloquence and influence with
those under their command were able to keep together the
remains a disheartened and defeated army in expectation

 his arrival there was some danger therefore i

ultimately be obliged to raise it with ignominy or to fight
the enemy under every disadvantage francis however
was not to be deterred from his undertaking he swore a
solemn oath that pavia should be his or he would perish
in the attempt
thus circumstanced he conceived a very extraordinary
project pavia is defended on one side by the tesino the
scene the first the four famous battles by which hannibal
signalised his invasion italy the king believed
that if this river could by the labour his army be diverted
from its course the town must instantly fall into his hands
he was encouraged to the undertaking by recollecting a
stratagem a similar nature by which cyrus formerly
made himself master the city babylon it was a
thought highly flattering to the grandeur his soul to
imagine that posterity would in this instance institute a
parallel between him and cyrus the great
the plan for diverting the course the tesino produced
a new and extraordinary scene it was as may well
be believed a work uncommon labour a new channel
was to be scooped out and deepened and while the stream
was turned into this channel piles were to be sunk and an
immense mound earth created as an effectual impediment
to the waters resuming their former course this
was a heavy burthen to the soldier in addition to the disadvantage
 being encamped during the course a winter
remarkably severe for the climate in which we fought by
any other army the task would have been performed with
cloudiness and discontent if not complained with repining
and murmurs but here the gaiety the french
character displayed itself the nobility france who
attended their sovereign in great numbers accompanied the
infantry in their labour we laid aside the indulgence 
the marquee tapestry and carpets we threw off our
upper garments and each seized a spade a barrow earth
or a mattock we put our hands to the engines and refused
no effort under pretence that it was sordid or severe
while the trees were leafless and nature appeared bound

up in frost sweat ran down our faces and bedewed our
limbs the army were encouraged by our example an
employment which under other circumstances would have
been regarded as rigid was thus made a source new
hilarity and amusement it was a memorable sight to behold
the venerable and greyheaded leaders the french
army endeavouring to exert the strength and activity 
their early years to me who had but lately arrived at
the stature manhood and who was accustomed to all the
exercises which give strength and vigour to the frame this
new employment was in no degree burdensome i felt in
it the satisfaction that a swift man experiences when he
enters the lists the race i congratulated myself upon
the nature my education if it be a sin to covet honour
that guilt was mine and so great was my appetite for it
that i was inexpressibly rejoiced to observe the various
ways in which it might be gratified
strange as it may seem this scene a wintercamp in the
midst blood and sweat surrounded with dangers and called
on for unparalleled exertions appears to me through the vista
 years that is now interposed between to have been one 
the happiest my life the gay labours and surprises 
the day were succeeded by a convivial evening in which
we did not the less open our hearts though frequently
liable to be interrupted in our midnight revels by the inexhaustible
activity and stratagems the enemy in this
various and evershifting scene i forgot the disasters that
occurred and the blood that flowed around me all sense
 a large and impartial morality was for the time at least
deadened in my breast i was ever upon the alert the
diversity events neither suffered my spirits to flag nor
reflection to awake it is only upon such occasions or
occasions like these that a man is able fully to feel what life
is and to revel in its exuberance above all i was delighted
with the society and friendship my brotherofficers
they honoured me they loved me i seemed to feel what
sympathy was and to have conscious pleasure in making
one in a race beings like myself such were my sensations

 travels st leon
it must not however be imagined that all about me
felt in these respects as i did i was deeply indebted in
this particular to my youth and my fortune the old endeavoured
to brace themselves in vain they sunk under
the continual pressure the poor soldier from the ranks
laboured incessantly and i laboured as much as he but
he had little opportunity to recruit his vigour and renovate
his strength there was yet another class persons in the
camp whose gaiety was much less interrupted than mine
these were the king and the generals who commanded
under him they could not be entirely devoid thought
and consideration they suffered much anxiety from the
length the siege and felt that every period delay
increased the doubtfulness the event
antonio de leyva governor the city necessarily felt
himself alarmed at the extraordinary project in which we
were engaged and made every exertion to prevent it one
evening the king sent for me to his tent and told me in
confidence that the enemy intended that very night to make
three several attacks upon our mound one on each side 
the stream and one by means boats in the centre two
 these he said were merely intended as feints the west
bank the tesino was the point against which their principal
exertions would be directed on that side he was
resolved to command in person the boats with which he
proposed to resist their flota he confided to one the most
famous and valuable officers his army the detachment
on the east bank he purposed to intrust to my uncle and
myself he observed that the detachment he could spare
for that purpose after having formed the other two bodies
and reserved a sufficient number for the defence the
camp and the works would be small and he warned me
to the exertion a particular vigilance it would be
doubly unfortunate if a body the attack upon which was
to be merely a feigned one should nevertheless be routed

answerably to the merit your first achievement and
depend upon it that you will prove hereafter one the

travels st leon
the marquis de villeroy divided our little force into
two bodies with the larger he lay in wait for the enemy
near the scene the expected attack the smaller he confided
to my direction and placed so that we might be able
to fall upon the rear the garrisontroops as soon as they
should be fully engaged with our comrades in the situation
assigned me i took advantage the skirts a
wood which enabled me to approach very near to the expected
route our assailants without being perceived by
them the night was extremely dark yet the vicinity 
my position was such that i could count the numbers 
the adversary as they passed along before my hidingplace
i was alarmed to find that they amounted to at least the
triple what we had been taught to expect they were
no sooner past than i despatched to the king a young
knight my particular friend who happened to be with me
to urge the necessity a reinforcement at the same time
i sent a messenger to my uncle by a circuitous route to
inform him what i had observed and the step i had
taken and to entreat him to defer the attack as long as consistently
with propriety it should be possible the enemy
however had no sooner arrived at the place his destination
than the troops the marquis no longer capable 
restraint rushed to engage the spaniards were at first surprised
but a short time led them to suspect the weakness
 their assailants nor was the assistance i brought to my
uncle sufficient to turn the fortune the fight we lost
many our men the rest apparently gave ground and
it was a vain attempt amidst the darkness the night to
endeavour to restore order and rally them to the assault
we were already almost completely overpowered when
the succours we expected reached us they were however
unable to distinguish friend from enemy a storm 
mingled rain and snow had come on which benumbed our
limbs drove fiercely in our faces and rendered every object
alike viewless the carnage which in this situation took
place was terrible our blows were struck at random a
frenchman was not less dreadful than a spaniard when
the battle ceased scarcely one the enemy was left alive 
but we observed with astonishment and horror the number
c 
 travels op st leon
 the besiegers who had probably in the midst the confusion
been cut to pieces by their own countrymen
i anl now arrived at the period which put an to the
festivity and jocundness the campaign all after this
was one continued series disaster about the close 
january our work though not wholly interrupted was considerably
retarded by a succession heavy rains this
was injurious to us in many ways our project which was
executed in the midst waters rendered additional damp
a matter serious consideration we were also seized
with an apprehension still greater magnitude which was
speedily realised the snows being at length completely
dissolved and the quantity water continually increasing
we perceived one afternoon strong symptoms that our
mound the principal subject our labour and source 
our hope was giving way in various places the next
morning at daybreak it rushed down every where at once
with wonderful violence and noise it is difficult to describe
the sensation anguish which was instantly and
universally diffused the labour many weeks was overthrown
in a moment as we had proceeded in our work
we every day saw ourselves nearer the object to which we
aspired at this time our project was almost completed and
pavia was in imagination already in our hands to gain
possession which had cost us such unremitted exertions
the display so much gallantry and the loss so many
soldiers we were confounded at the catastrophe we saw
we gazed at each other each in want encouragement
and every one unable to afford it
still however we were not destitute advantages the
garrison began to be in want both ammunition and provisions
they were in a general state discontent almost
 mutiny which scarcely all the address and authority 
the governor were able to suppress if the town continued
longer unrelieved it was sure to fall into our hands but
even this our last hope was considerably diminished by the
intelligence we received the very day after the destruction
 our mound that the imperial army after having received
large reinforcements was approaching in considerable force
the king had some time before in the height his contravels
 st leon 
licence and elation his heart sent off a detachment 
six thousand men to invade the kingdom naples for
upon that as well as the milanese he had inherited pretensions
from his immediate predecessors
but though the enemy was superior in numbers and a
part perhaps their forces better disciplined than ours
they laboured under several disadvantages to which we were
not exposed the emperor though his dominions were
more extensive did not derive from them a revenue equal
to that francis as he did not take the field in person
the war appeared to his subjects only a common war proceeding
upon the ordinary motives war but my countrymen
were led by their sovereign were fresh from the
recent insolence an invasion their own territory and
fought at once for personal glory and their country's honour
the king who commanded them seemed expressly formed
to obtain their attachment and affection his nobles became
enthusiastic by the example his enthusiasm and willingly
disbursed their revenues to give prosperity and eclat to the
campaign
the first question that arose upon the approach the
enemy was whether we should break up the siege and
attend in some strong post the slow but sure effect their
want money and the consequent dispersion their
troops or wait their attack in our present posture the
former advice was safe but to the gallant spirit francis
it appeared ignominious he was upon all occasions the
partisan rapid measures and decisive proceedings and
his temper with the exception a few wary and deliberate
counsellors accorded with that our whole army for
some days we congratulated ourselves upon the wisdom 
our choice we presented to the enemy so formidable an
appearance that notwithstanding the cogent motives he
had to proceed he hesitated long before he ventured to
attack us at length however the day came that was
pregnant with so momentous expectation
if through the whole limits our camp there was nota
man that did not feel himself roused upon this glorious
occasion to me it was especially interesting the scene
accorded with the whole purpose my education and
c 
 travels op st leon
novelty made it impressive i lived only in the present
moment i had not a thought a wish a straggling imagination
that wandered beyond the circuit the day my
soul was filled at one minute wild with expectation and
at another awed into solemnity there is something indescribably
delicious in this concentration the mind it
raises a man above himself and makes him feel a certain
nobleness and elevation character the possession 
which he was to that hour unconscious fear and pain
were ideas that could find no harbour in my bosom i regarded
this as the most memorable days and myself as
the most fortunate mortals far indeed was i from anticipating
the disgraceful event in which this elation 
heart speedily terminated
the sun rose bright in a cloudless sky the cold the
season was such as only to give new lightness and elasticity
to the muscles and animal spirits i saw few those
objects nature which in this delightful climate gave so
sacred a pleasure to the human soul but in my present
temper there was no object sight so ravishing as the firm
and equal steps the martial bands the impatience the
warhorse and the display military standards nor any
music so enchanting as the shrillness the pipe the
clangor the trumpet the neighing steeds and the
roaring cannon it is thus that man disguises to himself
the real nature his occupation and clothes that which
is all things the most nefarious or most to be lamented
with the semblance jubilee and festival
the imperialists were at first unable to withstand the
efforts french valour they gave way on every side 
we pursued our advantage with impetuosity to the
slaughter whole ranks mowed down with tremendous
celerity to the agonies the dying i was blind their
groans had no effect on my organ for my soul was occupied
in another direction my horse's heels spurned their
mangled limbs and were red with their blood i fought
not merely with valour but with fury i animated those
around me by my example and my acclamations it may
seem contrary to delicacy to speak with this freedom my
own praises but i am at my present writing totally changed
travels st leon 
and removed from what i was and i write with the freedom
 a general historian it is this simplicity and ingenuousness
that shall pervade the whole my narrative
the fortune the day speedily changed the cowardice
and desertion our swiss allies gave the first signal
 adversity the gallant commander the garrison 
pavia sallied out in the midst the fight and suddenly
attacked us in the rear a stratagem the imperial general
effected the rout our cavalry the whole face the
field was utterly reversed
it would be in vain for me to attempt to describe even
the small part that i beheld the calamity and slaughter
 the french army at this distance time the recollection
 it opens afresh the almost obliterated wounds 
my heart i saw my friends cut down and perish on
every side those who together with myself had marched
out in the morning swelled with exultation and hope now
lay weltering in their blood their desires their thoughts
their existence were brought to a fatal termination the
common soldiers were hewed and cut to pieces by hundreds
without note and observation many the first nobility
 france made desperate by the change the battle
rushed into the thickest the foe and became so many
voluntary sacrifices choosing rather to perish than to turn
their backs with dishonour
in the battle i had two horses killed under me the
first them suffered a sort gradual destruction he had
already received one wound in the nostrils and another in
the neck when a third shot carried away two his feet
and laid him prostrate on the earth bernardin my
faithful attendant observed what was passing and immediately
brought me a fresh charger but i had not long
mounted him when he received a wound which killed him
on the spot i was myself hurt in several places and at
length the stroke a sabre brought me to the ground
here i remained for a long time insensible when i recovered
and looked around me i found myself in entire
solitude and could at present perceive no trace either the
enemy or my own people soon however i recollected
what had passed and was but too well assured the
c 
 travels op st leon
defeat my countrymen had sustained weak and battered
as i was i attempted to retire to a place greater security
i had scarcely changed my ground before i saw a
trooper the enemy rushing towards me with the intention
to take away my life fortunately i observed a tree
at hand to the shelter which i hastened and partly by
moving the branches to and fro and partly by shifting my
position i baffled my adversary till he became weary 
the attempt a moment after i saw one my most intimate
and familiar companions killed before my eyes it
was not long however before a party fugitive french
came up to the spot where i stood and i like the rest was
hurried from the field my uncle perished in the battle
it is wonderful how men can harden their hearts against
such scenes as i then witnessed it is wonderful how
they can be brought to cooperate in such demoniac fury
and more than demoniac mischief barbarity and murder
but they are brought to it and enter not from a deplorable
necessity but as to a festival in which each man is eager
to occupy his place and share the amusements it seemed
to me at that time as it seems to me now that it should
be enough for a man to contemplate such a field as i saw
at pavia to induce him to abjure the trade violence forever
and to commit his sword once more to the bowels
 the earth from which it was torn for so nefarious a
purpose
these sensations though now finally established in my
mind were at the time which i am writing but fleeting
duration the force education and the first bent
 my mind were too strong the horror which overwhelmed
me in the first moments this great national
defeat subsided and the military passion returned upon mein
its original ardour my convictions and the moral integrity
 my soul were temporary and i became myself
a monument that inconstancy and that wonder to which
i have just alluded
various circumstances however prevented this passion
from its direct operation the character france was
altered by the battle pavia though mine remained the
same it was in the fullest degree decisive the fortune
travels st leon 
 the war milan and every other place in the duchy
opened their gates to the conqueror j and in a fortnight
not a frenchman was left in the fields italy the
whole army only a small body effected an orderly retreat
under the command the duke glencoe many persons
 the highest distinction perished in the battle many
were made prisoners hy the enemy france by this event
found the list her noblesse considerably reduced in numbers
 add to which those whose loss she sustained were
almost all them taken from among the most distinguished
and meritorious in the catalogue
but what constituted the principal feature in this memorable
event was that the king himself was found in the
number the prisoners nor was he released by his ungenerous
competitor till after more than a twelvemonth's
confinement during this period francis tasted the
dregs adversity inclined in the first instance to judge
 his rival by himself he expected a liberal treatment in
this he was deeply disappointed after a detention 
many months in the milanese the scene his former successes
he was transferred to madrid he was personally
neglected by the emperor while his disloyal subject was
treated with singular distinction the most rigorous terms
were proposed to him all this had the effect in one instance
 sinking him into a disease languor and dejection
which he was not expected to survive and in another
 inducing him to execute an instrument by which he abdicated
the crown and declared his resolution remaining
a prisoner for life his confinement was at length terminated
by his solemnly engaging to compulsory articles which
he was determined to break as soon as he found himself at
liberty an alternative peculiarly grating to the liberality
 his spirit this reverse fortune materially changed his
character the fine spirit his ambition was from this
time evaporated and while he still retained the indefeasible
qualities his soul and was gallant kindhearted and
generous he bartered as far as was compatible with his
disposition the enterprising and audacious temper he had
previously manifested for the wary and phlegmatic system
the constable bourbon

 his more fortunate competitor his genius cowered before
that charles and the defeat pavia may perhaps
be considered as having given a deadly wound to the reign
 chivalry and a secure foundation to that craft dissimulation

chapter iii
the lists military ambition then being closed if not
permanently at least for a time my mind took a new bias 
and without dismissing its most cherished and darling passion
pursued a path in the present emergency to which
the accidents my youth had also guided me if my
mother had survived she would probably either not have consented
to my serving at the siege pavia or at least would
have recalled me to the obscurity my paternal chateau
as soon as the campaign was at an i had not fully
completed the twentieth year my age at the period the
memorable battle in which my sovereign was made prisoner
i was left without adviser or guide even the marquis de
villeroy my mother's brother whatever consequence his
admonitions to me might have proved was taken from mein
this fatal engagement the king himself perhaps had
it not been for the dreadful calamities in which he was now
involved might have condescended to interest himself in
some degree in my welfare by the course events i
was left yet a minor and with an ample revenue at my
disposition to be wholly guided by the suggestions my
own mind
in the portion his reign already elapsed the splendid
and interesting qualities francis had given a new spring
to the sentiments the nation he was the most accomplished
and amiable prince the time in which he lived
there was but one all the sovereigns christendom that
could cope with him in power the emperor charles and
as charles's peculiarities were a sort that frenchmen
were accustomed to regard with aversion and contempt so
travels st leon 
there had not been a doubt among my compatriots the
side upon which the superiority would ultimately rest by
the events the day pavia they were confounded and
overwhelmed they did not despair their country they
soon felt and felt to its utmost extent the rank which
france held among the european states but the chain 
their ideas was interrupted they could not but be conscious
that the fortune the kingdom had received a grievous
check the illustrious career which they had in fancy
already traversed was postponed to a distant period
the consequences which flow from a suppressed ambition
may easily be imagined the nobility france exchanged
the activity the field for the indulgences the table 
that concentrated spirit which had sought to expand itself
upon the widest stage now found vent in the exhibition 
individual expense and above all the sordid and inglorious
passion for gaming a vice eminently characteristic the
age now especially gained strength and drew multitudes
into its destructive vortex it was perhaps impossible fora
young man to have entered the theatre the world under
less favourable auspices
in what i have already written i felt myself prompted
to enlarge with complacency upon the sentiments and scenes
 my youth and i have yielded to the suggestion the
same internal admonition makes me shrink from entering
with minuteness into the detail my ruin i recollect my
infatuation with abhorrence i fly from the memory with
sensations inexpressibly painful i regard it as a cloud that
overshadowed and blackened for ever the fair prospects 
my earlier years
i shall not enumerate all my youthful companions or all
my youthful follies i committed a mistake obvious enough
at this immature period my existence when i mistook
profusion and extravagance for splendour and dignity and
the prudent economy which my mother had practised served
in the present instance as the pander to my vices the
whole tendency my education had been to inspire me
with a proud and restless desire distinction and i was
not content to play a second part in the career my vices
as i should not have been content to play a second part in
 travels st leon
the genuine theatre honour and fame in all that was
thoughtlessly spirited and gaily profligate i led the way to
my compeers and was constantly held up by them as an
example by this conduct i incurred the censure the
rigorous and the old but the voice censure reached me
much seldom than that adulation my person and
demeanour were the topics general applause i was tall
and wellproportioned my frame was slender and agile
but with an appearance the fullest health my countenance
was open commanding and animated my rank and
situation in the world gave me confidence the fire and
impetuosity my temper rendered my gestures easy rapid
expressive and graceful the consequence all this was
to confirm me in a plan life which i early laid down to
myself and from which i never in any instance deviated
i put aside those rules as splenetic and hypercritical which
confessors preach and with which the preceptors young
men are accustomed to weary and alienate the minds 
their pupils the charge being disorderly and unthinking
i despised that imprudence even when meant for
blame sounded in my ear like the voice encomium but
accustomed from education to sentiments honour and
from habit to the language eulogy it is difficult for any
man to be more firmly bent than i was to incur no breath
 dishonour or to draw the line more peremptorily between
the follies youth and the aberrations a gross
and unprincipled spirit
it may be alleged indeed and with considerable justice
that the habit gaming is an exception to this statement
it was with hesitation and reluctance that i entered into
this habit i saw it as it was and as every ingenuous and
debauched mind must see it base and sordid the possession
 some degree wealth i regarded indeed as indispensable
to a man who would fill a lofty and respectable
character in the world a character that by uniting the
advantages exterior appearance with the actions a hero
should extort the homage his species but in the picture
i drew this man in my mind i considered wealth
as an accident the attendant on his birth to be dispensed
with dignity not to be adverted to with minuteness attravels
 st leon 
mention deep play is certainly sufficiently inconsistent with
this character the direct purpose the gamester is to
transfer money from the pocket his neighbour into his
own he rouses his sleepy and wearied attention by the
most sordid all motives the fear losing pierces his
heart with anguish and to gain to obtain an advantage
for himself which can scarcely exceed and which seldom
equals the injury his competitor suffers is the circumstance
which most transports his heart with delight for this he
watches for this he calculates an honourable gamester
does not seize with premeditation the moment when his
adversary is deprived by wine or any other cause his
usual selfpossession he does not seek with sober malice
to play upon his passions he does not enter with avidity
into the contest with an unpractised but presuming rival 
but he cannot avoid rejoicing when he finds that accident
has given him an unusual advantage i have often thought
that i could better understand how a man honour could
reconcile himself to the accursed and murderous trade 
war than to the system the gaming table in war he
fights with a stranger a man with whom he has no habits
 kindness and who is fairly apprised that he comes against
him with ruinous intent but in play he robs perhaps
his brother his friend the partner his bosom j or in
every event a man seduced into the snare with all the
arts courtesy and whom he smiles upon even while he
i am talking here the mere reason and common sense 
the question as it relates to mankind in general but it is
with other feelings that i reflect upon the concern i have
myself individually in the subject years roll on in vain 
ages themselves are useless here looking forward as i do
to an existence that shall endure till time shall be no more 
no time can wipe away the remembrance the bitter
anguish that i have endured the consequence gaming
it is torture it is madness poverty i have drained thy
cup to the dregs i have seen my wife and my children
looking to me in vain for bread which is the most intolerable
distress that the period in which all the comforts
 life gradually left me in which i caught at every
 travels st leon
fragment promise and every fragment failed in which
i rose every morning to pamper myself with empty delusions
 in which i ate the apples purgatory fair without
but within bitterness and ashes in which i tossed through
endless sightless nights upon the couch disappointment
and despair or the period when at length all my hopes
were at an when i fled with horror to a foreign
climate when my family that should have been my comfort
gave me my most poignant agony when i looked
upon them naked destitute and exiles with the tremendous
thought what and who it was that had caused their
ruin adversity without consolation adversity when its
sting is remorse selfabhorrence and selfcontempt hell
has no misery by which it can be thrown into shade or
exceeded 
why do i dwell upon or at least why do i anticipate
this detested circumstance my story let me add one
remark in this place and pass on to the other particulars
 this epoch my prodigality it is true i must take
this shameful appellation to myself i was a gamester
but in the beginning i took no concern in that species 
science which is often implied in the appellation my
games were games hazard not skill it appeared to
my distempered apprehension to be only a mode in which
for a man to display his fortitude and philosophy i was
flattered with the practice gaming because saw in it
when gracefully pursued the magnanimity the stoic
combined with the manners a man the world a magnanimity
that no success is able to intoxicate and no vicissitude
to subvert i committed my property to the hazard
 the die and i placed my ambition in laughing alike at
the favours fortune and her frowns in the sequel
however i found myself deceived the fickle goddess
sufficiently proved that she had the power making me
serious but in her most tremendous reverses i was never
influenced to do any thing that the most scrupulous gamester
regards as dishonourable i say not this for the purpose
 giving colour and speciousness to my tale i say
it because i have laid it down to myself in this narrative
as a sacred principle to relate the simple unaltered truth
travels st leon 
another characteristic the reign francis the first
is its gallantries it is well known how much the king was
himself occupied with attachments this sort his government
was rather the government women than politicians
 and the manners the sovereign strongly tended to
fix the habits his subjects a very young man rather
takes the tone his passions from those about him than
forms one that is properly his own and this was my casein
the present instance as well as in the preceding originally
 an amorous constitution i should perhaps have
quieted the restlessness my appetites without ostentation
and eclat had not the conduct my youthful associates in
general led me to regard gallantry as an accomplishment
indispensably necessary in a young man rank it must
be confessed indeed that this offence against the rigour 
discipline has a thousand advantages over that gaming
few women regular and reputable lives have that ease 
manners that flow fancy and that graceful intrepidity
 thinking and expressing themselves that is sometimes to
be found among those who have discharged themselves from
the tyranny custom there is something irresistibly
captivating in that voluptuousness which while it assumes
a certain air freedom uniformly and with preference
conforms itself to the dictates unsophisticated delicacy
a judicious and limited voluptuousness is necessary to the
cultivation the mind to the polishing the manners to
the refining sentiment and the development the understanding
 and a woman deficient in this respect may be
 use for the government our families but can neither
add to the enjoyments nor fix the partiality a man 
animation and taste
but whatever there may be in these considerations certain
it is that the conduct i pursued in matters gallantry
led me into great and serious expenses the mistresses
with whom i chanced to associate had neither the inexpressible
captivation madame de chateaubriand nor the
aspiring and impressive manners the duchess d'etampes
they had however beauty and vivacity frolic without
rudeness and softness without timidity they had paid
mistresses francis l
s travels st leon
some regard to points knowledge and taste considering
these as additional means for fixing the partiality their
paramour and knowing that they had no security for the
permanence their prosperity but in the variety their
attractions in their society i was led into new trains
 reflection a nicer consideration human passion and
the varieties human character and above all into a
greater quickness and delicacy in matters intellectual taste
my hours for the most part rolled swiftly and easily away
sometimes in the society the young the gay and the ambitious
 my own sex and sometimes in the softer and
more delicious intercourse the fair i lived in the midst
 all that paris could at that time furnish splendid and
luxurious this system living was calculated to lull
me in pleasing dreams and to waste away existence in delirious
softness it sufficiently accorded with the sad
period our sovereign's captivity when my young compatriots
sought to drown the sense public and patriotic
considerations in copious draughts pleasure nor did the
monarch's return immediately restore to france her former
haughtiness and pride
the course sensuality in which i was now engaged
though it did not absolutely sink into grossness may
well be supposed to have trodden upon the very edge 
licence i and my companions were young we were made
fearless and presuming by fortune and by rank we had
laid aside those more rigorous restraints which render the
soberer part mankind plausible and decent by making
them timid and trite i will not contaminate the minds 
my innocent and inexperienced readers by entering into the
detail the follies in which i engaged
one thing it is necessary to remark as essential to the
main thread my story my expenses all kinds during
this period selfdesertion drained my resources but did
not tarnish my good name my excesses were regarded by
some as ornamental and becoming but by all were admitted
as venial the laurels i had won in the field military
honour were not obscured by my subsequent conduct i
was universally ranked among the most promising and
honourable the young noblemen france i had some
travels st leon
rivals i did not pass through this turbulent and diversified
scene without disputes hut no one cast a reflection
upon my name no one ventured to speak me with superciliousness
and opprobrium nor was my temper more injured
than my reputation from every dispute i extricated
myself with grace and propriety i studied the pleasure and
ease all with whom i associated and no man enjoyed
more extensively than i did the sweets friendship as far
as the sweets friendship can be extensively enjoyed
chapter iv
i had been now two years in habits life and a mode 
expense extremely injurious to my patrimony when a circumstance
occurred which promised completely to deliver
me from the ruinous consequences my own folly this
was no other than my encounter with that incomparable
woman who afterwards became the partner my life and
the mother my children i cannot even now recollect
her without tears the sentiment which her very name excites
in my mind is a mingled feeling on the one hand 
the most exquisite and unspeakable delight a feeling that
elevates and expands and electrifies my throbbing heart 
and on the other the bitterest anguish and regret i
must developed the source this feeling
marguerite louise isabel de damville was at the period
 our first meeting in the nineteenth year her age
her complexion was the most perfect transparency her
eyes black and sparkling and her eyebrows dark and long
such were the perfect smoothness and clearness her skin
that at nineteen she appeared five years younger than she was
and she long retained this extreme juvenility form her step
was airy and light as that a young fawn yet at the same
time firm and indicative strength body and vigour 
mind her voice like the whole her external appearance
was expressive undesigning i had almost said
childish simplicity yet with all this playfulness 
travels st leon
appearance her understanding was bold and correct her
mind was well furnished with every thing that could add
to her accomplishments as a wife or a mother her indulgent
parents had procured her every advantage education
and circumstances had been uncommonly favourable
to her improvement she was encouraged and assisted in
the art drawing for which she discovered a very early
talent by leonardo da vinci j and she formed her poetical
taste from the conversation and instructions clement
mart but amidst the singular assemblage her intellectual
accomplishments there was nothing by which she
was so much distinguished as the uncommon prudence 
her judgments and the unalterable amiableness her
manners this was the woman destined to crown my happiness
and consummate my misery if i had never
known her i should never have tasted true pleasure if i
had been guided by her counsels i should not have drained
to the very dregs the cup anguish
the house her father the marquis de damville was
the resort all the most eminent wits and scholars that
period particularly mart rabelais erasmus and scaliger
this was my first inducement to frequent it my
education had inspired me with an inextinguishable love 
literature and the dissipation in which i was at this time
involved could not entirely interrupt the propensity the
most thoughtless and extravagant period my life had occasional
intervals study and reflection and the gay
animated and ingenious conversation the men i have
mentioned had always peculiar charms for me
i had continued for some time to visit at the marquis's
hotel before i encountered the beautiful marguerite the
first time i saw her she made a deep impression upon me
the marquis who was one the most benevolent and
enlightened mankind had been led by my character and
manners to conceive a warm friendship for me he saw
the ruin in which i was heedlessly involving myself and
believed that it was not yet too late to save me as he
thought that there was no method so likely to effect my
reformation as the interposition domestic affections he
was not unwilling to encourage the attachment i began to
travels op st leon 
feel for his daughter on my part i wanted but little
encouragement i no sooner observed her manners and
became acquainted with her merits than my heart was unalterably
fixed i became as it were a new man i was
like one who after his eyes had grown imperceptibly dim
till at length every object appeared indistinct and a
gloomy general hue has his sight instantaneously restored
and beholds the fabric the universe in its genuine clearness
brilliancy and truth i was astonished at my own
folly that i could so long have found gratification in pleasures
mean and sensual i was ashamed my own degradation
i could not endure the comparison between the
showy unsubstantial attractions the women i had hitherto
frequented and the charms the adorable marguerite the
purity her mind seemed to give a celestial brilliancy and
softness to the beauties her person the gross and brutal
pursuits the debauchee are often indeed described by the
same epithets as the virtuous and refined passion with which
i was now for the first time inspired but experience convinced
me that they differed in their most essential features
the marquis saw the state my mind and addressed
me thus lc count said he i feel the most ardent
friendship for you i am inexpressibly concerned for your
welfare you will be convinced this when i have furnished
you with a clue to my late conduct towards you i
regard you if not as a ruined man at least as a man in the
high road to ruin your present habits are the most
dangerous sort they appear to you perfectly conformable
to principles the strictest honour nay they come recommended
to you by a certain eclat and dignity with
which they seem to be surrounded i could say to you
recollect yourself be not misled by delusive appearances
consider the present state your fortune and the state in
which your mother left it you cannot be ignorant how
greatly it is impaired how has this circumstance arisen
have your revenues been expended in the service your
country have you purchased any thing by them that will
confer on you lasting renown put together the sum 
actions which piece by piece you have been willing to
regard as indifferent and innocent if not as graceful and
d 
 travels st leon
becoming you cannot but be struck with their monstrous
deformity is it possible that you can be ignorant the
nature poverty there is such a thing as honourable
poverty the poverty cincinnatus was honourable who
impoverished himself by paying the fine which was factiously
imposed on his son and then was contented to pass
his time alternately between the highest situations and the
most rigid simplicity the poverty a man genius
such as rabelais if not honourable is interesting when we
compare his merits and worth with that many those
persons upon whom fortune has blindly lavished her favours
it is honourable if he have declined the means 
enriching himself by the sacrifice his independence and
his principles but all earthly things the most contemptible
is the man who having wasted his goods in
riotous living yet hungers after the luxuries that have
proved his bane and feasts himself upon the steam 
dainties which he has lost the substance poverty
always sufficiently disadvantageous in a degenerate age
where attention and courtship are doled forth with scales
 gold is tremendous to him he is the scorn all mankind
wherever he is a guest he is invited only to be
trampled upon and insulted he is capable nothing
and is a burden to society and mankind the helplessness
 age advances upon him with stealing steps and he
is destined to gather all its miseries and none its consolations

i might have talked to you thus but i refused it i
apprehend something the nature advice i know that
it can seldom be attended with its genuine effect and will
never be received with deference and pleasure where its
motives are capable misconstruction if i had talked to
you thus i might have appeared to be indulging the tyranny
 age i might have seemed to assume an unbecoming
air superiority and command it could not have
been clear that i was honestly interested in that about
which i affected so much concern i doubt not the ingenuousness
 your nature i doubt not that you would
have been struck with the picture but i must be permitted
to doubt the adequate and lasting effect my extravels
 st leon j
population i was not willing by my forwardness and
loquacity to wear out one the great springs human
improvement
i have determined on your reform for that purpose i
think it necessary to combine my remonstrances and advice
with a change your habits and situation you have
tasted largely what are commonly called the pleasures 
life but there are pleasures that you have not tasted at
this moment you anticipate them and anticipate them
with the ardour a lover but you know not yet all the
gratifications that attend upon domestic affections
i am willing to bestow upon you my daughter i consent
to prove the purity my advice and the sincerity 
my regard by committing her happiness to the risk she
is a treasure the equal which perhaps the world does not
hold i speak not her personal attractions but in understanding
accomplishments and virtue i firmly believe
no woman living can compare with her in possessing her
you will be blessed beyond the lot princes but at the
same time that i shah thus put happiness within your grasp
remember that i commit to your disposal the happiness 
marguerite you are a worthy and an honourable man 
your talents and your virtues will constitute her felicity
her portion will redeem the injury which your patrimony
has suffered from your excesses and you will have enough
for yourselves and for your mutual offspring i cannot
believe that with such a deposit intrusted to you you will
consent to bring her to misery and ruin
c i have one condition however to stipulate with you
i require you as the pledge her happiness that you
break off your present modes life that you separate
yourself from your connections and retire into the country
upon your paternal estate you are yet too young to be in
danger from that tyranny custom which often renders
men more advanced in life incapable relishing the simple
and genuine pleasures you will find contentment and
joy in the society my daughter and in the bosom 
your rising family you will be happy in the circle 
your own hearth and have little to ask the rest mankind
if in any illomened and inauspicious moment the
d 
 travels st leon
allurements your present vices forgive the plainness 
my speech should resume their power over you i hope at
least that i shall never live to see it that i shall not be
taught by bitter experience that i have sacrificed to the
disinterestedness my friendship the happiness my
daughter and my posterity 
my heart weeps blood while i record the admonitions 
this noble and generous man a nobler france did not
contain through all her boundaries refined by literature
polished by the best society his age could afford grown
grey in the field honour and particularly distinguished
by the personal attachment and confidence his sovereign
what was all this advice to me what return did i make
to this unparalleled kindness and friendship i ruined this
admirable woman i involved her in poverty and shame 
with the most savage barbarity i prepared for her an immature
grave can i forget this what avail to me are
immortal life and immortal youth oh marguerite marguerite
 for ever thy image haunts me for ever thy
ghost upbraids me how little have i proved myself worthy
 such a partner rather what punishment what plagues
what shame and detestation have i not deserved praised
be heaven the last prayer the marquis damville at
least was granted he did not live to witness my relapse
my profligacy and insanity
i resume the thread my story i listened to the address
 the marquis with reverence and admiration i
accepted his conditions with joy i married his adorable
daughter and conducted her to my paternal estate in the
bourgeois now only it was that i tasted perfect happiness
to judge from my own experience in this situation
i should say that nature has atoned for all the disasters
and miseries she so copiously and incessantly pours upon
her sons by this one gift the transcendent enjoyment and
nameless delights which wherever the heart is pure and
the soul is refined wait on the attachment two persons
 opposite sexes my beloved marguerite guided and
directed me at the same time that she was ever studying
my gratification i instructed her by my experience while
she enlightened me by the rectitude and decision her
travels st leon s
taste ours was a sober and dignified happiness and its
very sobriety served to give it additional voluptuousness
we had each our separate pursuits whether for the cultivation
 our minds or the promotion our mutual interests
separation gave us respectability in each other's
eyes while it prepared us to enter with fresh ardour into
society and conversation in company with each other
hours passed over us and appeared but minutes it has
been said to be a peculiar felicity for any one to be praised
by a man who is himself eminently a subject praise 
how much happier to be prized and loved by a person
worthy love a man may be prized and valued by his
friend but in how different a style sentiment from the
regard and attachment that may reign in the bosom his
mistress or his wife selfcomplacency and selfsatisfaction
may perhaps be numbered among the principal sources 
contentment it is necessary for him who would endure
existence with patience that he should conceive himself to
be something that he should be persuaded he is not a
cipher in the musterroll man how bitter is the anguish
we are sometimes doomed to sustain in this respect
from the marks we receive other men's indifference and
contempt to feel that we are loved by one whose love we
have deserved to be employed in the mutual interchange 
the marks this love habitually to study the happiness
 one by whom our happiness is studied in return this is
the most desirable as it is the genuine and unadulterated
condition human nature i must have some one to
sympathise with i cannot bear to be cut off from all relations
 i desire to experience a confidence a concord an
attachment that cannot rise between common acquaintance
in every state we long for some fond bosom on which to
rest our weary head some speaking eye with which to exchange
the glances intelligence and affection then the
soul warms and expands itself then it shuns the observation
 every other beholder then it melts with feelings
that are inexpressible but that the heart understands without
the aid words then the eyes swim with rapture 
then the frame languishes with enjoyment then the soul
burns with fire then the two persons thus blest are no

longer two distance vanishes one thought animates one
mind informs them thus love acts thus it is ripened
to perfection never does man feel himself so much alive
so truly etherial as when bursting the bonds diffidence
uncertainty and reserve he pours himself entire into the
bosom the woman he adores
marguerite de damville was particularly distinguished
from every other woman i ever knew by the justness her
taste and the vividness her feelings this circumstance
was a fund inexhaustible delight and improvement tome
we were both us well acquainted with the most
eminent poets and fine writers modern times but when
we came to read them together they presented themselves
in a point view in which they had never been seen by us
before it is perhaps more important that poetry and
every thing that excites the imagination or appeals to the
heart should be read in solitude than in society but the
true way to understand our author in these cases is to employ
each these modes in succession the terrible the
majestic the voluptuous and the melting are all them
in a considerable degree affairs sympathy and we never
judge them so infallibly or with so much satisfaction
as when in the presence each other the emotion is
kindled in either bosom at the same instant the eyebeams
pregnant with sentiment and meaning involuntarily meet
and mingle the voice the reader becomes modulated by
the ideas his author and that the hearer by an accidental
interjection momentary comment or applause
confesses its accord it was in this manner that we read
together the admirable sonnets petrarch and passed in
review the sublime effusions dante the letters 
eloise to abelard afforded us singular delight we searched
into the effusions the troubadours and among all their
absurdities and inequality we found a wildness a daring
pouring forth the soul an unpruned richness imagination
and from time to time a grandeur conception and
audacious eccentricity thought that filled us with unlocked
for transport at other times when not regularly
engaged in this species reading we would repeat passages
to each other communicate the discoveries this sort that
travels op st leon 
either had made in solitude and point out unobserved beauties
that perhaps neither us would have remarked hut
for the suggestions the other it is impossible for two
persons to be constituted so much alike but that one 
them should have a more genuine and instantaneous relish
for one sort excellence and another for another thus
we added to each other's stores and acquired a largeness 
conception and liberality judgment that neither us
would have arrived at if separate it is difficult to imagine
how prolific this kind amusement proved true happiness
we were mutually delighted to remark the accord
 our feelings and still more so as we perceived that
accord to be hourly increasing and what struck either as a
blemish in the other wearing out and disappearing we
were also led by the same means to advert to the powers 
mind existing in each the rectitude judgment and delicacy
 feeling as our attachment hourly increased we
rejoiced in this reciprocation benefits while each gave or
received something that added to value mind and worth
 character mutual esteem was incessantly kept alive
and mutual esteem is the only substantial basis love
each us hourly blessed our common lot while each believed
it impracticable elsewhere to have found so much
worth blended with so much sweetness
but we did not confine ourselves to the library and fireside
we walked we rode we travelled together we observed
together the beauties nature and the system 
the universe we traversed many provinces france and
some parts italy and spain we examined the characters
 mankind as they are modified by the varieties natural
descent or the diversities political government in all
this we found peculiar gratification there is something
in the scent and impression a balmy atmosphere in the
lustre sunshine in the azure heaven and the purple
clouds in the opening prospects on this side and on that
in the contemplation verdure and fertility and industry
and simplicity and cheerfulness in all their variations in
the very act and exercise travelling peculiarly congenial
to the human frame it expands the heart it makes the
spirit dance and exquisitely disposes us for social enjoys
travels st leon
ment the mind becomes more elevated and refined it
assumes a microscopical and unwonted sensibility it feels
things which in ordinary moments are unheeded and unknown
 it enjoys things too evanescent for a name and too
minute to be arrested it trembles with pleasure through
every fibre and every articulation
one thing is necessary to be mentioned in this place
though while it adds to the fidelity delineation i am
aware it breaks the tone feeling and the harmony 
the picture but it is not my intention in this history to
pass myself for better than i am i have laid down to myself
the sacred maxim absolute truth and impartiality i
must confess therefore with whatever anguish my extreme
inferiority to my incomparable partner she had all the
simplicity genuine taste the more she delivered herself
up to nature the greater was her content all superfluous
appendages and show appeared to her as so many
obstacles to enjoyment she derived her happiness from
the tone her own mind and stood in no need the gaping
admiration and stupid wonder others to make her
feel herself happy but i retained the original vice my
mind the gestures worship and the voice applause
were necessary to me i did not suffice to myself i was not
satisfied with the tranquil and inglorious fruition genuine
pleasures forgetting the vain and anxious tumult the
world and forgotten by those who figured on its theatre
it may be that marguerite could and ought by insensible
degrees to have rooted out this disease my mind but
i am concerned only with the statement facts and i
know that no such thing was the effect our intercourse
this absurd passion did not however at this time lead
me to any fatal extremities it contented itself with the
frivolous gratification resulting from a certain portion 
ostentation and expense i maintained a considerable train
 servants my apartments were magnificent and my furniture
splendid when we travelled it was with an attendance
little short princely idiot that i was to
regard this as an addition to the genuine pleasures which i
have above enumerated when we were at home every
accidental guest was received and entertained with extratravels
 st leon
ordinary pomp a pomp not directed to add to his accommodation
but that was designed to leave him impressed
with astonishment and admiration at the spirit his host
often indeed did i feel this ostentation an encumbrance 
often did i languish for the ease and freedom which result
from a mediocrity circumstances but this i called
doing honour to my ancestors and my country and vindicating
the consideration due to the house st leon
to quit this painful recollection a circumstance which
tended at this time to fill the measure my happiness
consisted in the dear pledges which marguerite bore me 
our mutual affection it is impossible for him who has not
experienced it to conceive the accumulation which a genuine
tenderness derives from this source the difficulties
are many that attend upon pregnancy trifles are at that
period sources fatigue and injury it is necessary that
the person should be protected and the mind tranquil we
love to watch over a delicate plant that appears to call for
all our anxiety and attention there is in this case the
sentiment without the repulsive circumstances that attends
upon our sympathy with a dangerous and alarming disease
marguerite by her sensibility and growing attachment
abundantly rewarded my cares at length the critical period
arrives when an event so extraordinary occurs as cannot
fail to put the human frame in considerable jeopardy
never shall i forget the interview between us immediately
subsequent to her first parturition the effusion soul with
which we met each other after all danger seemed to have
subsided the kindness which animated us increased as it
was by ideas peril and suffering the sacred sensation
with which the mother presented her infant to her husband
or the complacency with which we read in each other's eyes
a common sentiment melting tenderness and inviolable
attachment 
this she seemed to say is the joint result our common
affection it partakes equally both and is the
shrine in which our sympathies and our life have been
poured together never to be separated let other lovers
testify their engagements by presents and tokens we record
and stamp our attachment in this precious creature a
 travels op st leon
creature that species which is more admirable than anything
else the world has to boast a creature susceptible 
pleasure and pain affection and love sentiment and
fancy wisdom and virtue this creature will daily
stand in need an aid we shall delight to afford will require
our meditations and exertions to forward its improvement
and confirm its merits and its worth we shall
each blend our exertions for that purpose and our union
confirmed by this common object our labour and affection
will every day become more sacred and indissoluble all
this the present weakness my beloved marguerite would
not allow her to say but all this occurred to my reflections
 and when we had time tranquilly to compare
our recollection the event it plainly appeared that in all
this our hearts and conceptions had most truly sympathised
the possessing a third object a common centre anxiety
to both is far from weakening the regard such a couple
for each other it does not separate or divert them it is
a new link connection each is attached to it the more
for the sake either each regards it as a sort branch
or scion representing the parent each rejoices in its
health its good humour its smiles its increase in size in
strength and in faculties principally from the idea the
gratification they will communicate to the other were it
not for this idea were it possible the pleasure should not
be mutual the sentiment would be stripped its principal
elevation and refinement it would be comparatively cold
selfish solitary and inane
in the first ten years our marriage my wife brought
me five children two sons and three daughters the second
son only died in his infancy my predominant passion at
this time was that domestic pleasures and employments
and i devoted myself jointly with the mother to the cultivation
 the minds my children they all in a considerable
degree rewarded our care they were all amiable
taught by the example their parents they lived in uncommon
harmony and affection charles the eldest was
a lad a bold and active disposition but the sentiments
 virtue and honour that were infused into him both by
marguerite and myself found a favourable reception and
travels op st leon 
promised to render those qualities which if left to themselves
might have been turbulent and dangerous productive
 the happiest consequences julia his eldest sister was
uncommonly mild and affectionate alive to the slightest
variations treatment profoundly depressed by every
mark unkindness but exquisitely sensible to demonstrations
 sympathy and attachment she appeared little
formed to struggle with the difficulties life and the frowns
 the world but in periods quietness and tranquillity
nothing could exceed the sweetness her character and
the fascination her manners her chief attachment was
to her mother though she was by no means capable her
mother's active beneficence and heroic fortitude louisa
the second daughter resembled her mother in person and
promised to resemble her in character marguerite the
youngest differed from the whole family in the playfulness
and frolic her disposition her vivacity was inexhaustible
and was continually displaying itself in innocent
tricks and smart unexpected sallies nothing could possibly
be more ingenuous than this admirable infant nothing
more kind considerate and enthusiastic in her tenderness
and grief when an occasion occurred to call forth
these sentiments but the moment the sorrowful occasion
was over she would resume all her vivacity and even
sometimes in the midst her tears some trait her
native humour would escape i know not whether all the
family were not more attached to the little marguerite than
to any other individual member as she certainly oftener
contributed to their amusement and pleasure such was
the amiable circle one and all whom have been involved
by me in the most tremendous ruin and disgrace
chapter v
charles was now nine years age his mother and
myself had delighted ourselves with observing and forwarding
the opening his infant mind and had hitherto been
 travels op st leon
contented with the assistance a neighbouring priest byway
 preceptor but as he was our only son we were
desirous that he should obtain every advantage education
we were neither us illiterate but in the course 
twentythree years which had elapsed since i was myself 
charles's age the progress literature and the literary
passion in europe had been astonishingly great and i was
anxious that he should realise in his own person every
benefit which the fortunate and illustrious period human
affairs in which he began to exist seemed to hold out to
him beside there was an impetuosity and forwardness in
his character that seemed ill to brook the profound solitude
and retirement in which his mother and i were contented
to live his case demanded companions his own
age a little world fellowbeings with whom he might
engage in their petty business and cares with whose passions
his own might jostle or might sympathise who might
kindle his emulation and open to him the field fraternal
associations and amity
there was however a considerable difficulty attendant
on this question the schools real literature in france
where languages were properly taught and science might
be acquired were at this time exceedingly few the
nearest university was that toulouse at the distance 
twentysix leagues this was practically speaking as far
from us as paris itself was then our darling child to be
torn from his parents from all he was accustomed to see
and all by whom he was loved to be planted in the midst
 strangers to have his mind excited to observation and
the spirit generous contention roused at the risk 
suppressing the tender affections his soul and the sentiments
 duty reliance and love there seemed however
to be no alternative it was necessary that a temporary
separation should take place intellectual improvement was
a point by all means to be pursued and we must direct
our efforts to keep alive along with it those winning qualities
and that softness heart which had hitherto rendered
charles so eminently our delight such were our
fond speculations and projects for the future
it was at length determined that i should proceed along
travels st leon 
with him to paris i could there observe upon the spot
the state the university and the means learning that
existed in the metropolis and could consult with some 
those eminent luminaries with whom i had become acquainted
at the house the marquis de damville marguerite
declined accompanying me upon this occasion her
father was dead she could not think quitting her daughters
for any considerable time and our nuptial engagement
 residing always in the country gave her a repugnance to
the removing with her whole family to paris it was left
probable that she might come to me when the business was
settled if at that time it was determined to leave her son at
the capital and that she might then conduct me to the
place which had been the scene all my happiness but
which i was destined never to revisit in peace
preliminaries being at length fully adjusted in the manner
that appeared suitable to the importance the occasion
i set off for the metropolis my country which i had seen
only once and that for a very short period in the course
 ten years that visit had been produced by a very melancholy
circumstance the death the marquis de damville
marguerite and myself had then been summoned
and arrived at his hotel but a few days before he expired
though extremely weakened by the mortal disease under
which he laboured he retained all the faculties his mind
and conversed with us in the most affectionate and endearing
terms he congratulated us upon our mutual felicity
nor could the situation in which we found him upon the
brink an everlasting oblivion all earthly things abate
the sincerity and fervour his delight he thanked me
for my carriage and conduct as a husband which he said
might with propriety be held up as a model to the human
species he applauded himself for that mingled discernment
and determination which as he affirmed had so
opportunely secured my virtue and his daughter's happiness
he trusted that i was now sufficiently weaned from those
habits which had formerly given him so much alarm at
the same time he conjured me by every motive that an
overflowing enthusiasm could suggest to persist in my good
resolutions and never to change that residence where i
travels st leon
had found every degree delight which the human
mind is in its present condition susceptible do not said
he be drawn aside by ambition do not be dazzled by the
gli utter idle pomp and decoration do not enter the remotest
circle the vortex dissipation live in the
midst your family cultivate domestic affection be the
solace and joy your wife watch for the present and
future welfare your children and be assured that you
will then be found no contemptible or beneficial member
 the community at large 
such were the last advices the marquis de damville
excellent man how ill were your lessons remembered 
how iu your kindness remunerated he died in the sixth
year our marriage the serious impression which this
event produced in my mind gave me small inclination to
enter into any species society and disposed me to quit
paris as soon as every respect had been paid to the obsequies
 the deceased
upon my arrival in the metropolis on the present occasion
i immediately sought to renew my acquaintance with
those amiable and eminent persons who had for the most
part constituted the circle the marquis de damville
they received me with that interest and attention that i
have usually found attendant on a cultivated mind the
pleasure was considerable that resulted from meeting them
thus again after ten years cessation intercourse a few
 them indeed were dead and others dispersed by various
accidents in different parts france or europe the
greater part however i still found in that celebrated city
which might well be considered as the metropolis the
civilised world the king had early been distinguished by
his love letters and the arts and added years while
they abated in his mind the eagerness ambition and glory
gave new strength to his more cultivated propensities the
liberality his conduct and the polished ease that characterised
his manners produced a general predilection in
favour the capital in which he resided
i found all my former friends matured and improved by
the silent influence time their knowledge was increased
their views rendered wider their conversation
travels op st leon 
was more amusing and instructive their manners more
bland and unaffected but if their characters had experienced
revolution mine was more materially changed i
had before encountered them with all the heat and presumption
 youth with no views so much present to my
mind as those chivalry and a factitious honour with no
experience but that a camp i was impetuous volatile
and dissipated i had not rested long enough upon any one
 the flowers intellect to extract its honey and my
mind was kept in a state preternatural agitation by the
passions a gamester it was now become cool moderate
and tranquil the society marguerite had contributed
much to the improvement my character i had li vet in
no idle and brutish solitude but in the midst contemplation
and letters and i had the passions a husband
and a father in the extremest degree attached to his family
these passions will be found perhaps to be the true school
 humanity the man whose situation continually exercises
in him the softest and most amiable charities our nature
will almost infallibly surpass his brethren in kindness to
sympathise with and promptness to relieve the distresses
 others
will it be accounted strange that in paris surrounded
by persons various knowledge and liberal benevolence i
found myself under the influence other feelings than any
i had lately experienced i was like a man who had suffered
long calamity in a famished vessel or a town besieged
and is immediately after introduced into the midst luxury
to a table loaded with the most costly dainties every viand
has to his apprehension an exquisite relish and every wine
a delicious flavour that he never perceived in them before
let no one infer that my love for marguerite was diminished
it has already sufficiently appeared in the course 
my narrative that no happiness could be more consummate
than mine was with this admirable woman had i been
called upon to choose for the seat my future life between
my paternal chateau in the bordelois with marguerite to
grace my abode on the one hand and all the gratifications
that paris could afford on the other i should not have
hesitated even for an instant but the mind man is
 travels st leon
made capacious various pleasures and a person sound
and uncorrupted judgment will perhaps always enjoy with
emotion the delights which for a long time before he had
not encountered however enviable his content may have
been under their absence i delighted to converse with
the men genius and refinement with whom paris at this
time abounded it was a feast soul which i had
rarely partaken in my rural retreat i delighted to combine
excellence with number and to a considerable degree at
least variety intercourse with sentiments regard and
friendship in these select societies i found no cold suppressions
and reserve their members were brethren indisposition
similar in their pursuits and congenial in their
sentiments when any one spoke it was that the person
to whom he addressed himself might apprehend what was
passing in his thoughts they participated with sincerity
and a liberal mind in each other's feelings whether gay
delight or melancholy disappointment
thus situated i forgot for a time my engagements with
marguerite the scenes st leon its fields its walks
its woods and its streams faded from my mind i forgot
the pleasure with which i had viewed my children sporting
on the green and the delicious rural suppers which i had
so often partaken with my wife beneath my vines and my
figtrees at the period the setting sun when i set out
for paris these images had dwelt upon my mind and saddened
my fancy at every stage i felt myself removed
still further from the scene where my treasures and my
affections were deposited but shortly after new scenes
and new employments engaged my thoughts the pleasures
which i sought but weakly at first every time they
were tasted increased my partiality for them i seemed fora
time to be under the influence an oblivion my former
life thus circumstanced the folly which had so deep a
root in my character took hold me i hired a magnificent
hotel and entertained at my own expense those persons
in whose society i principally delighted my circles
became more numerous than those the marquis de damville
and were conducted in a very different style splendour
and profusion i corresponded with marguerite but
travels st leon 
i continually found some new pretext for lengthening my
stay and she on her part though the kindest and most
indulgent women became seriously alarmed and unhappy

as my parties were more numerous than those the
marquis de damville had been they were more mixed
among others i occasionally associated with some those
nobleman who had been the companions my former dissipation
and gaming an obvious consequence resulted
from this parties play were occasionally proposed tome
i resisted i yielded my first compliances were
timid hesitating and painful i recollected the lessons
and exhortations my excellent fatherinlaw at length
however my alarms abated i reproached myself with the
want an honourable confidence in my own firmness and
the cowardice supposing that i was not to be trusted with
the direction my conduct
one evening i ventured beyond the cautious limits i had
at first prescribed myself and won a considerable sum
this incident produced a strong impression upon me and
filled my mind with tumult and agitation there was a
secret that i had concealed almost from myself but which
now recurred to me with tenfold violence j was living
beyond the means i had to discharge my expenses my
propensity this sort seemed to be fatal and irresistible
my marriage with marguerite had occurred opportunely to
heal the breaches i had at that time made in my fortune
and to take from me the consciousness embarrassments
which i should otherwise have deeply felt the death 
the marquis however deplorable in other respects happened
at a period when the spirit profusion and magnificence
which characterised me had again involved my affairs inconsiderable
difficulty it might be supposed that these two
cases experience would have sufficed to extirpate my
folly but they had rather the contrary effect in each 
them the event was such as to prevent extravagance and
thoughtlessness from producing their genuine results and
 consequence they appeared less criminal and mischievous
in my eyes than otherwise they probably would have appeared
i rather increased than diminished my establish

ment upon the death my fatherinlaw i had no reasonable
prospect any property hereafter to descend to me
that should exonerate me from the consequences further
prodigality but i did not advert to this i saw myself
surrounded by my children they were the delight and solace
 my life and yet i was heedless their interests
sometimes i resolved upon a more rigid economy but
economy is a principle that does not easily lay hold any
but a heart framed to receive it it is a business attentive
and vigilant detail it easily escapes the mind amidst
the impetuosity the passions the obstinacy rooted
propensities and the seduction long established habits
marguerite indeed did not share with me in these follies
the simplicity and ingenuousness her mind were such
that she would have been as happy in a cottage as a palace
but though she did not partake my vices an illjudged
forbearance and tenderness for my feelings did not permit
her effectually to counteract them this is perhaps the
only defect character i am able to impute to her
after i had won the sum to which i have alluded i
retired to my hotel full anxious thoughts it produced
upon me in some degree the same effect as ordinarily belongs
to a great calamity i lay all night sleepless and
disturbed ruin and despair presented themselves to my
mind in a thousand forms heedless prodigality and dilapidated
revenues passed in review before me i counted
the years my life i had completed the thirtysecond
year my age this was scarcely half the probable duration
 human existence how was i to support the remaining
period a period little assorted to difficulties and expedients 
and which in the close it seems imperiously to call for
every indulgence hitherto an interval four or five
years had repeatedly sufficed to involve me in serious embarrassment
my children were growing up around me 
my family was likely to become still larger as my offspring
increased in years their demands upon my revenues would
be more considerable were these demands to be slighted 
were my daughters nay was the heir my rank and my
name to be committed to the compassion the world
unprovided and forlorn what a cheerless prospect what
travels st leon 
a gloomy and disconsolate hue did these ideas spread upon
that future which the health the human mind requires
to have gilded with the beams hope and expectation i
had already tried the expedient economy and i had
uniformly found this inestimable and only sheetanchor 
prudence gliding from my deluded grasp could i promise
myself better success in future there seemed to be something
in my habits whether inattention ostentation or
inconsistency that baffled the strongest motives by which
parsimony and frugality can be enforced
why did these thoughts importunately recur to me in
the present moment they were the suggestions a malignant
genius thoughts the destination which was
to lead me into a gulf misery and guilt while i was
going on in a regular train expense while i was scooping
the mine that was to swallow me and my hopes together
i had the art to keep these reflections at bay now
that i had met with an unexpected piece good fortune
they rushed upon me with irresistible violence unfortunate
coincidence miserable rather let me say guilty abandoned
miscreant 
as soon as i rose in the morning i went to the closet
where the evening before i had deposited my recent acquisitions
i spread out the gold before me i gazed
upon it with intentness my eyes a moment after rolled
in vacancy i traversed the apartment with impatient steps
all the demon seemed to make his descent upon my soul
this was the first time that i had ever felt the struggle 
conscious guilt and dishonour i was far indeed from anticipating
that species guilt and that species ruin
which soon after overwhelmed me my mind did not once
recur to the possibility any serious mischief i dwelt
only as gamesters perhaps usually do upon the alternative
between acquisition and no acquisition i did not take into
the account the ungovernableness my own passions i
assumed it as unquestionable that i could stop when i
pleased the thoughts that tortured me were in the first
place those a sanguine and unexperienced adventurer ina
lottery whose mind rests not for a moment upon the sum
he has risked but who having in fancy the principal prize
k 
 travels st leon
already in his possession and having distributed it to various
objects and purposes sometimes fearfully recurs to the possibility
 his disappointment and anticipates with terror
what will be his situation if deprived this imaginary
wealth i had now for the first time opened my eyes to
the real state my affairs and i clung with proportionable
vehemence to this plank which was to bear me from the
storm in the second place i felt though darkly and unwillingly
the immorality my conception to game may
in some instances not be in diametrical opposition to liberality
 mind but he who games for the express purpose
 improving his circumstances must be an idiot if he does
not sometimes recollect that the money lost may be as serious
a mischief to his neighbour as the money gained can
possibly be a benefit to himself it is past a question that
he who thus turns his amusement into his business loses
the dignity a man honour and puts himself upon a
level with the most avaricious and usurious merchant
though i was far from having digested a specific plan
 enriching myself by these discreditable means yet the
very tumult my thoughts operated strongly to lead me
once more to the gamingtable i was in no humour to
busy myself with my own thoughts the calmness literary
discussion and the polished interchange wit which had
lately so much delighted me had now no attraction for my
heart the turbulence a scene high play alone had
power to distract my attention from the storm within i
won a second time i felt the rapidity and intenseness 
my contemplations still further accelerated i will not over
again detail what they were suffice it to say that my
hopes became more ardent my conception the necessity
 this resource more impressive and my alarm lest this
last expedient should fail me more tormenting
the next time i lost half as much as the sum my
winnings i then proceeded for several days in a nearly
regular alternation gain and loss this as soon as the
fact unavoidably forced itself upon my mind only served
to render my thoughts more desperate no exclaimed i
it was not for this that i entered upon so tormenting a
pursuit it is not for this that i have deserted the learned
societies which were lately my delight and committed mytravels
 st leon 
self to a sea disquiet and anxiety i came not here like
a boy for amusement or like one who has been bred in
the lap ignorance and wealth to seek a relief from the
burden existence and to find a stimulus to animate my
torpid spirits am i then to be for ever baffled am i to
cultivate a tract land which is to present me nothing in
return but unvaried barrenness am i continually to wind up
my passions and newstring my attention in vain am i
a mere instrument to be played upon by endless hopes and
fears and tormenting wishes am i to be the sport 
events the fool promise always agitated with near approaching
good yet always deluded 
this frame mind led me on insensibly to the most
extravagant adventures it threw me in the first place into
the hands notorious gamblers men real property
shrunk from the stakes i proposed as though they were
in some degree infected with the venom gaming their
infection was not so deep as mine nor with my desperation
 thought the players with whom i engaged were for
the most part well known to every one but myself not to
be able to pay the sums they played for if they lost nay
this fact might be said in some sense to be known to me as
well as the rest though i obstinately steeled myself against
the recollection it one evening i won one these
persons a very large sum for which i suffered him to play
with me upon honour the consequence was simple the
next morning he took his departure from paris and i heard
 him no more
before this however the tide success had set strongly
against me i had sustained some serious vicissitudes 
and while i was playing with the wretch i have just mentioned
my eagerness increased as my good luck began and
i flattered myself that i should now avenge myself fortune
for some her late unkindness my anguish
why should i call the thing by a disproportionate and
trivial appellation my agony was by so much the
greater when i found that this person the very individual
who had already stripped me considerable sums had
disappeared and left me without the smallest benefit from
my imaginary winnings

been gradually worked up into a paroxysm an unexpected
turn arrives and he is made the most miserable men
never shall i cease to recollect the sensation i have repeatedly
felt in the instantaneous sinking the spirits the
conscious fire that spread over my visage the anger in my
eye the burning dryness my throat the sentiment that
in a moment was ready to overwhelm with curses the cards
the stake my own existence and all mankind how every
malignant and insufferable passion seemed to rush upon my
soul what nights dreadful solitude and despair did i
repeatedly pass during the progress my ruin it was the
night the soul my mind was wrapped in a gloom that
could not be pierced my heart was oppressed with a
weight that no power human or divine was equal to
remove my eyelids seemed to press downward with an
invincible burden my eyeballs were ready to start and
crack their sockets i lay motionless the victim ineffable
horror the whole endless night seemed to be
travels st leon 
filled with one vast appalling immovable idea it was a
stupor more insupportable and tremendous than the
utmost whirl pain or the fiercest agony exquisite perception

one day that my mind was in a state excessive anguish
and remorse i had already contrived by this infernal
means to dispossess myself the half my property
my son came unexpectedly into my chamber for sometime
i had scarcely ever seen him such is a gamester 
all the night while he slept i was engaged in these haunts
 demons all the day while he was awake and studying
with his masters or amusing himself i was in my bedchamber
endeavouring to court a few broken hours sleep
when notwithstanding the opposition our habits i had
the opportunity seeing him i rather shunned to use
than sought to embrace it the sight him had a savour
 bitterness in it that more than balanced all the solace 
natural affection it brought before me the image his
mother and his sisters it presented to my soul a frightful
tale deserted duties it was more galling and envenomed
than the sting scorpions
starting at the sound the opening door i called out
abruptly and with some harshness who is there what
do you want 
it is i sir replied the boy it is charles come to
pay his duty to you 
f i do not want you now you should not come but
when you know i am at leisure answered i somewhat
disturbed
very well sir very well i am going as he spoke
his voice seemed suffocated with tears he was on the
point shutting the door and leaving me to myself
 charles said i not well knowing what it was i intended
to do
he returned
c come here my dear boy 
i took his hand i drew him between my knees i hid
my face in his neck i shook with the violence my emotion

go go boy you perceive i cannot talk to you
 travels st leon
i pushed him gently from me
papa cried he i do not like to leave you i
know i am but a boy and can be but little use to you
if mamma were with you i would not be troublesome i
should cry when i saw you were grieved but i would ask
no questions and would leave you because you desired it
i hope you have not had any bad news 
no my boy no come to me tomorrow and i will
be at leisure and will talk a great deal to you
ah papa tomorrow every day that i did not see
you i thought it would be tomorrow and there was one
tomorrow and another tomorrow and so many that it
seemed as if you had forgotten to speak to me at all
 why charles you do not doubt my word i tell
you that tomorrow you shall see me as long as you please
well well i will wait but do then let it be all day
i will not go to college and it shall be a holiday papa i
do not like my lessons half so well as i did since i have
neither you nor mamma that i can tell what they are
about
goodbye charles be a good boy remember tomorrow
 goodbye 
papa now i am sure you look a good deal better than
you did at first let me tell you something about the
lesson i read this morning it was a story seleucus
the dorian who put out one his own eyes that he
might preserve eyesight to his son
this artless story thus innocently introduced cut me to
the soul i started in my chair and hid my face upon the
table
papa what is the matter indeed you frighten me 
 zaleucus was a father what then am i 
t yes zaleucus was very good indeed but do you
know his son was very naughty it was his disobedience
and wickedness that made him liable to such a punishment
i would not for the world be like zaleucus's son i hope
papa you will never suffer from my wilfulness you shall
not papa indeed indeed 
i caught the boy in my arms no you are very good 
you are too good i cannot bear it 
travels op st leon 
well papa i wish i were able to show you that i
love you as well as ever zaleucus loved his son i
i was melted with the ingenuousness the boy's expression
i quitted him i paced up and down the
room suddenly as if by paroxysm insanity i seized
my child by the arm i seated myself i drew him towards
me i put my eye upon him
boy how dare you talk to me zaleucus do you
mean to insinuate a reproach do i not discharge a father's
duty if i do not know urchin i will not be insulted
by my child 
the boy was astonished he burst into tears and was
silent
i was moved by his evident distress no child you
have no father i am afraid you have not you do not
know my baseness you do not know that i am the deadliest
foe you have in the world
dear papa do not talk thus do not i know that you
are the best men do not i love you and mamma
better than every body else put together 
te well charles cried i endeavouring to compose myself
 we will talk no more now did not i tell you you
should not come to me but when you knew it was a proper
time i hope you will never have reason to hate me
i never will hate you papa do to me what you will t r
he saw i wished to be alone and left me
chapter vi
in the evening the same day my beloved marguerite
arrived unexpectedly at paris in the beginning our
separation i had been to the last degree punctual in my
letters i had no pleasure so great as retiring to my
closet and pouring out my soul to the most adorable 
women by degrees i relaxed in punctuality ordinary
occupations however closely pursued have a method in
them that easily combines with regularity in points an
incidental nature but gaming when pursued with avidity
travels st leon
subverts all order and forces every avocation from the
place assigned it when my insane project supplying
the inadequateness my fortune by this expedient began
to produce an effect exactly opposite i could not but with
the extremest difficulty string my mind to write to the
mistress my soul i endeavoured not to think with
distinctness and attention the persons whose happiness
was most nearly involved with mine i said to myself
yet another venture must be tried fortune shall change
the animosity with which she has lately pursued me i
will repair the breaches that have been sustained and i
shall then return with tenfold avidity to subjects that at
present i dare not fix my mind upon my letters were
accordingly short unfrequent and unsatisfactory and
those marguerite discovered increasing anguish perturbation
and anxiety what a change in the minds 
both had the lapse a few months produced not that
my attachment had suffered the diminution a single
particle but that attachment which had lately been the
source our mutual felicity was now fraught only with
distress my mind was filled with horrors and marguerite
expected from me an encouragement and consolation in
absence which alas i had it not in my power to give 
i had now continued in paris for a time vastly greater
than i had originally proposed after having remained
more than ten days without receiving one word intelligence
a letter mine was delivered to marguerite more
short mysterious and distressing to her feelings than any
that had preceded the ten days silence from me who
at first had never missed an opportunity pouring out
my soul to her and contributing to her pleasure was exquisitely
painful there is scarcely any thing that produces
such a sickness the heart as the repeated prorogation
 hope but when the letter arrived that had
been so anxiously looked for when the handwriting 
the superscription was recognised when the letter was
treasured up for the impatiently desired moment solitude
that the sacred emotions the heart might suffer no
interruption and when it at last appeared so cold so
ominous so withering to the buds affection the detertravels
 st leon l
mention marguerite was speedily formed the relations
that bound us together were too mighty a value
to be dispensed or to be trifled with she felt them as
the very cords existence for ten years she had known
no solace that was disconnected from my idea no care but
 our own happiness and that our offspring benevolent
she was almost beyond human example and interested
for the welfare all she knew but these were
brief and mutable concerns they were not incorporated
with the stamina her existence i was the whole world
to her she had no idea satisfaction without me her
firmness had been sufficiently tried by the interposal 
separation and absence how was she to interpret the
obscurity that had now arisen had i forgotten my
family and my wife had i been corrupted and debauched
by that paris the effects which upon my
character her father had so deeply apprehended had i
in contempt every thing sacred entered into some new
attachment had the attractions some new beauty in
the metropolis made me indifferent to the virtue my
children and the life their mother perhaps the length
 our attachment had infected me with satiety and the
inconstancy my temper had been roused by the charms
 novelty perhaps the certainty her kindness and
regard had no longer allurements for me and i might be
excited to the pursuit another by the pleasures hope
combined with uncertainty and a coyness that seemed
to promise compliance hereafter even while it pronounced
a present denial these were the images that haunted her
mind they engendered all the wildness and all the torments
 a delirious paroxysm she resolved that no time
should be sacrificed to needless uncertainty and that no
effort hers should be unexpected to prevent the mischief
she feared
it was evening when she arrived i was upon the
point repairing to that scene nightly resort the source
 all my guilt and all my miseries i enquired my
son's valet where he was and how he had been in the
course the day he was gone to bed he had appeared
unusually sad sometimes in tears and while he was
oxs travels op st leon
undressing had sighed deeply two or three times while
i was collecting this account in my own apartment the
gates the hotel opened and a number horsemen
entered the courtyard i was somewhat surprised because
though i was accustomed to see much company
few my acquaintance visited me at so late an hour
except on the evenings appropriated to receive them i
crossed the saloon to enquire one the servants exclaimed
 it is bernardin's voice it must be my mistress
that is come 
nothing could be further from my mind than the
thought her arrival i flew through the passage i
was on the spot the moment that the servant prepared to
conduct his mistress from the litter i received marguerite
in my arms and led her into the house if i had expected
her arrival i should infallibly have met her at this
moment with anxiety and confusion i should have gone
round the circle my thoughts and should not have had
confidence to encounter the beam her eye but the
event was so unexpected as to drive all other ideas from
my mind and in consequence i enjoyed several minutes
ages rather let me say the sincerest transport
i kissed the mistress my soul with ecstasy i gazed
upon her well known lineaments and features i listened
to the pleasing melody her voice i w r as intoxicated
with delight upon occasions like this it seems as if
every former joy that had marked the various periods 
intercourse distilled its very spirit and essence to compose
a draught ten times more delicious and refined than
had ever before been tasted our meeting was like awaking
from the dead it was the emancipation the weary
captive who exchanges the dungeon's gloom for the lustre
 the morning and who feels a celestial exhilaration 
heart the very memory which had been insensibly wearing
away from his treacherous brain all my senses partook
 the rapture marguerite seemed to shed ambrosial
odours round her her touch was thrilling her lips were
nectar her figure was that a descended deity 
her pleasure was not less than mine it is indeed absurd
it may be termed profanation to talk solitary
travels st leon 
pleasure no sensation ordinarily distinguished by that
epithet can endure the test a moment's inspection when
compared with a social enjoyment it is then only that a
man is truly pleased when pulse replies to pulse when the
eyes discourse eloquently to each other when in responsive
tones and words the soul is communicated altogether weare
conscious a sober a chaste and dignified intoxication
an elevation spirit that does not bereave the mind itself
and that endures long enough for us to analyse and savour
the causes our joy
for some time we rested on a sofa each filled and
occupied with the observation the other my eyes assured
marguerite the constancy my affection my
kisses were those chaste undivided entire attachment
our words were insignificant and idle the broken and
incoherent phrases a happiness that could not be silent
at length marguerite exclaimed it is enough my fears
are vanished i have no questions to ask no doubts to remove
yet why my reginald did you suffer those doubts
to gather those fears to accumulate surely you knew
the singleness my affection how many painful days
and hours might you have saved me almost by a word i
forgive me my love replied i waste not the golden
hour meeting in recrimination feeling as your angelic
goodness now makes me feel i wonder at myself that i
could for one moment have consented to separation that i
could have thought any thing but this existence or that
having experienced the joys that you have bestowed i
could lose all image the past and dwelling in a desert
imagine it paradise 
recrimination rejoined marguerite no my love 
you make me too happy to leave room for any thing but
gratitude and affection forgive me reginald if i pretend
that in meeting you thus i find myself your superior
in happiness and love you only awake from lethargy
forgetfulness yourself and me but i awake from
anguish a separation that i desired not at first and 
which i hourly wished to see an from doubts that
would intrude and refused to be expelled from the incessant
contemplation and regret a felicity once possessed
travels st leon
but possessed no longer melancholy ideas gloomy prognostic
overspread my sleepless nights and bedewed my
pillow with tears this it is that at last has driven me
from my family and daughters resolved to obtain the certainty
 despair or the dispersion my fears have i
known all this and think you that i do not enjoy with rapture
this blissful moment 
while we were thus conversing charles entered the
room he was not yet asleep when his mother arrived 
he heard her voice and hastened to put on his clothes
that he might rush into her arms the pleasure marguerite
had conceived from our meeting and the affectionate
serenity that had taken possession her soul infused
double ardour into the embraces she bestowed on her son
he gazed earnestly in her face he kissed her with fervency
 but was silent
why charles said she what is the matter with you 
are not you glad to see me 
that i am mamma so glad that i do not know what
to do with myself i was afraid i never should have been
glad again 
 pooh boy what do you mean you were not mothersick
were you 
yes indeed i was sick sick at heart not that i ama
coward i think that i could have been satisfied to have
been without either my father or you for a little while
but papa is so altered you cannot think he never smiles
and looks happy and when i see him instead making
me joyful as it used to do it makes me sad i
dear reginald replied the mother looking at me is
it possible that while my heart was haunted with fear and
suspicions separation alone should have had such an effect
on you 
i dare say it was that interposed the boy i could
not make papa smile all i could do but now you are come
he will soon be well how much he must love you
mamma 
the artless prattle my son struck anguish to my soul
and awakened a whole train tormenting thoughts alas 
thought i can it indeed be love that thus contrives against
travels op st leon 
the peace its object would to god my child that
my thoughts were as simple and pure as thy innocent
bosom 
 and yet added the boy as if recollecting himself if
he couldn't see you sure that was no reason for him to avoid
me he seemed as much afraid me as i have seen
some my playfellows a snake indeed mamma it
was a sad thing that when i wanted him to kiss me and
press me to his bosom he shrunk away from me there
now it was just so as he looks now that papa used to
frown upon me i cannot tell how often now is not that
ugly mamma 
i could no longer govern the tumult my thoughts
peace urchin cried i why did you come to mar
the transport our meeting just now marguerite i
forgot myself and was happy now all the villain rises
in my soul 
my wife was so astonished at the perturbation my
manner and at the words i uttered that she was scarcely
able to articulate reginald in broken accents she exclaimed
 my love my husband 
no matter said i it shall yet be well my heart
assures me it shall be not disturbed my love i will
never cause you a moment's anguish i would sooner die a
thousand deaths forget the odious thoughts that poor
charles has excited in me so unseasonably they were
mere idle words depend upon it they were 
while i was speaking marguerite hid her face upon the
sofa i took her hand and by my caresses endeavoured to
soothe and compose her at length turning to me
e reginald said she in a voice anguish do you then
endeavour to hide from me the real state your thoughts 
was the joy that attended our meeting imperishable and deceitful
 after ten years unbounded affection and confidence
am i denied to be the partner your bosom 
no marguerite no this was but the thought a moment
 by tomorrow's dawn it shall have no existence in
my bosom why should i torment you with what so soon
shall have no existence to myself meanwhile be assured
my love instead suffering diminution is more full more
fervent and entire than it ever was 
' travels st leon
at this instant my mind experienced an extraordinary impression
instead being weaned by the presence this
admirable woman from my passion for gaming it became
stronger than ever if charles had not entered at the critical
moment he did i should have remained with marguerite
and amidst the so long un tasted solace love have
at least for this night forgotten my cares but that occurrence
had overturned every thing had uncovered the wounds
 my bosom and awakened conceptions that refused to be
laid to sleep again the arms my wife that were about
to embrace me suddenly became to me a nest scorpions
i could as soon have rested and enjoyed myself upon the
top vesuvius when it flamed new as i was to this
species anguish tranquilly and full virtuous contentment
as i had hitherto passed the years my married state
the pangs a guilty conscience i was wholly unable to bear
i rose from my seat and was upon the point quitting
the room
marguerite perceived by my manner that there was something
extraordinary passing in my mind where are you
going reginald said she
i answered with a slight nod not far i replied
attempting an air apathy and unconcern
she was not satisfied you are not going out she
enquired
i returned to where i had been sitting my love i
was going out at the moment your arrival it is necessary
i assure you i hope shall soon be back i am
sorry i am obliged to leave you compose yourself you
are in want rest and had better go to bed
stop reginald afford me a minute's leisure before
you depart leave us charles good night my dear
boy kiss me remember that your mother is now in the
same house with you and sleep in peace
the boy quitted the room
 reginald said the mother i have no wish to control
your desires or be a spy upon your actions but your
conduct seems so extraordinary in this instance as to dispense
me from the observation common rules i have
always been a complying wife i have never set myself in
contradiction to your will i appeal to yourself for the
travels op st leon 
truth this i despise however those delicacies an adherence
to which would entail upon us the sacrifice all
that is most valuable in human life can i shut my ears
upon the mysterious expressions which charles's complaints
have extorted from you can i be insensible to the extraordinary
purpose you declare leaving me when i have
yet been scarcely half an hour under the roof with you 
before charles came in you seem to have entertained no
such design
my love replied i how seriously you comment upon
the most insignificant incident is it extraordinary that your
unexpected arrival should at first have made me forget an
engagement that i now recollect 
f st leon answered my wife before you indulge in
surprise at my earnestness recollect the circumstances that
immediately preceded it through successive weeks i have
waited for some satisfactory and agreeable intelligence from
you i had a right before this to have expected your return
uncertainty and a thousand fearful apprehensions have at
length driven me from my home and brought me to paris
i am come here for satisfaction to my doubts and peace to
my anxious heart wonder not therefore if you find
something more earnest and determined in my proceedings
now than upon ordinary occasions give me i conjure
you give me ease and relief if you are able if not at least
allow me this consolation to know the worst

ability in any degree providing for and superintending
my family it became therefore incumbent upon her to
exert herself for the welfare all had we never fallen
under this astonishing reverse i might have spent my whole
life in daily intercourse with this admirable woman without
becoming acquainted with half the treasures her
mind she was my steward and from the result her
own reflections made the most judicious disposition my
property she was my physician not by administering
medicines to my body but by carefully studying and exerting
herself to remove the distemper mind unfortunately
no distempers are so obstinate as mental ones yet
had my distemper had any lighter source than an upbraiding
conscience i am persuaded the wisdom marguerite
would have banished it she was the instructor my
children her daughters felt no want a governess j and
i am even ready to doubt whether the lessons his mother
did not amply supply to charles his loss an education in
the university paris the love order the activity
the industry the cheerfulness let me say this illustrious
matron became contagious to all the inhabitants my
roof once and again have i stolen a glance at them or
viewed them from a distance busied sometimes gravely
sometimes gaily in the plain and have whispered to my
bursting heart how miserable am i how happy they 
so insurmountable is the barrier that divides innocence
from guilt they may breathe the same air they may
dwell under the same roof j they may be one family and
one blood they may associate with each other every day
and every hour j but they can never assimilate never have
any genuine contact is there a happier family than mine
in all the valley this farfamed republic is there a
family more virtuous or more cultivated with all the refinements
that conduce to the true dignity man i i
only am its burden and its stain the pleasure with
which i am surrounded on every side finds a repellent
quality in my heart that will not suffer its approach to
whatever is connected with me i communicate misfortune
whenever i make my appearance those countenances that
at all other times spoke contentment and hilarity fall into
travels st leon 
sadness like a pestilential wind i appear to breathe
blast to the fruits nature and sickliness to its aspect
marguerite expostulated with me in the most soothing
manner upon the obstinacy my malady my reginald
 my love said she cease to be unhappy or to
reproach yourself you were rash in the experiment you
made upon the resources your family but have you
done us mischief or have you conferred a benefit i more
than half incline to the latter opinion let us at length
dismiss artificial tastes and idle and visionary pursuits
that do not flow in a direct line from any the genuine
principles our nature here we are surrounded with
sources happiness here we may live in true patriarchal
simplicity what is chivalry what are military prowess and
glory believe me they are the passions a mind depraved
that with ambitious refinement seeks to be wise beyond
the dictates sentiment or reason there is no happiness
so solid or so perfect as that which disdains these
refinements you like me are fond the luxuriant and
romantic scenes nature here we are placed in the midst
 them how idle it would be to wish to change our
arbours our verdant lanes and thickets for vaulted roofs
and gloomy halls and massy plate alas reginald it is
i fear too true that the splendour in which we lately lived
has its basis in oppression and that the superfluities 
the rich are a boon extorted from the hunger and misery
 the poor here we see a peasantry more peaceful and
less oppressed than perhaps any other tract the earth
can exhibit they are erect and independent at once
friendly and fearless is not this a refreshing spectacle 
i now begin practically to perceive that the cultivators 
the fields and the vineyards are my brethren and my
sisters and my heart bounds with joy as i feel my relations
to society multiply how cumbrous is magnificence 
the moderate man is the only free he who reduces all
beneath him to a state servitude becomes himself the
slave his establishment and all his domestics to
diminish the cases in which the assistance others is felt
absolutely necessary is the only genuine road to independence
we can now move wherever we please without

waiting the leisure others our simple repasts require
no tedious preparation and do not imprison us in saloons
and eating rooms yet we partake them with a more
genuine appetite and rise from them more truly refreshed
than from the most sumptuous feast i prepare for my
meal hy industry and exercise and when it is over amuse
myself with my children in the fields and the shade
though i love the sight the peasants i would not be a
peasant i would have a larger stock ideas and a
wider field activity i love the sight peasants only
for their accessories or by comparison they are comparatively
more secure than any other large masses men
and the scenes in the midst which they are placed are
delightful to sense but i would not sacrifice in prone
oblivion the best characteristics my nature i put in my
claim for refinements and luxuries but they are the refinements
and purifying intellect and the luxuries 
unjustly simple taste i would incite the whole world if
i knew how to do it to put in a similar claim i would
improve my mind i would enlarge my understanding i
would contribute to the instruction all connected with
me and to the mass human knowledge the pleasures
i would pursue and disseminate though not dependent on
a large property are such as could not be understood by
the rustic and the savage our son bred in these fields
indeed will probably never become a preux chevalier or
figure in the roll military heroes but he may become
something happier and better he may improve his mind
and cultivate his taste he may be the counsellor and protector

in which he resides he may institute in his adoptive
country new defences for liberty new systems public
benefit and new improvements life there is no character
more admirable than the patriotyeoman who unites
with the utmost simplicity garb and manners an understanding
fraught with information and sentiment and a
heart burning with the love mankind such were patricius
and regulus among the ancients and such was
tell the founder the helvetic liberty for my part
i am inclined to be thankful that this unexpected reverse
travels op st leon 
in our circumstances has made me acquainted with new
pleasures and opened to my mind an invaluable lesson
if you could but be prevailed on to enter into our pleasures
to dismiss idle reproaches and pernicious propensities our
happiness would then be complete 
the expostulations marguerite often excited my attention
often my respect and sometimes produced a sort
 imperfect conviction but the conviction was transient
and the feelings i have already described as properly my
own returned when the fresh and vivid impression what
i had heard was gone it was in vain that i heard the
praises simplicity and innocence i was well pleased to
see those who were nearest to me not affecting contentment
but really contented with these things but i could
not be contented for them the lessons my education
had left too deep an impression i could myself have surrendered
my claim to admiration and homage as a penance
for my misdeeds but i could not figure to myself a genuine
satisfaction unaccompanied by these accessories 
and this satisfaction i obstinately and impatiently coveted
for those i loved
chapter viii
while i murmured in bitterness soul at the lowness to
which my family was reduced a still heavier calamity impended
as if in vengeance against the fantastic refinements
 distress over which i brooded
i was wandering as i had often done with a gloomy
and rebellious spirit among the rocks a few miles distant
from the place our habitation it was the middle 
summer the weather had been remarkably fine but i
disdained to allow the gratifications which arise from a pure
atmosphere and a serene sky to find entrance in my soul
my excursions had for some days been incessant and the
sun which matured the corn and blackened the grapes
g 
 travels op st leon
around had imbrowned my visage and boiled in my blood
i drank in fierceness and desperation from the fervour 
his beams one night as in sullen mood i watched his
betting from a point the rock i perceived the clearness
 the day subsiding in a threatening evening the
clouds gathered in the west and as night approached were
overspread with a deep dye the fiercest crimson the
wind rose and during the hours darkness its roaring
were hollow and tempestuous
in the morning the clouds were hurried rapidly along
and the air was changed from a long series sultriness to
a nipping cold this change the atmosphere i disregarded
and pursued my rambles a little before noon
however the air suddenly grew so dark as to produce a
sensation perfectly tremendous i felt as if the darkest
night had never exceeded it the impetuous motion to
which i had been impelled partly by the fever in my blood
and partly by the turbulence the season was suspended
mechanically i looked round me for shelter but i could
ill distinguish the objects that were near me when a flash
 lightning blue and sulphureous came directly in my
face with a brightness that threatened to extinguish the
organ vision the thunder that followed was a
length and loudness to admit no comparison from any
object with which i am acquainted the bursts were so
frequent as almost to confound themselves with each other
at present i thought only myself and the recent habits
 my mind were not calculated to make me peculiarly accessible
to fear i stood awestruck but rather with the awe
that inheres to a cultivated imagination than that which
consists in apprehension i seemed ready to mount amidst
the clouds and penetrate the veil with which nature conceals
her operations i would have plunged into the recesses
in which the storm was engendered and bared my bosom
to the streaming fire meanwhile my thoughts were solemnised
and fixed by observing the diversified dance the
lightnings upon the points the rocks contrasting as they
did in the strongest manner with the darkness in which
the rest the scene was enveloped this added contention
 the elements did not however suspend the raging
travels st leon 
 the wind presently a storm mingled hail and rain
poured from the clouds and was driven with inconceivable
impetuosity the hailstones were so astonishing a magnitude
that before i was aware i was beaten by them to
the ground not daring to attempt to rise again i simply
endeavoured to place myself in such a manner as might best
protect me from their violence i therefore remained prostrate
listening to the force with which they struck upon the
earth and feeling the rebound their blows from different
parts my body
in about twenty minutes the shower abated and in half
an hour was entirely over when i began to move i was
surprised at the sensation soreness which i felt in every
part me i raised myself upon my elbow and saw the
hailstones in some places lying in heaps like hillocks 
ice while in others they had ploughed up the surface and
buried themselves in the earth as i looked further i perceived
immense trees torn from their roots and thrown to
a great distance upon the declivity to the noise that they
made in their descent which must have been astonishingly
great i had been at the time insensible such were the
marks which the tempest had left upon the mountains
in the plain it was still worse i could perceive the soil
for long spaces together converted into a morass the standing
corn beaten down and buried in the mud the vines
torn into a thousand pieces the fruit trees demolished and
even in some places the animals themselves lambs sheep and
cows strewing the fields with their mangled carcasses the
whole hopes the year over which my eyes had glanced a
few minutes before for it was near the period harvest
were converted into the most barren and dreary scene that
any quarter the globe ever witnessed i was mounted
upon a considerable eminence and had an extensive prospect
 this horrible devastation
as i stood gazing in mute astonishment suddenly a fear
came over me that struck dampness to my very heart
what was the situation my own family and their little
remaining property amidst this dreadful ruin i was ina
position where though i nearly faced our habitation a
point the rock intercepted it from my sight the 
travels op st leon
stale was but a small one yet it would require a considerable
circuit to overcome i flew along the path with a
speed that scarcely permitted me to breathe when i had
passed the upper rock the whole extensive scene opened
upon me in an instant what were my sensations when
i perceived that the devastation had been even more complete
here than on the side where i first viewed it my
own cottage in particular which that very morning had
contained and i hoped continued to contain all that was
most dear to my heart seemed to stand an entire solitude
in the midst an immense swamp
marguerite whose idea upon our retreat into switzerland
had been that conforming without reserve to the new
situation that was allotted us had immediately expended
the whole what remained from the shipwreck our fortune
in the purchase the cottage in which we dwelt and
a small portion land around it sufficient with economy
for the support our family under her direction the
hills had been covered with vines and the fields with corn
she had purchased cows to furnish us with milk and sheep
with their fleeces and had formed her establishment upon
the model the swiss peasantry in our neighbourhood
reverting to the simplicity nature appeared to her like
building upon an immovable basis which the clash nations
could not destroy and which was too humble to
fear the treachery courts or the caprice artificial refinement

it was all swept away in a moment our little property
looked as if it had been particularly a mark for the vengeance
 heaven and was more utterly destroyed than any
 the surrounding scenes there was not a tree left
standing there was not a hedge or a limit that remained
within or around it chaos had here resumed his empire
and avenged himself the extraordinary order and beauty
it had lately displayed
i was not overwhelmed with this astonishing spectacle
at that moment nature found her way to my heart and
made a man me i made light these petty accessories
 our existence and the thought my wife and my
children simply as they were in themselves filled every
travels st leon 
avenue my heart for them and them alone i was
interested it was a question for their lives to conceive
what they might personally have sustained was a horror
that seemed to freeze up all the arteries my heart i
descended from the mountain it was with the greatest
difficulty and not without many circuitous deviations that
i proceeded so much was the surface changed and so
deep arid miry the swamps my terror increased as i
passed near to the carcasses the animals who had fallen
victims to this convulsion the elements i observed
with inconceivable alarm that the dead or wounded bodies
 some human beings were intermingled with the brute
destruction i stayed not to enquire whether they were yet
in a state to require assistance the idea that had taken
possession me left no room for the sentiment general
humanity
a little further on i distinctly remarked the body a
woman at some distance from any habitation who appeared
to be dead destroyed by the storm near her lay a female
infant apparently about six years age my attention
was involuntarily arrested i thought louisa that sweet
and amiable child so like her admirable mother the
figure was hers j the colour the robe corresponded to
that in which i last saw her the child was lying on her
face with all the impatient emotions a father i stooped
down i turned over the body that i might identify my
child it was still warm life had scarcely deserted it i
gazed upon the visage it was distorted with the agonies 
death but enough to convince me still remained discernible
it was not louisa 
i can scarcely recollect a period through all the strange
vicissitudes my existence to be compared with this if
i had not felt what i then felt i could never have conceived
it human nature is so constituted that the highest
degree anguish an anguish in which the heart stretches
itself to take in the mightiness its woe can be felt but
for a few instants when the calamity we feared is already
arrived or when the expectation it is so certain as to
shut out hope there seems to be a principle within us by
which we look with misanthropic composure on the state
 travels st leon
to which we are reduced and the heart sullenly contracts
and accommodates itself to what it most abhorred our
hopes wither and our pride our selfcomplacence all that
taught us to rejoice in existence wither along with them
but when hope yet struggles with despair or when the calamity
abruptly announces itself then is the true contention
the tempest and uproar the soul too vast to be endured
this sentiment ineffable wretchedness i experienced
when i stooped down over the body the imaginary
louisa and when i hastened to obtain the certainty which
was all things most terrible to me the termination 
such a moment horror is scarcely less memorable than its
intrinsic greatness in an instant the soul recovers its
balance and the thought is as if it has never been i
clapped my hands in an ecstasy at once joy and astonishment
so sure did i seem to have made myself my misfortune
 i quitted the body with an unburdened heart i
flew towards my home that i might ascertain whether i
was prematurely speaking comfort to my spirit
at length i reached it i saw the happy group assembled
at the door marguerite had entertained the same
terrors for me with which i had myself so lately been impressed
we flew into each other's arms she hid her
face in my neck and sobbed audibly i embraced each 
the children in turn but louisa with the most heartfelt delight
 are you safe papa are you safe my child 
were echoed on every side a spectator unacquainted with
what was passing in our hearts would certainly have stood
astonished to see the transport with which we exulted surrounded
as we were with desolation and ruin
after an interval however we opened our eyes and began
to ruminate upon the new condition in which we were
placed marguerite and myself watched each other's countenances
with anxiety to discover what were likely to bethe
feelings either in this terrible crisis be good
heart my love said marguerite cf do not suffer the accident
which has happened entirely to overcome you there
was a mixed compassion tenderness and anxiety in the
tone voice with which she uttered these words that was
inexpressibly delightful
travels op st leon 
f no marguerite replied i with enthusiastic impetuosity
 i am not cast down i never shah be cast down
again ruin is nothing to me so long as i am surrounded
with you and our dear children i have for some time
been a fool in the midst every real blessing i have
fashioned for myself imaginary evils but my eyes are
now opened how easily is the human mind induced to
forget those benefits with which we are constantly surrounded
and our possession which we regard as secure 
the feelings this morning have awakened me i am
now cured my folly i have learned to value my domestic
blessings as i ought having preserved them i
esteem myself to have lost nothing what are gold and
jewels and precious utensils mere dross and dirt the
human face and the human heart reciprocations kindness
and love and all the nameless sympathies our nature
these are the only objects worth being attached to what
are rank and station the homage the multitude and
the applause fools let me judge for myself the value
 a man is in his intrinsic qualities in that which
power cannot strip him and which adverse fortune cannot
take away that for which he is indebted to circumstances
is mere trapping and tinsel i should love these precious
and ingenuous creatures before me better though in rags
than the children kings in all the pomp ornament i
am proud to be their father whatever may be my personal
faults the world is my debtor for having been the
occasion their existence but they are endeared to me
by a better principle than pride i love them for their qualities
he that loves and is loved by a race pure and
virtuous creatures and that lives continually in the midst 
them is an idiot if he does not think himself happy surrounded
as i am now surrounded i feel as irremovable as
the pillars creation nothing that does not strike at their
existence can affect me with terror
marguerite viewed me with surprise and joy now indeed
said she you are the man i took you for and the
man i shall henceforth be prouder than ever to call my
husband the sorrow in which you lately indulged was
a luxury and we must have done with luxuries you will
be our protector and our support
 travels op st leon
thus saying she took me by the hand and motioned
me to view with her the devastation that had been committed
there was one path i had discovered in which
we might proceed some way with tolerable ease the
scene was terrible we were indeed beggars a whole
province had been destroyed all the corn and the fruits
 the earth most the trees in many places cattle
in some places men persons who had been rich in the
morning saw all the produce their fields annihilated
and were unable even to guess by what process fertility
was to be reestablished the comparatively wealthy
scarcely knew how they were to obtain immediate subsistence
 the humbler class who always live by the expedients
 the day saw nothing before them but the prospect 
perishing with hunger we witnessed in one or two instances
the anguish their despair
our prospect was scarcely in any respect better than
theirs yet we felt differently we were more impressed
with the joy our personal escape as my error respecting
the value externals had been uncommonly great the
sudden revolution opinion i experienced was equally memorable
the survey indeed that we took the general
distress somewhat saddened our hearts but the sadness it
gave was that sobriety not dejection
it was incumbent upon us to make a strict examination
into the amount our property and our immediate resources
 and in this office i united myself with marguerite
not only with a degree cheerfulness and application the
perfect contrast my whole conduct ever since our arrival
in switzerland but which greatly exceeded any thing i had
ever before exhibited in a business this nature we
found that though all our hopes a harvest were annihilated
yet we were not destitute the instant means 
subsistence the resources we possessed whether in money
or provisions that were our dependence till the period when
the new produce should supply their place were uninjured
our implements husbandry remained s before the
land was not impoverished but had rather derived additional
fertility from the effects the storm what we
had lost was chiefly the produce our capital for one year
travels op st leon 
together with a part that capital itself in the live stock
that had been destroyed this was a loss which a certain
degree care and scope in our external circumstances
might easily have enabled us to supply but the principle
 supply was denied us it was with considerable difficulty
that all the economy marguerite had enabled her
to support our family establishment while every thing 
this kind had gone on prosperously such a shock as the
present we were totally disqualified to surmount it compelled
us to a complete revolution our affairs
many indeed our neighbours had scarcely any greater
advantage in their private affairs than ourselves but they
possessed one superiority that proved the greatest importance
in this conjuncture they were natives the state
in which they resided in the cantons switzerland the
destruction the fruits the earth occasioned by inclement
seasons and tempests is by no means unfrequent and
it is therefore customary in plentiful years to lay up corn
in public magazines that the people may not perish in periods
 scarcity these magazines are placed under the
inspection and disposal the magistracy and the inhabitants
looked to them with confidence for the supply their
need no storm however had occurred in the memory 
man so terrible and ruinous as the present and it became
evident that the magazines would prove a resource too
feeble for the extent the emergency
the storm had spread itself over a space many leagues
in circumference not only in the canton soleure but in
the neighbouring cantons particularly that berne the
sufferers in our own canton only amounted to scarcely less
than ten thousand while the women and children for
the most part remained at home the houses having in
general suffered little other damage than the destruction 
their windows the fathers families repaired to the seat
 government to put in their claims for national relief 
and these alone formed an immense troop that threatened
little less than to besiege the public magazines and the magistrates
an accurate investigation was entered into the
losses each it being the purpose government as far as
its power extended not only to supply the people with the
 travels st leon
means immediate subsistence but also by disbursements
from the public treasury to recruit the stock cattle and
to assist every one to return with revived hopes and expectation
to the sphere his industry the purpose was no
doubt benevolent but in the mean time the unhappy
victims found in uncertainty and expectation a real and
corroding anguish
i advanced my claim with the rest but met with a
peremptory refusal the harsh and rigorous answer i
received was that they had not enough for their own
people and could spare nothing to strangers upon this
occasion i was compelled to feel what it was to be an alien
and how different the condition in which i was now placed
from that i had filled in my native country there i had
lived in the midst a people to whom the veneration 
my ancestry and name seemed a part their nature they
had witnessed for several years the respectable manner in
which i lived the virtues marguerite were familiar to
them and they took an interest in every thing that concerned
us a sentiment that confessed us at once for kindred
and patrons it was the turn mind only which is
generated by rank that had compelled us to quit their
vicinity we might have continued in it if not in affluence
at least enjoying the gratifications that arise from general
affection and respect but here we were beheld with an
eye jealousy and distaste we had no prejudice birth
and habit in our favour indeed in the reverse fortune
which had brought us hither marguerite had been less desirous
 obtruding than withdrawing from the public
eye the circumstance our rank we were too recent
inmates to have secured by any thing a personal nature
an advantageous opinion among our neighbours they saw
only a miserable and distracted father a family and a
mother who in spite the simplicity she cultivated sufficiently
evinced that she had been accustomed to a more
elevated situation the prepossessions mankind are
clearly unfavourable to a newcomer an emigrant who has
quitted his former connections and the scenes his youth
they are unavoidably impelled to believe that his taking
up his abode in another country must be owing to a weak
travels op st leon 
and discreditable caprice if it be not owing to something
still more disadvantageous to his character
the calamity therefore which we had suffered in common
with most the inhabitants the province finally
reduced us to the necessity a second emigration the
jealousy with which we were regarded daily became more
visible and threatening though in consequence the
distribution made by order the state the price commodities
was not so much increased as might have been expected
we were considered as interlopers upon the portion
 the natives the sellers could with difficulty be persuaded
to accommodate us and the bystanders treated us
with murmurs and reviling while we were deliberating
what course to pursue in this emergency certain officers 
government one morning entered our habitation producing
an order the senate for our immediate removal out the
territory it is the essence coercive regulations to
expel to imprison and turn out prison the individuals
it is thought proper to control without any care as to the
mischiefs they may suffer and whether they perish under
or survive the evil inflicted on them we were accordingly
allowed only from six in the morning till noon to prepare
for our departure our guards indeed offered to permit
me to remain three days to wind up my affairs upon condition
that my wife and children were instantly removed into
another country as a sort hostages for my own departure
this indulgence however would have been useless in the
present state the country no purchaser could be found
for the little estate i possessed and if there could it must
doubtless have been disposed to great disadvantage at
such an emergency i know not how we should have extricated
ourselves out these difficulties if a member 
the senate who being one my nearest neighbours had
been struck with admiration the virtues marguerite
and with compassion for my family had not paid me a visit
shortly after the arrival the officers and generously offered
to take upon himself the care my property and to
advance me what money might be necessary for my emigration
this offer which at any other time might have
been regarded as purely a matter course under the
 travels st leon
present circumstances when capital was so necessary for
the revival agriculture in the desolated country implied
a liberal and disinterested spirit i accepted the kindness
 my neighbour in both its parts but for the reimbursement
 his loan referred him to the french minister to
the united cantons who under all the circumstances 
the case and taking my estate as security for the money
advanced i thought it reasonable to believe would attend
to my application
chapter ix
my affairs being thus far adjusted i took leave my late
habitation and set off with my wife and children the same
afternoon in the evening we arrived at basle where we
were permitted to remain that night and the next morning
were conducted in form out at the north gate the city
where our attendants quitted us with a fresh prohibition
under the severest penalties if we were found within the
ensuing twelve months in any the territories the
helvetic republic
marguerite and myself had already formed our plan
we began with dismissing both our servants an attendant
was no longer necessary to me nor a nurse for the infant
the suggestion this measure originated in myself my
temper at this time as i have already said underwent a
striking change i was resolved to be happy i was resolved
to be active it was hard to part with persons so
long familiar to us and who appeared rather in the character
 humble friends than domestics but an imperious
necessity demanded it let us said i to marguerite
increase and secure our happiness by diminishing our
wants i will be your husbandman and your labourer
you may depend upon my perseverance my education has
fitted me to endure hardship and fatigue though the hardships
then thought were a different nature you have
ever delighted in active usefulness and will not i know
travels st leon 
repine at this accumulation employment let us accommodate
ourselves to our circumstances our children i
perceive are fated to be peasants and will therefore be
eminently benefited by the example patience and independence
we shall set before them
the next object our plan related to the choice our
future place residence this originated with marguerite
she had heard much the beauty and richness the
country bordering on the lake constance and she
thought that while we denied ourselves expensive pleasures
or rather while they were placed out our reach
there would be a propriety in our procuring for ourselves a
stock those pleasures which would cost us nothing this
was a refinement beyond me and serves to evince the superiority
which marguerite's virtue and force mind still
retained over mine the virtue i had so recently adopted
was a strenuous effort i rather resolved to be happy than
could strictly be said to be happy i loved my children
indeed with an unfeigned affection it was with sincerity
that i professed to prefer them to all earthly possessions
but vanity and ostentation were habits wrought into my
soul and might be said to form part its essence i could
not but by the force constant recollection keep them out
 my wishes and hopes for the future i could not like
marguerite suffer my thoughts as it were to riot and
wanton in the pleasures poverty i could only reconcile
myself to my fate by a sort gloomy firmness the tranquillity
i seemed to have attained was an unnatural state
 my soul to which it was necessary that i should resolutely
hold myself down and from which my thoughts
appeared ever upon the alert to escape bitter experience
had at length taught me a hard lesson and that lesson i was
determined to practise whatever pangs my resignation
might cost me
we proceeded without hesitation in the direction we had
resolved to pursue our whole journey exceeded the space
 forty leagues in extent and the expense necessarily
attendant upon it our family even after its reduction
consisting no less than six persons drained our puiee
 a great part the money which had been supplied to
h 
 travels op st leon
us by the benevolent senator but he had agreed to undertake
the disposing the property we were obliged to leave
behind us and in the mean time if any considerable interval
occurred before that was accomplished to furnish us
with the sums that should be necessary for our subsistence
we placed the utmost reliance upon his fidelity and dismissed
from our minds all anxiety respecting the interval
which our banishment had interposed between us and the
resources necessary for our future settlement
upon our arrival at constance we found a letter from
our friend and though he transmitted to us no fresh supply
the complexion his communication was upon the
whole so encouraging as to determine us with no other delay
than that four days rest from our journey to pass
to the other side the lake and explore for ourselves a
situation suitable to our design the western bank the
lake with the exception only the city constance was
part the pays conquis the united cantons the eastern
bank was a territory dependent on the government that
city it was in this territory that we purposed fixing our
residence and we trusted that our affairs would shortly be
put in a train to enable us to take possession the spot we
should select
thus driven once more into flight by the pressure 
misfortune and compelled to exchange for a land unknown
the scenes which familiarity might have endeared or tender
recollections have made interesting we did not sink under
the weight our adversity this removal was not like
our last switzerland was to none us endeared like the
vales st leon i was not now goaded and tormented
by conscious guilt in the degree i had then been marguerite
was not afflicted by the spectacle my misery
our present change though it might be denominated a fall
was light in comparison with the former the composure
i had gained was new to me and had to my own mind all the
gloss novelty to my companions it proved contagious 
they were astonished at my serenity and drew from it an
unwonted lightness heart
thus circumstanced our tour had its charms for us all 
and there are few passages my life that i have felt more
travels st leon
agreeably the lake itself is uncommonly beautiful and its
environs are fertile and interesting it is surrounded with
an abundance towns villages country seats and monasteries
sufficient to adorn and diversify the view but not to
exclude the sweetness a rural scenery or the grand features
 nature we coasted a considerable part the lake
that we might judge in some degree previously to our landing
which part the shore promised best to yield us the
object we sought the autumn was now commencing the
air was liquid and sweet the foliage was rich and varied 
and the vinecovered hills exhibited a warmth and luxuriance
 colouring that no other object nature or art is
able to cope with surrounded with these objects i sat in
my boat in the midst my children and as i was but
just awakened to an observation their worth and my own
happiness i viewed them with a transport that would be ill
illustrated by being compared with the transport a miser
over his newrecovered treasure from the bowels the
deep
o poverty exclaimed i with elevated and unconquerable
emotion if these are the delights that attend thee willingly
will i resign the pomp palaces and the splendour
 rank to whoever shall deem them worth his acceptance 
henceforth i desire only to dedicate myself to the simplicity
 nature and the genuine sentiments the heart i
will enjoy the beauty scenes cultivated by other hands
than mine or that are spread out before me by the author
 the universe i will sit in the midst my children and
revel in the luxury domestic affections pleasures these
that may be incumbered but cannot be heightened by all
that wealth has in its power to bestow wealth serves no
other purpose than to deprave the soul and adulterate the
fountains genuine delight
such was the spirit exultation with which my mind
was at this time filled i am sensible that it was only
calculated to be transitory i might learn to be contented
i was not formed to be satisfied in obscurity and a low
estate
thus happy and thus amused we spent two days in
coasting the lake landing frequently for the purposes either
ii 
 travels st leon
 variety or enquiry and regularly passing the night on
shore on the evening the second day we were struck
with the neat appearance and pleasing situation a cottage
which we discovered in our rambles about a mile and a
half from the lake we found that it was to be sold and
it seemed precisely to correspond with the wishes we had
formed it was at a considerable distance from any populous
neighbourhood the nearest town being that merspure
the usual residence the bishops constance
which was distant from this spot not less than three leagues
the cottage was situated in a valley the hills being for
the most part crowned with rich and verdant foliage their
sides covered with vineyards and corn and a clear transparent
rivulet murmuring along from east to west in the
distance a few similar cottages discovered themselves and
in front there was an opening between the hills just wide
enough to show us a few sails as they floated along the now
even surface the lake we approached the cottage and
found in it only one person an interesting girl nineteen
who had resided there from her birth and had been employed
for the last four years in attendance upon the closing
scene her mother her mother had been dead only
a few weeks and she was upon the point removing as
she told us to the house a brother the best creature in
the world who was already married and had a family 
children while we were talking with her we perceived a
fine boy about eleven years age skipping along the
meadow he proved to be her nephew and hastened to
say that his father and mr henry were just behind and
would be with her in a few minutes we waited their
arrival and it was easy to see that mr henry was by no
means an indifferent object in the eyes the beautiful orphan
 she had probably conditioned that he should permit
her to remain single as long as she could be any use to
her mother the lovers were well satisfied that the girl's
brother should be taken aside that i might talk over with
him the affair the cottage we made a tour the fields
that were part the property the deceased and the
terms our intended purchase were easily adjusted
though we had now accomplished the immediate purtravels
op st leon 
pose our expedition yet as we had found unusual exhilaration
and sweetness in the objects it presented to us we
came to a resolution continuing it still further and completing
the circuit the lake we were aware that it
would be vain as yet to expect to receive the money requisite
for completing our purchase and as no pleasure
merely in the way relaxation could be more delightful
than that we were now enjoying so was it impossible
that we could fill up our time in a more frugal manner than
in this little voyage our gratification was not less but
more perfect because it consisted simple inartificial
unsought amusements the scenes around us were refreshing
and invigorating they were calculated temporarily at
least to inspire gaiety and youth into decrepitude itself
amidst these scenes we forgot our sorrows they were a
kind stream in which weariness and dejection plunged
their limbs and came forth untired and alert they
awakened in the mind all its most pleasing associations
having already as we believed chosen the place our
future residence we busied ourselves in imagining ah the
accompaniments that would grow out it we determined
that poverty with health would not fail to be attended
with its portion pleasures the scenes nature were
all our own nor could wealth give them a more perfect
or a firmer appropriation the affections and charities 
habitude and consanguinity we trusted we should feel uninterrupted
unincumbered with the ceremonies and trappings
 life and in that rural plainness which is their
genial soil
after a leisurely and delightful voyage six days we
returned to constance we expected to have found on our
return some further intelligence from the beneficent senator
but in this we were disappointed the imagination however
easily suggested to us a variety circumstances that
might have delayed the business he had undertaken and
it was no forced inference to suppose that he deferred writing
because he had nothing important to communicate
at first therefore we suffered little uneasiness from the
delay but as time proceeded and the silence our protector
continued the affair began to assume a more serious
h 
 travels op st leon
aspect the little stock we had brought with us in our
exile was in a rapid progress decay we had managed
it with frugality though not at first with that anxious solicitude
the necessity which we now began to apprehend
we had procured for ourselves two small and inconvenient
apartments in an obscure alley the city constance
we were in the act meditating what steps it would be
necessary to take in this unfortunate emergency when intelligence
was brought us the sudden decease the
person upon whose kindness and exertions we depended
he was succeeded in his estate by his nephew a man 
whom we had heard something during our residence in the
neighbourhood and whose habits we understood to be diametrically
the reverse his predecessor's in short he
had been represented to us as illiberal morose selfish and
litigious a man who having suffered in one part his
life the hardships poverty scrupled no means honourable
or otherwise removing it to the greatest practicable
distance he had already reaped the succession some weeks
when we heard the event that put him in possession 
it and the letters which i had more than once addressed
to our protector had probably fallen into his hands these
circumstances afforded no favourable augury the treatment
we might expect from him the first thing which
seemed proper was to write to him which i accordingly
did i acquainted him with the nature the transaction
between myself and his uncle and signified how necessary
it was that we should come to a conclusion as speedily as
possible i represented to him pathetically the condition
to which i was born and the opulence in which i had
passed many years my life together with the contrast
afforded by the present reduced and urgent circumstances
 my family i entreated him to exert his generosity and
justice in behalf an unfortunate exile whom untoward
events had deprived the power doing justice to himself

to this letter i received no answer uncertain as to the
cause my correspondent's silence or even whether my
letter had been received i wrote again my heart was
wrung with this new adversity i was forbidden under
travels op st leon 
pain perpetual imprisonment to return to the territories
 the republic and i had no friend to solicit in my behalf
in constance i was utterly a stranger in switzerland my
unfortunate habits life the depression and solitude in
which i had been merged deprived me the opportunity
 forming connections the deceased was the only person
who had been disposed to interfere for me it was too
probable that the silence his successor was an indication
 the hostility his views i saw nothing before me but
the prospect my family perishing with want deprived
 their last resource exiles and penniless thus destitute
and forlorn what could we do to what plan could we have
recourse we had not so much as the means providing
ourselves with the implements the humblest labour if
we had could i under my circumstances resolve upon
this could i give up the last slender pittance my
children while there was a chance recovering it and by
surrendering them to the slavery perpetual labour devote
them to the lowest degree ignorance and degradation 
no i still clung to this final hope and was resolved to
undertake any thing however desperate rather than part
with it such were my feelings and in the new letter
which i now despatched i poured out all the anguish 
my soul
a reply to this letter was at length vouchsafed the
heir my protector informed me that he knew nothing 
the business to which i alluded that he had come into
possession the lands i described together with the other
property his late uncle and regarded himself as holding
them by the same tenure that he found in the accounts 
the estate a sum money advanced to me which he might
with the strictest justice regard as a debt and pursue me
for it accordingly he should be liberal enough however
so far to give credit to my story and to consider the sum
in question as advanced upon a pledge land in that case
i might regard myself as sufficiently fortunate in having
obtained even that amount at a time when but for the humanity
or weakness his uncle my estate would not have
sold for a farthing meanwhile the forbearance which he
proffered would he observed depend upon my conduct and
 travels st leon
be retracted if i afforded him cause for resentment he
added that he despised my menaces and commands and
that if i took a single step against him i should find it
terminate in my utter ruin
nothing could be more profligate than the style his
letter but its impotence was equal to its wickedness it
was absurd to threaten to inflict ruin on a man whom ruin
had already overtaken before the letter arrived i had
disbursed the whole sum i brought with me from switzerland
this entire annihilation my resources seemed to
steal on me unperceived finding that all reply to my
importunity was either refused or deferred to an uncertain
period i would willingly at all risks have sought the villain
who thus obdurately devoted me and my family to destruction
and have endeavoured to obtain justice in person but
it was now too late before i felt the case thus desperate
my finances were so far reduced as to make it impracticable
for me to leave my wife and children enough to support
them in my absence even if i had determined myself to
set out upon this perilous expedition penny less i resolved
that if we did perish we would perish together
penury was now advancing upon us with such rapid
strides that the lowest and most scanty resources no longer
admitted neglect had a case thus desperate been encountered
with timely attention it is not improbable that
some the various talents i had acquired in the course 
my education would have furnished me with a means 
subsistence not altogether plebeian or incompetent but
with the uncertainty my situation and totally unaccustomed
as i was to regard my person or mind as a machine
fitted for productive labour i had not looked to this question
till the urgency the case deprived me every advantage
i might otherwise have seized i was glad therefore
to have recourse to menial occupation and sought
employment under the gardener the episcopal palace for
whose service i was sufficiently qualified by my ten years
retreat in the bordelois that i might better adapt myself
to the painful necessity my situation i previously exchanged
some my own clothes for garments more suitable
to the business i now solicited it was not till i had artravels
 st leon 
rived within a very few days to the my resources
that even this expedient hy a sort accident recurred to
my mind marguerite though fully aware the urgency
 the case had as she afterwards told me imposed on
herself a compulsory silence fearing for the inflamed and
irritated frame my mind and aware that the course 
events would ultimately lead me to a point with which she
dreaded to intermeddle this was for her a trying moment
 my lately recovered insanity obliging her to contemplate
in silence our growing distress and to wait the attack
 hunger and want that threatened to destroy us with an
apparent tranquillity and cheerfulness
for me so entire a revolution had taken place in my
sentiments that i spurned with contempt so far as related
to myself that pride rank and romantic gallantry 
honour which had formerly been my idols i submitted
with a sort gloomy contentment to the situation upon
which my destiny drove me i regarded it as the natural
result my former misconduct and derived a sentiment 
ease and relief from thus expiating as it were with the
sweat my brow the temptations to which i had yielded
had i been myself only reduced thus low or had the produce
 my labour been sufficient to purchase competence
for my wife and the means instruction for my family i
can safely affirm that i should have found no consequence
so direct from my own degradation as the means silencing
the reproaches conscience and reconciling me to myself
but when i returned in the evening with the earnings 
my day's labour and found it incompetent to the procuring
for those who depended on me the simplest means subsistence
then indeed my sensations were different my
heart died within me i did not return after the fatigues
 the day which to me who had not been accustomed to
unremitted labour and who now began to feel that i was
not so young as i had been at the siege pavia were extremely
trying i did not return i say to a night 
repose i became a very woman when i looked forward
and endeavoured to picture to myself the future situation 
my family i watered my pillow with my tears often
when i imagined that my whole family were asleep i gave
 travels st leon
vent to my perturbed and distracted mind in groans 
marguerite would sometimes overhear me and with the
gentlest suggestions her admirable mind would endeavour
to soothe my thoughts to peace for the present as
i have said my earnings were incompetent and we found
it necessary to supply the deficiency by the sale the few
garments not in immediate use that we still possessed
what then would be the case when these were gone and
when in addition to this it would be necessary to purchase
not only food to eat and a roof to shelter but also
clothes to cover us 
chapter x
these deficiencies i anxiously anticipated but there was
another evil upon which i had not calculated that was still
hearer and more overwhelming the mode life in which
i was now engaged so different from any thing to which i
had been accustomed excessive fatigue together with the
occasional heat the weather the uneasiness my mind
and the sleeplessness my nights all combined to throw
me into a fever which though it did not last long had
raged so furiously during the period its continuance as
to leave me in a state the most complete debility while
the disorder was upon me i was sensible my danger 
and as the brilliant and consolatory prospects life seemed
for ever closed upon me i at first regarded my approaching
dissolution with complacency and longed to be released
from a series woes in which i had been originally involved
by my own folly this frame mind however
was no great duration the more nearly i contemplated
the idea separation from those i loved the smaller was
my resignation i was unwilling to quit those dear objects
by which i still held to this mortal scene i shrunk with
aversion from that barrier which separates us from all that
is new mysterious and strange another train ideas
succeeded this and i began to despise myself for my impa
travels st leon
thence and cowardice it was by my vices that my family
was involved in a long train misfortunes could i shrink
from partaking what i had not feared to create the
greater were the adversities for which they were reserved
the more ought i to desire to suffer with them i had
already committed the evil in what remained it was reasonable
to suppose i should prove their benefactor and
not their foe it was incumbent on me to soothe and to
animate them to enrich their minds with cheerfulness and
courage and to set before them an example philosophy
and patience by my faculties industry i was their
principal hope and whatever we might suffer combined
it was probable their sufferings would be infinitely greater
if deprived my assistance these reflections gave me
energy and it seemed as if the resolute predilection i had
conceived for life contributed much to my recovery
one thing which strongly confirmed the change my
mind underwent in this respect was a conversation that
i overheard at a time when i was supposed to be completely
in a state insensibility but when though i was too
much reduced to give almost any tokens life my faculties
 hearing and understanding what passed around me were
entire charles came up to my bedside laid his hand
upon mine as if to feel the state the skin and with a
handkerchief that was near wiped away the moisture that
bedewed my face he had been fitted for many nurselike
offices by the unwearied attention he had exerted towards
me in the paroxysm my insanity having finished his
task he withdrew from the bed and burst into tears his
mother came up to him drew him to the furthest part 
the room and in a low voice began the conversation
do my dear boy go down stairs and get yourself
something to eat you see your papa is quiet now
i am afraid that will not last long and then he will be
so restless and toss about so it is dreadful to see him
i will watch charles and let you know
indeed mamma i cannot eat now i will by and
by
you must try to eat charles or else you will make
yourself quite ill if you were ill too it would be more
than i could support
 travels st leon
i will not be ill mamma i assure you i will not
but besides that i have no stomach i cannot bear to eat
when there is hardly enough for my sisters
eat boy do not trouble yourself about that we
shall get more when that is gone god is good and will
take care us
i know that god is good but for all that one must
not expect to have every thing one wishes though god
is good there are dreadful misfortunes in the world and i
suppose we shall have our share them
come charles though you are but a boy you are the
best boy in the world you are now almost my only
comfort but you will not be able to comfort me if you do
not take care yourself
dear mamma do you know mamma i heard that
naughty man below stairs count up last night how much
rent you owed him for and swear you should not stay any
longer if you did not pay him if i were a little bigger i
would talk to him so that he should not dare to insult us in
our distress but not being big enough i opened the
door and went into the room and begged him for god's
sake not to add to your distress and though he is so
ugly i took hold his hand and kissed it but it felt
like iron which put me in mind his iron heart and
i cried ready to burst with mortification ha did not say
hardly a word
he must be paid charles he shall be paid
 do you know mamma as soon as i left him i went
to the bishop's gardens and spoke to the gardener i
asked him if he had heard that my papa was ill and he
said he had he said too he was very sorry and wanted
to know what hand we made it for want the wages i
told him we were sadly off and the man the house had
just been affronting me about his rent but said i cannot
you give me something to do to weed or to rake i
can dig a little too and scatter seed he asked if i knew
weeds from flowers oh that i do said i well then
said he there is not much you can do but you are a good
boy and i will put you on the bishop's list but now
mamma i have not the heart to work till i see whether
papa will get well again
travels st leon ill
while poor charles told his artless tale marguerite wept
over him and kissed him again and again she called him
the best child in the world and said that if i were hut so
fortunate as to recover with such a husband and such a son
she should yet be the happiest women
oh my poor father exclaimed charles ever
since the great hailstorm i have every hour loved him
better than before i thought that was impossible but he is
so gentle so kind so goodhumoured and so patient i
loved him when he was harsh and when he was out his
mind but nothing so well then as i have done since
people that are kind and smile always do one good but
nobody's smiles are like my father's it makes me cry
with joy sometimes when i do but think them pray
papa added he coming up to the bedside and whispering
yet with a hurried and passionate accent get well 
do but get well and we will be so happy never was
there a family so happy or so loving as we will be i
while he spoke thus i endeavoured to put out my hand
but i could not i endeavoured to smile but i was unable 
my heart was in a feeble yet soothing tranquillity the
accents love i had heard dwelt upon my memory they
had talked distress but the sentiment love was uppermost
in my recollection i was too weak frame to suffer
intellectual distress no accents but those which carried
balm to my spirit seemed capable resting upon my ear
from this hour i regularly grew better and as i recovered
seemed to feel more and more vividly how enviable
it was to be the head a loving and harmonious
family
my recovery however was exceedingly slow and it was
several weeks before i had so far recruited my strength as
to be capable my ordinary occupations in the meantime
the pecuniary difficulties to which we were exposed
hourly increased and the cheerful but insignificant labours
 charles could contribute little to the support a family
the melancholy nature our situation might perhaps
have been expected to prevent the restoration my health
at first however it had not that effect the debilitated
state my animal functions led me by a sort irresisu
 travels op st leon
able instinct to reject ideas and reflections which i thou
then have been unable to endure i saw the anxiety and
affection my family and i was comforted i saw the
smiles marguerite and i seemed insensible to the languor
the saddened cheerfulness they expressed i did not
perceive that while i was provided with every thing necessary
in my condition my family were in want the very
bread that should sustain existence
my health in the mean time improved and my perceptions
became proportionably clearer symptoms desolation
and famine though as much as possible covered from
my sight obtruded themselves and were remarked one
day in particular i observed various tokens this nature in
silence and with that sort bewildered understanding
which at once labours for comprehension and resists belief
the day closed and what i had perceived pressed upon my
mind and excluded sleep now for the first time i exerted
myself to recollect in a methodical way the state 
my affairs for the severity my illness had at length
succeeded to banish from me all ideas and feelings but what
related to the sensations it produced and to the objects
around me and it was not without effort that i could once
more fully call to mind the scenes in which i had been
engaged the truth then by regular degrees rose completely
to view and i began to be astonished that my poor
wife and children had been able in any manner to get
through the horrible evils to which they must have been
exposed this thought i revolved in my mind for near
two hours and the longer i dwelt upon it the more perturbed
and restless i grew at length it became impossible
for me to hold my contemplations pent up in my own bosom
i turned to marguerite and asked her whether she
were asleep
she answered in the negative she had been remarking
my restlessness and tenderly enquired respecting its
cause
how long said i is it since i was taken with the
fever 
a month tomorrow replied she it was the
most malignant and distressing kind while it lasted and
travels st leon 
i did not expect you to live but ithas left you a fortnight
 and i hope reginald you find yourself getting
strong again
 and so we are here in constance and we have left
switzerland 
 three months my love 
i remember very well the letter we received from monsieur
grimseld has any further intelligence reached us from
that quarter 
none
none no supply any kind has reached you 
my dear reginald talk something else you will
soon i hope be well our children are all alive and the
calamity that has not succeeded to separate us or to diminish
our circle love even by a single member we will
learn to bear let us fix our attention on the better prospects
that open before us 
stay marguerite i have other questions to ask before
you require me to bear the calamities that have overtaken
us let me understand what these calamities are
while we waited for intelligence from switzerland we expended
the whole sum that we brought with us and i was
obliged to hire myself to the episcopal gardener for bread 
was it not so 
indeed reginald you are to blame pray question
me no further 
f this was our condition some time ago and now fora
month past i have been incapable labour marguerite
what have you done 
indeed my love i have been too anxious for you to
think much any thing else we had still some things
you know that we could contrive to do without and those
i have sold charles too our excellenthearted son has
lately hired himself to the gardener and has every night
brought us home a little though it was but little
 i am sorry you must wait but
you must learn to have patience
do you know papa i walked in the garden before
breakfast and so not thinking any thing i came to
the summerhouse and i tried to open the door but i
could not j found it was locked so i thought julia
was there and i knocked and called julia but nobody
answered so then i knew julia was not there for i was
sure she would have opened the door so i climbed upon
the stump the peartree and tried to look in at the window
 but the shutters were shut and i could not get to see
over the top them and i walked all round the summerhouse
and all the shutters were shut papa i wish
you would not let a man get into the summerhouse who
 travels st leon
shuts all the shutters and locks the door you always
used to let me go into every room i liked and do you
know i think none but bad people lock and bolt themselves
up so it puts mind the giants with their drawbridges
and their pitfalls i shall be quite afraid this frightful old
man
this prattle the child was nothing yet it increased
the embarrassment my situation and made the peculiarity
 the case more conspicuous finding her pertinacious
in insisting upon a topic that was disagreeable tome
her mother called her from me and put her upon some
occupation that served to divert her attention i felt like
a person that was guilty some crime and this consideration
and kindness my wife when i seemed to myself to
deserve her reproach had not the power to calm my
uneasiness
these little occurrences appeared like the beginning 
a separation interests and estrangement hearts i
tasked myself severely i summoned the whole force 
my mind that i might strictly consider what it was in
which i was about to engage if this slight and casual
hint a secret is felt by both marguerite and myself with
so much uneasiness and embarrassment what will be our
situation if i go on to accept the stranger's confidence and
become the depository an arcanum so important as he
represents his to be he declares himself able to bestow
upon me the highest opulence what will be the feelings 
my wife and children when they see my condition suddenly
changed from its present humble appearance to splendour
and wealth without being able to assign the source this
extraordinary accession 
it is difficult to conceive a family picture more enviable
that than to which i was now continually present and 
which i formed a part we had been happy on the banks
 the garonne and we had pictured to ourselves a plan 
happiness immediately on our arrival in the city constance
but these were little and imperfect compared with
what i now enjoyed in the first situation my children
were infants and in the second the eldest was but ten years
 age the mother was now thirtyfive and she had
travels st leon 
lost in my eyes at least none her personal attractions
her intellectual accomplishments were much greater than
ever her understanding was matured her judgment decided
her experience more comprehensive as she had a
greater compass materials to work upon her fancy was
more playful her conversation richer and her reflections
more amusing and profound the matron character she
had acquired had had no other effect on her feelings than
to render them more deep more true and magnetical her
disposition was more entirely affectionate than it had been
even in the first year our cohabitation her attachment
to her children was exemplary and her vigilance uninterrupted
 and for myself she was accustomed in all that
related to our mutual love to enter into my sentiments and
inclinations with so just a tone equality and kindness
that we seemed to be two bodies animated by a single soul
if the mother were improved the children were still more
improved in their early years we are attached to our offspring
merely because they are ours and in a way that has
led superficial speculators to consider the attachment less as
the necessary operation a sensible and conscious mind
than as a wise provision nature for the perpetuation 
the species but as they grow up the case is different
our partiality is then confirmed or diminished by qualities
visible to an impartial bystander as really as to ourselves
they then cease to be merely the objects our solicitude
and become our companions the partners our sentiments
and the counsellors our undertakings such at least was
my case at the present period charles who was now
sixteen was manly beyond his years while the native fire
 his disposition was tempered by adversity by an humble
situation and by the ardour filial and fraternal affection
julia who was two years younger became daily more interesting
by the mildness her disposition and the tenderness
 her sensibility louisa was only twelve but as
she was extremely notable and had an uncommonly quick
and accurate spirit imitation she rendered herself exceedingly
useful to her mother marguerite the plaything
and amusement the family had as i have said just
completed the eighth year her age

one exquisite source gratification when it is not a
source uneasiness to speak from my own experience
which a parent finds in the society his children is their
individuality they are not puppets moved with wires
and to be played on at will almost from the hour their
birth they have a will their own to be consulted and
negotiated with we may say to them as adam to the
general mother mankind but now thou wert flesh

and reason a living being to be regarded with attention
and deference to be courted not compelled susceptible 
the various catalogue human passions capable resentment
and gratitude indignation and love perverseness
and submission it is because thou art thus
formed that i love thee i cannot be interested about objects
inanimate or brute i require a somewhat that shall
exercise my judgment and awaken my moral feelings it
is necessary to me to approve myself and be approved by
another i rejoice to stand before you at once the defendant
and the judge i rejoice in the restraint to which your
independent character subjects me and it will be my pride
to cultivate that independence in your mind i would negotiate
for your affections and confidence and not be loved
by you but in proportion as i shall have done something
to deserve it i could not congratulate myself upon your
correspondence to my wishes if it had not been in your
power to withhold it
while i indulge this vein reflection i seem again to
see my family as they surrounded me in the year fifteen
hundred and fortyfour marguerite the partner my life
charles the brother my cares the blooming julia the
sage louisa and the playful cadette the family how
richly furnished how cheerful how heart reviving appeared
to me the apartment in which they were assembled i
dwell upon the image with fond affection and lingering delight
where are they now how has all this happiness
been maliciously undermined and irrevocably destroyed 
to look back on it it seems like the idle fabric a dream
i awake and find myself alone were there really such
travels st leon 
persons where are they dispersed whither are they
gone oh miserable solitude and desertion to which i
have so long been condemned i see nothing around me
but speechless walls or human faces that say as little to my
heart as the walls themselves how palsied is my soul 
how withered my affections but i will not anticipate
chapter xii
i carried food to the stranger as occasion required in the
course the day he seemed indisposed to speak and we
exchanged scarcely more than two or three words the
next morning was the implied time to which the question
 his confidence was deferred and i went to him with the
full resolution refusing it whether it were that he
discerned this resolution in my countenance or that in the
interval that elapsed he had formed a meaner opinion 
my character and thought me unfit for the purposes he intended
i should answer certain it is that he anticipated me
at the same time he magnified the importance the gifts
he had to communicate he expressed himself astonished
at the precipitateness his yesterday's conduct it was
not till after much trial and long probation that he could
choose himself a confidant i was not at present fit for the
character nor perhaps ever should be the talent he possessed
was one upon which the fate nations and the
human species might be made to depend god had given
it for the best and highest purposes and the vessel in
which it was deposited must be purified from the alloy 
human frailty it might be abused and applied to the
most atrocious designs it might blind the understanding

might overturn kingdoms and change the whole order 
human society into anarchy and barbarism it might
render its possessor the universal plague or the universal
tyrant mankind
go st leon added the stranger you are not quae

travels op st leon
lifted for so important a trust you are not yet purged 
imbecility and weakness though you have passed through
much and had considerable experience you are yet a child
i had heard your history and expected to find you a different
man go and learn to know yourself for what you are
frivolous and insignificant worthy to have been born a
peasant and not fitted to adorn the rolls chivalry or the
rank to which you were destined 
there was something so impressive in the rebuke and
contempt this venerable sage that made it impossible to
contend with them never was there a man more singular
and in whom were united greater apparent contradictions
observe him in a quiet and unanimated moment you might
almost take him for a common beggar a poor miserable
wretch in whom life lingered and insensate stupidity
reigned but when his soul was touched in any those
points on which it was most alive he rose at once and appeared
a giant his voice was the voice thunder and
rolling in a rich and sublime swell it arrested and stilled
while it withered all the nerves the soul his eyebeam
sat upon your countenance and seemed to look through you
you wished to escape from its penetrating power but you
had not the strength to move i began to feel as if it were
some mysterious and superior being in human form and
not a mortal with whom i was concerned
what a strange and contradictory being is man i had
gone to the summerhouse this morning with a firm resolution
to refuse the gifts and the communication the
stranger i felt as if lightened from a burthen which the
whole preceding day had oppressed me while i formed this
resolution i was cheerful and conscious rectitude and
strength mind how cheaply we prize a gift which we
imagine to be already in our power with what philosophical
indifference do we turn it on every side depreciate
its worth magnify its disadvantages and then pique ourselves
upon the sobriety and justice the estimate we have
made thus it was with me in the present transaction 
but when i had received the check the stranger and
saw the proposed benefit removed to a vast and uncertain
distance then it resumed all its charms then the contrast
travels st leon 
 wealth and poverty flashed full upon my soul before
i had questioned the reality the stranger's pretensions
and considered whether he might not be an artful impostor
but now all was clearness and certainty the advantages 
wealth passed in full review before my roused imagination
i saw horses palaces and their furniture i saw the splendour
 exhibition and the trains attendants objects
which had been for ever dear to my puerile imagination i
contemplated the honour love obedience troops friends
which are so apt to attend upon wealth when disbursed
with a moderate degree dignity and munificence when
i compared this with my present poverty and desertion the
meanness our appearance our daily labours the danger
that an untoward accident might sink us in the deepest distress
and the hopelessness that my son or his posterity
should ever rise to that honour and distinction to which they
had once been destined the effect was too powerful
another feeling came still further in aid this it was
the humiliating impression which the stranger had left upon
my mind this seemed to be his great art if in reality his
conduct is to be imputed to art there is no enemy to
virtue so fatal as a sense degradation selfapplause is
our principal support in every liberal and elevated act 
virtue if this ally can be turned against us if we can be
made to ascribe baseness effeminacy want spirit and
adventure to our virtuous resolutions we shall then indeed
feel ourselves shaken this was precisely my situation 
the figure i made in my own eyes was mean i was impatient
 my degradation i believed that i had shown
myself uxorious and effeminate at a time that must have
roused in me the spirit a man if there had been a spark
 manly spirit latent in my breast this impatience cooperated
with the temptations the stranger and made me
anxious to possess what he offered to my acceptance
i reasoned thus with myself what excites my scruples is
simply the idea having one single secret from my wife
and family this scruple is created by the singular and
unprecedented confidence in which we have been accustomed
to live other men have their secrets nor do they
find their domestic tranquillity broken by that circumstance
 travels st leon
the merchant does not call his wife into consultation upon
his ventures the statesman does not unfold to her his policy
and his projects the warrior does not take her advice upon
the plan his campaign the poet does not concert with
her his flights and his episodes to other men the domestic
scene is the relaxation their cares when they enter it
they dismiss the business the day and call another cause
i only have concentrated in it the whole my existence
by this means i have extinguished in myself the true energy
 the human character a man can never be respectable
in the eyes the world or in his own except so far as he
stands by himself and is truly independent he may have
friends he may have domestic connections but he must
not in these connections lose his individuality nothing
truly great was ever achieved that was not executed or
planned in solitary seclusion
but if these reasons are sufficient to prove that the plan
i have lately pursued is fundamentally wrong how much
more will the importance what is proposed by the stranger
plead my excuse for deviating from it how bitterly have
i lamented the degradation my family shall i not
seize this opportunity reinstalling them in their hereditary
honours i deemed the ruin i had brought upon
them irreparable shall i not embrace the occasion 
atoning for my fault no man despises wealth who fully
understands the advantages it confers does it not confer the
means cultivating our powers does it not open to us
the career honour which is shut against the unknown
and obscure does it not conciliate the prepossessions 
mankind and gain for us an indulgent and liberal construction
 does it not inspire us with graceful confidence
and animate us to generous adventure the poor man is
denied every advantage education and wears out his life
in labour and ignorance from offices trust from opportunities
 distinction he is ignominiously thrust aside 
and though he should sacrifice his life for the public cause
he dies unhonoured and unknown if by any accident he
comes into possession those qualities which when discerned
and acknowledged command the applause mankind
who will listen to him his appearance is mean 
travels st leon 
and the fastidious auditor turns from him ere half his words
are uttered he has no equipage and attendants no one
to blow the trumpet before him and proclaim his rank 
how can he propose any thing that shall be worthy attention
 aware the prepossession mankind in this
respect he is alarmed and overwhelmed with confusion
before he opens his lips filled with the conscience his
worth he anticipates the unmerited contempt that is prepared
to oppress him and his very heart dies within him
add to these circumstances the constitution our nature
the various pleasures which it is adapted to partake and
how many these pleasures it is in the power wealth to
procure yes an object like this will sufficiently apologise forme
to those for whose sake alone it was estimable in my sight
it is indeed nothing but our poverty and the lowness 
our station that have thus produced in us an habitual and
unreserved communication sentiments wealth would
to a certain degree destroy our contact and take off the
wonder that we had each our thoughts that were not put
into the common stock
these considerations decided my choice i was not indeed
without some variations mind and some compunction
 heart for the resolution i had espoused the longer
the stranger remained with me the more evident it was
that there was something mysterious between us and the
unreserved affection and union that had lately reigned under
my roof suffered materially the effects it the stranger
had been led to my cottage in the first instance by the entire
solitude in which it was placed there was nothing
about which he was so solicitous as concealment the most
atrocious criminal could not be more alarmed at the idea 
being discovered i was unable to account for this but i was
now too anxious for his stay and the promised reward not
to be alert in gratifying all his wishes the most inviolable
secresy therefore was enjoined to the whole family and
the younger branches it particularly the little marguerite
it was necessary to keep almost immured to prevent the
danger their reporting any thing out the house that
might be displeasing to the stranger and fatal to my expectations
upon the whole my situation was eminently
 travels op st leon
an uneasy one no experiment can be more precarious than
that a halfconfidence and nothing but the sincere affection
that was entertained for me could have rendered it
successful in this instance my family felt that they were
trusted by me only in points where it was impossible to
avoid it and that i was not therefore properly entitled to
their cooperation i was conscious ingratitude in
making them no return for their fidelity they kept my
secret because they were solicitous to oblige me not from
any conviction that they were conferring on me a benefit 
but on the contrary suspecting that the object as to which
they were blindly assisting me would prove injurious tome
as well as to themselves
the health the stranger visibly declined but this was
a circumstance which he evidently regarded with complacency
it was the only source consolation which he
appeared susceptible his mind was torn with painful remembrances
and agitated with terrible forebodings he
abhorred solitude and yet found no consolation in society
i could not be much with him my duty to my family
who were principally supported by my labour was a call
too imperious to be neglected even when i was with him
he commonly testified no desire for conversation stay
with me he was accustomed to say give me as much 
your time as you can but do not talk upon these occasions
he would sit sometimes with his arms folded and
with the most melancholy expression imaginable he would
then knit his brows wring his hands with a sadness that
might have excited pity in the hardest breast or with both
hands closed the one clasping the other strike himself impatiently
on the forehead at other times he would rise
from his seat pace the room with hurried and unquiet
steps and then again throw himself on his couch in the
greatest agitation his features were often convulsed with
agony often have i wiped away the sweat which would
suddenly burst out in large drops on his forehead at
those seasons he would continually mutter words to himself
the sense which it was impossible for me to collect i
could perceive however that he often repeated the names
 clara henry a wife a friend a friend 
travels st leon
and then he would groan as if his heart were bursting
sometimes in the midst these recollections he would
pass the back his hand over his eyes and then looking
at it shaking his head and biting his under lip exclaim
with a piteous accent dry dry all the moisture 
my frame is perished then as if recovering himself he
would cry with a startled and terrified voice who is there
st leon come to me let me feel that there is a
human being near me i often call for you but i find
myself alone deserted friendless friendless 
at times when his recollection was more complete he
would say i know i tire you why should i tire you 
what gratification can it be to me to occasion emotions 
disgust upon these occasions i endeavoured to soothe
him and assured him i found pleasure in administering to
his relief but he replied no no do not flatter me 
it is long since i have heard the voice flattery i never
loved it no i know i am precluded from ever exciting
friendship or sympathy why am i hot dead why do i
live a burthen to myself useful to none my secret i
could almost resolve should die with me but you have
earned and you shall receive it
the stranger was not always in this state extreme anguish
nor always indisposed to converse he had lucid
intervals and could beguile the sorrow his heart with
social communication we sometimes talked various
sciences and branches learning he appeared to be well
informed in them all his observations were ingenious 
his language copious his illustrations fanciful and picturesque
 his manner bold and penetrating it was easy
to observe in him the marks a vigorous and masculine
genius sometimes we discussed the events at that time
going on in the world when we discoursed events that
had passed and persons that had died more than a century
before the stranger often spoke them in a manner as if
he had been an eyewitness and directly acquainted with
the objects our discourse this i ascribed to the vividness
 his conceptions and the animation his language
he however often checked himself in this peculiarity and
always carefully avoided what could lead to any thing per
 travels op st leon
sonal to himself i described to him the scenes my youth
and related my subsequent history he on his part was
invincibly silent on every circumstance his country his
family and his adventures
the longer i was acquainted with him the more my curiosity
grew i was restless and impatient to learn something
respecting a man who thus wrapped himself up in
mystery and reserve often i threw out as it were a line
by which to fathom his secret i talked various countries
i mentioned different kinds calamities and even crimes
that by some incidental allusion i might discover at unawares
his country his connections or the nature his
story when any thing that offered seemed to lead to the
desired point i doubled my questions and endeavoured to
construct them with the skill a crafty litigant in a court
 justice there were some subjects the very mention 
which gave him uneasiness and upon which he immediately
silenced me but these were not themselves enough to
afford me a clue or to furnish materials out which forme
to construct the history the stranger he did not
always perceive the drift my questions and snares but
ashen he did he generally became loud resentful and
furious there was nothing else that so completely roused
his indignation
st leon said he to me one day silence this inquisitive
temper yours check your rash and rude curiosity
the only secret i have that can be any importance
to you you shall one day know but my country my
family my adventures i have once told you and i tell
you again you shall never know that knowledge can be
 moment to no one and it shall never be disclosed when
this heart ceases to beat that tale shall cease to have a place
on the face the earth why should my distresses and
disgraces be published to any one is it not enough that
they have lacerated my bosom that they have deprived me
 friends that they have visited me with every adversity
and every anguish that they have bowed me down to the
earth that they have made thought and remembrance and
life itself a burthen too heavy to be borne your present
injudicious conduct if persisted in will have the effect 
travels op st leon 
driving me from your roof turning me once more upon
the world upon that world that i hate upon that world
whose bruises and ill treatment i feel in every fibre my
frame j exposing me again to fresh persecutions and
causing me to perish miserably in a dungeon or die upon
a scaffold spare me my generous host i know you are
capable generosity indeed i have endured enough to
satiate the rage malice itself you see what i suffer from
the rage and tempest my own thoughts even without the
assistance any external foe let me die in that degree 
tranquillity i am able to attain i will not trouble you long
at another time he addressed me in a different style
 you see st leon that the anguish mind i endure is
such as is ordinarily attributed to the recollection great
crimes and you have very probably conjectured that in my
case it arises from the same source if you have i forgive
you but i assure you that you are mistaken take from
yourself that uneasiness if it has ever visited you you
are not giving sanctuary to a villain i am innocent i
can take no crime to my charge i have suffered more
almost than man ever suffered but i have sinned little
the cause my uneasiness and prime source all my
misfortunes i dare not disclose to you be contented with
the plan my conduct i have digested my purpose i
have determined where to speak and where to be silent
the more i saw this man the more strange and unaccountable
appeared to me every thing that related to him
why was he so poor possessing as he pretended inexhaustible
wealth why was he unhappy with so great
talents and genius and such various information why
was he friendless being as he solemnly assured me so perfectly
innocent and consequence so respectable that
he was an impostor every thing that i saw him forbade
me to believe his sorrows were too profound and excruciating
for it to be possible for me to rank them among
the actions that a man may play the greatness his
powers the dignity his carriage the irresistible appearance
 sincerity that sparkled in his eye and modulated
his voice fully convinced me that he really was what he
pretended to be i had heard men who under the prest
travels op st leon
hence alchemy fastened themselves upon persons possessing
sums money and beguiling them with a delusive
expectation wealth reduced them to beggary and ruin
one such person i had had a brief connection with during
my residence in the bordelois though finding the incident
by no means essential to the progress my history i have
passed it over together with many others in silence but
nothing could be more unlike than that man and the person
respecting whom i was now concerned in reality i possessed
at that time if i may be allowed to say so a more
than common insight into the characters mankind so as
to be little likely except under the tyranny passion as
in the instance gaming to be made the prey imposition
i had studied my species as it exhibits itself in history
and had mixed with it in various scenes and under
dissimilar aspects i had accordingly in the transaction i
have just alluded to soon detected the plans the villain
who expected to delude me but what could be the purpose
 the stranger in this respect the pretended alchemist
in france had obtained a certain sum money me
and demanded more the stranger never made such a demand
 me and perfectly knew that even if i had been
inclined i was not able to supply him the alchemist
had amused me with descriptions various processes for
the transmutation metals had exhibited his crucibles and
retorts and employed a sort dramatic coup d'aeil for the
purpose awakening my curiosity and stimulating my
passions the stranger had simply stated in the plainest
and most direct manner that it was in his power to enrich
me but had been silent as to the manner producing the
wealth he promised and had abstained from every effort to
intoxicate my mind i felt therefore in this instance the
effect that without being able to solve the difficulties and
contrarieties that hung about him i yet believed his assertions
 nor was the inscrutability his history and his motives
capable shaking my confidence
one day during the period his concealment certain
officers the bishop constance accompanied by a foreigner
in a neapolitan habit came to my house and as
it proved with the express purpose searching for the
travels st leon 
man who had put himself under my protection charles
and myself were at work in the fields within sight the
lake their appearance first caught the attention charles
as they approached the shore and he enquired me respecting
the habit the foreigner which was different from
any he had been accustomed to see while we were yet
speaking i observed in them an intention to land within
sight my cottage this was an uncommon circumstance
our privacy was rarely invaded and we lived almost as
much out the world as we should have done in the remotest
island the atlantic ocean i reasoned in my own
mind upon their appearance they had little resemblance to
a party pleasure the habit the officers justice i
was perfectly acquainted with and the suspicion the real
nature their errand immediately darted on my thoughts
without saying a word to charles on the subject i hastened
with all the speed i could exert to the apartment the
stranger and acquainted him with what i had seen he
concurred with me in the ideas i had formed and appeared
much shocked at the intelligence there was however
no time to be lost and after having for a moment given
vent to an anguish which was too powerful to be suppressed
he withdrew as hastily as he could from the summerhouse
and betook himself to the woods he recommended to me
to leave him telling me that he could conceal himself most
effectually alone and observing that it would be necessary
for me to meet the officers and endeavour as much as possible
to remove their suspicions
accordingly as soon as he was gone i threw open the
windows the summerhouse removed the shutters and
took from it as effectually as i could all appearance 
having served as a place concealment this was a precaution
which the stranger had on a former occasion recommended
to me it fortunately happened that julia and
the little marguerite were gone out together in the fields on
the eastern side my cottage otherwise infallibly the child
foy her innocent prattle and perhaps julia by the apprehensive
sensibility her temper would have betrayed our
secret or at least have suggested to the officers a feeling as
if by a longer stay and a more diligent search they might
l
 travels st leon
possibly succeed in the object their expedition as it
was i received them at the door and learned from their
own mouths the nature their errand charles whom
they had crossed in the fields they had simply asked whether
they were right as to the name the person who was proprietor
 the cottage before them they described to me
with great accuracy the appearance the stranger and insisted
that he had been an inhabitant my cottage they
told me they were well informed that the summerhouse
in my garden had carefully been shut up for more than a
month past and that some person had been concealed there
i was interested in the distress the stranger i was impressed
with the dignity his character i implicitly confided
in his assertions innocence and the unjust persecution
that he suffered i was not insensible to the proposed
reward the realising which probably depended on his
safety but most all i considered my honour as pledged
for the protection the man who had thus cast himself
upon my fidelity and believed that i should be everlastingly
disgraced if he suffered any evil through treachery or neglect
on my part i therefore answered confidently to
the officers that they were misinformed and offered to conduct
them over every part my house and demesnes that
they might satisfy themselves by inspection that there was
no person concealed any where within my possessions i
should have been better pleased openly to have defied their
interrogatories and to have asked them whether allowing
their suspicions to be just they were entitled to believe that
i was such a villain as to betray a man who had thrown
himself upon my generosity but though this conduct
would have had a greater appearance gallantry i believed
it would have less the reality as it would have strengthened
their idea my participation and increased the danger
 the person i was bound to protect
they accepted my offer submitting to their search
and made a strict examination every place about my habitation
in which the stranger could be concealed disappointed
here they endeavoured by threats to discover
whether i was able to give them any information to these
i calmly answered that they had mistaken my character 
travels st leon 
that though i was a poor man i had not forgotten that i
was noble that they were already in possession my spontaneous
answer to their enquiries and that in no case and
upon no supposition should tyranny and ill treatment extort
from me what i was not in the first instance disposed
to give my wife was present during this conversation and
i could perceive felt an alarm for my danger that she would
have been incapable feeling for a danger to herself
though i was extremely anxious that these men should
be disappointed in the object their expedition yet i did
not neglect this opportunity endeavouring to obtain satisfaction
for my own curiosity i remarked at first that the
neapolitan was an inquisitor and this circumstance had
given additional poignancy to the uneasiness marguerite
but the accusations which the inquisition at this time
took cognisance were so numerous the ecclesiastical power
continually usurping upon the civil that i was little assisted
in the judgment i was desirous to frame by any inference to
be deduced from this circumstance i questioned directly
with an air as if it were merely in the way conversation
what was the crime the man whom they were in pursuit
and what was the cause forcible enough to induce a
neapolitan inquisitor to follow so decrepit and forlorn an
individual as he described beyond the alps and almost to
the banks the danube to this he answered roughly
that though he was not able to discover the object his
search he was by no means convinced that i was not his
abettor and accomplice and that as to his crime that was
not to be named the welfare christendom demanding
that the criminal and the memory his offences should
be buried together at the same time he warned me to
consider well what i did before i exposed myself to fce
overwhelmed by the vengeance the court which he
was a member to this i answered haughtily that i had
already condescended to repel his suspicion and that no
other man than an inquisitor would have had the stupidity
or the audaciousness to question my veracity i added
that i was perfectly acquainted with the nature his court
which was an object abhorrence to the whole christian
world but that he was mistaken if he supposed that the
l 
 travels st leon
detestable nature its proceedings would enable him to
practise every sort outrage with impunity the officers
withdrew into the little inclosure in front my cottage
and i overheard them consulting whether having failed in
their principal object they should carry me a prisoner
along with them the firmness my manner however
had awed them and the fearlessness i expressed seemed to
them to arise from a consciousness innocence they at
length departed as they came
i watched them from my cottage as they descended to
the shore and it was with no little pleasure that i perceived
them reembark and stand off for the opposite side the
lake this spectacle for a time entirely engaged me and
when i turned from the door i observed that my beloved
marguerite had been in tears she endeavoured to hide
this circumstance from my sight i took her affectionately
by the hand and pressing her to my bosom entreated her
not to make herself uneasy
ah reginald said she how can i avoid being uneasy
when i see you exposed to this imminent danger i
thought that in forfeiting our fortune and our rank and
retiring to this obscure and sequestered situation we might
at least promise ourselves the blessing the poor oblivion
and security and that should have consoled me for all i
have lost who is this man that is thus mysteriously hidden
among us what is the guilt from the punishment 
which he thus anxiously withdraws himself what can
be the nature your connection with such a man and
what will be the issue so perilous an adventure 
i hesitated i knew not what to answer to so earnest
an anxiety i was melted at the distress and the affection
 marguerite she saw my embarrassment and proceeded

mistake me not my beloved said she i have no
desire to pry into what you are willing to conceal forgive
the perturbation which has poured itself out in these involuntary
questions i repose an entire confidence in you
i would sooner die than interfere with any object you have
at heart go on according to the dictates your own
judgment undisturbed by me i will not doubt that you
travels op st leon 
have sufficient reasons for what you communicate and what
you suppress i am grieved indeed at the interruption 
our obscure and unambitious tranquillity but i had resolved
not to trouble you with my uneasiness and apprehensions
the incident this morning has extorted them from me 
but i will behave better in future
this scene was extremely distressing to me my wife
was oppressed with fears and i had nothing to answer her
the consolations that rose up in my own mind i was prevented
from communicating the more generously she
confided in me the more i felt the ungracious and disagreeable
nature the concealment i practised i endeavoured
however to encourage myself with the idea that the labour
would not be long and the harvest would prove abundant
i said in my own mind the worst is now over the business
has been commenced the shock to my own family
has actually occurred i must go on resolutely and shut
my eyes to the temporarily displeasing circumstances that
may be connected with the completing my object
chapter xiii
another source uneasiness was added to the distraction
my mind already endured the stranger did not appear
it was in the morning that the officers justice arrived
they departed about noon and in two hours afterwards i
entered the wood in search my guest the wood was
 some leagues in extent it was intersected by paths in
various directions it was interspersed with caverns j its
growth was all kinds in some places lofty trees that
seemed to form a support for the clouds in others an underwood
impenetrable alike to the feet and to the eye as
i entered the wood i however conceived that the discovery
 the stranger to me who was acquainted with its lurkingplaces
would be an affair little toil his feebleness and
decrepitude would not suffer him to proceed to any great
distance in this i was mistaken i looked carefully on
i 
 travels st leon
all sides i examined every recess and corner with which
i was acquainted but i found no trace the stranger
the scene was so complicated and involved that even this
was a labour considerable duration at length i became
satisfied that he was not in the nearer division the
wood
i paused i felt at once that it was little less than a
herculean task to hunt through the whole its dimensions
it would probably be little use to call and endeavour
by that means to discover his retreat i knew 
no name by which he was to be recognised and if my own
voice was but a slight resource to penetrate this immense
labyrinth foliage the voice the stranger weakened by
age and now probably still more enfeebled by hunger and
fatigue could not be expected to make itself heard beside
which as i knew not what the source information had
been to the officers who had just left me i was unwilling
to expose my guest to the danger that might arise from this
mode seeking him i could not even be sure though i
had seen their boat stand off from the shore that they might
not afterwards land one or more their party and be at
this very moment within earshot me i therefore proceeded
in anxiety and silence
my search was no more successful in the part the
wood with which i was little acquainted than in the part
with which i was most familiar i had already been engaged
four hours in the task and night began to come on
it shut in with heavy clouds that on all sides appeared
deeply loaded with rain i now began to consider my own
situation and by comparing circumstances found that i
was at a great distance from my own habitation there
was no direct path by which for me to return i had proceeded
to the right and the left backward and forward
sometimes by more open paths and sometimes forcing my
way through briars and brushwood as caprice or the hope
 effecting the object my search happened to guide me
it was therefore no easy matter to guess how i was to
return or even now that the lowering clouds had covered
the horizon with one uniform tint in which direction lay
the cottage or the lake while i stood contemplating what
travels st leon 
was to be done i heard the howling the wolves at a distance
 and their howl had that particular melancholy and
discomfiting sound which is well known to precede a coming
storm there was no time to be lost and accordingly
i set out i was less anxious to be at home on my own
account than for the sake quieting the alarms my
family to whom i had already occasioned too great a portion
 uneasiness
i had not proceeded far before the rain descended in
torrents intermingled with peals thunder and sheets 
lightning the thunder interrupted as it were from time
to time with the noise the wild beasts that inhabited the
wood deafened me while the excessive and instantaneous
brilliancy the lightning occasioned me an intolerable
aching in the organ sight it rained incessantly for two
hours and i found myself drenched and fatigued with the
wet during this time my progress was small and i was
ever and anon intercepted by the underwood and could not
without repeated experiments discover the means proceeding
at length the rain subsided and seemed to give
place to a gloomy and motionless calm soon after i discovered
a light at a distance and advanced towards it as
i approached i perceived that it proceeded from a set 
banditti to the amount fourteen or fifteen persons sitting
round a fire in the mouth a cavern i was glad to turn
my steps another way and was for some time afraid that
the noise i made in occasionally forcing my way through
the bushes would alarm them and cost me my life i
however fortunately escaped their notice this was in a
part the wood remote from the path i ought to have
taken and near the road to linda
the day began to dawn before i reached my own habitation
the conjecture i had made when i was unawares
upon the point falling into the hands the banditti
that the road linda was on the other side their retreat
was some service to me as an indication where to
find the cottage and the lake this road skirted the wood
on the side nearly opposite to that by which i entered it
the difficulties however i had to encounter were inconceivably
great in endeavouring to preserve my line direction
l 
 travels op st leon
after having been compelled four or five times to deviate
from the line it is seldom that a traveller will find himself
right in his conjecture as to the direction he is pursuing
unless he has some sensible object as a sort polestar by
which to govern his route it happened in this instance
that i was more fortunate than i was entitled to expect i
laboured indeed till daybreak without getting out the
labyrinth that inclosed me but the sun no sooner began
to lend an imperfect light than i recognised certain objects
which upon some former occasions i had observed and
perceived that my journey was nearly at an i entered
my cottage and found marguerite alone awake and expecting
me
she had been somewhat uneasy on account my absence
both from the extreme tempestuousness the night
and in consequence the painful sensations the events 
the preceding morning had introducedevents with which
it was almost unavoidable for her to imagine that my absence
was in some way connected the period my insanity
in switzerland might indeed have accustomed her
to the irregularity my motions but a term more than
six years which had intervened had produced in her expectations
and habits a different sort i related to this
admirable woman the adventures the night and the fruitlessness
 the search in which i had been engaged and
this openness communication resembling the nature
 the intercourse which had lately existed between us relieved
in some degree my burthened heart and cheered the
drooping spirits marguerite she dropped some consolatory
and sadly pleasing tears and her manner seemed to
say though she would not suffer her tongue to give the idea
words how sweet are cordiality and confidence oh do
not let our situation which has deprived us many other
comforts ever again be robbed this comfort which is
alone worth all the rest though she necessarily felt the
presence the stranger as an evil the bane our domestic
peace yet it was impossible for her not to compassionate
his fate and suffer some distress from his strange and
abrupt disappearance
after the conversation which had so eminently served as
travels st leon 
a relief to our minds marguerite left me to repose myself
from the extraordinary fatigue i had undergone but my
ttind was too much disturbed to suffer me to sink into the
arms forgetfulness i felt something tragical in the sad
destiny my unfortunate guest it was but too probable
that in his peculiarly weak state body and with his declining
health the being thus exposed for a day and a night
to the effects hunger the inclemency the air and
the tempestuousness the elements would put a close to
his existence i was determined soon to recommence my
search but how could i be sure that i should be more
fortunate today than the day before if i found him it
was most likely i should find him either dead or dying
the degree intercourse that had taken place between us
had made him occupy a considerable space in my thoughts
the prospects he had opened to me the conduct he had
induced me to adopt the painful effects and dissatisfaction
 mind which had been produced by that conduct as it
respected my family all combined to give me an interest
in his fate i had seen his talents i had felt his ascendancy
 had experienced that sort conflict which appearances
 guilt on the one hand and asseverations 
innocence on the other are calculated to produce in the
thoughts and emotions a bystander he was no common
man the expectations and conjectures he excited were
 no ordinary sort and i felt that an army might be
destroyed and a spacious plain covered with the wounded
and the dying without producing greater commotion in my
soul
in the anxious and disturbed state mind in which i
was the thoughts flow with extraordinary rapidity it will
be found attended with a strange and previously to the
experiment incredible mixture reasoning and passion 
philosophising and fury i was accordingly conscious at
this moment the truth the stranger's assertion that in
me he had a protector not a friend friendship is an object
 a peculiar sort the smallest reserve is deadly to it
i may indeed feel the emotions a friend towards a man
who in part conceals from me the thoughts his heart 
but then i must be unconscious this concealment the
 travels st leon
instant i perceive this limitation confidence he drops
into the class ordinary men a divorce is effected between
us our hearts which grew together suffer amputation
 the arteries are closed the blood is no longer
mutually transfused and confounded i shall be conscious
 all his qualities for i stand in the place an impartial
umpire i consider him as a machine capable so much
utility to myself and so much utility to other men but
i do not regard him as the brother my soul i do not
feel that my life is bound up in his i do not feel as if
were he to die the whole world would be at an to me
and that my happiness would be buried with him for ever
in the darkness the grave i am not conscious those
emotions which are the most exquisite and indescribable
the human mind can experience and which being communicated
by a sort electrical stroke to him who is their
object constitute the solace all his cares the alleviator
 all his calamities the only nectar and truest balm 
human life for me he stands alone in the world having
companions and associates the connections as it were 
mercantile selfishness or casual jollity and good humour
but no friend it was thus that i thought the stranger
he obtained from me the compassion due to a human being
and the respect extorted by his qualities but nothing calculated
radically to disturb the equilibrium the mind i
looked forward to his death with unruffled thoughts and an
moistened eye there was one thing indeed that shook
me more deeply the thought losing the promised reward
and having exposed myself to the evil an unquiet and
dissatisfied mind in vain
i rested but a few hours before i set out again upon the
search to which the interposition the darkness the
preceding night had put an abrupt close i had the precaution
to take with me a slight provision food and cordials
believing that if i found the stranger he would at
least be in the greatest need something reviving and restorative
charles earnestly intreated to assist me in the
search but upon this i put a peremptory prohibition it
would have been in direct contradiction to what the stranger
had most solemnly required me
travels st leon 
i had already spent several hours in anxiously tracing
the wood in every direction and the period noon was
past when approaching an obscure and almost impenetrable
thicket my ear was caught by a low and melancholy sound
which at first i knew not to what i was to ascribe it
however arrested my attention and caused me to assume
an attitude listening after the lapse little more thana
minute the same sound was repeated i now distinctly
perceived that it was the groan some creature in a very
feeble and exhausted state and immediately suspected that
it was the stranger i went almost round the thicket before
i could discern an entrance and though i looked with the
utmost care could perceive nothing that the thicket inclosed
the groan was repeated a third time the long intervals
between the groans gave a peculiar melancholy to the effect
and each seemed so much lower than the groan before that
nothing but the ear anxious attention would have caught
it at the same time that the tone conveyed an idea stupefied
yet vital anguish at length i perceived the legs
and something the garb a man it was the stranger 
he appeared to have crept into the thicket upon his hands
and knees when i forced my way to him he seemed in
the very act expiring he was lying on his face and i
raised him a little his eyes were fixed his mouth was
open his lips and tongue were parched and dry i infused
a few drops a cordial into his mouth for a moment
it appeared to produce no sensation but presently my
patient uttered a deep and longdrawn sigh i repeated my
application as a principal cause the condition in which
i found him was inanition the stimulant i administered
produced a powerful effect he moved his hands shuddered
turned his eyes languidly upon me and having appeared
to recognise me shut them hastily again i moved
him slowly and softly into a freer air and bathed his temples
with one the liquids i had about me by this time he
looked up and then suddenly round him with a wild and
hurried air he spoke not however he was speechless
in about a quarter an hour he relapsed into convulsions
in which it seemed probable he would expire they lasted
a considerable time and he then sunk into a state ingens
travels st leon
nobility i thought he was dead thus circumstanced it
was some relief to my humanity to have found him yet
alive and to have received his parting breath but in a
moment his secret and his promises recurred to me with
inexpressible anguish and i inwardly reproached him for
having deferred his communication so long as now to preclude
its ever being made i cannot describe the keenness
the burning and intolerable bitterness my sensation
keen it may well be supposed to have been from its having
so instantaneously and forcibly recurred at a time when
other objects seemed to press upon my senses no one
who has not felt what it is to fall in a moment from hope
or as i should rather say from assured possession what
his soul most loved and desired into black and interminable
despair can imagine what was then the state my mind
the body my patient sliced from my nerveless arms i
lifted up the eyes rage and phrensy as if to curse the author
 my being and then fell helpless and immoveable
by the side the stranger
i felt him move i heard him sigh i lifted up my
head and perceived stronger marks life and sense about
him than had yet displayed themselves i threw my arms
about him i pressed him to my heart the emphatically
gesture i used seemed to have a sort magnetical force to
rouse his dying powers with a little assistance from me
he sat upright my assiduity produced wonders it fortunately
happened that this thicket was but a half a mile
from my habitation and indeed was one the spots
which i had searched without success the day before
about the hour sunset partly by leading and partly
by supporting him i restored my guest to his former apartment

he remained speechless or nearly so he vented his
sensations in sighs in inward and inarticulate sounds and
even when he arrived at the power making himself understood
by words it was only by monosyllables and half
sentences that he conveyed to me his meaning i now gave
up my time almost entirely to an assiduous attendance on
the stranger every day i expected to be his last everyday
was more or less interspersed with symptoms that
travels st leon 
seemed to menace his instant dissolution during all this
time i remained in the anxious suspense contending hope
and fear was it probable that he would ever recover
strength enough to confer on me the legacy he had announced
 the particulars his secret i knew not but
judging from what i had heard the pretences and pursuits
 alchemy it was natural to suppose that he had a
process to communicate which would require on his part
considerable accuracy recollection as well as the power
 delivering himself in a methodical and orderly discourse
i was fortunate enough however to perceive after a tormenting
and tedious crisis that he appeared to be in a progress
 convalescence and that his strength both body
and mind were recruited daily after the lapse a fortnight
from the adventure the wood he one evening
addressed me in the following manner 
st leon i have been to blame i have put you to a
sufficient trial i have received from you every assistance
and kindness that my situation demanded i have imposed
on you much trouble and anxiety i have excited your
expectations by announcing to you in part what it was in
my power to bestow and i have finally risked the defrauding
your hopes and your humanity their just reward
do me the justice however to remember that i had no
presentiment the event which has so inauspiciously come
between you and your hopes fool that i was i imagined
i had suffered enough and that as i had obtained a longer
respite from external persecution than i almost ever experienced
i should be permitted to spend the short remainder
 my days uninterrupted i now however look back upon
this last assault with complacency it has cut off something
from the last remnant a life to the close which
i look forward with inexpressible longing at the same
time that i am still in prospect obtaining the final wish
 my heart the stealing out the world unperceived and
thus in some measure eluding the last malice my enemies
after my death i have but one injunction to leave
with you the injunction hercules to philoctetes that
no inducement may move you to betray to mortal man the
place in which you shall have deposited my ashes bury
 travels op st leon
them in a spot which i will describe to you it is not far
and is only recommended to me by its almost inaccessible
situation and that once done speak me and if possible
think me no more never on any account mention me
or allude to me never describe me or relate the manner 
our meeting or the adventure which has at length brought
on the desired close my existence
believe me in the feeble and helpless condition in which
i have spent the last fortnight your wishes and expectations
have been uppermost in my mind and there is
nothing i have felt with so much compunction as the danger
 leaving them unsatisfied to you perhaps i at present
appear to be rapidly recovering i feel the dart 
death in my vitals i know i shall not live four days it
is necessary therefore that i should finish without delay all
that remains for me to finish i will devote this night to
the arranging my thoughts and putting in order what i have
to communicate that no mistake or omission may have part
in a transaction so important come to me tomorrow
morning i will be prepared for you
as soon as i heard this discourse and provided the stranger
with every thing he could want during the night i withdrew
my heart was big with expectation my thoughts
all night were wild and tumultuous when the hour 
assignation arrived i hastened along the garden to the
summerhouse conscious that upon that hour depended all
the colour my future life since the stranger had been
in his present dangerous condition the door was not bolted
it was only locked the key was in my possession and
remained night and day attached to my person i opened
the door i panted and was breathless
i immediately saw that the stranger had undergone some
great alteration for the worse he had suffered a sort 
paralytic affection he lifted up his face as i entered it
was paler than i had ever seen it he shook his head
mournfully and intimated by signs the disappointment
which this morning must witness he was speechless
te fate fate exclaimed i in an agony despair am i to
be for ever baffled is the prize so much longed for and so
ardently expected at last to escape me it is not to be
travels op st leon 
imagined how much these successive endless disappointments
increased my impatience and magnified in my eyes
the donation i sought
the whole this and the following day the stranger
remained speechless the third day in the morning he
murmured many sounds but in a manner so excessively
inarticulate that i was not able to understand one word in
six that he said i recollected his prediction that he should
die on the fourth day the fever my soul was at its
height mortal sinews and fibres could sustain no more
if the stranger had died thus it is most probable that i
should have thrown myself in anguish and rage upon his
corpse and have expired in the same hour
in the evening the third day i visited him again he
had thrown his robe around him and was sitting on the side
 his couch the evening sun shot his last beams over
the windowshutters there were about eight inches between
the shutter and the top the window and some
branches vines with their grapes already ripe broke the
uniformity the light the side the couch faced the
west and the beams played upon the old man's countenance
i had never seen it so serene the light already softened
by the decline day gave it a peculiar animation and a
smile that seemed to betoken renovation and the youth 
angels sat upon it he beckoned me to approach i
placed myself beside him on the couch he took my hand
in his and leaned his face towards me
i shall never witness the light the setting sun
again were the first words he uttered i immediately
perceived that he spoke more collectedly and with better
articulation than at any time since the paralytic stroke
still however it was no easy matter to develop his words
but i wound up every faculty my frame to catch them 
and assisted as i was by the habit listening to his
speech for many weeks which during the whole that
time had never been distinct i was successful enough to
make out his entire discourse
it continued though with various interruptions for more
than half an hour he explained with wonderful accuracy
the whole his secrets and the process with which they
 travels st leon
were connected my soul was roused to the utmost stretch
 attention and astonishment his secrets as i have
already announced in the commencement this history
consisted two principal particulars the art multiplying
gold and the power living for ever the detail these
secrets i omit into that i am forbidden to enter my
design in writing this narrative i have said is not to teach
the art which i am in possession but to describe the
adventures it produced to me
the more i listened the more my astonishment grew
i looked at the old man before me i observed the wretchedness
 his appearance the meanness his attire his
apparent old age his extreme feebleness the characters
 approaching death that were written on his countenance
after what i had just heard i surveyed these things with
a sensation novelty as if i had never remarked them in
him before i said to myself is this the man that possesses
mines wealth inexhaustible and the capacity living forever

observing that he had finished his discourse i addressed
to him these words by a sort uncontrollable impulse
and with all the vehemence unsated and insuppressible
curiosity
tell me i adjure you by the living god what use
have you made these extraordinary gifts and with what
events has that use been attended 
as i spoke thus the countenance the old man underwent
a surprising change its serenity vanished his
eyes rolled with an expression agony and he answered
me thus 
be silent st leon how often must i tell you that
no single incident my story shall ever be repeated have
i no claim upon your forbearance can you be barbarous
and inhuman enough to disturb my last scene with these
bitter recollections i was silent
this is all that is material that passed at our interview
the stranger died the next day and was buried according
to his instructions
travels op st leon ll
chapter xiv
from the moment my last interview with the stranger
i was another creature my thoughts incessantly rolled upon
his communications they filled me with astonishment and
joy almost to bursting i was unable to contain myself 
i was unable to remain in any posture or any place i
could scarcely command myself sufficiently to perform the
last duties to his body in the manner he had directed i
paced with eager step the sands the lake i climbed the
neighbouring hills and then descended with inconceivable
rapidity to the vales below i traced with fierce impatience
the endless mazes the wood in which i so hardly
recovered my bewildered guest the uninterruptedness
and celerity bodily motion seemed to communicate some
ease to my swelling heart
yet there was one thing i wanted i wanted some
friendly bosom into which to pour out my feelings and
thus by participation to render my transports balsamic and
tolerable but this was for ever denied me no human
ear must ever be astonished with the story my endowments
and my privileges i may whisper it to the woods
and the waters but not in the face man not only am
i bound to suppress the knowledge the important secret
i possess but even the feelings the ruminations the visions
that are for ever floating in my soul it is but a vain and
frivolous distinction upon which i act when i commit to
this paper my history and not the science which is its cornerstone
the reason why the science may not be divulged
is obvious exhaustless wealth if communicated to all
men would be but an exhaustless heap pebbles and dust
and nature will not admit her everlasting laws to be so
abrogated as they would be by rendering the whole race 
sublunary man immortal but i am bound as far as possible
not only to hide my secrets but to conceal that i have
any to hide senseless paper be thou at least my confidant
 to thee i may impart what my soul spurns the
task to suppress the human mind insatiably thirsts for a
 travels op st leon
confidant and a friend it is no matter that these p
shall never be surveyed by other eyes than mine they
afford at least the semblance communication and the unburdening
 the mind and i will press the illusion fondly
and for ever to my heart
to return to the explanation my feelings immediately
after receiving possession my grand acquisition for without
that explanation the spirit and meaning my subsequent
narrative will scarcely be sufficiently apprehended
happy happy happy man exclaimed i in the
midst my wanderings and reveries wealth thy power
is unbounded and inconceivable all men bow down to
thee the most stubborn will is by thee rendered pliant as
wax all obstacles are melted down and dissolved by the
ardour thy beams the man that possesses thee finds
every path level before him and every creature burning
to anticipate his wishes but if these are the advantages
that wealth imparts to such as possess only those scanty
portions which states and nations allow to the richest how
enviable must his condition be whose wealth is literally
exhaustless and infinite he possesses really the blessing
which priestcraft and superstition have lyingly pronounced
upon the charitable he may give away the revenues 
princes and not be the poorer he possesses the attribute
which we are accustomed to ascribe to the creator the
universe he may say to a man be rich and he is rich
he can bestow with equal facility the smallest gifts and the
greatest palaces as if they were the native exhalations 
the soil rise out the earth at his bidding he holds the
fate nations and the world in his hand he can remove
forests and level mountains drain marshes extend
canals turn the course rivers and shut up the sea with
doors he can assign to every individual in a nation the
task he pleases can improve agriculture and establish manufactures
can found schools and hospitals and infirmaries
and universities he can study the genius every man
and enable every man to pursue the bent his mind
poets and philosophers will be fostered the sublimest flights
 genius be produced and the most admirable discoveries
effected under his auspicious patronage the whole world
travels op st leon l
are his servants and he if his temper be noble and upright
will be the servant the whole world nay it cannot
happen otherwise he has as few temptations to obliquity
as omnipotence itself weakness and want are the parents
 vice but he possesses every thing he cannot better
his situation no man can come into rivalship or competition
with him i thank god i have known the extremes
 poverty and therefore am properly qualified to enjoy my
present happiness i have felt a reverse fortune driving
me in one instance to insanity in another instance threatening
to destroy me my wife and children together with
the plague hunger my heart has been racked with
neverdying remorse because by my guilt and folly my
children have been deprived the distinction and rank to
which they were born and plunged in remediless obscurity
heaven has seen my sufferings and at length has graciously
said it is enough because i have endured more than
man ever endured from the privation fortune god in his
justice has reserved for me this secret the transmutation
 metals i can never again fall into that wretchedness
by which my understanding was subverted and my heart
was broken
from this part the legacy the stranger my mind
reverted to the oth i surveyed my limbs all the joints
and articulations my frame with curiosity and astonishment
 what exclaimed i these limbs this complicated
but brittle frame shall last for ever no disease
shall attack it no pain shall seize it death shall withhold
from it for ever his abhorred grasp perpetual vigour
perpetual activity perpetual youth shall take up their abode
with me time shall generate in me no decay shall not
add a wrinkle to my brow or convert a hair my head to
grey this body was formed to die this edifice to crumble
into dust the principles corruption and mortality are
mixed up in every atom my frame but for me the
laws nature are suspended the eternal wheels the
universe roll backward i am destined to be triumphant
over fate and time 
months years cycles centuries to me all these are
but as indivisible moments i shall never become old j i
m 
 travels op st leon
shall always be as it were in the porch and infancy 
existence no lapse years shall subtract any thing from
my future duration i was born under louis the twelfth 
the life francis the first now threatens a speedy termination
 he will be gathered to his fathers and henry his
son will succeed him but what are princes and kings and
generations men to me i shall become familiar with
the rise and fall empires in a little while the very name
 france my country will perish from the face the
earth and men will dispute about the situation paris as
they dispute about the site ancient nineveh and babylon
and troy yet i shall still be young i shall take my most
distant posterity by the hand i shall accompany them in
their career and when they are worn out and exhausted
shall shut up the tomb over them and set forward
there was something however in this part my speculation
that did not entirely please me methought the
race mankind looked too insignificant in my eyes i
felt a degree uneasiness at the immeasurable distance
that was put between me and the rest my species i
found myself alone in the world must i for ever live
without a companion a friend any one with whom i can
associate upon equal terms with whom i can have a
community sensations and feelings and hopes and
desires and fears i experienced something less than a
wish yet a something very capable damping my joy
that i also were subject to mortality i could have been
well content to be partaker with a race immortals but i
was not satisfied to be single in this respect i was not
pleased to recollect how trivial would appear to me those
concerns a few years about which the passions men
are so eagerly occupied i did not like the deadness 
heart that seemed to threaten me i began to be afraid 
vacancy and torpor and that my life would become too uniformly
quiet nor did it sufficiently console me to recollect
that as one set friends died off the stage another
race would arise to be substituted in their stead i felt that
human affections and passions are not made this transferable
stuff and that we can love nothing truly unless we
devote ourselves to it heart and soul and our life is as it
were bound up in the object our attachment
travels op st leon 
it was worse when i recollected my wife and my children
when i considered for the first time that they were now ina
manner nothing to me i felt a sensation that might be
said to mount to anguish how can a man attach himself
to any thing when he comes to consider it as the mere
plaything and amusement the moment in this statement
however i am not accurate habit is more potent than any
theoretical speculation past times had attached me deeply
irrevocably to all the members my family but i felt
that i should survive them all they would die one by one
and leave me alone i should drop into their graves the
still renewing tear anguish in that tomb would my
heart be buried never never through the countless ages
 eternity should i form another attachment in the
happy age delusion happy and auspicious at least to the
cultivation the passions when i felt that i also was a
mortal i was capable a community sentiments and a
going forth the heart but how could i an immortal
hope ever hereafter to feel a serious an elevating and expansive
passion for the ephemeron an hour 
as the first tumult my thoughts subsided i began as
is usual with persons whose minds are turned loose in the
search visionary happiness to picture to myself more
steadily and with greater minuteness the objects i would
resolve early to accomplish i would in the first place
return to france my adored country the residence my
ancestors whose annals they had adorned whose plains had
witnessed their heroic feats and whose earth enclosed their
ashes to france i was endeared by every tie that binds
the human heart her language had been the prattle my
infancy her national manners and temper were twined
with the fibres my constitution and could not be rooted
out i felt that every frenchman that lived was my brother
banishment had only caused these prejudices to strike their
tendrils deeper in my heart i knew not that i should
finally limit my abode to france a man who like 
is without life may well consider himself
as being also like him without father without mother
and without descent but at all events i would first fix
my children who did not participate in my privileges in
m 
 travels op st leoif
their native soil i would reside there myself at least till
they were fully disposed and till the admirable partner 
the last seventeen years my life had resigned her breath i
would immediately repurchase the property my ancestors
which had been so distressfully resigned the exile should
return from his seven years banishment in triumph and
splendour i would return to the court my old patron
and friend the gallant francis and present to him my boy
the future representative my family now one year older
than i had been at the field the cloth gold though
an exile from my country i had not been an inattentive
witness her fortunes the year fifteen hundred and
fortyfour was a remarkable and interesting year in the
history france the endless animosities francis and
the emperor had broken out with new fury about two years
before in the spring the present year the count d'an
guien had won a battle in piedmont in which ten thousand
imperialists were left dead upon the field and which
might be considered as having at length effaced the defeat
 pavia in the same part the world nineteen years before
the moment it had been announced that a battle was resolved
on the young nobility france with their characteristic
ardour had hurried to the scene and the court 
paris was in an instant as it were turned into a desert
on the other hand the emperor and the king england
had concerted for the same season a formidable plan 
attack against our northern frontier with an army 
twentyfive thousand men respectively the one on the side
 champagne and the other picardy they agreed to
advance directly into the heart the kingdom and to unite
their forces in the neighbourhood paris the last intelligence
that iad leached me was that chateau theory
about twenty leagues from the metropolis was in the hands
 the emperor and that the inhabitants the capital
filled with consternation were seeking their safety by flight
in every direction these circumstances had passed idly
by me and left little impression so long as i considered
myself as an obscure peasant cut off for ever from the bosom
 my country but vested with the extraordinary powers
the battle cerisoltes
travels st leon l
now intrusted to me the case was altered i felt even a
greater interest in my sovereign now pressed down with
disease and calamity yet retaining the original alacrity and
confidence his soul than i had done when i saw him in
all the pride youth and all the splendour prosperity
i was anxious that charles should now enter into his service
 and i determined once again to assume the cuirass
and the falchion that i might he the instructor his
youth and his pattern in feats war i resolved that my
shepherdboy bred in obscurity among woods and mountains
should burst with sudden splendour upon his countrymen
and prove in the field his noble blood and generous
strain i also proposed to myself both out sympathy
for my king and to give greater eclat to my son's entrance
into life to replenish with my treasures the empty coffers 
france and thus to furnish what at this period seemed to
be the main spring upon which the fortune war depended
with the advantages i could afford him the career 
charles could not fail to be rapid and illustrious and he
would undoubtedly obtain the staff constable france
the possessor which montmorency was now in disgrace
i would marry my daughters to such the young nobility
as i should find most distinguished in talents and spotless
in character when by the death her i most loved my
affections should be weaned from my country and the scenes
to which i had been accustomed were rendered painful and
distressing i would then set out upon my travels i would
travel with such splendour and profusion expense for
this though mortified in me by a reverse many years
duration continued to be the foible my heart as should
supersede the necessity letters recommendation and
secure me a favourable reception wherever i appeared i
might spend a life in a manner in every country that was
fortunate enough to allure my stay spreading improvements
dispensing blessings and causing all distress and calamity
to vanish from before me

chapter xv
my mind was occupied in these and similar reveries for
several weeks after the death the stranger my wife and
children had hoped after that event that i should have
returned to the habits which had pervaded the last six years
 my existence and which they had felt so eminently productive
 gratification and delight in this hope they
found themselves deceived my domestic character was
for the present at least wholly destroyed i had a subject
 contemplation that did not admit a partaker and from
this subject i could not withdraw my thoughts so much as
for an instant i had no pleasure but in that retirement
where i could be unseen and unheard by any human eye or
ear if at any time i was compelled to join the domestic
circle i despatched the occasion that brought me there as
speedily as possible and even while i remained in it was
silent and absent engrossed with my own contemplations
and heedless and unobservant every thing around me
my abstraction was not however so entire as to prevent
me from sometimes stealing in a sort momentary interregnum
 thought in that pause where the mind rests
upon the chain already passed over and seems passively to
wait for the sequel a glance at my family i looked at
them without knowing what it was that i did and without
the intention to notice what i saw yet even in this state
 mental abstraction visible objects will sometimes succeed
in making their impression i perceived that my wife
and children suffered from my behaviour i remarked a
general air disconsolateness and a mild expostulating
submission to what nevertheless the heart deeply deplored
they did not presume to interrupt me they did not by
prying and inquisitive speeches attempt to extort from me
the secret the alteration they saw but it was manifest
they conceived some great and radical calamity had poisoned
the heart our domestic joy
it was these symptoms thus remarked by me that first
roused me from the inebriation my new condition i
travels op st leon 
was compelled to suspect that while i revelled in visions 
future enjoyment i was inflicting severe and unmerited
pains on those i loved it was necessary if i valued their
happiness that i should descend from the clouds speculation
and fancy and enter upon the world realities
but here i first found a difficulty to which during the
reign my intoxication i had been utterly insensible i
was rich i could raise my family as far as the power 
money extended money which may in some sense be sty led
the empress the world to what heights i pleased i
had hitherto committed the fault so common to projectors
 looking only to ultimate objects and great resting places
and neglecting to consider the steps between this was an
omission high importance every thing in the world
is conducted by gradual process this seems to be the
great principle harmony in the universe nothing is
abrupt one thing is so blended and softened into another
that it is impossible to say where the former ends and the
latter begins
this remark is fully applicable to the situation which was
now before me yesterday i was poor today i was possessor
 treasures inexhaustible how was this alteration
to be announced to dissipate the revenues princes
to purchase immense estates to launch into costly establishments
are tasks to which the most vulgar mind is equal
but no man stands alone in the world without all trace 
what he has been and with no one near that thinks himself
entitled to scrutinise his proceedings and his condition
least all was this my case i was bound to certain
other persons by the most sacred obligations i could not
separate myself from them i could not render myself a
mere enigma in their eyes though in the language the
world the head my family they were my natural censors
and judges i was accountable to them for my conduct it
was my duty paramount to all other duties to stand as a
fair upright and honourable character in their estimation
if these remarks be true taken in a general view they
are much more so when applied to my particular case
there are men who live in the midst their families like
an eastern despot surrounded with his subjects they are
 travels op st leon
something too sacred to be approached their conduct is not
to be reasoned upon the amount their receipts and disbursements
is not to be inspected their resources are unknown
 no one must say to them what dost thou or
why hast thou thus conducted thyself even these persons
will not escape the tax to which all men are liable they
cannot kill the general spirit enquiry the mystery in
which they wrap themselves will often serve as an additional
stimulus they will finally encounter the judgment and
verdict all for myself i had lived in the midst my
family upon a system paternal and amicable commerce
i had suffered too deeply from a momentary season 
separation and mystery not to have been induced to renounce
it decisively and for ever
firm however as i had imagined my renunciation to
have been i was now thrown back upon what i had most
avoided i had a secret source advantage the effects 
which were to be participated by those i loved while the
spring was to remain for ever unknown what i most
sought upon this occasion was that my family should
share my good fortune and at the same time be prevented
from so much as suspecting that there was any thing mysterious
connected with it to effect this i presently conceived
that it would be necessary to sacrifice the sudden
and instantaneous prosperity i had proposed to myself and
introduce the reverse our condition by slow and as far
as possible insensible degrees
one thing on which i determined preparatory to the
other measures i had in view was to remove from my present
habitation and take up my residence for a time in the
city constance in the cottage the mountains it was
impossible o make any material alteration m my establishment
my property was the narrowest extent nor
would it be easily practicable in a country the inhabitants
 which were accustomed to a humble allotment considerably
to enlarge it my house was frugal if not mean 
and unless it were first pulled down and built over again
the idea introducing servants equipage or splendour into
it would be absurd my design was not to make a long
abode where i now was but as soon as my family should
travels op st leon 
be sufficiently prepared for the transition to return to my
native country i believed in the mean time that in the
capital the bishopric where my name was scarcely remembered
by a single individual i should be more at
liberty to proceed as circumstances suggested than in my
present rural situation where every neighbour regarded
himself as vested with a sort inquisitorial power over all
around him
to account for this measure to my family i felt it incumbent
on me to confess to them a certain pecuniary acquisition
the story that most readily suggested itself was
that the stranger having left behind him a certain sum
 which he made a donation to me this though in the
plain and direct sense the terms it were false yet in its
spirit bore a certain resemblance to the truth and with
that resemblance in spite the rigid adherence to veracity
that first ornament a gentleman that most essential prerequisite
to the regard arid affection others which i had
hitherto maintained i was induced to content myself
what could i do i was compelled to account for appearances
 i was forbidden by the most solemn injunctions to
unfold the truth i should indeed have felt little complacence
in the disclosure i should have been reluctant to
announce a circumstance which as i began to feel introduced
a permanent difference and separation between me
and my family
the sum at which i fixed the legacy the stranger was
three thousand crowns i was not inattentive to the future 
i should have been glad by my present account to have
furnished a more ample solution for circumstances which
might occur hereafter but some regard was due to probability
an unknown a solitary man broken with age
who arrived on foot and who declined all aid and attendance
must not be represented as possessing mines treasure

it was some time before i could prevail on myself to
break my story to the inhabitants my cottage as the
time approached when i was to bid an everlasting farewell
to rural obscurity and a humble station they seemed to
adorn themselves in new charms i was like the son a
 travels st leon
king who had hitherto been told by his attendants that
was a mere villager and who while his youthful imagination
is dazzled by the splendour that awaits him yet looks
back with a wistful eye upon his mirthful sports his former
companions and the simple charms her who first
obtained his guileless love i announced my acquisition
and my purpose with a faltering tongue and a beating
heart
i could perceive that my tale produced few emotions 
pleasure in those who heard it julia and her mother
especially were warmly attached to their retirement and
the scenes which had witnessed so many pleasurable incidents
and emotions chagrin in spite themselves made
a transient abode upon their countenances but the unresisting
mildness the one and the considerate attachment
 the other prevented for the present their sensations
from breaking out into words the feelings however
that they consigned to silence did not entirely escape the
notice the lively little marguerite she sympathised
with them probably without being aware that they were
sad she came towards me and with much anxiety in
her enquiring face asked why we must go away from the
cottage if i had got some money i might go to the
town and buy sweetmeats and ribands and new clothes
and a hundred more pretty things and bring them home
for her part she should be better pleased to put on her
finery and make her feast in the pretty old summerhouse
now she was again permitted to go and play in it than ina
palace all stuck over with emeralds and rubies her
mother wiped away a tear at the innocent speech her
darling kissed her and bid her go and feed the hen and
her chickens charles was the only one in whom i could
observe any pleasure at my intelligence he was not as
yet skilful enough to calculate the advantages that three
thousand crowns could purchase but i could see joy
sparkle in his eyes as i announced my intention bidding
adieu to retirement and taking up my rest in the capital 
the district his veins swelled with the blood his ancestors
 his mind was inured to the contemplation their
prowess already sixteen years age he hacusecretly
travels st leon 
burned to go forth into the world to behold the manners
 his species and to establish for himself a claim to some
rank in their estimation he had pined in thought at the
mediocrity our circumstances and the apparent impossibility
 emerging for he regarded the duty contributing
his labour to the subsistence the family as the first 
all obligations and the more the bent his spirit struggled
against it the more resolutely he set himself to comply
the rest the family were no sooner retired than marguerite
finding in what i had just announced to all an
occasion from the use which she could not excuse herself
took this opportunity unburthening the grief which
had long been accumulating in her mind
st leon said she listen kindly to what i am going
to say to you and assure yourself that i am actuated by
no spleen resentment or illhumour but by the truest
affection i perceive i have lost in your apprehension
the right advising you i am no longer the partner
 your counsels i am no longer the confident your
thoughts you communicate nothing but what you cannot
suppress and that you communicate to your whole
family assembled heaven knows how dear to me is every
individual that family but my love for them does not
hide from me what is due to myself i know that a husband
who felt as a husband ought and give me leave to
say as i have deserved you should feel towards me could
not act as you have acted tonight
you must excuse my reminding you some things
which you seem to have forgotten i would not mention
them if they had not been forgotten when they ought to
have been remembered i have lived seventeen years with
you my whole study had been your advantage and pleasure
have you any thing to reproach me with point
out to me if in any thing i could have added to your
pleasure and have neglected it what i have done has not
been the ceremonious discharge a duty it has been the
pure emanation an attachment that knew no bounds i
have passed with you through good fortune and ill fortune
when we were rich i entered with my whole heart into your
pleasures because they were yours when we were poor i
 travels op st leon
endured every hardship without a murmur i watched hy
you i consoled you i reconciled you to yourself i do
not mean to make a merit all this no reginald i
could not have acted otherwise if i would
t do me the justice to recollect that i have not been a
complaining or irritable companion in all our adversities
in the loss fortune and the bitter consequences that
loss i never uttered a reproachful word what poverty
sorrow hunger and famine never extorted from me you
have at length wrung from my bleeding heart st leon 
i have known your bosomthoughts in no former instance
has your affection or your confidence been alienated from
me and that consoled me for all the rest but now for
three months the case has been entirely altered you have
during all that time been busy pensive and agitated but
i have been as much a stranger to your meditations as if
i had never been accustomed to be their depository you
have not scrupled to inflict a wound upon me that no
subsequent change will ever be able to cicatrise nor indeed
do i see any likelihood a change you announce
our removal to constance what we are to do next with
what views or for what purpose i am ignorant
i have made my election my heart is formed for
affection and must always feel an uneasy void and desolation
without it if you had thus robbed me your
attachment in an early period our intercourse i know
not upon what extremity my disappointment and anguish
might have driven me they are harder to bear now
but i submit it is too late either for relief or remedy
what remains my powers and my strength i owe to my
children i will not seduce them from their father they
may be benefited by his purse or his understanding though
like me they should be deprived his affection you
may be their friend when i am no more i feel that this
will not last long i feel that the main link that bound
me to existence cannot be snapped and thus snapped by
unkindness worse than death without promising soon to
put a period to my miseries i shall be your victim in
death after having devoted my life to you in a way in
which few women were ever devoted to their husbands
travels op st leon 
but this is not what i purposed chiefly to say this is
what my situation and my feelings have unwillingly wrung
from me though you have injured me in the tenderest
point i still recollect what you were to me i still feel
deeply interested in your welfare and the fair fame you are
to transmit to your children i entreat you then to reflect
deeply before you proceed further you seem to me to
stand upon a precipice nor do the alteration that has taken
place in your manners and the revolution your heart
lead me to augur favourably the plans you have formed
what is this stranger whence came he why did he
hide himself and why was he pursued by the officers 
justice had he no relations was his bequest the
sum he had about him his own act and who is the witness
to its deliberateness or its freedom you must not think
that the world is inattentive to the actions men or their
circumstances if it were the fame we prize would be an
empty bauble no sir a fair fame can only be secured by
unequivocal proceedings what will what can be thought
 your giving shelter to an unknown a man accused 
crimes a man never beheld even by an individual your own
family and upon the strength whose alleged bequest
you are about to change the whole mode your life 
nor reginald must you think me credulous enough to
imagine that you have now disclosed the whole or the precise
truth three thousand crowns is not a sum sufficient
to account for what you propose for the long agitation 
your thoughts or for the change character you have sustained
you must either totally deprived rational
judgment or there must be something behind that you
have not communicated what do you purpose in going
to reside in the midst a city foreign to the manners 
a frenchman distracted with internal broils and embittered
to us by the recollection the extremities we personally
suffered in it is your ambition sunk so low that ifc
can be gratified by such a transition no you mean more
than you have announced you mean something you are
unwilling to declare consider that meaning well put
me out the question i am nothing and no longer desire
to be any thing but donot involve yourself in in
travels st leon
delvile disgrace or entail upon your memory the curses 
your children 
what a distress was mine who in return to so generous
and noble an expostulation could impart no confidence and
indulge no sincerity i felt a misery which till this
hour i had been unable to form a conception fool that
i was i had imagined that when endowed with the bequests
 the stranger no further evil could approach me 
i had in my visionary mood created castles and palaces
and expatiated in the most distant futurity and here i
was stopped and disappointed at the threshold in the very
first step my proceedings what i could however i
did i poured forth to marguerite not the secrets my
understanding but the overpowering emotions my soul
best most adorable women cried i how you
rend my heart with the nobleness your remonstrances i
never was man blessed with a partner so accomplished and
exemplary as i have been do you think your merits can
ever be obliterated from my memory do you think the
feelings gratitude and admiration can ever be weakened
in my bosom or that the strength and singleness my attachment
can suffer decay bear me witness heaven i
know no creature on the face the earth that can enter
into competition with you there is not the thing in nature
that i prize in comparison i love you a thousand times
better than myself and would die with joy to purchase
your ease and satisfaction i can never repay the benefits
you have conferred on me i can never rise to an equality
with you
what anguish then do you inflict upon me when you
talk becoming the victim my unkindness believe
you i can endure after having dissipated your patrimony
and drawn you with me into exile after having experienced
from you a tenderness such as man never in any other instance
obtained from woman to entertain the idea embittering
the remainder your life and shortening your
existence i should regard myself as the most execrable 
monsters i could not live under the recollection so
unheardof a guilt if you would not have me abhor myself
and curse existence live confide in me and be happy 
travels op st leon 
oh marguerite how wretched and pitiable is my
situation make some allowance for me i have a secret
that i would give worlds to utter but dare not do not
imagine that there is or can be any decay in my affection 
confide in me allow to necessity what never never
could be the result choice in all things else you shall
know my inmost heart as you possess the boundless and
unalterable affections my soul
marguerite was somewhat but not wholly soothed by
the earnestness my protestations she saw for the prescience
 the heart is never deceived that a blow was
given to the entireness our affection from which it would
never recover she felt for in truth and delicacy sentiment
she was much my superior that the reserve in which
i persisted and for which i deprecated excuse might be
sufficiently consistent with a vulgar attachment but would
totally change the nature ours she was aware that it
related to no ordinary point that it formed the polestar 
my conduct that it must present itself afresh from day today
and that in its operation it amounted to a divorce 
the heart she submitted however and endeavoured to
appear cheerful though she felt the worm sorrow
gnawing her vitals she was unwilling to occasion me an
uneasiness it was in her power to withhold she was struck
with the consistency and determination my resistance
and expostulated no more
we went to constance we bade adieu to the scene 
a six years happiness such as the earth has seldom witnessed
i alone had occasioned some imperfection in that
happiness there were times indeed when sitting in
affectionate communion with my wife and surrounded by
my children my sensations had been as delicious as the
state human existence ever had to boast i felt my
heart expand i was conscious to the unreserved union
that subsisted among us i felt myself identified with all
that i loved and all for whom my heart was anxious but
the curse entailed upon me from the earliest period to
which my memory can reach operated even in the cottage
 the lake i was not formed to enjoy a scene pastoral
simplicity ambition still haunted me an uneasiness
n
 travels st leon
scarcely defined in its object from time to time recurred to
my mind if i thought i wanted nothing for myself i
deemed a career honour due to my children again
when i regarded honour as an empty phantom and persuaded
myself that all conditions life were intrinsically
equal i recollected the fearful scene where hunger and destruction
had hung over us in constance and in imagination
often pictured to myself that scene as on the point 
being renewed the sword the demon famine seemed
to my disturbed apprehension to be suspended over us by a
hair such had been the draught bitterness that occasionally
detracted from this most enviable as in retrospect
i am willing to denominate it period my existence
we quitted our rural retreat and took up our abode ina
prosperous mercantile city i hired commodious apartments
in one the grand squares not far from the spot
where the fairs are usually held undoubtedly there was
nothing in this residence very congenial to the bent my
disposition or the projects that fermented in my mind i
had merely chosen it by way interval and to soften the
transition from what i had been to what i purposed to be
in the multitude irresolute thoughts with which i laboured
the small distance constance from the cottage 
the lake made me feel as if the removal thither was one 
the gentlest and most moderate measures to which i could
have recourse
i had never been less happy and at peace with myself than
i was now from general society and the ordinary intercourse
 acquaintance i had long been estranged and it
was in vain that i endeavoured to return to habits that
sort the society which the city constance afforded had
few charms for me it had no pretensions to the politeness
the elegance the learning or the genius an intercourse
with which had once been familiar to me it scarcely
contained within its walls any but such as were occupied in
merchandise or manufacture the attention its inhabitants
were divided between these objects and the encroachments
which were making upon the ancient religion by the
confession augsburg and the dogmas calvin the
majority the inhabitants were protestants and a few
travels op st leon 
years before they had expelled their bishop and the canons
 their cathedral having however miscarried in a religious
war into which they had entered these dignitaries
had been reinstalled in their functions and emoluments
the situation thus produced was an unnatural one and a
storm was evidently brewing more violent than any which
the city had yet sustained the gloomy temper and melancholy
austerity the reformers were as little congenial to
my temper as the sordid ignorance and selfishness the
trading spirit the community
i therefore lived in a state seclusion i endeavoured
to seek amusement in such novelties and occupations as
might present themselves to a person disengaged from the
general vortex but if the distinguished sphere in which
i had once moved disqualified me for taking an interest in
these puerilities the anticipations in which i indulged 
the future disqualified me still more my domestic scene
too no longer afforded me the consolation and relief i had
been accustomed to derive from it marguerite exerted
herself to appear cheerful and contented but it was an
exertion i began to fear that the arrow disappointment
had indeed struck her to the heart i was anxiously occupied
in considering what i was to do next i hoped that
our next step might operate to revive her gaiety and by
additional splendour amuse her solicitude i began to fear
that i had taken a wrong method and entered the career 
a better fortune with too much caution and timidity at
all events i felt that we no longer lived together as we had
done there was no more opening the heart between us
no more infantine guilelessness and sincerity no more 
that unapprehensive exposure every thought the soul
that adds the purest zest to the pleasures domestic life
we stood in awe each other each was to the other in
some degree an intrusive and unwelcome spy upon what
was secretly passing in the mind there may be persons
who regard this as an evil very capable being endured 
but they must be such as never knew the domestic joys i
once experienced the fall from one these conditions 
life to the other was too bitter

chapter xvi
anxious to divert my thoughts from what i hoped was only
a temporary evil i determined accompanied by charles to
make a tour some the cities germany dresden
was the capital to which i was most desirous conducting
him maurice duke saxony who held his court there
and who was now only twentythree years age was incomparably
the most accomplished prince the empire
desirous as i was that my only son should fill a distinguished
career i thought i could not better prepare him for the
theatre his native country than by thus initiating him
beforehand in scenes distinction and greatness
he was delighted with his tour we had not proceeded
many leagues from constance before indulging in the bent
 my mind i laid aside the humbleness our appearance
and the obscure style in which we travelled and having
procured a numerous cavalcade horses and servants i set
forward with considerable magnificence we passed through
munich ratisbon and prague at munich we found the
court the elector palatine the diet the empire was
sitting at ratisbon when we arrived at that city charles
had been almost entirely a stranger to every thing princely
and magnificent from the time he was nine years age 
and he was now exactly at that period human life when
external appearances are apt to make the strongest impression
to him every thing that occurred seemed like transportation
into a new world the figure we made procured us as
strangers unquestioned admission into every circle we
mixed with princes ourselves in garb and figure confounded
with those we saw i had lived too much and too
long in the most splendid society to find difficulty in resuming
the unembarrassed and courtly manners which i had
for years laid aside and charles might be said to see his
father in a new character novelty prompted his admiration
 he was intoxicated with wonder his disposition
travels op st leon 
had always led him to bold and adventurous conceptions 
nothing less than an imperious sense duty could have restrained
him from quitting our cottage and casting himself
upon the world in search honour and distinction his
generous heart had beat to burst away from the obscurity
 his station and it was with impatience and discontent
that he looked forward to the life a swain yet he knew
not how to break through the obstacles that confined him
it was therefore with transports pleasure that he saw
them vanishing as themselves and the career glory
opening as if by enchantment to his eager steps
the court dresden was infinitely more delightful to
him than the court munich or the imperial display at
ratisbon here charles saw a young prince in the flower
 his age whose talents and spirit rendered him the universal
object attention and adoration he remarked in
the fire his eyes the vivacity his gestures and the
grandeur his port something inexpressibly different from
those princes whom it is necessary that their rank should
be announced to you by some extrinsic circumstance that
you may not mistake them for a merchant's clerk or a city
magistrate the sentiment that he breathed as it were instinctively
as we returned from the first time our seeing
duke maurice was ef at twentythree years age may i
in appearance accomplishments and spirit resemble this
man 
here i was desirous making a longer stay than at the
cities through which we had previously passed and procuring
for my son some personal intercourse with this great
ornament the age i judged this to be the more easy
as in our first visit to the palace i had perceived some
french noblemen the protestant persuasion who had resorted
to the duke's court in search employment they
appeared not to know me but that was little to be wondered
at considering that i had been seven years absent from my
country and that the calamities by which i had been overtaken
more than once during that period might be supposed
to have produced a greater effect upon me than the
mere lapse years would have done among the rest i
remarked gaspar de coligny who was only twentyone
n 
 travels op st leon
years age at the time i quitted france and had then
been remarked as one the most promising young men his
country had to boast his stay here was expected to be
short his hopes in his own country from the greatness 
his connections were the highest class and he had only
come to dresden at the earnest invitation duke maurice
who entertained an ardent affection for him my heart led
me towards him policy concurred in dictating the application
as if i were fortunate enough to gain his favour my
son could not have a friend better qualified either to form
his character or forward his advancement
i wrote to coligny to announce my request to him and
in a few hours after the delivery my letter that young
nobleman came in person to wait on me he informed
me that he had done so because he had something delicacy
to mention which he did not choose to trust to the
intermission a third person and upon which as he
hoped i could remove his scruple he did not like even to
bestow the formality putting it on paper
i am a gentleman france said coligny you
will excuse my frankness i am a gentleman france 
you will not wonder at the niceness my honour mixing
in society i do not pretend minutely to investigate the
character every person with whom i converse but what
you ask me obliges me to consult my understanding and
enquire into facts i cannot consent to vouch for any
man's character to another till i have paid some attention
to the ground upon which that character rests
i remember the count de st leon with pleasure and
advantage at the court my own sovereign every one
admired his accomplishments his gallantry and his learning
every one spoke him with respect unfortunate
circumstances as we all understood deprived you your
patrimony that is nothing to me i respect a nobleman in
misfortune as much as when he is surrounded with wealth
and splendour you retired into voluntary exile i heard
with great grief some subsequent calamities that have
overtaken you but here in saxony i see you resuming
all your former splendour and coming forward with the
magnificence a prince other your countrymen have
travels st leon 
remarked it as well as myself and feel themselves at a loss
to account for what they see
e excuse me count by your application to me you
oblige me to speak freely i dare say you can clear up the
difficulty and account for this second revolution in your
fortune upon which i shall then be the first to congratulate
you i cannot suspect a man with your high descent
and the illustrious character you formerly maintained
 any thing dishonourable but you have not sufficiently
considered the account we all owe to one another
and the clearness proceeding we are obliged to maintain
not only to our own hearts but in the face the world
the present occasion is i trust fortunate for you and
when you have assisted me in complying with the rules by
which every honourable man governs himself i shall be
eager to publish your justification and render you all the
service in my power
i was ready to burst with astonishment and vexation
during this representation coligny i could feel my
colour change from pale to red and from red to pale i
could only answer with suffocation and inward rage that i
was much obliged to him i would consider what he said 
i would acquaint him with my justification and whenever
it was made he might be assured it should be an
ample one i was cautious as to what i uttered i could
not immediately foresee what it was eligible or what it was
possible to do and i was resolved that i would not by
an idle or hasty expression preclude myself in a matter 
so much moment from the benefits future deliberation
if what i had just heard had come from any other person
i should probably have despised it but i felt at once that
gaspar de coligny might be considered in a case this
sort as the representative all that was most honourable
and illustrious in my native country finding that i was
indisposed to any further communication on the subject he
took a polite leave and departed
i was no sooner alone than i felt myself overwhelmed
with mortification and shame i had rejoiced in the bequests

means restoring me to splendour and replacing my child

drew in the situation to which they were entitled by their
birth was that which i had regarded as the instrument
 their glory to become the medium their ignominy
and disgrace i had suffered all other misfortunes but
tie whisper dishonour had never been breathed against
me i was a son honour descended a race heroes
and cradled in the lap glory and fame when we
quitted paris in the year my incomparable wife had
set to sale our entire property resolved that though driven
into exile we would not leave it in the power the meanest
individual to controvert the sacred attention we yielded
to every just obligation since that time had declined
from the splendour rank to the humble situation a
rustic cultivating my little property with my own hands 
nay i had even for a short time hired myself as a labourer
in the garden the bishop constance but the same
disdain every thing disgraceful had followed me to my
cottage and my truckle bed which i had originally learned
in the halls chivalry and the castle my ancestors
accordingly i had uniformly retained the same honourable
character and spotless fame st leon the virtuous cottager
had in nothing blemished the name st leon surrounded
with glory in the siege pavia often and with
pride had i pointed out this circumstance to my son adding
wherever fortune calls you for whatever scenes you
may be reserved remember that your father was unfortunate
but that through life he never acted a deed nor conceived
a thought that should stain your manly cheeks with
the blush shame i stand before you a culprit as having
robbed you your patrimony but i have preserved
for you entire the inheritance our honour 
this had been the first lesson imprinted upon my infant
mind all other possessions i had ever held cheap and
worthless in comparison with that an illustrious name
my indignation at the attack it now sustained was boundless
the more i thought the more intolerable it appeared
i was impatient and furious like a lion struggling
in the toils i could with joy have trampled under my
feet whoever aspersed me i could have wantoned in blood
and defied my adversaries to mortal combat alas all my
travels st leon
fury was useless here it was no tale whispered in the
dark that i had to contend with it was the commentary
 the world upon incontestable facts though a hecatomb
 souls should be sacrificed at the shrine my blasted
name the facts would still remain the mystery still require
to be solved coligny the virtuous coligny had made no
observations on the circumstances he mentioned j he merely
proposed a difficulty and waited my answer
i was called upon to exercise the whole my deliberative
powers as to the reply which was to be returned or
the conduct to be held upon the question coligny
every thing i most valued was now at issue and a false
step taken under the present circumstances could never be
retrieved i had another sort party to deal with here
than when i had told marguerite the tale the stranger
and his legacy nothing would pass now but what bore
an open fair and unequivocal appearance i must vent
no assertion that could not bear to be sifted to the bottom
and that did not fully accord with all the vouchers with
which it could be collated i had written to marguerite
immediately after launching into the expense with which
our tour had been attended that i had received an unexpected
acquisition from the death a relation my
own family in france i knew that the story the three
thousand crowns would no longer account for the style in
which i was proceeding and this fabrication suggested
itself upon the spur the moment i hated to think 
the difficulties in the way explanation in which i was
involved i abhorred the system falsehood i was driven
to practise it did not occur to me at the time infatuated
as i was that i should have occasion to account for this
accession wealth to any one out my own family
marguerite i well knew had no correspondence in france
nor therefore any obvious means verifying or refuting
this second deception but such a story could not be told
to noblemen france without being instantly liable to be
compared with known facts and eventually investigated
upon the spot where the scene was laid marguerite herself
i well knew had listened with incredulity to the explanation
i had made and the alleged legacy the stranger 
 travels op st leon
what could i expect from indifferent hearers they might
not all possess her good sense and sagacity in judging but
they were destitute that personal kindness and partiality
which were calculated to induce her to credit whatever i
affirmed most men have a malignant pleasure in the detection
 specious pretences in humbling the importunate
superiority that obscures their claims and removing the
rival who might otherwise acquire the prize which they
are in pursuit
my mind was still torn and distracted with these contemplations
when in the afternoon the same day on
which i had received the visit coligny my attention
was suddenly roused by the abrupt entrance my son into
the chamber where i was sitting he opened the door
with a hurried action as he entered and having closed it
impetuously after him advanced directly towards me he
then stopped himself and turning from me i could perceive
a rush crimson in his face like that a man suffocated
a passion tears succeeded that shook his frame
and sufficiently proved that his feelings had sustained some
extraordinary shock my whole soul was alarmed at what
i saw and following him as he retired to the other side
 the room in the gentlest accents i endeavoured to soothe
him while i enquired with earnestness and trepidation into
the cause his grief
chapter xvii
he repelled me sit down sir sit down do not follow
me i beg you but sit down 
his manner was earnest and emphatically mechanically
and without knowing what i did i obeyed his direction
he came towards me
i have no time added he for qualifying and form
tell me am i the son a man honour or a villain 
he saw i was shocked at the unexpected rudeness 
his question
travels st leon 
forgive me my father i have always been affectionate
and dutiful i have ever looked up to you as my
model and my oracle but i have been insulted it never
was one your lessons to teach me to bear an insult 
is it replied i with the sternness that the character
 a father will seldom fail to inspire under such circumstances
 because you have been insulted that you think
yourself authorised to come home and insult him to whom
you owe nothing but respect and reverence 
stop sir before you claim my reverence you must
show your title to it and wipe off the aspersions under
which you at present labour
f insolent presumptuous boy know that i am not by
you to be instructed in my duty and will not answer so rude
a questioner the down as yet scarcely shades your schoolboy's
cheek and have you so forgotten the decencies 
life as to scoff your father his eye brightened as i
spoke
ei you are right sir it gives mepleasure to see your
blood rise in return to my passion your accent is the
accent innocence but indeed the more innocent and
noble you shall prove yourself the more readily will you
forgive my indignation
i cannot tell my temper does not fit me to bear the
rudeness a son nor do i think that such behaviour as
this can be any credit to you whatever may have been the
provocation tell me however what is the insult that has
thus deeply shaken you 
i went this afternoon to the tenniscourt near the river
and played several games with the young count luitmann
while we were playing came in the chevalier dupont my
countryman the insolence his nature is a subject 
general remark and he has though i know not for what
reason conceived a particular animosity to me a trifling
dispute arose between us we gradually warmed he
threatened to turn me out the court i resented the
insult and he passionately answered that the son an
adventurer and a sharper had no business there and he
would take care i should never be admitted again i attempted
to strike him but was prevented and presently
 travels op st leon
learned that the sudden and unexplained way in which we
have emerged from poverty was the ground his aspersion
as i gained time and reflected more distinctly upon
what was alleged i felt that personal violence could never
remove an accusation this sort i saw too though intoxicated
as i had idly been with the unwonted splendour
to which i was introduced i had not adverted to it at the
time that the case was a nature that required explanation
i had been accustomed to reverence and an implicit faith
in the wisdom and rectitude my parents and therefore
encountered in silent submission the revolution our fortune
but this neutrality will suffice no longer
to you sir i resort for explanation send me back
to the insolent youth and his companions with a plain and
unanswerable tale that may put to silence for ever these
brutal scoffs and reproaches let it be seen this night
which the two has most fully merited to be thrust out 
honourable society i trust i have not so demeaned myself
but that our mutual companions will join to compel
this unmannered boor to retract his aspersions
fc charles you are too warm and impetuous 
too warm sir when i hear my father loaded with
the foulest appellations 
you are young and ill qualified to terminate in the
proper way a business this serious aspect leave it to me 
 travels op st leon
from you and disown your name i shall be involved in the
same disgrace
saying thus he left me and in about half an hour returned
his return i had not foreseen i had made no use his
absence my mind was overcome my understanding was
stupefied by a situation and events i had so little expected
i had stood unmoved leaning against the wall from the
instant his departure i seemed rooted to the spot incapable
 calling up my fortitude or arranging my ideas
my eyes had rolled my brow was knit i had bit my lips
and my tongue with agony from time to time i had muttered
a few words my son my son wealth
wealth my wife my son but they were incoherent
and without meaning
charles reentered the apartment where the preceding
conversation had passed and the noise he made in entering
roused me he had his hat in his hand which he threw
from him and exclaimed with an accent dejection and
anguish my father farewell 
tf cruel cruel boy can you persist in your harsh and
calamitous resolution if you have no affection for me yet
think your mother and your sisters 
seek not sir to turn me from my purpose the struggle
against it in my own bosom has been sufficiently severe 
but it must be executed his voice as he spoke was inward
stifled and broken with the weight his feelings
then farewell i replied yet take with you
some provision for your long and perilous adventure name
the sum you will accept and whatever is its amount it
shall instantly be yours
i will have nothing it is this wealth with whose
splendour i was at first child enough to be dazzled that has
destroyed us my fingers shall not be contaminated with
an atom it what is to be my fate as yet i know not
but i am young and strong and enterprising and courageous
the lessons honour and nobility live in my
bosom though my instructor is lost his instructions shall
not be vain 
once more farewell from my heart i thank you for
your protestations innocence never will i part with
travels st leon 
this last consolation to believe them i have recollected
the manner in which they were uttered it was the manner
 truth if there be any evidence a contrary tendency
that i will forget though to the world i shall be
without father and without relatives i will still retain this
sacred consolation for my hours retirement and solitude
that my ancestors were honourable and my father in spite
 all presumptions to the contrary was innocent
how hard it is to quit for ever a family love and
affection as ours has been bear witness for me how
deeply i sympathised with you at paris in switzerland in
constance though now you dissolve the tie between us
yet till now never had a son greater reason for gratitude
to a father you and my mother have made me what i
am and that i may preserve what you have made me i
now cast myself upon an untried world the recollection
 what i found you in the past period my life shall befor
ever cherished in my memory 
i quit my mother and my sisters without leavetaking
or adieu it will be a fruitless and painful addition to
what each party must learn to bear dear excellent peerless
protector and companions my early years my
wishes are yours my prayers shall for ever be poured out
for you you sir who rob them a son and a brother
be careful to make up to them a loss which i doubt not
they will account grievous i can do nothing for them i can
throw myself into the arms poverty it is my duty
but in doing so i must separate myself from them assuredly
innocent and worthy more and greater benefits
than i could ever confer on them farewell 
saying this he threw himself into my arms and i felt
the agonies a parting embrace
chapter xviii
fob some time i could not believe him departed when i
retired to rest i felt the want charles to press my hand
and wish me refreshing slumbers and i passed on sad
and solitary to my chamber when i came next morn
o 
 travels st leon
ing into the breakfasting room charles was not there to
greet me with looks affection and duty and the gilding
and ornaments the apartment were to me no less disconsolate
than the damps and sootiness a dungeon
i hoped he would return i knew how tenderly he was
attached to his mother and his sisters i was fully convinced
that the affection for me which had been the perpetual
habit his mind could not be entirely eradicated
from his heart i mentioned him not in my letters to
constance the pen lingered my hand trembled when i
thought him i could neither pretend that he was with
me nor announce the catastrophe his absence but i
opened the letters marguerite with still increasing impatience
finding that he did not return to me i hoped
that some alteration the extraordinary resolution he had
formed would lead him to constance in vain i hoped 
there reached me by no conveyance from no quarter
tidings my son 
how surprising an event a youth not seventeen years
 age forming and executing in the same instant the purpose
 flying from his parents and his family deserting
all his hopes all his attachments all his fortune refusing
the smallest particle assistance or provision in his entrance
upon the wide scene the world oh charles exclaimed
i you are indeed an extraordinary and admirable youth 
but are you fortified against all the temptations the world
and all its hardships do your tender years qualify you to
struggle with its unkindness its indifference and its insults
in how few quarters is merit ever treated with the attention
and benevolence it deserves how often is it reduced to
tremble with indignation at the scoffs and brutality to which
it is exposed and at the sight folly and vice exalted in
its stead and appointed its despot and its master my son
my son what will be your fate is your unseasoned
frame reserved to perish by hunger in barren deserts and
beneath inclement skies will you not in some hour 
bitter disappointment and unpitied loneliness lay yourself
down in despair and die will you not be made the slave
 some capricious tyrant for bread generous as is your
nature will it be eternally proof against reiterated tempttravels
 st leon q
action upon what a world are you turned adrift a world
 which you know as little as the poor affrighted soul a
dying man knows when launching into the mysterious
impenetrable abyss eternity unnatural father to have
reduced my only son to this cruel alternative i should
with a less aching and agonising heart have accompanied
his senseless remains to the grave dreadful as that parting
is there at least the anxious mind the survivor has
rest there are no thoughts and devices in the silence 
the tomb there all our prospects and we are no
longer sensible to pain to persecution to insult and to
agony but charles thus departed wandering on the face
 the globe without protector adviser or resource no lapse
 years can put a close upon my anxiety for him if i
am in ease and prosperity i cannot relish them for my
exposed and living son may be at that moment in the depth
 misery if i am myself oppressed and suffering the
thought what may be his fate will form a dreadful addition
to all my other calamities what am i to say 
him upon my return to constance if he had died this
was a natural casualty and whatever grief it might occasion
time no doubt would mollify and abate it but what
account can now be rendered him to his disconsolate
mother and terrified sisters how can i lift up my head in
their presence or meet the glance their reproachful eyes 
the idea had occurred to me in the instant charles's
departure and immediately after his exit detaining or
bringing him back by force he was by his extreme youth
according to the maxims the world still in a state 
guardianship and unqualified to be the chooser his own
actions but to this mode proceeding however deeply
i felt the catastrophe which had taken place i could never
consent it was in utter hostility to the lessons chivalry
and honour with which i had been familiarised from my
earliest infancy there might be cases in which this restraint
laid by a father upon his child would be salutary
but the idea which had occasioned the secession charles
was decisive in this instance what right had i to chain
him to dishonour the whole bent his education had
been to impress him with the feelings by which he was
o 
 travels st leon
now actuated if i detained him for a short time was
there any vigilance on earth that could finally prevent him
from executing a purpose upon which his whole soul was
resolved or suppose there were must not the consequence
be to break his spirit to deprive him all manliness and
energy and to render him the mere drooping and soulless
shadow that conspicuous hero i had been anxious to
make him it might be said indeed that this was the determination
 a boy formed in an hour and that if i
detained him only long enough for deliberation and revisal
he would his own accord retract so desperate a project
but i felt that it was a resolution formed to endure and
was built upon principles that could not change so long as
an atom his mind remained no i was rather disposed
to say however grievous was the wound he inflicted on me
go my son act upon the dictates your choice as i
have acted on mine i admire your resolution though i
cannot imitate it your purpose is lofty and godlike and
he that harbours it was not born to be a slave be free 
and may every power propitious to generosity and virtue
smooth your path through life and smile upon your desires 
the anguish i felt for having lost my son and in this
painful and reproachful manner was not diminished to me
either by society or amusement i dared not go out my
house i saw no one but my own attendants i had not
the courage to meet the aspect a human creature i
knew not how far persons in dresden might have heard the
injurious reports which occasioned the flight my son or
even have been acquainted with the nature that flight
i had promised to see coligny again but alas the affair
which had at first led me to wish to see him was now at
an i had no heart to seek him nor indeed did i
know what story i was to tell him or how i was to remove
the suspicions he had urged against me the machine 
human life though constituted a thousand parts is in
all its parts regularly and systematically connected nor is
it easy to insert an additional member the spuriousness 
which an accurate observation will not readily detect how
was i to assign a source my wealth different from the
true which would not be liable to investigation and when
travels st leon 
investigated would not be seen to be counterfeit this
indeed is the prime source individual security in human
affairs that whatever any man does may be subjected to
examination and whatever does not admit being satisfactorily
accounted for exposes him whom it concerns to
the most injurious suspicions this law our nature so
salutary in its general operation was the first source all
my misfortunes
i began now seriously to consider what judgment i was
to pass upon the bequests the stranger were they to
be regarded as a benefit or a misfortune ought they to
be classed with the poisoned robe nessus which being
sent as a token affection was found in the experiment
to eat into the flesh and burn up the vitals him that
wore it should i from this instant reject their use and
returning to the modes life established among my fellowmen
content myself with the affection those with whom
i had intercourse though poverty and hardships mingled
with the balm 
the experiment i had made these extraordinary gifts
was a short one but how contrary were ah the results i had
arrived at from those i looked for when the stranger had
appeared six months before at the cottage the lake he
had found me a poor man indeed but rich in the confidence
and happy in the security and content every
member my family i lived in the bosom nature
surrounded with the luxuriance its gifts and the sublimity
 its features which the romantic elevation my
soul particularly fitted me to relish in my domestic scene
i beheld the golden age renewed the simplicity pastoral
life without its grossness a situation remote from cities and
courts from traffic and hypocrisy yet not unadorned with
taste imagination and knowledge never was a family
more united in sentiments and affection now all this
beauteous scene was defaced all was silence suspicion
and reserve the one party dared not be ingenuous and
the other felt that ah the paradise attachment was dwindled
to an empty name no questions were asked for no
honest answer was given or expected though corporeally
we might sit in the same apartment in mind a gulf wide
o 
 travels op st leon
impassable and tremendous gaped between us my wife
pined in speechless grief and it was to be feared had sustained
a mortal blow my son my only son a youth 
such promise that i would not have exchanged him for empires
had disappeared and as he had solemnly protested
for ever my heart was childless my bosom was bereaved
 its dearest hope it was for him principally that i had
accepted that i had rejoiced in the gifts the stranger
my darling vision was to see him clothed in the harness
surrounded with the insignia a hero there was nothing
i so earnestly desired as that his merits graced with the
favours fortune might cause him to stand confessed the
first subject france a situation more enviable than that
 its monarch since he who holds it is raised by deeds and
the other only by birth and if less respected by interested
courtiers is certain to be more honoured by the impartial
voice history but if i felt thus desolate and heartbroken
for the loss my son what would be the sentiments
 his mother more susceptible to feel and in her present
weakness spirits less vigorous to bear than myself when
the dreadful tidings should be communicated to her 
yet i could not resolve to renounce donations which i
had so dearly appropriated i held it to be abase and cowardly
to surrender gifts so invaluable upon so insufficient
an experiment he i thought must be a man ignoble
and grovelling spirit who could easily be prevailed on to part
with unbounded wealth and immortal life i had but just
entered the vast field that was opened to me it was the
nature all great undertakings to be attended with difficulties
and obstacles in the commencement to present a
face calculated to discourage the man that is infirm purpose
but it became my descent my character and pretensions
to show myself serene in the midst storms
perseverance and constancy are the virtues a man
affairs this extensive compass often prove in the issue
the reverse what they seemed in the outset the tempest
might be expected to disperse difficulties to unravel
themselves and unlookedfor concurrences to arise all
opposition and hostile appearance give way before him who
goes calmly onward and scorns to be dismayed
travels st leon 
chapter xix
it was thus that i spurred myself to persist in the path
upon which i had entered having remained some time
at dresden flattering myself with the hope that charles
might yet join me before i quitted that city i began to
think once more turning my steps towards the residence
 my family this was no cheerful thought but upon
what was i to determine i had a wife whom i ardently
loved and three daughters the darlings my heart because
i had lost a beloved son was i to estrange myself
from these i already felt most painfully the detachment
and widowhood to which i was reduced and i clung with
imperious affection to what remained my race the
meeting i purposed must be a melancholy one but in the
sorrows the heart there is a purer and nobler gratification
than in the most tumultuous pleasures where affectionis
silent i looked forward indeed to scenes endless
variety and attraction but in the mean time what seemed
first to demand my attention was the beloved circle i had
left behind in the city constance
i retraced upon the present occasion the route i had
lately pursued with my son how different were now my
sensations my heart was then indeed painfully impressed
with the variance and dissolution confidence that had
arisen between me and his mother it was perhaps principally
for the sake banishing this impression that i had
had recourse to the splendour equipage and attendance
which was first assumed upon the journey from constance
to dresden nor frivolous as this expedient may appear
in the unattractive dispassionateness narrative had it
been by any means weak effect at the time it was employed
when charles was once mounted on his proud
and impatient steed and decorated in rich and costly attire
i felt as it were the sluggishness my imagination roused
i surveyed his shape and his countenance with inexpressible
complacence and already anticipated the period when he
was to become the favourite his sovereign and his count
 st leon
try's pride now i returned with the same retinue but
the place that had been occupied by my son was empty i
sought him with frantic and restless gaze i figured him
to my disturbed and furious imagination till the sensations
and phantoms my brain became intolerable i raved
and imprecated curses on myself i endeavoured to divert
my thoughts by observing the scenes that passed before me
they talked to me charles they had been pointed outby
each to each and had been the subject our mutual
comment though charles was endowed with a high relish
for the beauties nature and in our little retreat on the
borders the lake had lived in the midst them he had
seen little the variety her features and the journey
we made through the heart germany had furnished him
with continual food for admiration and delight nor did
the scenes i beheld merely remind me the sensations
they produced in charles they led me through a wider
field i recollected long conversations and digressive excursions
which had been started by the impression they
made i recollected many passages and occurrences to
which they had not the slightest reference but which
having arisen while they constituted the visible scene were
forcibly revived by its reappearance thus from various
causes my lost and lamented son was not a moment out 
my thoughts during the journey while i continued at
dresden i seemed daily to expect his return but no
sooner did i quit that city than despair took possession 
my heart
thus anxious and distressed i arrived at prague and
soon after at ratisbon i travelled slowly because though
i was desirous returning to constance i anticipated my
arrival there with little complacence as i drew nearer to
my family i felt more distinctly the impossibility presenting
myself before them without first endeavouring to
take off the shock they would sustain at seeing me return
without my son i therefore resolved to send forward a
servant from ratisbon whom i directed to make all practicable
speed as i designed to wait for an answer he should
bring me at the city munich to attempt to write to
marguerite on this subject was a severe trial to me the
travels st leoiv 
whole however that i proposed to myself was to remove
the surprise which would be occasioned hy seeing me alone
and to anticipate questions that it would be impossible forme
to hear without anguish mind and perturbation 
countenance i therefore took care to express myself in
such terms as should lead marguerite to believe that i had
voluntarily left her son in saxony and that in no very longtime
he would rejoin his family i trusted to subsequent
events to unfold the painful catastrophe and could not prevail
on myself to shock her maternal feelings so much as i
must necessarily do if i informed her the whole at once
charles had not been mentioned but in ordinary terms and
the accustomed language affection in the letters i had
recently received from constance and i was therefore convinced
that he had neither gone to that place nor had
conveyed thither any account his proceedings
the answer i received from marguerite by my messenger
was as follows 
 your absence has been long and critical and the welfare
 your daughters seems to require that we should rejoin
each other as speedily as may be whether we should
meet here or at any other place you must determine it
is however right i should inform you that during your
absence rumour has been busy with your reputation what
the extent or importance the ill reports circulated you
may be i am scarcely competent to judge we have lived
in uniform privacy and it is natural to suppose that the
portion censure that has reached us is but a small part
 what really exists the mode in which you have proceeded
and the extraordinary figure you have made in a
progress through germany have given weight to these insinuations
but it is not my intention to comment on
what you have done
you appear to design that i should understand you
have left my son behind you in saxony poor charles i
had a letter from him three weeks ago in which he informs
me what has happened and apologises in the most pathetic
terms for any seeming want regard to me in his
conduct at the very moment that his heart bleeds for my
fate i did not think it necessary to communicate this cir
 travels st leon
constance to you i have done with complaining now
that i have fallen into the worst and most unlookedfor
misfortunes i have a gratification that i do not choose to
part with in shutting up my sorrows in my own breast
oh charles my son my idol what is become 
you for what calamities are you reserved he tells me
it is necessary that i should never see or hear him again
never i his mother reginald there are some wounds
that we may endeavour to forgive but they leave a sentiment
in the heart the demonstrations which may perhaps
be restrained but which it is not in nature wholly to
subdue if i did but know where to find or to write to
my poor boy i would take my girls with me and partake
his honest and honourable poverty and never again join
the shadow him who was my husband forgive me
reginald i did not intend to say this if i should prove
unable to control the impatience my grief do not inflict
the punishment my offence on your innocent daughters

as to your fiction voluntarily leaving him behind
for further improvement it corresponds with every thing
you have lately attempted to make me believe i no longer
expect truth from you for seventeen years i had a husband
well well i ought not perhaps to repine i have
had my share the happiness which the present life is
calculated to afford
reginald i have not long to live when i tell you
this i am not giving way to melancholy presentiment i
will exert myself for the benefit my girls they will
have a grievous loss in me and for their sake i will live
as long as i can but i feel that you have struck me to
the heart my nights are sleepless my flesh is wasted 
my appetite is entirely gone you will presently be able
to judge whether i am deceiving myself the prospect
for these poor creatures who are at present all my care is
a dismal one i know not for what they are reserved but
i can hope for nothing good when i am dead remember
and be a father to them i ask nothing for myself i have
no longer any concern with life but if my dying request
can have weight with you make up to them the duty you
travels st leon 
have broken to me by all our past loves by the cordiality
and confidence in which we have so long lived by the
singleness and sincerity our affection by the pure delights
so seldom experienced in married life that have
attended our union i conjure you listen to me and obey
me in this
if i were deeply distressed for the loss my son if i
looked forward with a mingled sensation eagerness and
alarm to the approaching interview with my family it may
easily be imagined that this letter formed a heavy addition
to my mental anguish i confess i thought it a cruel one
marguerite might well suppose that the departure charles
was a circumstance i must strongly feel and she should
not have thus aggravated the recent wounds paternal
grief some allowance however was to be made for a
mother when we are ourselves racked with intolerable
pain that certainly is not the time at which we can rationally
be expected to exert the nicest and most vigilant consideration
for another add to which she was innocent
 the calamities she suffered and could not but know that
i was their sole author but whatever may be decided as
to the propriety the letter its effect upon my mind waseminently
salutary i instantly determined on the conduct
it became me to pursue
i lost not a moment from dresden to munich i had
advanced with slow and unwilling steps from munich to
constance i proceeded as rapidly as the modes travelling
and the nature the roads would permit i left my retinue
at the gates the town and flew instantly to the
apartments my family i hastened up stairs and as i
entered the sittingroom i saw the first and most exemplary
 matrons surrounded by her blooming daughters i instantly
perceived a great alteration in her appearance her
look was dejected j her form emaciated her countenance
sickly and pale she lifted up her eyes as i entered but
immediately dropped them again without any discernible
expression either congratulation or resentment i embraced
my children with undescribable emotion i said
within myself the love and affection i had reserved for
charles shall be divided among you and added to the share
travels st leon
you each possess my heart having saluted them in
turn i addressed myself to marguerite telling her that i
must have some conversation with her instantly my manner
was earnest she led the way into another apartment
i felt my heart overflowing at my tongue
tf i am come to you cried i a repenting prodigal
take me and mould me at your pleasure 
she looked up she was struck with the honest fervour
 my expression she answered in almost forgotten terms
and with a peculiar fulness meaning my husband 
it seemed as if the best years and the best emotions 
our life were suddenly renewed
most adorable women i continued c do you
think i can bear that you should die and i your murderer
no man in any age or climate the world ever owed so
much to a human creature as i owe to you no woman was
ever so ardently loved no woman ever so much deserved
to be loved if you were to die i should never know
peace again if you were to die the victim any miscalculation
 mine i should be the blackest criminals 
 reginald replied she i am afraid i have been
wrong i am afraid i have written harshly to you you
have a feeling heart and i have been too severe forgive
me it was the effect love affection cannot view with
a tranquil eye the faults the object beloved
let them be forgotten let the last six months be
blotted from our memory be as though they had never
existed 
she looked at me her look seemed to say though she
would not give the sentiment words that can never be the
loss charles and certain other calamities that period
are irretrievable 
 i resign myself into your hands i have been guilty 
i have had secrets meditations engendered and shut up in
my own bosom but it shall be so no more the tide 
affection kept back from its natural channel now flows with
double impetuousness never did i love you not when
you first came a virgin to my arms not on the banks 
the garonne not in the cottage the lake so fervently
so entirely as i love you now be my director do with
travels op st leon 
me as you please i have never been either wise or virtuous
but when i have been implicitly guided by you 
 i have wealth i am forbidden by the most solemn obligations
to discover the source that wealth this only
i may not communicate in all things else govern me despotically
 shall i resign it all shall i return to the
cottage the lake shall i go a houseless and helpless
wanderer to the farthest quarter the globe speak the
word only and it shall be done i prefer your affection
your cordial regard in the most obscure and meanest retreat
to all that wealth can purchase or kings can give 
cc reginald i thank you i acknowledge in your present
language and earnestness the object my first and
only love this return to your true character gives me all
the pleasure i am now capable receiving but it is too
late my son is lost that cannot be retrieved your reputation
is blasted i am sorry you are returned hither 
constance is in arms against you and i will not answer for
the consequence for myself i grieve to tell you so i
am ashamed my weakness but my heart is broken 
i loved you so entirely that i was not able to bear any
suspension our confidence i had passed with you through
all other misfortunes and the firmness my temper was
not shaken for this one misfortune that seemed the entire
dissolution our attachment i was not prepared i
feel every morning as i rise the warnings my decease
my nights are sleepless my appetite is gone from me
oh marguerite talk not thus distract me not with
the most fatal images our confidence shall return 
all the causes your malady shall be removed with the
causes the symptoms depend on it will disappear your
youth your tranquillity your happiness shall be renewed
oh no you shall not die we will yet live to love and
peace 
flatter not yourself with vain hopes my love i feel
something wrong within me which is rapidly wearing my
body to decay reconcile your mind to what very soon
must happen prepare yourself for being the only parent
to your remaining offspring i have composed my spirit
and calmly wait my fate you have now administered to
 travels st leon
me the only consolation i aspired to by this return to your
true character which affords me a sanguine hope that you
will faithfully discharge the duty to your offspring which
when i am gone will be doubly urgent on you
i was grieved to see that the mind marguerite was so
deeply impressed with the notion that she had but a short
time to live i could not bear to imagine for a moment
that her prognostic was just the thought seemed capable
 driving me to distraction i however conceived that
the best thing that could be done for the present was to
turn the conversation to some other topic
well well my love i answered there are some
things that are immediately pressing direct me direct a
husband so amply convinced your discretion what i am
to do at present shall i instantly annihilate all that has
made this unfortunate breach between us j shall i resign
my wealth from whatever source derived whither shall
we go shall we return to the cottage the lake shall
we retreat into some distant part the world 
how can you expect me said marguerite faintly
smiling to advise you respecting the disposal a wealth
 the amount which i am uninformed and the source
 which is invisible but i guess your secret the
stranger who died your guest was in possession the philosopher's
stone and he has bequeathed to you his discovery
i have heard this art though i confess i was not
much inclined to credit it i do not ask you to confirm my
conjecture i do not wish that you should violate my engagements
into which you have entered but upon putting
circumstances together which i have been inevitably
compelled to do i apprehend it can be nothing else i am
astonished that a conjecture so obvious should have offered
itself to my mind so late
if your wealth is any other nature ample as it apparently
is it is a natural question to ask to whom is it to
be resigned the ordinary wealth the world is something
real and substantial and can neither be created nor
dissipated with a breath but if your wealth be the
kind i have named let me ask is it possible to resign it 
a secret is a thing with which wq may choose whether we
travels st leon 
will become acquainted but once known we cannot become
unacquainted with it at pleasure your wealth upon
my supposition will always be at your beck and it is
perhaps beyond the strength human nature to refuse
under some circumstances at least in some emergencies to
use the wealth which is within our reach
it has been our mutual misfortune that such an engine
has been put into your hands it has been your fault to
make an indiscreet use it gladly would i return to the
tranquil and unsuspected poverty the cottage the lake
but that is impossible you have lost your son you have
lost your honest fame the life your marguerite is undermined
and perishing if it were possible for us to
return to our former situation and our former peace still
my reginald forgive me if i say i doubt the inflexibleness
 your resolution the gift unbounded wealth if
you possess it and with wealth apparently at least distinction
and greatness is too powerful a temptation nor
though i should trust your resistance could i be pleased ina
husband with the possession these extraordinary powers
it sets too great a distance between the parties it destroys
that communion spirit which is the soul the marriagetie
a consort should be a human being and an equal but
to this equality and simple humanity it is no longer in your
power to return
circumstanced then as we now are the marriage union
you must allow me to say irreparably dissolved your son
lost your fair fame destroyed your orphan daughters to be
provided for i know not if i should advise you ta forget
the prerogative that has been bought for you at so dreadful
a price beside if i am not mistaken there are great trials
in reserve for you i am afraid your present situation is
extremely critical i am afraid the suspicions you have
excited will cost you dear at all events i believe it to
be but a necessary precaution that we should fly from
constance i have nothing therefore to recommend to
you on the subject wealth but discretion i shall not
long live to be your adviser i shall always regard the
donation you have received you cannot wonder that i
should so regard it as one the most fearful calamities ta
 travels op st leon
which a human being can be exposed if you had used
your prerogative with discretion you might perhaps
though i confess i do not see how have escaped the obloquy
 the world into your domestic scene where the interest
is more lively and the watch upon you more unremitted it
must have introduced alienation and distrust as it is
i see you surrounded with dangers a thousand denominations
police has its eyes upon you superstition will
regard you as the familiar demons avarice will turn
upon you a regard jealousy and insatiable appetite if i
could recover from the weakness that at present besets me
and continue to live i foresee more and severer trials both
at home and abroad than any i have yet sustained and i
am almost thankful to that providence which has decreed
to take me away from the evil to comet
one thing further let me add i will speak it not in
the character a censor but a friend it must ever be
right and useful that a man should be undeceived in any
erroneous estimate he may make himself i have loved
you much i found in you many good qualities my imagination
decorated you in the virtues that you had not but
you have removed the veil an adept and an alchemist is
a low character when i married you i supposed myself
united to a nobleman a knight and a soldier a man who
would have revolted with disdain from every thing that was
poorspirited and base i lived with you long and happily
i saw faults i saw imbecilities i did not see them with
indifference but i endeavoured and with a degree success
to forget and to forgive them they did not contaminate
and corrupt the vitals honour at length you have
completely reversed the scene for a soldier you present
me with a projector and a chemist a coldblooded mortal
raking in the ashes a crucible for a selfish and solitary
advantage here is an all genuine dignity and the
truest generosity soul you cannot be ingenuous for
all your dealings are secrecy and darkness you cannot
have a friend for the mortal lives not that can sympathise
with your thoughts and emotions a generous spirit
reginald delights to live upon equal terms with his associates
and fellows he would disdain when offered to him
excessive and clandestine advantages equality is the soul
travels st leon 
 real and cordial society a man rank indeed does
not live upon equal terms with the whole his species 
but his heart also can exult for he has his equals how
unhappy the wretch the monster rather let me say who
is without an equal who looks through the world and
in the world cannot find a brother who is endowed
with attributes which no living being participates with
him and who is therefore cut off for ever from all cordiality

in the advice marguerite i saw that sound wisdom
and discernment by which in all the periods our connection
she had been so eminently characterised with her
views the future i was not disposed to accord i regarded
them as obscured and discoloured by the unfortunate state
 her health i could not indeed refuse to believe that
the prerogative i had received had been the parent much
domestic unhappiness willingly would i have resigned
all that i had derived from the stranger to be replaced in
the situation in which his pernicious legacies had found me
he had robbed me my son he had destroyed my domestic
peace he had undermined the tranquillity and
health the partner my life these calamities pressed
with a heavy and intolerable weight at my heart but if
as marguerite affirmed they were irretrievable or if they
could once be removed and the domestic advantages i had
heretofore enjoyed be restored i was not disposed to fear
those external mischiefs which marguerite so feelingly predicted
i could not believe that i should have such a
league foreign enemies to encounter nor could i easily
image to myself any external evils which it was not in the
power gold to remedy these considerations i urged to
my beloved partner and by enforcing them endeavoured to
remove those gloomy apprehensions from the prevalence 
which i feared much injury to her health there was
another circumstance i was led particularly to insist on j i
mean the nature the secret intrusted to me
p 
 travels st leon
tf i admire your discernment and ingenuity marguerite
said i in your conjecture respecting the source my
wealth i admire your delicacy in not pressing me to decide
upon the truth your conjecture this only i must
be permitted to say on that subject it is a secret and you
will perceive that the same reasons whatever they are
which make that secret obligatory on me require that it
should be respected by you the same evils that my own
indiscretion may draw on me i shall be equally exposed toby
any error or miscalculation yours i have therefore
most earnestly and solemnly to conjure you whatever misfortunes
may hereafter befall me in whatever perilous situation
i may be involved that you will never utter a syllable
on this subject and that as i am the selected depository 
this secret and alone know with certainty what is its nature
you will trust our prosperity in this point to me marguerite
engaged to conduct herself as i desired
the night which succeeded this explanation was particularly
soothing and grateful to me i was relieved from
a great and oppressive burthen i was conscious that
particular species pleasure which arises from the resolute
discharge an heroic duty the peace i felt within shed
its gay and reviving beams upon all around me reconciled
to myself i was filled with sanguine and agreeable
visions the future my mind obstinately rejected all
dark and hateful presages i had intrusted myself and the
direction my conduct as far as it was possible to that
better pilot under whose guidance if i had not avoided the
rocks and quicksands life i had at least escaped with
little comparative injury i felt therefore as if my domestic
enjoyments were restored and the pleasures my better
years were about to run over again their auspicious career
not so marguerite she was mild gentle and soothing
displeasure and resentment towards me were banished from
her mind she endeavoured to conquer her melancholy
and to forget the wounds that had been so fatal to her
hopes but her endeavours were fruitless a fixed dejection
clung to her heart nor could the generous sweetness
that pervaded her manners hide from me entirely what was
passing in her bosom
during this interval we had talked over the plan our
travels st leon
future operations marguerite was exceedingly urgent with
me to quit constance nor did i though not impressed
with her presentiments feel any reluctance to that change
 scene which i believed would materially contribute to
the serenity her mind and the restoration her health
we determined on some the cities italy as the next
place our residence and fixed if possible to set out
some time in the next day or the day after the plan 
proceeding to france which had lately been a favourite
with me was a favourite no longer that had been the
project cheerful and wanton prosperity it had had for its
object the reestablishment my family honours and the
elevation my son now my son was lost my wife was
oppressed with languor and disease my house was overwhelmed
with sorrow this was no time for wantonness
and triumph if i could ever hope to resume the plans
my frolic fancy had sketched an interval at least soberer
hue must first be suffered to elapse
my mind at this time sustained a revolution sufficiently
remarkable but which the urgency events that immediately
succeeded prevented me from ever ascertaining
whether it would have proved temporary or permanent
when i first received the donation the stranger my
thoughts as i have already said were in a state enthusiastic
transport and amidst the golden visions in which
my fancy revelled i became in a considerable degree alienated
from domestic sentiments and pleasures if i still
loved my wife and children it was the love habit rather
than sympathy more an anxiety for their prosperous success
in the world than an earnest craving for their presence
and intercourse this state intoxication and rapture had
now subsided the events the few last weeks had sobered
my thoughts having lost my son and being threatened
with the loss his mother i was roused to a sense
 their value the influx wealth and supernatural gifts
had grown familiar to my mind and now only occupied
the background the picture i was once more a man
and i hoped to partake the privileges and advantages 
a man the fate reserved for these hopes will speedily be
seen

the morning after my return to my family as i sat surrounded
with my girls and endeavouring to make myself
their playmate and companion certain officers justice
belonging to the supreme tribunal the city entered my
apartment they were sent as they informed me to conduct
me to prison my blood at this intelligence mounted
into my face
 to prison cried i wherefore what have i
done i am no citizen your state what is the charge
against me lead me not to prison lead me to your
chief magistrate 
f you will be called up for examination when his honour
is at leisure to hear you in the mean time you must
go to prison
do those who sent you know that i am a native and
a gentleman france they will be made to repent this
insolence upon what pretence do they dare to act thus 
f you will please not to talk insolence to us if you
do not demean yourself quietly 
silence fellow answered i fiercely lead the
way 
travels st leon 
by this time the children astonished at a scene so alarming
and unintelligible to them began to express their terror
in various ways julia who was ready to faint occupied
the attention her mother the little marguerite clung
round my knees and expressed her emotions by shrieks and
cries to see her father about to be torn from her by four
strangers the peculiarity whose garb office aggravated
the rudeness their countenances and the peremptoriness
 their behaviour was a spectacle which the affectionately
 her nature was unable to endure
ff i will go with you presently said i to the officers
ff see how you have terrified the children 
nay sir if you will behave civilly and make it worth
our while we do not desire to hurry you
i was stung with the brutal assurance with which they
thus set the liberty a few moments at a price to me but
i checked my impatience i felt that it would be both
foolish and degrading to enter into contention with such
wretches i turned from them proudly and took my child
in my arms
i will not be long gone my love said i these
people have made a mistake and i shall soon be able to
rectify it
i fancy not muttered one them surlily
they shall not take you away papa that they shall
not i will hold you and will not let you go 
e you are a good girl marguerite but i know best
what is proper and you must not think to control me
the men will not do me any harm child they dare not
perhaps i shall be back to dinner and mamma will then
tell me how good you have been
as i spoke she looked steadfastly in my face and then
flinging her arms round my neck cried goodby papa 
and burst into a flood tears
i embraced the other children and their mother and
saying to the latter significantly fear nothing you
know i have nothing to fear departed with my conductors

the way to the citadel lay through the marketplace
the scene was already crowded and i had the mortified

travels st leon
tin to be led along as a criminal in the midst a thousand
gazing eyes and enquiring tongues new as everything
connected with my present situation was to me i had
not anticipated this vexation i was stung with shame and
impatience to my dungeon said i to my conductors
sternly if you had shown yourself better humoured
cried the most brutal them we would have led you
round by the back way
the master the prison was somewhat less a savage
than his officers he knew my person and had heard 
my wealth does monsieur choose the best apartment
said he any where that i can be alone answered
i hastily he hesitated a moment i looked in his face 
oh yes you will be paid he bowed and showed
me to a room
i shut the door as he retired what had happened tome
was little importance in itself the impertinence 
bailiffs and thieftakers is no more real moment than the
stinging a gnat but i was so utterly unacquainted with
scenes this nature the pride rank that swelled
within me made every appearance restraint galling to
my sense from the instant i was able to write man no
one except in the voluntary compact military service
had ever said to me go there or do this and now
was i to be directed by the very refuse the species was
i to learn the prudence not replying to their insults 
was i to purchase at a stipulated price their patience and
forbearance i request the reader to pardon me for troubling
him with my noviciate feelings i soon learned to
understand the world the world a prison better 
but what was more importance i was apprehended
as a criminal i had been dragged a prisoner justice
through the streets constance i was by and by to be
subjected to the interrogatories the municipal tribunal
i could scarcely credit my senses that such an indignity
had happened to the blood st leon it is true i was
innocent i was conscious whatever might be my imprudences
and offences towards my own family that i had
done nothing to merit the animadversion public justice
but this was no consequence nothing in my opinion
travels st leon 
could wipe away the disgrace being interrogated examined
 having for an instant imputed to me the possibility
 being a criminal i writhed under this dishonour
and felt it as a severer attack than the question which was
comparatively ceremony and etiquette that had oppressed
me in my residence at dresden
the next day when i was brought up for examination
i had expected to be the complainant in demanding redress
for the injury i had sustained but i was mistaken

i entered the room haughtily and with the air a man
that felt himself aggrieved this however the magistrate
took no notice do you know sir said i that i ama
citizen and a gentleman france are you acquainted
with the treatment i have experienced have you lent
your authority to that treatment 
wait a few minutes replied he with an imperious
tone and i shall be at leisure to attend to you
i was silent after the interval nearly a quarter 
an hour he resumed
you call yourself the count de st leon 
i do
perhaps sir you are uninformed the purity with
which justice is administered in the city within whose jurisdiction
you now stand our state is a small one and its
magistrates are therefore enabled to discharge the office 
a parent not only to its proper citizens but to all strangers
that place themselves under its protection
i remember sir that seven years ago i and my wife
and four children sick and unfriended were upon the
point perishing with hunger within the walls this
city the fact i mentioned was wholly foreign to the
point with which i was at present concerned but the
parading arrogance the man brought it forcibly to my
memory and wrung it from my lips
monsieur le comte replied he you are petulant
it is not the office a state to feed the souls it contains 
it could not do that without making them slaves its
proper concern is to maintain them in that security and
freedom action which may best enable them to support
themselves
 travels st leon
i suppressed the emotions which the tone this speech
excited i was unwilling to enter into contention with a man
whom i regarded as inexpressibly my inferior
is it cried i sternly a part the justice you boast
 to drag a man rank and a stranger from his home
without any intimation the cause his being so treated
and then instead investigating immediately the charge
against him to send him to prison unheard i disdain to
mention the behaviour your officers those things naturally
grow out the abuses practised by their superiors
the mode our proceeding replied he depends
upon the seriousness the crime imputed if a man 
distinction labours under a slight accusation only we then
treat him with all proper forbearance and respect but
when he is suspected a crime more than ordinary
magnitude that alters the case the man who has ceased
to respect himself must look for no respect from others
i was for a moment thunderstruck and speechless at
length fiercely i cried produce my accusers 
that is not the mode proceeding in constance i
have certain questions to propound to you when you have
answered them we shall see what is to be done next
carry me before the princebishop your city if i
am to be examined further let it be by your sovereign 
the princebishop moved by the state our affairs in
matters religion has been prevailed on to delegate his
juridical authority i am the person to whom the cognisance
 your business belongs and at certain times aided
by my assessors have the power life and death within
this city you have had every indulgence to which you
are entitled and it will be your wisdom to be no further
refractory
propose your questions 
e a person apparently greatly advanced in years arrived
in the autumn last year at a miserable farm you at that
time cultivated called the cottage the lake it is to
him that my questions will principally relate
i stood aghast the words the magistrate were most
unwelcome sounds i remembered that the stranger had
said to me when i am once buried speak me and
travels op st leon 
if possible think me no more i replied with eagerness
and alarm
 that person i have nothing to say spare your
questions i have no answer to return you 
what was his name 
i know not
his country
i cannot inform you
it is understood that he died or in some manner disappeared
while under your protection yet in the registers
 the church there is no notice that event if he
died no application was made for the rites religion to
him dying or to his body when his spirit had deserted it
you are required to answer what became him or his
remains 
i have already told you that from me you will obtain
no information
one question more sir seven years ago you tell me
you and your family were perishing with hunger soon
after you removed from obscure lodgings in this city to
the cottage the lake and seemed to be laudably employed
in earning for yourself a scanty livelihood with the labour
 your hands but within the last six months the scene
is wholly changed you appear to have suddenly grown
rich and here and in other parts germany have actually
disbursed considerable sums whence comes this
change
the train questions thus proposed to me impelled me
to a serious reply
 monsieur le juge said i c i am a stranger a native
 france and a man rank in my own country i have
paid your state the compliment choosing it for my residence
i have expended my industry i expend my wealth
among you i have comported myself as a peaceable inhabitant
no action my life has brought scandal upon
your state or disturbed the peace and tranquillity your
affairs i cannot collect from any thing you have said
that i have any accuser or that any charge has been alleged
against me till that happens i cannot fall under
your animadversion i am a man generous birth and
travels st leon
honourable sentiments to myself and my own conscience
only am i accountable for my expenditure and my income
i disdain to answer to any tribunal on earth an enquiry 
this sort and now sir in conclusion what i demand 
you is first my liberty and secondly an ample reparation
for the interruption i have sustained and the insults to
which i have causelessly been exposed
you are mistaken sir said the magistrate what
you mention may be the rule administering justice in
some states they may decide if they think proper that
some open act apparently a criminal description must
be alleged against a man before he can become an object 
animadversion to the state but in constance as i have
already told you the government assumes to act the part 
a parent to its subjects i sit here not merely to investigate
and examine definite acts but as a censor morum and
i should violate the oath my office if i did not lend a
vigilant attention to the behaviour and conduct every one
within my jurisdiction the city constance requires
that nothing immoral licentious or suspicious character
shall be transacted within its walls your proceedings
have escaped notice too long much longer than they would
have done but for your late absence in cases where what
is committed is merely immoral or licentious we content
ourselves with sending the offender out our walls but
your case is a complicated nature it has scandalised
all the inhabitants our virtuous and religious city unless
you answer my enquiries and give a clear and satisfactory
account your wealth i am bound to believe that
there is something in the business that will not bear the
light the coincidence times obliges me to connect the
disappearance your guest and the sudden growth your
fortune this connection gives rise to the most alarming
suspicions i have therefore to inform you that unless
you honourably clear up these suspicions by the most ample
communication my duty directs me to remand you to
prison and to assure you that you will not be liberated
thence till you have satisfied the whole my interrogatories

c think deliberately answered i your decision
travels st leon 
before you form it your prisons i despise but i will
not suffer my reputation and my honour to be trifled with
i came before you willingly though i could easily have
avoided doing so because i was eager to clear my fame
i expected accusers and i knew i could confound accusation
but what is this that you call justice you put
together circumstances in your own mind you form conjectures
 and then without information accuser or oath
without the semblance guilt you condemn me to prison
and expect to extort from me confession in defect 
articles charge i disdain to answer the only return a
man honour should make to loose conjectures and random
calumnies is silence i am descended from a race 
heroes knights the cross and champions france and
their blood has not degenerated in my veins i feel myself
animated by the soul honour and incapable crime
i know my innocence and i rest upon it with confidence
your vulgar citizens habituated to none but the groveling
notions traffic and barter are not the peers st leon
nor able to comprehend the views and sentiments by which
he is guided
ee you are mighty wellspoken monsieur st leon replied
the magistrate and your words are big and sounding
but we know that the devil can assume the form an angel
and that the most infamous and profligate character can
pronounce with emphasis sentiments the purest virtue
you are pleased to decide that the presumptions against you
are nothing but calumnies is it nothing that having received
a stranger and retained him with you for months
you endeavoured to conceal this fact and never suffered
him to be seen by a human creature is his final disappearance
nothing is it nothing that supposing him to be
dead as he probably is you denied to his remains the rites
 funeral and refuse to tell what is become the body 
is it nothing that upon the death this stranger you
who were before in a state almost penury suddenly appear
to be possessed unbounded riches where is the
will this stranger in what archives have you deposited
the declaration his wealth let me tell you sir that
these presumptions which you call nothing form a body 
 travels st leon
circumstantial evidence that in many countries would have
led you to the scaffold as a murderer but the laws 
constance which you audaciously revile are the mildest in
the universe here we never put a man to death but on
his own confession we simply condemn him to perpetual
imprisonment or until he makes a declaration his guilt
you refuse to declare the name or country the man
whom you are suspected murdering and then have the
assurance to boast that no private accuser rises against you
no sir we know there can be no private accuser where the
connections the party can be successfully concealed but
shall this concealment which is an aggravation the murder
prove its security in conclusion you boast your
blood and heroic sentiments and rail at our citizens as
shopkeepers and merchants let me tell you sir shopkeepers
and merchants though we are we should scorn to
conduct ourselves in the obscure and suspicious manner
that you have done and now i have taken the trouble
to refute your flimsy pretences which it was wholly unnecessary
for me to do i have done with you you know
your destination unless you are prepared immediately to give
a satisfactory account yourself and your proceedings
finding it impossible to make on this man the impression
i desired i declined entering into further parley and
telling him that i should convey a representation my
case to my native sovereign and did not doubt soon to
make him feel the rashness his proceeding i withdrew
in the custody the officers who had conducted me to the
scene audience i was i confess struck with the coincidence
 circumstances which the magistrate had placed
in a light equally unexpected and forcible and which i
now saw calculated to subject me to the most injurious
suspicions i was not disposed in the smallest degree to
yield to the attack but i felt a desire to act deliberately
and with caution the whole what i had heard was
utterly unforeseen and it was with peculiar anguish that i
became aware this new consequence the stranger's pernicious
donation this was a consequence that no resignation
no abjuration his bequests could cure and that
must be stood up to with manly courage if any hope were
entertained averting it

chapter xxi
the appearance wealth that accompanied me had by
this time made its impression upon my keepers and one
 them now informed me that monsieur monluc an agent
 the court france who was making a tour several
 the german states hy order his sovereign had arrived
the night before at the city constance there was no
representative my country regularly resident here and
i immediately felt the presence monluc to be the most
fortunate event that could have occurred for effecting my
honourable deliverance selfishness and avarice it may bethought
would rather have impelled the persons who had
me in custody to conceal from me a circumstance calculated
to deprive them an advantageous prey but in
those groveling souls from whom riches never fail to extort
homage however strange it may seem the homage often
appears disinterested they pay it by a sort irresistible
instinct and admiring what they covet at an awful distance
with difficulty assume the courage to pollute their
worship with ideas calculation and gain
i immediately addressed a memorial to this gallant soldier
with whose person indeed i was unacquainted but
the fame whose spirit and enterprise had not failed to
have reached me i represented to him that i was a
frenchman family and distinction that i had been
seized upon and was retained in prison by the magistrates
here without accuser or the hope a trial that i had not
been guilty the shadow a crime and that i knew the
benignity and courage my sovereign would never permit
a subject france to languish under calumny and oppression
in a foreign country i added that he would do an
acceptable service to king francis to whom i had the honour
to be known by interfering in my favour and therefore
entreated him to obtain for me immediate justice and
deliverance monluc returned me an answer by the bearer
 my memorial assuring me that he would lose no time
in enquiring into the merits my case and that i might
travels st leon
depend upon receiving every assistance from him that a
man honour could desire
the warmth and frankness this answer filled me with
hope for there was no deliverance from my present situation
that i could contemplate with satisfaction but such
a one as should be accompanied with reparation and eclat
three days however elapsed before i heard again from the
french envoy on the morning the fourth he announced
his intention visiting me and about an hour after
arrived at the prison his appearance was striking he
was tall slender and well made with a freedom carriage
not derived from the polish courts but which appeared
to flow from the manliness and active energies 
his mind his hair and complexion were dark the former
though he was still young rather scantily shaded a high
and ample forehead his features were expressive the
sanguine and dust temper his mind and though his
eye was animated his countenance as he entered struck
me as particularly solemn
 you are the count de st leon said he
i am
you sent me a memorial a few days ago complaining
 the tribunal this city i am afraid sir i can do nothing
for you
my countenance fell as he spoke i gasped for breath
i had conceived a most favourable anticipation as he entered
and my disappointment was particularly cruel i
had said in my heart this is the very man to rescue my
injured fame
i see sir you are disappointed resumed he
have not given up the affair if i had this visit which i
design as a mark attention would be an insult the
moment i received your memorial i paid the utmost regard
to it if the affair had been as you represented it i
know i could not do any thing more acceptable to my sovereign
than interfere in your behalf i have spent the
whole interval in investigating the case i have seen the
magistrate who committed you i have visited the spot
where your crime is alleged to have been perpetrated i
have had an interview with your wife
travels st leon 
well sir cried i alarmed and impatient well
sir and the result 
appearances are uncommonly strong against you they
can scarcely be stronger but you have a right to be heard 
it is for the sake discharging that last act justice that
you see me this morning
f great god exclaimed i overwhelmed with chagrin
f is if possible that my countryman the man to whom i
was proud and happy to appeal the gallant monluc should
believe me a murderer i swear by every thing that is
sacred by the blood him that died for me on the cross
and by my eternal salvation that i am as innocent as the
child unborn 
i am glad to hear you express yourself with this emphasis
and fervour i cannot but say that to my own
feelings it has great weight but i must not suffer myself
as a man and still less in the public capacity in which i
stand to heovercome and confounded by your asseverations
there is a connected and most unfavourable story against
you this it is incumbent on you to clear up
and you say you have seen my wife i was distracted
and overwhelmed by monluc's way putting the
question i was divided between my anxiety to be justified
and the solemn mystery the affair to which his enquiries
led and i probably spoke thus from an unconscious desire
to gain time
 yesthat is another presumption in your favour madame
de st leon is perhaps the most striking and extraordinary
woman i ever saw the husband such a woman
especially when he appears to be the object her attachment
i should be always inclined to think well madame
de st leon pleaded for you with earnestness and affection
but amidst all her ardour i could perceive that she felt
there was something mysterious and unpleasant in the affair
that she was unable to developed
as monluc spoke i saw that i had failed in one the
main anchors my hope i thought that no one could
have talked with my beloved marguerite and have left her
with the opinion that i was a murderer how did this happen
 was she lukewarm and unfaithful in my vindication 
 travels st leon
what she continued my countryman i could see
was not only unable to explain hut did not fully understand
it is you alone can clear the concealment the
stranger his disappearance what became the body and
your own sudden transition from poverty to wealth
i was by this time fully sensible the nature my
situation i summoned my fortitude i felt that i had no
longer any hope but in the dignity innocence
you call on me for explanation replied i can
you not conceive gallant monluc that i may be able to
resolve your doubts and yet that i will not explanation
is not the business a man honour he cannot stoop
to it he will win the applause and approbation mankind
if won in silence he will hold on the even course
 a generous spirit and turn neither to the right nor to the
left to court the suffrage or deprecate the condemnation 
a giddy multitude such my brave countryman have been
the maxims my past life such will be the maxims 
my future
i admire answered monluc at least the gallantry
 these sentiments though i may be inclined to doubt their
prudence but if such is your determination permit me
to say you have no concern with me he who resolutely
withholds explanation must arm himself with patience and
either wait the operation time or rest satisfied with the
consciousness his innocence
and is that all will there not be some noble spirits
who separating themselves from the herd will judge 
him by what they feel in their own breasts and be drawn
to him with an irresistible impulse was it not natural
that i should expect monluc to be one these it would
be hard indeed if he who disdains to temporise with
popularity and to vindicate himself from the ungenerous
constructions sordid minds should not by that very proceeding
secure the friendship and sympathy those whose
friendship it will be most grateful to him to possess
the friends an innocent man whom a combination
 circumstances has exposed to the most painful suspicions
must always be few he can scarcely expect the acquittal
and sympathy a stranger i must know i must have
travels st leon 
felt and observed in a man a thousand virtues before i can
be entitled to treat accumulated presumptions against him
as nothing
and thus then are to my hopes in monluc he
does not feel that i am innocent he does not recognise
in me the countenance the voice the turn thought a
brother a man no less incapable than himself every thing
disgraceful and ignominious be it so i will as you advise
me rest upon the consciousness my innocence a
frenchman the descendant illustrious ancestors long an
exile long the victim adversity but at all times conscious
 the purity my sentiments and the integrity my
conduct i will not suffer myself to be overwhelmed with
this last desertion this ultimate refusal justice 
count de st leon your appeal is full energy in
whatever way i decide it will leave an unpleasant sensation
in my breast let us suppose that as a private man
i could take you to my arms and dismiss every unfavourable
appearance from my mind you must remember that
i am here in a public character and that only in a public
character am i capable affording you assistance thus
situated i am bound to resist the impulses a romantic
and irregular confidence and to do nothing which i shall
not be able to render a clear and intelligible account
tf let us not part thus it is not the vindication 
your character to the world with which we are at present
concerned it is only necessary that you should furnish a
sufficient ground to justify me to myself for interfering in
your behalf explain to me the particulars your casein
confidence if you will but fully and without reserve i
will not abuse your confidence i will make no use your
communication but such as you shall yourself approve
only enable me to have a reason for acting that is not
merely capable being felt but that i may know is in its
own nature capable being stated to another it is upon
me that you call to take certain measures you must enable
me to judge their propriety
you are mistaken when you suppose the appearances
against you to be slight it is not a slight circumstance
that you profess to be ignorant or have refused to disci

 travels st leon
close the country the connections and even the name 
the stranger whom you so anxiously concealed the disappearance
 his body is still more extraordinary what
intelligible motive except a guilty one can i assign for
that but your sudden wealth immediately after this disappearance
is especially material it is a broad and glaring
fact that men cannot shut their eyes on if they would
the chain and combination events that proceeds systematically
from link to link is the criterion guilt and
the protector reputation your case as it now stands
is scarcely to be termed equivocal upon the supposition 
your criminality all is plain and easy to be accounted for 
upon any other supposition it appears an inscrutable mystery
place but the balance even present to me an exposition
 these facts that shall make your innocence not less
probable than your guilt and as i feel myself interested
for you and your family and as the presumption when
matters are doubtful ought always to be on the favourable
side i consent to be your friend 
how unfortunate i exclaimed am i doomed to be 
your proposal is liberal and generous but i must refuse
it my story is an unhappy one particulars have been
reposed in my fidelity which i am not at liberty to communicate
but which if communicated you would not regard
as dishonourable i may be made the martyr infamy
and the abhorrence my species i can endure
adversity and anguish i can die but that which you
demand from me never can be confided to any mortal ear 
as you please rejoined monluc the secrets a
dead man to be preserved after his death and that to the
ruin him who is their depository must i believe be
villanous secrets and the secret a villain no one is bound
to observe you must further give me leave to tell you
that whatever a high strained sense honour might dictate
in that point the fortune you possess is your own affair
and to dissipate or not the mystery which hangs upon that
is wholly at your discretion but i have already advanced
as far perhaps further than circumstances or propriety
could justify and there can now be no more parley between
us
travels st leon 
monluc cried i i submit however harsh your
decision is as towards me however painful and unfortunate
its consequences i will admit it to be that which duty prescribes
to you i struggle i contend no further one
thing only i would willingly obtain you that you would
interpose your influence to obtain for me the society and
intercourse my family the transaction this day will
then be remembered by me with respect towards you and
a melancholy regret that i could riot entitle myself to your
esteem i shall recollect with pleasure that i owe something
to the generosity monluc
incredible pertinacity exclaimed my visitor with a
voice perplexity and astonishment what am i to
conceive you under what appearance shall i consider
you in the records my memory your silence is the indication
 guilt and in that indication i ought to acquiesce
yet the fortitude your manner and something i
know not what emotion that your manner produces in
my own bosom would fain persuade me you are innocent
why will you leave me a prey to this contention thought
if all men constituted as i am were to feel in you as it
were the magnetism innocence shame the simple inference
 understanding and the general sense mankind
would oblige them to treat you as guilty what i can
however be assured i will cheerfully do for you i cannot
deliver you from prison but i will not fail to obtain the
mitigation you ask farewell 
such was the issue my interview with monluc it
was clear that my reputation was wounded beyond the power
 remedy while the question had only been a magistrate
haughty supercilious insolent and unfeeling i flattered
myself that the harshness the conclusions that were
drawn might be ascribed to the depravity his character
but monluc was the reverse this man he was not less
generous and heroic than the magistrate was gross and illiberal
his desire to relieve me was not less apparent than
the magistrate's eagerness to oppress yet his conclusion
was the same and was felt by me so much the more bitterly
in proportion to the humanity the kindness the intrepidity
and the virtue the man from whom it flowed
q 
travels st leon
virtue and vice barbarism and refinement were equally
engaged in the concert against me and there was no chance
i should triumph in a contention with so many enemies
i might now be said to have reached the my adventure
 i had closed one grand experiment upon the
donation the stranger what had it produced to me 
not one atom the benefits i anticipated not a particle 
those advantages which a little while ago had made the in
toxicationsof my waking dreams its fruits had been distasteful
and loathsome whether i looked to my person
my family or my fame i had felt in all the miserable
effects this treacherous and delusive gift my person
was shut up in prison and i was now to make an experiment
whether by clandestine and secret proceedings wealth
could restore to me the liberty which wealth had deprived
me my family was blasted my wife was struck to the
heart and no mortal skill could restore the wound she had
suffered my son was gone unaided into voluntary exile
that he might shun the contagion my follies what was
i to do with the poor remains my house forlorn dejected
and wretched the wound my good name had
received was the most decisive species when i first
encountered contumely at dresden and was called on for
explanation by coligny the difficulties my condition
struck anguish to my soul but what were they compared
with what had now overtaken me i was charged with
robbery and murder with every thing that combines the
whole species against the perpetrator and determines them
without sense compunction to extirpate him from the
face the earth perhaps it was only by the courtesy 
the laws this state that i was permitted my choice between
an ignominious death and perpetual imprisonment
i might possibly indeed escape from my confinement i
might pass into a distant country i might be fortunate
enough to cut off all connection between my past and my
future life and thus enter upon a new career but this to
a man honourable mind is a miserable expedient with
what feelings does he recollect that there is a spot where
his name is abhorred where a story is told against him to
excite the wonder the ignorant and the torpid feelings 
travels st leon 
the sluggish soul a story to darken with new infamy the
records guilt and to infect the imagination the solitary
man with nameless horrors to be the theme such a
tale is no common evil no matter how far the man to
whom it relates shall remove from the detested spot the
spot itself with all its chain circumstances will often
recur the voices that repulsed and humbled him will ring
in his ear the degraded figure he made will rise for ever
fresh to his imagination he cannot ascend to any free and
lofty sentiment he cannot attain the healthful tone unblemished
virtue j wherever he goes he carries the arrow
 disgrace in his bosom and when he would erect his head
on high it reminds him the past and stings him to the
heart
if the consciousness all this would have been painful
to any other man what was it to me who had been
brought up from my infancy in the opinion that fame was
the first all human possessions and to whom honour
and an unimpeached integrity had ever been more necessary
than my daily food or than the life which that food supported
 what would i not have given could i have returned
to the situation in which the inauspicious arrival the
stranger had found me but that was impossible if all
that i had recently passed through could but have proved a
dream if i could have awakened and freed myself from the
phantoms this horrible vision how happy beyond all
names happiness should i by such an event have been
made what a lesson would it have taught me the
emptiness and futility human wishes what a sovereign
contempt would it have impressed upon me for wealth and
all its train ostentation how profound a feeling contentment
with humble circumstances and a narrow station
would it have produced in my mind alas the conception
 those advantages and that peace was the illusion and not
the evils i had sustained and from which i could not
escape 
q

meanwhile it was necessary that i should make the best
 the present circumstances my heart was wounded my
spirit was in a manner broken but not so utterly withered
and destroyed as to make me rest supine in perpetual imprisonment
i felt with equal conviction and pungency
that my character and my happiness had sustained the
deepest injuries but i felt it incumbent on me to collect
and improve the fragments that remained for some days
indeed after the conference with monluc i was sunk in the
deepest dejection but as that dejection subsided i began
to turn a steady attention upon the future i recollected
that an eternal and inexhaustible gift deserved to be made
the subject more than one experiment before a decision
was formed upon its merits i shall become wiser said i
as i go forward experience however bitter will teach
me sagacity and discrimination my next experiment shall
be made with more prudence and a soberer gradation i
will remove to some distant country where the disadvantages
 my past adventures shall not follow me i will
take a new name i shall then enjoy the benefit a tyro
just entering a scene to all the personages which he is
wholly unknown i shall be like a serpent that has stripped
its tarnished and wrinkled skin and comes forth in all the
gloss and sleekness youth surely in an unknown land
with the prejudice wealth in my favour and no prejudices
against me i shall know how to conduct myself so as
to obtain honour and respect it is impossible that inexhaustible
wealth and immortal youth gifts so earnestly
coveted by every creature that lives gifts which if i were
known to possess my whole species from the mere impulses
 envy would probably combine to murder me as not able
to endure the sight one so elevated above his brethren
it is impossible that such gifts should not be pregnant with
variety joy
marguerite greatly contributed to raise me from the
dejection into which my imprisonment and the conference
travels st leon 
 monluc had sunk me she was my better genius i
had been so accustomed to receive consolation from her lips
in the most trying circumstances that now the very sound
 her voice was able to smooth my wrinkled brow and
calm my agitated spirit i listened as to the sound an
angelic lyre i was all ear i drank in the accents her
tongue and in the dear delight my cares were hushed
and my sorrows at an she talked to me her daughters
whom she represented as about to have no protector
but their father she urged me to watch over them and to
take such steps as should most conduce to their future virtue
and happiness she pointed out the practicability 
escape and recommended to me to fly to some distant
country the dreams future prosperity from the gifts 
the stranger were not hers they were all my own it was
inexpressibly affecting at this time to receive consolation
from her who had no consolation in her own breast who
had bid farewell to all the gay attractions the world and
talked familiarly her death as a thing certain to happen
in no very long time she had lost the purest gratifications
 the domestic scene she had lost her son her heart
was broken yet with her dying accents she sought to dispel
retrospect and inspire cheerfulness in the breast her
husband
the reader may perhaps imagine that i was something
too sanguine when surrounded with jailors and all the
precautions a prison i planned the nature and scene 
my next residence exactly as if i had been a person at
large but i took it for granted that the power money
i possessed would easily unlock to me the gates my captivity
i believed that upon the lowest calculation personal
liberty was clearly included among the gifts the
stranger impressed with this opinion t fixed upon a
negro a servant the prison and who had the keys my
apartment as the subject my pecuniary experiment the
idea applying to him had perhaps first occurred to me
from the mere circumstance my seeing him more frequently
than any other attendant the prison when i
thought further the matter i judged from the meanness
 his rank and his apparent poverty that i could not have
 travels st leon
chosen better so far as related to the sum to be paid as
the price my liberty it was indeed indifferent to me
whether it were large or small i had however suffered so
much from the inconsiderate lavishing wealth that i had
no inclination on the present occasion to make ostentation
 more than was necessary but what was most importance
to me i was desirous that my first experiment
should be a successful one though not unaware the
power gold i conceived that among persons middling
rank and easier circumstances there might be varieties
 disposition and i might be mistaken in my choice
some might have the whim integrity or might place a
sturdy sort pride in showing that they were content with
what they had and were too high for a bribe there
might be persons who though plebeian rank might value
reputation as much as ever i had done and be opinion
that no advance station could compensate for the name
or the consciousness dishonour these distinctions may
seem an idle and superfluous refinement when it is considered
that i had the power raising my bribe to the level
 any man's honesty or pride be it as great as it might 
and it may be thought that my offer might be so increased
as to be too dazzling for mortal firmness to resist be that
as it will i am merely stating the reflections that passed
through my mind not entering into their vindication
taking the first opportunity then accosting this man
when he was alone with me i addressed him thus 
my good friend are not you poor 
yes sir
would not you readily do me a kindness 
if my master give me leave i will
you mistake me would you be my friend 
e i do not know what you mean sir i have been used
to call the man i love my friend if you mean that you
know i cannot choose whether i wil be a man's friend it
comes itself
 can i not make you my friend 
that is make me love you 
i was surprised at the propriety his answers i am
unable at this distance time to recall the defects his
travels st leon 
language and i disdain the mimic toil inventing a
jargon for him suitable to the lowness his condition the
sense what he said i faithfully report i had before been
struck with a certain correctness thinking in him 
but i now examined his countenance more attentively than
i had ever before done and thought i could distinctly
trace in it the indications a sound understanding and an
excellent heart
i do not know sir continued he if i see that
you are a good man i believe i shall love you but if it
happened that you were good and generous to me i am sure
i should love you very much
 you are very poor 
so they tell me i never had more than a shilling or
two at a time in my life
it is a very sad thing to be poor 
fe why yes so i have heard sir but for my own
part i am always merry and gay
my good fellow i will make you rich
thank you sir but what good will that do me 
f you are a servant i will make you a master 
servants
now that i should not like at all i am merry because
i am lighthearted if i had money and property
to take care and servants to direct i am afraid they
would make me grave and suspicious and in every respect
unlike what you see me
es is it possible you should be pleased with your present
situation under the orders one man in a house and
obliged to play the tyrant to the rest 
why as you say sir there may be more agreeable
situations than the life a jail but as to being under
orders i have no objection to that i never knew any other
condition and therefore i am contented it is not pleasant
indeed to have a master who is always scolding and dissatisfied
 but the gentleman i serve at present is reasonable
 i know how to content him and when i have done
that he leaves me to please myself you offer me money 
now sir that is not what i call being generous i count
nothing for much except when a man shows me has bowels
 travels st leon
and convinces me that he thinks justice due even to a
negro i dare say however you designed it for generosity
and expected something from me in return tell me what
it is you want and whatever i can do with propriety you
may depend on it i will
do you approve a man's being deprived his
liberty 
 will you please to tell me what you mean by liberty 
you offered me just now what you called liberty and independence
 and i am content to be a servant
would you be pleased instead being a turnkey to
have the key turned on yourself
that i should not i understand the disagreeableness
 that well enough for when i first entered this place it
was as a prisoner
if then my good fellow you were convinced that i
was a man disposed to be generous to you in your own
way and to deserve your attachment and love surely you
would not refuse to deliver me from a situation which you
have yourself felt to be so disagreeable and calamitous

genius temper in this one particular assumed the guise 
cunning never did he tell his love in the ear any indifferent
auditor assiduously did he avoid pronouncing
even the name her to whom he was attached in any
other case he would have announced to me his inclinations
and previously demanded my leave absence for his excursions
but love seemed to him imperiously to command
privacy and he employed every imaginable precaution to
prevent me and all human beings from knowing whither he
went or that he was absent at all
in one his visits to his fair donzella he happened incautiously
to drop some very remote hint the scenes hi
which he had just been engaged with me in my secret
grotto the curiosity the girl was strongly roused she
questioned him further he started and was terrified to
recollect what he had said i had strictly enjoined him
secrecy towards every member my family my precaution
had extended no further for as i have said i
scarcely knew that he had the most casual intercourse with
any person beyond my own roof but hector naturally
dreaded that what i was so earnest to conceal from everyone
in my house he would be highly to blame to communicate
to a stranger he therefore peremptorily refused
and with many signs distress to say another word on the
subject
the donzella piqued at his resistance had recourse to
female arts she was cruel she uttered words sharp
displeasure and disdain she knew that a person who refused
her such a trifle could not have an atom regard for
her she commanded him never to see her more unsuccessful
in these expedients she had recourse to expedients
 a different sort she wept she called him base falsehearted
and unkind she saw he was determined to be the
death her she was seized with strong fits sobbing
and hysterical affection in the midst all this he was
as unmoved as a rock marble he interpreted everything
that passed in its most literal form he felt more
severely her unkindness and sympathised more truly in her
distress than perhaps any human creature would have done
but no further could she gain upon him the confidence
travels st leon 
 his master was in question and he would sooner have
died upon the rack than run the slightest risk betraying
it
from these arts she descended to arts more congenial to
the habits her life she summoned all her skill to perplex
him with cunning and insidious questions from her
questions he ought to have fled but this hector was incapable
he was distressed by her severity he grieved for
the unintentional pain he had caused her all these circumstances
melted his heart and he could not resolve upon
anything that was not considerate and respectful towards her
as the framing artful questions was the stronghold 
the donzella and she might have challenged in this article
the most hoary practitioner the quibbling bar so it was
exactly the weakest side upon which poor hector could be
attacked his simplicity yielded him up a defenceless prey
to the assailant least all human undertakings was he capable
 detecting the various faces a doubtful question
and guarding himself against the traps an insidious
foe it was not till the fourth interview from hector's original
hint that the donzella had recourse to this species 
attack and she did not withdraw her forces till she had
extorted from him all he knew
when hector found that all his guards were baffled and
put to flight he had then recourse to the only expedient
that remained conjuring her by every thing sacred and
every thing tremendous not to betray a trust she had so
ungenerously obtained from him she readily promised
every thing he desired soothed by her compliance he
determined not to mention to me the lapse which he had
been guilty it would in his opinion have been little less
than treason to suspect his dulcinea indiscretion or
frailty in the breast this miracle nature was not his
loyalty as secure as it could be even in his own why
then should he betray the secret his love which had
never yet been confided even to the senseless air why
should he subject himself to the inconceivable anguish and
confusion owning where my interests or where my
wishes were concerned that he had been found tripping
and imperfect why should he inflict a pain or cause
travels op st leon
in me a fear which he knew and he only could know
was groundless thus it happened that had one more
confident what i purposed should be secret than i was
myself in the smallest degree advertised 
the consequences this indiscretion my servant were
not slow in rendering themselves visible the donzella
was by no means so scrupulous or delicate in her sentiments
as my humble but faithful attendant as she had
given her company to hector she had had an opportunity
 observing in him such integrity and goodness heart
as could not fail to extort the esteem any human being
she really honoured him she was unwilling to give him
any cause uneasiness but she had another lover perhaps
she had more the laws chastity she regarded as
prejudices and believed they were never formed for persons
in her situation in society she was opinion that the
more lovers she had provided she satisfied them all the
more completely did she improve the talents with which
heaven had endowed her few women have any secrets
for the man they admit to their embraces in an hour 
amorous dalliance she communicated to agostino the ostler
all that she knew the conjurations and spells monsieur
boismorand such was the name i had assumed upon my
entrance into italy her communication was probably attended
with cautions imitated from those with which hector
had so industriously loaded the donzella in the preceding
example perhaps the illustrissimo agostino had another
mistress with whom he thought it would be unjust to
practise greater reserves than the donzella had done with
him be that as it will the rumours which were whispered
to my prejudice speedily got air and it may be were repeated
with the greater avidity on account the mystery
that attended them and the injunctions secrecy with
which they were accompanied
travels st leon 
chapter xxv
italy may be considered as the very focus and parent 
superstitious credulity the materials which hector had
furnished after all the interrogations the donzella were
slight compared with the superstructure which was presently
erected on them my grotto was said to be the appropriated
haunt where a thousand devils held their infernal
sabbath the terrified imagination the rustics listening
with a temper horribly distracted between curiosity and
alarm created to itself fictitious bowling arid shrieks and
saw pale and sulphureous flames dancing upon the surface
 the stream poor hector was early the victim their
cruel and untamed ignorance they believed that the peculiarity
 his complexion rendered him a singularly agreeable
intercessor between me and my infernal familiars
the colour charon was similar to that my confidential
attendant and he like hector fell under the calumnious
misconstructions the affrighted villagers conspicuously
noble affectionate and useful as he was the
jaundiced eye superstition metamorphosed him into a
devil the storms thunder and lightning to which the
climate in which i resided is particularly subject acquired
new terror from the ill fame which now pursued the name
 monsieur boismorand at those times the shapeless
form monsters vomiting smoke and flames were visible
to the neighbourhood sometimes scudding along the blue
tops the distant hills and at others with audaciousness
incredible brushing even at the elbow the almost lifeless
clowns and dairymaids and then suddenly dissolving into
air their place no longer marked but by the noisome and
deadly stench they left behind all the misfortunes the
district were imputed to me the mortality cattle the
convulsions and death children and the pale and lingering
decay persons recently advanced to an age puberty
innocent and blameless was my conduct to all
around us often was i forward and eager for the relief 
 travels st leon
the poor and afflicted never was i the author the
slightest inconvenience or prejudice to any yet nothing
merely human could be hated in the degree in which i was
hated few were daring and intrepid enough to repeat the
very name i bore and when it was inadvertently pronounced
it produced through the whole extent the
astonished circle an involuntary and supernatural shudder
agostino the first lover who had made an impression on
the heart hector's donzella was as i afterwards found
a fellow a gloomy and ferocious disposition a true italian
spadaccino determined that none should perpetrate an affront
against him with impunity but should expiate in
some refined and cruel vengeance the levity by which they
had been so unfortunate as to give birth to his hatred he
by no means relished or approved the liberal and goodhumoured
sentiments the donzella often had they inflicted
on him the darkest torments jealousy nor had he failed
at least in one preceding instance to make his rival the
victim his resentment the donzella however went on
in her career she was light heart gay in temper and
careless consequences she had always hitherto succeeded
by playful blandishments or more serious demonstrations
 contrition in mollifying the temper her
brute and every pardon she received operated with her asa
new permission to offend she did not sufficiently consider
that she was thus continually raising to a higher pitch
the frenzy his malice hector in the mean time was
utterly unconscious and ignorant the perilous situation
in which he stood while to the apprehension agostino
the giving him a negro for a rival whom his pride regarded
as belonging to an inferior species beings and his devout
ignorance likened to the leader the infernal squadrons
was the last and most intolerable insult
his malice was ingenious and subtle he disdained the
vulgar revenge stabbing his antagonist in the dark and
supposing that his enmity could be gorged by a blow
when the venom his nature was thoroughly put in motion
nothing could restore it to quietness and tranquillity but
some mighty stroke to excite the wonder every bystander
and that should leave behind it a track deso
travels st leon
nation never to be filled up again and erased he heard
therefore with unsated appetite and eager joy the tale necromancy
and infernal machination repeated to him from
hector by the donzella the impression which the narrative
produced upon him was a mixed sentiment 
transport at the apprehension such an instrument 
vengeance and palpitating hatred superstition teaching
him to believe and to view with abhorrence that which he
desired to render tenfold more an object faith and aversion
to his neighbours he struck an auspicious and august
alliance between his revenge and his religion his religion
exciting him to exterminate that the destruction which
would produce inexpressible gratification to his revenge
the darkness his spirit led him to proceed with double
caution and vigilance in his correspondence with the dondella
he discovered nothing to her the dark project
which was engendering in his mind and only betrayed so
much his superstitious feelings and fears as by giving
new emotion might stimulate her to gratify his curiosity
and her own by a detection further particulars he was
assiduous in the underhand and sinister propagation the
tale to which he did not fail to give his own colouring and
affix his own feelings he was desirous that the train
should be laid in silence and that the explosion he designed
should be free from all presignification the event thus
an individual whose animosity i had no apprehension
and the meanness whose appearance would probably have
made me neglect all precaution against him gave method
and direction to an evil which however upon a review
i am not inclined to doubt i should have been the victim
if the enmity and industry this individual had been
wholly withdrawn
the mischief was long in preparation before i received
in any way the slightest intimation the predicament in
which i stood the first circumstance at all calculated to
excite alarm in my mind was the singular manner in which i
found myself regarded if i entered any the neighbouring
villages or met the rustics and their dames as i strayed
along the roads or the fields they fled my approach deserted
the streets and carefully shut themselves up in their
 travels st leon
houses till i had passed where it was impossible to
avoid me they bowed themselves to the earth in the most
submissive guise before me while the most lively terror
was painted in their countenances dreading lest they should
excite the resentment a tremendous and inexorable foe
these tokens however were far from inspiring me with a
conception the truth they perplexed they astonished
they distressed me sore as i was with my recent afflictions
my mind was but too fully prepared for anticipations 
evil i had suffered from suspicions i had suffered from
calumnious imputations i had suffered from the malignant
effects popular rumour had i yielded my confidence
to any person but such a one as hector it is probable my
suspicions would have turned on that side but my reliance
on him was not less than that which alexander the great
yielded to philip the physician i knew his rectitude his
simplicity his fidelity and the singleness his heart and
i could not harbour the shadow a doubt respecting him
my reliance was that entire and perfect sort which did
not express itself by a recollection the physical possibility
and an acquittal founded in deliberation but by a total
vacancy doubt or retrospect that way directed just
such as the state my mind would have appeared if the
thing had been naturally impossible
i was not however ignorant and raw enough to be deceived
by the exterior homage i have described i sufficiently
knew that what i beheld was the offspring 
hatred to feel one's self hated is in all instances a painful
and humiliating state the human mind to me it was
especially so i was not formed to retaliate this species 
injury i could not hate in my turn i was formed to
love i could not look upon my species with dark and
gloomy contemplations i was prompt to admire their
virtues and perhaps even too prompt to extenuate their
errors it may i believe be laid down as a rule that
they who cannot hate can least endure to be made objects
 hatred fettered however as i now was by the tenderest
consideration for the health and tranquillity marguerite
i thought it best to temporise and submit in silence
my principal anxiety was to hide these symptoms from the
travels st leon
notice my family this i could not completely effect 
some them were too glaring and obtrusive entirely to
escape the observation my daughters in their walks but
the filial forbearance they felt towards their mother led them
implicitly and without any concerted plan to concur with
me in my exertions for her quiet
the animosity agostino was restless and inextinguishable
his plans did not terminate in exciting against
me a secret and covered abhorrence they aimed at nothing
less than my utter destruction the next exertion the
conspiracy which was engendering against me was a tragical
nature
it happened one night after all my family was retired
to rest and i was myself sunk into a slumber that i was
suddenly alarmed at the report a musket which seemed
to be fired almost under the window my chamber this
was a very singular circumstance and calculated to convey
an impression danger i leaped from my bed and ran
to the window the night was extremely dark and everything
seemed perfectly quiet presently i discerned a
glimmering light like that a lantern which however appeared
to be gradually retiring to a greater distance i was
not thus satisfied but determined to hasten down stairs and
investigate the cause the disturbance marguerite who
had heard the firing the musket as well as myself now

chapter 

 mine ear is open and my heart prepared
 the worst is wordly loss thou canst unfold 
 say is my kingdom lost shakespeare

it was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of north america that
the toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before
the adverse hosts could meet a wide and apparently an impervious
boundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces
of france and england the hardy colonist and the trained european who
fought at his side frequently expended months in struggling against
the rapids of the streams or in effecting the rugged passes of the
mountains in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more
martial conflict but emulating the patience and self-denial of the
practiced native warriors they learned to overcome every difficulty
and it would seem that in time there was no recess of the woods so
dark nor any secret place so lovely that it might claim exemption
from the inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their
vengeance or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant
monarchs of europe

perhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate
frontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness
of the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies
between the head waters of the hudson and the adjacent lakes

the facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the
combatants were too obvious to be neglected the lengthened sheet of
the champlain stretched from the frontiers of canada deep within the
borders of the neighboring province of new york forming a natural
passage across half the distance that the french were compelled to
master in order to strike their enemies near its southern termination
it received the contributions of another lake whose waters were so
limpid as to have been exclusively selected by the jesuit missionaries
to perform the typical purification of baptism and to obtain for it
the title of lake du saint sacrement the less zealous english thought
they conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains when they
bestowed the name of their reigning prince the second of the house of
hanover the two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded
scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of
horican

 as each nation of the indians had its language or its
 dialect they usually gave different names to the same
 places though nearly all of their appellations were
 descriptive of the object thus a literal translation of the
 name of this beautiful sheet of water used by the tribe
 that dwelt on its banks would be the tail of the lake
 lake george as it is vulgarly and now indeed legally
 called forms a sort of tail to lake champlain when viewed
 on the map hence the name

winding its way among countless islands and imbedded in mountains the
holy lake extended a dozen leagues still further to the south with
the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of
the water commenced a portage of as many miles which conducted the
adventurer to the banks of the hudson at a point where with the usual
obstructions of the rapids or rifts as they were then termed in the
language of the country the river became navigable to the tide

while in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance the restless
enterprise of the french even attempted the distant and difficult
gorges of the alleghany it may easily be imagined that their proverbial
acuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we
have just described it became emphatically the bloody arena in which
most of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested
forts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities
of the route and were taken and retaken razed and rebuilt as victory
alighted on the hostile banners while the husbandman shrank back from
the dangerous passes within the safer boundaries of the more ancient
settlements armies larger than those that had often disposed of the
scepters of the mother countries were seen to bury themselves in these
forests whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands that were
haggard with care or dejected by defeat though the arts of peace were
unknown to this fatal region its forests were alive with men its
shades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music and the echoes
of its mountains threw back the laugh or repeated the wanton cry
of many a gallant and reckless youth as he hurried by them in the
noontide of his spirits to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness

it was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we
shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war
which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that
neither was destined to retain

the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want of
energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great
britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the
talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer
dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence
of self-respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though
innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her
blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a
chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they
had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been
selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military
endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and
only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian
boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady
influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a
wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more
substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary
dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages
mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable
forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies
increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent
massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any
ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the
narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives
of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous
and excited traveler related the hazardous chances of the wilderness
the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious
glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of
the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to
set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should
have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest passions even
the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue
of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly
increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of
the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid
waste by the inroads of their relentless allies

 washington who after uselessly admonishing the european
 general of the danger into which he was heedlessly running
 saved the remnants of the british army on this occasion by
 his decision and courage the reputation earned by
 washington in this battle was the principal cause of his
 being selected to command the american armies at a later
 day it is a circumstance worthy of observation that while
 all america rang with his well-merited reputation his name
 does not occur in any european account of the battle at
 least the author has searched for it without success in
 this manner does the mother country absorb even the fame
 under that system of rule

when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the
southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes
that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army
numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more
of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior
should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had
been brought toward the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian
runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of
a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful
reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between
these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which
originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the
passage of wagons so that the distance which had been traveled by the
son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment
of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting
of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to
one of these forest-fastnesses the name of william henry and to the
other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the
reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with
a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far
too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was
leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however
lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern
provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the
several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed
nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising
frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army
but little superior in numbers

but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and
men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable
antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their
march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du
quesne and striking a blow on their advance

after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a
rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the
margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the
fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to
depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern
extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor
soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the
commander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this
service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubts as to the
intention of webb now vanished and an hour or two of hurried footsteps
and anxious faces succeeded the novice in the military art flew from
point to point retarding his own preparations by the excess of his
violent and somewhat distempered zeal while the more practiced veteran
made his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance
of haste though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently
betrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the as yet
untried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness at length the sun set in
a flood of glory behind the distant western hills and as darkness drew
its veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished
the last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer
the trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling
stream and a silence soon pervaded the camp as deep as that which
reigned in the vast forest by which it was environed

according to the orders of the preceding night the heavy sleep of the
army was broken by the rolling of the warning drums whose rattling
echoes were heard issuing on the damp morning air out of every vista
of the woods just as day began to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall
pines of the vicinity on the opening brightness of a soft and cloudless
eastern sky in an instant the whole camp was in motion the meanest
soldier arousing from his lair to witness the departure of his comrades
and to share in the excitement and incidents of the hour the simple
array of the chosen band was soon completed while the regular and
trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right of
the line the less pretending colonists took their humbler position
on its left with a docility that long practice had rendered easy
the scouts departed strong guards preceded and followed the lumbering
vehicles that bore the baggage and before the gray light of the morning
was mellowed by the rays of the sun the main body of the combatants
wheeled into column and left the encampment with a show of high
military bearing that served to drown the slumbering apprehensions of
many a novice who was now about to make his first essay in arms while
in view of their admiring comrades the same proud front and ordered
array was observed until the notes of their fifes growing fainter in
distance the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass
which had slowly entered its bosom

the deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to
be borne on the breeze to the listeners and the latest straggler had
already disappeared in pursuit but there still remained the signs
of another departure before a log cabin of unusual size and
accommodations in front of which those sentinels paced their rounds
who were known to guard the person of the english general at this spot
were gathered some half dozen horses caparisoned in a manner which
showed that two at least were destined to bear the persons of females
of a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the wilds of the
country a third wore trappings and arms of an officer of the staff
while the rest from the plainness of the housings and the traveling
mails with which they were encumbered were evidently fitted for the
reception of as many menials who were seemingly already waiting
the pleasure of those they served at a respectful distance from this
unusual show were gathered divers groups of curious idlers some
admiring the blood and bone of the high-mettled military charger
and others gazing at the preparations with the dull wonder of vulgar
curiosity there was one man however who by his countenance and
actions formed a marked exception to those who composed the latter
class of spectators being neither idle nor seemingly very ignorant

the person of this individual was to the last degree ungainly without
being in any particular manner deformed he had all the bones and joints
of other men without any of their proportions erect his stature
surpassed that of his fellows though seated he appeared reduced within
the ordinary limits of the race the same contrariety in his members
seemed to exist throughout the whole man his head was large his
shoulders narrow his arms long and dangling while his hands were
small if not delicate his legs and thighs were thin nearly to
emaciation but of extraordinary length and his knees would have
been considered tremendous had they not been outdone by the broader
foundations on which this false superstructure of blended human orders
was so profanely reared the ill-assorted and injudicious attire of the
individual only served to render his awkwardness more conspicuous a
sky-blue coat with short and broad skirts and low cape exposed a long
thin neck and longer and thinner legs to the worst animadversions
of the evil-disposed his nether garment was a yellow nankeen closely
fitted to the shape and tied at his bunches of knees by large knots of
white ribbon a good deal sullied by use clouded cotton stockings and
shoes on one of the latter of which was a plated spur completed the
costume of the lower extremity of this figure no curve or angle of
which was concealed but on the other hand studiously exhibited
through the vanity or simplicity of its owner

from beneath the flap of an enormous pocket of a soiled vest of embossed
silk heavily ornamented with tarnished silver lace projected an
instrument which from being seen in such martial company might have
been easily mistaken for some mischievous and unknown implement of war
small as it was this uncommon engine had excited the curiosity of most
of the europeans in the camp though several of the provincials
were seen to handle it not only without fear but with the utmost
familiarity a large civil cocked hat like those worn by clergymen
within the last thirty years surmounted the whole furnishing dignity
to a good-natured and somewhat vacant countenance that apparently
needed such artificial aid to support the gravity of some high and
extraordinary trust

while the common herd stood aloof in deference to the quarters of webb
the figure we have described stalked into the center of the domestics
freely expressing his censures or commendations on the merits of the
horses as by chance they displeased or satisfied his judgment

this beast i rather conclude friend is not of home raising but is
from foreign lands or perhaps from the little island itself over the
blue water he said in a voice as remarkable for the softness and
sweetness of its tones as was his person for its rare proportions i
may speak of these things and be no braggart for i have been down at
both havens that which is situate at the mouth of thames and is named
after the capital of old england and that which is called haven with
the addition of the word new and have seen the scows and brigantines
collecting their droves like the gathering to the ark being outward
bound to the island of jamaica for the purpose of barter and traffic
in four-footed animals but never before have i beheld a beast which
verified the true scripture war-horse like this he paweth in the
valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed
men he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle
afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting it would seem
that the stock of the horse of israel had descended to our own time
would it not friend

receiving no reply to this extraordinary appeal which in truth as it
was delivered with the vigor of full and sonorous tones merited some
sort of notice he who had thus sung forth the language of the holy
book turned to the silent figure to whom he had unwittingly addressed
himself and found a new and more powerful subject of admiration in the
object that encountered his gaze his eyes fell on the still upright
and rigid form of the indian runner who had borne to the camp the
unwelcome tidings of the preceding evening although in a state of
perfect repose and apparently disregarding with characteristic
stoicism the excitement and bustle around him there was a sullen
fierceness mingled with the quiet of the savage that was likely to
arrest the attention of much more experienced eyes than those which now
scanned him in unconcealed amazement the native bore both the tomahawk
and knife of his tribe and yet his appearance was not altogether that
of a warrior on the contrary there was an air of neglect about his
person like that which might have proceeded from great and recent
exertion which he had not yet found leisure to repair the colors
of the war-paint had blended in dark confusion about his fierce
countenance and rendered his swarthy lineaments still more savage
and repulsive than if art had attempted an effect which had been thus
produced by chance his eye alone which glistened like a fiery star
amid lowering clouds was to be seen in its state of native wildness
for a single instant his searching and yet wary glance met the wondering
look of the other and then changing its direction partly in cunning
and partly in disdain it remained fixed as if penetrating the distant
air

it is impossible to say what unlooked-for remark this short and silent
communication between two such singular men might have elicited from
the white man had not his active curiosity been again drawn to other
objects a general movement among the domestics and a low sound of
gentle voices announced the approach of those whose presence alone
was wanted to enable the cavalcade to move the simple admirer of the
war-horse instantly fell back to a low gaunt switch-tailed mare that
was unconsciously gleaning the faded herbage of the camp nigh by where
leaning with one elbow on the blanket that concealed an apology for a
saddle he became a spectator of the departure while a foal was quietly
making its morning repast on the opposite side of the same animal

a young man in the dress of an officer conducted to their steeds two
females who as it was apparent by their dresses were prepared to
encounter the fatigues of a journey in the woods one and she was
the more juvenile in her appearance though both were young permitted
glimpses of her dazzling complexion fair golden hair and bright blue
eyes to be caught as she artlessly suffered the morning air to blow
aside the green veil which descended low from her beaver

the flush which still lingered above the pines in the western sky was
not more bright nor delicate than the bloom on her cheek nor was the
opening day more cheering than the animated smile which she bestowed on
the youth as he assisted her into the saddle the other who appeared
to share equally in the attention of the young officer concealed her
charms from the gaze of the soldiery with a care that seemed better
fitted to the experience of four or five additional years it could be
seen however that her person though molded with the same exquisite
proportions of which none of the graces were lost by the traveling
dress she wore was rather fuller and more mature than that of her
companion

no sooner were these females seated than their attendant sprang lightly
into the saddle of the war-horse when the whole three bowed to webb
who in courtesy awaited their parting on the threshold of his cabin and
turning their horses heads they proceeded at a slow amble followed
by their train toward the northern entrance of the encampment as they
traversed that short distance not a voice was heard among them but
a slight exclamation proceeded from the younger of the females as the
indian runner glided by her unexpectedly and led the way along the
military road in her front though this sudden and startling movement
of the indian produced no sound from the other in the surprise her veil
also was allowed to open its folds and betrayed an indescribable look
of pity admiration and horror as her dark eye followed the easy
motions of the savage the tresses of this lady were shining and black
like the plumage of the raven her complexion was not brown but it
rather appeared charged with the color of the rich blood that seemed
ready to burst its bounds and yet there was neither coarseness nor
want of shadowing in a countenance that was exquisitely regular and
dignified and surpassingly beautiful she smiled as if in pity at her
own momentary forgetfulness discovering by the act a row of teeth that
would have shamed the purest ivory when replacing the veil she bowed
her face and rode in silence like one whose thoughts were abstracted
from the scene around her




chapter 

 sola sola wo ha ho sola
 shakespeare

while one of the lovely beings we have so cursorily presented to the
reader was thus lost in thought the other quickly recovered from the
alarm which induced the exclamation and laughing at her own weakness
she inquired of the youth who rode by her side

are such specters frequent in the woods heyward or is this sight an
especial entertainment ordered on our behalf if the latter gratitude
must close our mouths but if the former both cora and i shall have
need to draw largely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast
even before we are made to encounter the redoubtable montcalm

yon indian is a runner of the army and after the fashion of his
people he may be accounted a hero returned the officer he has
volunteered to guide us to the lake by a path but little known
sooner than if we followed the tardy movements of the column and by
consequence more agreeably

i like him not said the lady shuddering partly in assumed yet more
in real terror you know him duncan or you would not trust yourself
so freely to his keeping

say rather alice that i would not trust you i do know him or he
would not have my confidence and least of all at this moment he
is said to be a canadian too and yet he served with our friends the
mohawks who as you know are one of the six allied nations he was
brought among us as i have heard by some strange accident in which
your father was interested and in which the savage was rigidly dealt
by but i forget the idle tale it is enough that he is now our
friend

if he has been my father's enemy i like him still less exclaimed the
now really anxious girl will you not speak to him major heyward that
i may hear his tones foolish though it may be you have often heard me
avow my faith in the tones of the human voice

it would be in vain and answered most probably by an ejaculation
though he may understand it he affects like most of his people to be
ignorant of the english and least of all will he condescend to speak
it now that the war demands the utmost exercise of his dignity but
he stops the private path by which we are to journey is doubtless at
hand

the conjecture of major heyward was true when they reached the spot
where the indian stood pointing into the thicket that fringed the
military road a narrow and blind path which might with some little
inconvenience receive one person at a time became visible

here then lies our way said the young man in a low voice
manifest no distrust or you may invite the danger you appear to
apprehend

cora what think you asked the reluctant fair one if we journey
with the troops though we may find their presence irksome shall we not
feel better assurance of our safety

being little accustomed to the practices of the savages alice you
mistake the place of real danger said heyward if enemies have
reached the portage at all a thing by no means probable as our scouts
are abroad they will surely be found skirting the column where scalps
abound the most the route of the detachment is known while ours
having been determined within the hour must still be secret

should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners and
that his skin is dark coldly asked cora

alice hesitated no longer but giving her narrangansett a smart cut
of the whip she was the first to dash aside the slight branches of the
bushes and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway
the young man regarded the last speaker in open admiration and even
permitted her fairer though certainly not more beautiful companion to
proceed unattended while he sedulously opened the way himself for
the passage of her who has been called cora it would seem that the
domestics had been previously instructed for instead of penetrating
the thicket they followed the route of the column a measure which
heyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their guide in
order to diminish the marks of their trail if haply the canadian
savages should be lurking so far in advance of their army for many
minutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue
after which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which
grew along the line of the highway and entered under the high but dark
arches of the forest here their progress was less interrupted and the
instant the guide perceived that the females could command their steeds
he moved on at a pace between a trot and a walk and at a rate which
kept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode at a fast yet easy
amble the youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed cora when the
distant sound of horses hoofs clattering over the roots of the broken
way in his rear caused him to check his charger and as his companions
drew their reins at the same instant the whole party came to a halt in
order to obtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption

 in the state of rhode island there is a bay called
 narragansett so named after a powerful tribe of indians
 which formerly dwelt on its banks accident or one of those
 unaccountable freaks which nature sometimes plays in the
 animal world gave rise to a breed of horses which were once
 well known in america and distinguished by their habit of
 pacing horses of this race were and are still in much
 request as saddle horses on account of their hardiness and
 the ease of their movements as they were also sure of foot
 the narragansetts were greatly sought for by females who
 were obliged to travel over the roots and holes in the new
 countries

in a few moments a colt was seen gliding like a fallow deer among the
straight trunks of the pines and in another instant the person of the
ungainly man described in the preceding chapter came into view with
as much rapidity as he could excite his meager beast to endure without
coming to an open rupture until now this personage had escaped the
observation of the travelers if he possessed the power to arrest any
wandering eye when exhibiting the glories of his altitude on foot his
equestrian graces were still more likely to attract attention

notwithstanding a constant application of his one armed heel to the
flanks of the mare the most confirmed gait that he could establish
was a canterbury gallop with the hind legs in which those more forward
assisted for doubtful moments though generally content to maintain a
loping trot perhaps the rapidity of the changes from one of these paces
to the other created an optical illusion which might thus magnify the
powers of the beast for it is certain that heyward who possessed
a true eye for the merits of a horse was unable with his utmost
ingenuity to decide by what sort of movement his pursuer worked his
sinuous way on his footsteps with such persevering hardihood

the industry and movements of the rider were not less remarkable than
those of the ridden at each change in the evolutions of the latter
the former raised his tall person in the stirrups producing in this
manner by the undue elongation of his legs such sudden growths and
diminishings of the stature as baffled every conjecture that might
be made as to his dimensions if to this be added the fact that in
consequence of the ex parte application of the spur one side of the
mare appeared to journey faster than the other and that the aggrieved
flank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy tail
we finish the picture of both horse and man

the frown which had gathered around the handsome open and manly brow
of heyward gradually relaxed and his lips curled into a slight smile
as he regarded the stranger alice made no very powerful effort to
control her merriment and even the dark thoughtful eye of cora lighted
with a humor that it would seem the habit rather than the nature of
its mistress repressed

seek you any here demanded heyward when the other had arrived
sufficiently nigh to abate his speed i trust you are no messenger of
evil tidings

even so replied the stranger making diligent use of his triangular
castor to produce a circulation in the close air of the woods and
leaving his hearers in doubt to which of the young man's questions he
responded when however he had cooled his face and recovered his
breath he continued i hear you are riding to william henry as i
am journeying thitherward myself i concluded good company would seem
consistent to the wishes of both parties

you appear to possess the privilege of a casting vote returned
heyward we are three while you have consulted no one but yourself

even so the first point to be obtained is to know one's own mind once
sure of that and where women are concerned it is not easy the next is
to act up to the decision i have endeavored to do both and here i am

if you journey to the lake you have mistaken your route said
heyward haughtily the highway thither is at least half a mile behind
you

even so returned the stranger nothing daunted by this cold
reception i have tarried at edward a week and i should be dumb not
to have inquired the road i was to journey and if dumb there would be
an end to my calling after simpering in a small way like one whose
modesty prohibited a more open expression of his admiration of
a witticism that was perfectly unintelligible to his hearers he
continued it is not prudent for any one of my profession to be too
familiar with those he has to instruct for which reason i follow not
the line of the army besides which i conclude that a gentleman of
your character has the best judgment in matters of wayfaring i have
therefore decided to join company in order that the ride may be made
agreeable and partake of social communion

a most arbitrary if not a hasty decision exclaimed heyward
undecided whether to give vent to his growing anger or to laugh in the
other's face but you speak of instruction and of a profession are
you an adjunct to the provincial corps as a master of the noble science
of defense and offense or perhaps you are one who draws lines and
angles under the pretense of expounding the mathematics

the stranger regarded his interrogator a moment in wonder and then
losing every mark of self-satisfaction in an expression of solemn
humility he answered

of offense i hope there is none to either party of defense i make
none by god's good mercy having committed no palpable sin since last
entreating his pardoning grace i understand not your allusions about
lines and angles and i leave expounding to those who have been called
and set apart for that holy office i lay claim to no higher gift than a
small insight into the glorious art of petitioning and thanksgiving as
practiced in psalmody

the man is most manifestly a disciple of apollo cried the amused
alice and i take him under my own especial protection nay throw
aside that frown heyward and in pity to my longing ears suffer him to
journey in our train besides she added in a low and hurried voice
casting a glance at the distant cora who slowly followed the footsteps
of their silent but sullen guide it may be a friend added to our
strength in time of need

think you alice that i would trust those i love by this secret path
did i imagine such need could happen

nay nay i think not of it now but this strange man amuses me and if
he hath music in his soul let us not churlishly reject his company
she pointed persuasively along the path with her riding whip while
their eyes met in a look which the young man lingered a moment to
prolong then yielding to her gentle influence he clapped his spurs
into his charger and in a few bounds was again at the side of cora

i am glad to encounter thee friend continued the maiden waving her
hand to the stranger to proceed as she urged her narragansett to renew
its amble partial relatives have almost persuaded me that i am not
entirely worthless in a duet myself and we may enliven our wayfaring
by indulging in our favorite pursuit it might be of signal advantage to
one ignorant as i to hear the opinions and experience of a master in
the art

it is refreshing both to the spirits and to the body to indulge
in psalmody in befitting seasons returned the master of song
unhesitatingly complying with her intimation to follow and nothing
would relieve the mind more than such a consoling communion but four
parts are altogether necessary to the perfection of melody you have all
the manifestations of a soft and rich treble i can by especial aid
carry a full tenor to the highest letter but we lack counter and bass
yon officer of the king who hesitated to admit me to his company might
fill the latter if one may judge from the intonations of his voice in
common dialogue

judge not too rashly from hasty and deceptive appearances said the
lady smiling though major heyward can assume such deep notes on
occasion believe me his natural tones are better fitted for a mellow
tenor than the bass you heard

is he then much practiced in the art of psalmody demanded her
simple companion

alice felt disposed to laugh though she succeeded in suppressing her
merriment ere she answered

i apprehend that he is rather addicted to profane song the chances
of a soldier's life are but little fitted for the encouragement of more
sober inclinations

man's voice is given to him like his other talents to be used and
not to be abused none can say they have ever known me to neglect my
gifts i am thankful that though my boyhood may be said to have been
set apart like the youth of the royal david for the purposes of music
no syllable of rude verse has ever profaned my lips

you have then limited your efforts to sacred song

even so as the psalms of david exceed all other language so does the
psalmody that has been fitted to them by the divines and sages of the
land surpass all vain poetry happily i may say that i utter nothing
but the thoughts and the wishes of the king of israel himself for
though the times may call for some slight changes yet does this version
which we use in the colonies of new england so much exceed all other
versions that by its richness its exactness and its spiritual
simplicity it approacheth as near as may be to the great work of the
inspired writer i never abide in any place sleeping or waking without
an example of this gifted work tis the six-and-twentieth edition
promulgated at boston anno domini and is entitled the psalms
hymns and spiritual songs of the old and new testaments faithfully
translated into english metre for the use edification and comfort of
the saints in public and private especially in new england

during this eulogium on the rare production of his native poets the
stranger had drawn the book from his pocket and fitting a pair of
iron-rimmed spectacles to his nose opened the volume with a care and
veneration suited to its sacred purposes then without circumlocution
or apology first pronounced the word standish and placing the
unknown engine already described to his mouth from which he drew a
high shrill sound that was followed by an octave below from his own
voice he commenced singing the following words in full sweet and
melodious tones that set the music the poetry and even the uneasy
motion of his ill-trained beast at defiance how good it is o see and
how it pleaseth well together e'en in unity for brethren so to dwell
it's like the choice ointment from the head to the beard did go down
aaron's head that downward went his garment's skirts unto

the delivery of these skillful rhymes was accompanied on the part
of the stranger by a regular rise and fall of his right hand which
terminated at the descent by suffering the fingers to dwell a moment on
the leaves of the little volume and on the ascent by such a flourish
of the member as none but the initiated may ever hope to imitate
it would seem long practice had rendered this manual accompaniment
necessary for it did not cease until the preposition which the poet had
selected for the close of his verse had been duly delivered like a word
of two syllables

such an innovation on the silence and retirement of the forest could not
fail to enlist the ears of those who journeyed at so short a distance in
advance the indian muttered a few words in broken english to heyward
who in his turn spoke to the stranger at once interrupting and for
the time closing his musical efforts

though we are not in danger common prudence would teach us to journey
through this wilderness in as quiet a manner as possible you will then
pardon me alice should i diminish your enjoyments by requesting this
gentleman to postpone his chant until a safer opportunity

you will diminish them indeed returned the arch girl for never did
i hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and language than that
to which i have been listening and i was far gone in a learned inquiry
into the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense when you
broke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours duncan

i know not what you call my bass said heyward piqued at her remark
but i know that your safety and that of cora is far dearer to me than
could be any orchestra of handel's music he paused and turned his head
quickly toward a thicket and then bent his eyes suspiciously on their
guide who continued his steady pace in undisturbed gravity the young
man smiled to himself for he believed he had mistaken some shining
berry of the woods for the glistening eyeballs of a prowling savage and
he rode forward continuing the conversation which had been interrupted
by the passing thought

major heyward was mistaken only in suffering his youthful and generous
pride to suppress his active watchfulness the cavalcade had not long
passed before the branches of the bushes that formed the thicket were
cautiously moved asunder and a human visage as fiercely wild as savage
art and unbridled passions could make it peered out on the retiring
footsteps of the travelers a gleam of exultation shot across the
darkly-painted lineaments of the inhabitant of the forest as he traced
the route of his intended victims who rode unconsciously onward the
light and graceful forms of the females waving among the trees in the
curvatures of their path followed at each bend by the manly figure of
heyward until finally the shapeless person of the singing master
was concealed behind the numberless trunks of trees that rose in dark
lines in the intermediate space




chapter 

 before these fields were shorn and till'd
 full to the brim our rivers flow'd
 the melody of waters fill'd
 the fresh and boundless wood
 and torrents dash'd and rivulets play'd
 and fountains spouted in the shade bryant

leaving the unsuspecting heyward and his confiding companions to
penetrate still deeper into a forest that contained such treacherous
inmates we must use an author's privilege and shift the scene a few
miles to the westward of the place where we have last seen them

on that day two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid
stream within an hour's journey of the encampment of webb like those
who awaited the appearance of an absent person or the approach of some
expected event the vast canopy of woods spread itself to the margin of
the river overhanging the water and shadowing its dark current with a
deeper hue the rays of the sun were beginning to grow less fierce and
the intense heat of the day was lessened as the cooler vapors of the
springs and fountains rose above their leafy beds and rested in
the atmosphere still that breathing silence which marks the drowsy
sultriness of an american landscape in july pervaded the secluded spot
interrupted only by the low voices of the men the occasional and lazy
tap of a woodpecker the discordant cry of some gaudy jay or a swelling
on the ear from the dull roar of a distant waterfall these feeble and
broken sounds were however too familiar to the foresters to draw their
attention from the more interesting matter of their dialogue while
one of these loiterers showed the red skin and wild accouterments of a
native of the woods the other exhibited through the mask of his
rude and nearly savage equipments the brighter though sun-burned and
long-faced complexion of one who might claim descent from a european
parentage the former was seated on the end of a mossy log in a posture
that permitted him to heighten the effect of his earnest language by
the calm but expressive gestures of an indian engaged in debate his
body which was nearly naked presented a terrific emblem of death
drawn in intermingled colors of white and black his closely-shaved
head on which no other hair than the well-known and chivalrous
scalping tuft was preserved was without ornament of any kind with
the exception of a solitary eagle's plume that crossed his crown
and depended over the left shoulder a tomahawk and scalping knife of
english manufacture were in his girdle while a short military rifle
of that sort with which the policy of the whites armed their savage
allies lay carelessly across his bare and sinewy knee the expanded
chest full formed limbs and grave countenance of this warrior would
denote that he had reached the vigor of his days though no symptoms of
decay appeared to have yet weakened his manhood

 the north american warrior caused the hair to be plucked
 from his whole body a small tuft was left on the crown of
 his head in order that his enemy might avail himself of it
 in wrenching off the scalp in the event of his fall the
 scalp was the only admissible trophy of victory thus it
 was deemed more important to obtain the scalp than to kill
 the man some tribes lay great stress on the honor of
 striking a dead body these practices have nearly
 disappeared among the indians of the atlantic states

the frame of the white man judging by such parts as were not concealed
by his clothes was like that of one who had known hardships and
exertion from his earliest youth his person though muscular was
rather attenuated than full but every nerve and muscle appeared strung
and indurated by unremitted exposure and toil he wore a hunting shirt
of forest-green fringed with faded yellow and a summer cap of skins
which had been shorn of their fur he also bore a knife in a girdle of
wampum like that which confined the scanty garments of the indian but
no tomahawk his moccasins were ornamented after the gay fashion of the
natives while the only part of his under dress which appeared below the
hunting-frock was a pair of buckskin leggings that laced at the sides
and which were gartered above the knees with the sinews of a deer a
pouch and horn completed his personal accouterments though a rifle of
great length which the theory of the more ingenious whites had
taught them was the most dangerous of all firearms leaned against a
neighboring sapling the eye of the hunter or scout whichever he might
be was small quick keen and restless roving while he spoke on
every side of him as if in quest of game or distrusting the sudden
approach of some lurking enemy notwithstanding the symptoms of habitual
suspicion his countenance was not only without guile but at the moment
at which he is introduced it was charged with an expression of sturdy
honesty

 the hunting-shirt is a picturesque smock-frock being
 shorter and ornamented with fringes and tassels the colors
 are intended to imitate the hues of the wood with a view to
 concealment many corps of american riflemen have been thus
 attired and the dress is one of the most striking of modern
 times the hunting-shirt is frequently white

 the rifle of the army is short that of the hunter is
 always long

even your traditions make the case in my favor chingachgook he said
speaking in the tongue which was known to all the natives who formerly
inhabited the country between the hudson and the potomac and of
which we shall give a free translation for the benefit of the reader
endeavoring at the same time to preserve some of the peculiarities
both of the individual and of the language your fathers came from the
setting sun crossed the big river fought the people of the country
and took the land and mine came from the red sky of the morning over
the salt lake and did their work much after the fashion that had been
set them by yours then let god judge the matter between us and friends
spare their words

 the mississippi the scout alludes to a tradition which is
 very popular among the tribes of the atlantic states
 evidence of their asiatic origin is deduced from the
 circumstances though great uncertainty hangs over the whole
 history of the indians

my fathers fought with the naked red man returned the indian
sternly in the same language is there no difference hawkeye between
the stone-headed arrow of the warrior and the leaden bullet with which
you kill

there is reason in an indian though nature has made him with a red
skin said the white man shaking his head like one on whom such an
appeal to his justice was not thrown away for a moment he appeared to
be conscious of having the worst of the argument then rallying again
he answered the objection of his antagonist in the best manner his
limited information would allow

i am no scholar and i care not who knows it but judging from what
i have seen at deer chases and squirrel hunts of the sparks below
i should think a rifle in the hands of their grandfathers was not so
dangerous as a hickory bow and a good flint-head might be if drawn with
indian judgment and sent by an indian eye

you have the story told by your fathers returned the other coldly
waving his hand what say your old men do they tell the young warriors
that the pale faces met the red men painted for war and armed with the
stone hatchet and wooden gun

i am not a prejudiced man nor one who vaunts himself on his natural
privileges though the worst enemy i have on earth and he is an
iroquois daren't deny that i am genuine white the scout replied
surveying with secret satisfaction the faded color of his bony and
sinewy hand and i am willing to own that my people have many ways of
which as an honest man i can't approve it is one of their customs to
write in books what they have done and seen instead of telling them
in their villages where the lie can be given to the face of a cowardly
boaster and the brave soldier can call on his comrades to witness for
the truth of his words in consequence of this bad fashion a man who
is too conscientious to misspend his days among the women in learning
the names of black marks may never hear of the deeds of his fathers
nor feel a pride in striving to outdo them for myself i conclude the
bumppos could shoot for i have a natural turn with a rifle which
must have been handed down from generation to generation as our holy
commandments tell us all good and evil gifts are bestowed though i
should be loath to answer for other people in such a matter but every
story has its two sides so i ask you chingachgook what passed
according to the traditions of the red men when our fathers first met

a silence of a minute succeeded during which the indian sat mute then
full of the dignity of his office he commenced his brief tale with a
solemnity that served to heighten its appearance of truth

listen hawkeye and your ear shall drink no lie tis what my fathers
have said and what the mohicans have done he hesitated a single
instant and bending a cautious glance toward his companion he
continued in a manner that was divided between interrogation and
assertion does not this stream at our feet run toward the summer
until its waters grow salt and the current flows upward

it can't be denied that your traditions tell you true in both these
matters said the white man for i have been there and have seen
them though why water which is so sweet in the shade should become
bitter in the sun is an alteration for which i have never been able to
account

and the current demanded the indian who expected his reply with that
sort of interest that a man feels in the confirmation of testimony at
which he marvels even while he respects it the fathers of chingachgook
have not lied

the holy bible is not more true and that is the truest thing in
nature they call this up-stream current the tide which is a thing soon
explained and clear enough six hours the waters run in and six hours
they run out and the reason is this when there is higher water in the
sea than in the river they run in until the river gets to be highest
and then it runs out again

the waters in the woods and on the great lakes run downward
until they lie like my hand said the indian stretching the limb
horizontally before him and then they run no more

no honest man will deny it said the scout a little nettled at the
implied distrust of his explanation of the mystery of the tides and i
grant that it is true on the small scale and where the land is level
but everything depends on what scale you look at things now on the
small scale the arth is level but on the large scale it is round in
this manner pools and ponds and even the great fresh-water lakes may
be stagnant as you and i both know they are having seen them but when
you come to spread water over a great tract like the sea where the
earth is round how in reason can the water be quiet you might as well
expect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile
above us though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at
this very moment

if unsatisfied by the philosophy of his companion the indian was far
too dignified to betray his unbelief he listened like one who was
convinced and resumed his narrative in his former solemn manner

we came from the place where the sun is hid at night over great plains
where the buffaloes live until we reached the big river there we
fought the alligewi till the ground was red with their blood from the
banks of the big river to the shores of the salt lake there was none to
meet us the maquas followed at a distance we said the country should
be ours from the place where the water runs up no longer on this stream
to a river twenty sun's journey toward the summer we drove the maquas
into the woods with the bears they only tasted salt at the licks they
drew no fish from the great lake we threw them the bones

all this i have heard and believe said the white man observing that
the indian paused but it was long before the english came into the
country

a pine grew then where this chestnut now stands the first pale faces
who came among us spoke no english they came in a large canoe when
my fathers had buried the tomahawk with the red men around them then
hawkeye he continued betraying his deep emotion only by permitting
his voice to fall to those low guttural tones which render his
language as spoken at times so very musical then hawkeye we were
one people and we were happy the salt lake gave us its fish the wood
its deer and the air its birds we took wives who bore us children we
worshipped the great spirit and we kept the maquas beyond the sound of
our songs of triumph

know you anything of your own family at that time demanded the white
but you are just a man for an indian and as i suppose you hold their
gifts your fathers must have been brave warriors and wise men at the
council-fire

my tribe is the grandfather of nations but i am an unmixed man the
blood of chiefs is in my veins where it must stay forever the dutch
landed and gave my people the fire-water they drank until the heavens
and the earth seemed to meet and they foolishly thought they had found
the great spirit then they parted with their land foot by foot
they were driven back from the shores until i that am a chief and a
sagamore have never seen the sun shine but through the trees and have
never visited the graves of my fathers

graves bring solemn feelings over the mind returned the scout a good
deal touched at the calm suffering of his companion and they often aid
a man in his good intentions though for myself i expect to leave my
own bones unburied to bleach in the woods or to be torn asunder by the
wolves but where are to be found those of your race who came to their
kin in the delaware country so many summers since

where are the blossoms of those summers fallen one by one so all
of my family departed each in his turn to the land of spirits i am on
the hilltop and must go down into the valley and when uncas follows in
my footsteps there will no longer be any of the blood of the sagamores
for my boy is the last of the mohicans

uncas is here said another voice in the same soft guttural tones
near his elbow who speaks to uncas

the white man loosened his knife in his leathern sheath and made
an involuntary movement of the hand toward his rifle at this sudden
interruption but the indian sat composed and without turning his head
at the unexpected sounds

at the next instant a youthful warrior passed between them with a
noiseless step and seated himself on the bank of the rapid stream no
exclamation of surprise escaped the father nor was any question asked
or reply given for several minutes each appearing to await the moment
when he might speak without betraying womanish curiosity or childish
impatience the white man seemed to take counsel from their customs
and relinquishing his grasp of the rifle he also remained silent and
reserved at length chingachgook turned his eyes slowly toward his son
and demanded

do the maquas dare to leave the print of their moccasins in these
woods

i have been on their trail replied the young indian and know that
they number as many as the fingers of my two hands but they lie hid
like cowards

the thieves are outlying for scalps and plunder said the white man
whom we shall call hawkeye after the manner of his companions that
busy frenchman montcalm will send his spies into our very camp but he
will know what road we travel

tis enough returned the father glancing his eye toward the setting
sun they shall be driven like deer from their bushes hawkeye let us
eat to-night and show the maquas that we are men to-morrow

i am as ready to do the one as the other but to fight the iroquois
tis necessary to find the skulkers and to eat tis necessary to get
the game talk of the devil and he will come there is a pair of the
biggest antlers i have seen this season moving the bushes below the
hill now uncas he continued in a half whisper and laughing with a
kind of inward sound like one who had learned to be watchful i will
bet my charger three times full of powder against a foot of wampum
that i take him atwixt the eyes and nearer to the right than to the
left

it cannot be said the young indian springing to his feet with
youthful eagerness all but the tips of his horns are hid

he's a boy said the white man shaking his head while he spoke and
addressing the father does he think when a hunter sees a part of the
creature he can't tell where the rest of him should be

adjusting his rifle he was about to make an exhibition of that skill
on which he so much valued himself when the warrior struck up the piece
with his hand saying

hawkeye will you fight the maquas

these indians know the nature of the woods as it might be by
instinct returned the scout dropping his rifle and turning away like
a man who was convinced of his error i must leave the buck to your
arrow uncas or we may kill a deer for them thieves the iroquois to
eat

the instant the father seconded this intimation by an expressive gesture
of the hand uncas threw himself on the ground and approached the
animal with wary movements when within a few yards of the cover he
fitted an arrow to his bow with the utmost care while the antlers
moved as if their owner snuffed an enemy in the tainted air in another
moment the twang of the cord was heard a white streak was seen glancing
into the bushes and the wounded buck plunged from the cover to the
very feet of his hidden enemy avoiding the horns of the infuriated
animal uncas darted to his side and passed his knife across the
throat when bounding to the edge of the river it fell dyeing the
waters with its blood

twas done with indian skill said the scout laughing inwardly but
with vast satisfaction and twas a pretty sight to behold though an
arrow is a near shot and needs a knife to finish the work

hugh ejaculated his companion turning quickly like a hound who
scented game

by the lord there is a drove of them exclaimed the scout whose eyes
began to glisten with the ardor of his usual occupation if they come
within range of a bullet i will drop one though the whole six nations
should be lurking within sound what do you hear chingachgook for to
my ears the woods are dumb

there is but one deer and he is dead said the indian bending his
body till his ear nearly touched the earth i hear the sounds of feet

perhaps the wolves have driven the buck to shelter and are following
on his trail

no the horses of white men are coming returned the other raising
himself with dignity and resuming his seat on the log with his former
composure hawkeye they are your brothers speak to them

that i will and in english that the king needn't be ashamed to
answer returned the hunter speaking in the language of which he
boasted but i see nothing nor do i hear the sounds of man or beast
tis strange that an indian should understand white sounds better than a
man who his very enemies will own has no cross in his blood although
he may have lived with the red skins long enough to be suspected ha
there goes something like the cracking of a dry stick too now i hear
the bushes move yes yes there is a trampling that i mistook for
the falls and but here they come themselves god keep them from the
iroquois




chapter 

 well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
 till i torment thee for this injury midsummer night's dream

the words were still in the mouth of the scout when the leader of the
party whose approaching footsteps had caught the vigilant ear of the
indian came openly into view a beaten path such as those made by the
periodical passage of the deer wound through a little glen at no great
distance and struck the river at the point where the white man and his
red companions had posted themselves along this track the travelers
who had produced a surprise so unusual in the depths of the forest
advanced slowly toward the hunter who was in front of his associates
in readiness to receive them

who comes demanded the scout throwing his rifle carelessly across
his left arm and keeping the forefinger of his right hand on the
trigger though he avoided all appearance of menace in the act who
comes hither among the beasts and dangers of the wilderness

believers in religion and friends to the law and to the king
returned he who rode foremost men who have journeyed since the rising
sun in the shades of this forest without nourishment and are sadly
tired of their wayfaring

you are then lost interrupted the hunter and have found how
helpless tis not to know whether to take the right hand or the left

even so sucking babes are not more dependent on those who guide them
than we who are of larger growth and who may now be said to possess the
stature without the knowledge of men know you the distance to a post of
the crown called william henry

hoot shouted the scout who did not spare his open laughter though
instantly checking the dangerous sounds he indulged his merriment at
less risk of being overheard by any lurking enemies you are as much
off the scent as a hound would be with horican atwixt him and the deer
william henry man if you are friends to the king and have business
with the army your way would be to follow the river down to edward and
lay the matter before webb who tarries there instead of pushing into
the defiles and driving this saucy frenchman back across champlain
into his den again

before the stranger could make any reply to this unexpected proposition
another horseman dashed the bushes aside and leaped his charger into
the pathway in front of his companion

what then may be our distance from fort edward demanded a new
speaker the place you advise us to seek we left this morning and our
destination is the head of the lake

then you must have lost your eyesight afore losing your way for the
road across the portage is cut to a good two rods and is as grand a
path i calculate as any that runs into london or even before the
palace of the king himself

we will not dispute concerning the excellence of the passage returned
heyward smiling for as the reader has anticipated it was he it is
enough for the present that we trusted to an indian guide to take
us by a nearer though blinder path and that we are deceived in his
knowledge in plain words we know not where we are

an indian lost in the woods said the scout shaking his head
doubtingly when the sun is scorching the tree tops and the water
courses are full when the moss on every beech he sees will tell him in
what quarter the north star will shine at night the woods are full
of deer-paths which run to the streams and licks places well known to
everybody nor have the geese done their flight to the canada waters
altogether tis strange that an indian should be lost atwixt horican
and the bend in the river is he a mohawk

not by birth though adopted in that tribe i think his birthplace was
farther north and he is one of those you call a huron

hugh exclaimed the two companions of the scout who had continued
until this part of the dialogue seated immovable and apparently
indifferent to what passed but who now sprang to their feet with an
activity and interest that had evidently got the better of their reserve
by surprise

a huron repeated the sturdy scout once more shaking his head in
open distrust they are a thievish race nor do i care by whom they are
adopted you can never make anything of them but skulks and vagabonds
since you trusted yourself to the care of one of that nation i only
wonder that you have not fallen in with more

of that there is little danger since william henry is so many miles
in our front you forget that i have told you our guide is now a mohawk
and that he serves with our forces as a friend

and i tell you that he who is born a mingo will die a mingo returned
the other positively a mohawk no give me a delaware or a mohican
for honesty and when they will fight which they won't all do having
suffered their cunning enemies the maquas to make them women but
when they will fight at all look to a delaware or a mohican for a
warrior

enough of this said heyward impatiently i wish not to inquire into
the character of a man that i know and to whom you must be a stranger
you have not yet answered my question what is our distance from the
main army at edward

it seems that may depend on who is your guide one would think such
a horse as that might get over a good deal of ground atwixt sun-up and
sun-down

i wish no contention of idle words with you friend said heyward
curbing his dissatisfied manner and speaking in a more gentle voice
if you will tell me the distance to fort edward and conduct me
thither your labor shall not go without its reward

and in so doing how know i that i don't guide an enemy and a spy of
montcalm to the works of the army it is not every man who can speak
the english tongue that is an honest subject

if you serve with the troops of whom i judge you to be a scout you
should know of such a regiment of the king as the sixtieth

the sixtieth you can tell me little of the royal americans that
i don't know though i do wear a hunting-shirt instead of a scarlet
jacket

well then among other things you may know the name of its major

its major interrupted the hunter elevating his body like one who was
proud of his trust if there is a man in the country who knows major
effingham he stands before you

it is a corps which has many majors the gentleman you name is the
senior but i speak of the junior of them all he who commands the
companies in garrison at william henry

yes yes i have heard that a young gentleman of vast riches from one
of the provinces far south has got the place he is over young too
to hold such rank and to be put above men whose heads are beginning to
bleach and yet they say he is a soldier in his knowledge and a gallant
gentleman

whatever he may be or however he may be qualified for his rank he now
speaks to you and of course can be no enemy to dread

the scout regarded heyward in surprise and then lifting his cap he
answered in a tone less confident than before though still expressing
doubt

i have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the
lake shore

you have heard the truth but i preferred a nearer route trusting to
the knowledge of the indian i mentioned

and he deceived you and then deserted

neither as i believe certainly not the latter for he is to be found
in the rear

i should like to look at the creature if it is a true iroquois i
can tell him by his knavish look and by his paint said the scout
stepping past the charger of heyward and entering the path behind the
mare of the singing master whose foal had taken advantage of the halt
to exact the maternal contribution after shoving aside the bushes
and proceeding a few paces he encountered the females who awaited
the result of the conference with anxiety and not entirely without
apprehension behind these the runner leaned against a tree where he
stood the close examination of the scout with an air unmoved though
with a look so dark and savage that it might in itself excite fear
satisfied with his scrutiny the hunter soon left him as he repassed
the females he paused a moment to gaze upon their beauty answering to
the smile and nod of alice with a look of open pleasure thence he went
to the side of the motherly animal and spending a minute in a fruitless
inquiry into the character of her rider he shook his head and returned
to heyward

a mingo is a mingo and god having made him so neither the mohawks nor
any other tribe can alter him he said when he had regained his former
position if we were alone and you would leave that noble horse at the
mercy of the wolves to-night i could show you the way to edward myself
within an hour for it lies only about an hour's journey hence but with
such ladies in your company tis impossible

and why they are fatigued but they are quite equal to a ride of a few
more miles

tis a natural impossibility repeated the scout i wouldn't walk
a mile in these woods after night gets into them in company with that
runner for the best rifle in the colonies they are full of outlying
iroquois and your mongrel mohawk knows where to find them too well to
be my companion

think you so said heyward leaning forward in the saddle and
dropping his voice nearly to a whisper i confess i have not been
without my own suspicions though i have endeavored to conceal them
and affected a confidence i have not always felt on account of my
companions it was because i suspected him that i would follow no
longer making him as you see follow me

i knew he was one of the cheats as soon as i laid eyes on him
returned the scout placing a finger on his nose in sign of caution

the thief is leaning against the foot of the sugar sapling that you
can see over them bushes his right leg is in a line with the bark of
the tree and tapping his rifle i can take him from where i stand
between the angle and the knee with a single shot putting an end
to his tramping through the woods for at least a month to come if i
should go back to him the cunning varmint would suspect something and
be dodging through the trees like a frightened deer

it will not do he may be innocent and i dislike the act though if i
felt confident of his treachery 

tis a safe thing to calculate on the knavery of an iroquois said the
scout throwing his rifle forward by a sort of instinctive movement

hold interrupted heyward it will not do we must think of some
other scheme and yet i have much reason to believe the rascal has
deceived me

the hunter who had already abandoned his intention of maiming the
runner mused a moment and then made a gesture which instantly brought
his two red companions to his side they spoke together earnestly in the
delaware language though in an undertone and by the gestures of
the white man which were frequently directed towards the top of the
sapling it was evident he pointed out the situation of their hidden
enemy his companions were not long in comprehending his wishes and
laying aside their firearms they parted taking opposite sides of
the path and burying themselves in the thicket with such cautious
movements that their steps were inaudible

now go you back said the hunter speaking again to heyward and
hold the imp in talk these mohicans here will take him without breaking
his paint

nay said heyward proudly i will seize him myself

hist what could you do mounted against an indian in the bushes

i will dismount

and think you when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup he
would wait for the other to be free whoever comes into the woods to
deal with the natives must use indian fashions if he would wish to
prosper in his undertakings go then talk openly to the miscreant and
seem to believe him the truest friend you have on arth

heyward prepared to comply though with strong disgust at the nature of
the office he was compelled to execute each moment however pressed
upon him a conviction of the critical situation in which he had suffered
his invaluable trust to be involved through his own confidence the sun
had already disappeared and the woods suddenly deprived of his light
were assuming a dusky hue which keenly reminded him that the hour the
savage usually chose for his most barbarous and remorseless acts
of vengeance or hostility was speedily drawing near stimulated by
apprehension he left the scout who immediately entered into a loud
conversation with the stranger that had so unceremoniously enlisted
himself in the party of travelers that morning in passing his gentler
companions heyward uttered a few words of encouragement and was
pleased to find that though fatigued with the exercise of the day they
appeared to entertain no suspicion that their present embarrassment was
other than the result of accident giving them reason to believe he
was merely employed in a consultation concerning the future route
he spurred his charger and drew the reins again when the animal had
carried him within a few yards of the place where the sullen runner
still stood leaning against the tree

 the scene of this tale was in the d degree of latitude
 where the twilight is never of long continuation

you may see magua he said endeavoring to assume an air of freedom
and confidence that the night is closing around us and yet we are no
nearer to william henry than when we left the encampment of webb with
the rising sun

you have missed the way nor have i been more fortunate but happily
we have fallen in with a hunter he whom you hear talking to the singer
that is acquainted with the deerpaths and by-ways of the woods and
who promises to lead us to a place where we may rest securely till the
morning

the indian riveted his glowing eyes on heyward as he asked in his
imperfect english is he alone

alone hesitatingly answered heyward to whom deception was too new to
be assumed without embarrassment oh not alone surely magua for you
know that we are with him

then le renard subtil will go returned the runner coolly raising
his little wallet from the place where it had lain at his feet and the
pale faces will see none but their own color

go whom call you le renard

tis the name his canada fathers have given to magua returned the
runner with an air that manifested his pride at the distinction night
is the same as day to le subtil when munro waits for him

and what account will le renard give the chief of william henry
concerning his daughters will he dare to tell the hot-blooded scotsman
that his children are left without a guide though magua promised to be
one

though the gray head has a loud voice and a long arm le renard will
not hear him nor feel him in the woods

but what will the mohawks say they will make him petticoats and bid
him stay in the wigwam with the women for he is no longer to be trusted
with the business of a man

le subtil knows the path to the great lakes and he can find the bones
of his fathers was the answer of the unmoved runner

enough magua said heyward are we not friends why should there be
bitter words between us munro has promised you a gift for your services
when performed and i shall be your debtor for another rest your weary
limbs then and open your wallet to eat we have a few moments to
spare let us not waste them in talk like wrangling women when the
ladies are refreshed we will proceed

the pale faces make themselves dogs to their women muttered the
indian in his native language and when they want to eat their
warriors must lay aside the tomahawk to feed their laziness

what say you renard

le subtil says it is good

the indian then fastened his eyes keenly on the open countenance of
heyward but meeting his glance he turned them quickly away and
seating himself deliberately on the ground he drew forth the remnant of
some former repast and began to eat though not without first bending
his looks slowly and cautiously around him

this is well continued heyward and le renard will have strength and
sight to find the path in the morning he paused for sounds like the
snapping of a dried stick and the rustling of leaves rose from the
adjacent bushes but recollecting himself instantly he continued we
must be moving before the sun is seen or montcalm may lie in our path
and shut us out from the fortress

the hand of magua dropped from his mouth to his side and though
his eyes were fastened on the ground his head was turned aside his
nostrils expanded and his ears seemed even to stand more erect than
usual giving to him the appearance of a statue that was made to
represent intense attention

heyward who watched his movements with a vigilant eye carelessly
extricated one of his feet from the stirrup while he passed a hand
toward the bear-skin covering of his holsters

every effort to detect the point most regarded by the runner was
completely frustrated by the tremulous glances of his organs which
seemed not to rest a single instant on any particular object and which
at the same time could be hardly said to move while he hesitated how
to proceed le subtil cautiously raised himself to his feet though with
a motion so slow and guarded that not the slightest noise was produced
by the change heyward felt it had now become incumbent on him to act
throwing his leg over the saddle he dismounted with a determination to
advance and seize his treacherous companion trusting the result to his
own manhood in order however to prevent unnecessary alarm he still
preserved an air of calmness and friendship

le renard subtil does not eat he said using the appellation he had
found most flattering to the vanity of the indian his corn is not
well parched and it seems dry let me examine perhaps something may be
found among my own provisions that will help his appetite

magua held out the wallet to the proffer of the other he even suffered
their hands to meet without betraying the least emotion or varying his
riveted attitude of attention but when he felt the fingers of heyward
moving gently along his own naked arm he struck up the limb of the
young man and uttering a piercing cry he darted beneath it and
plunged at a single bound into the opposite thicket at the next
instant the form of chingachgook appeared from the bushes looking like
a specter in its paint and glided across the path in swift pursuit
next followed the shout of uncas when the woods were lighted by a
sudden flash that was accompanied by the sharp report of the hunter's
rifle




chapter 

 in such a night
 did this be fearfully o'ertrip the dew
 and saw the lion's shadow ere himself merchant of venice

the suddenness of the flight of his guide and the wild cries of the
pursuers caused heyward to remain fixed for a few moments in inactive
surprise then recollecting the importance of securing the fugitive he
dashed aside the surrounding bushes and pressed eagerly forward to lend
his aid in the chase before he had however proceeded a hundred yards
he met the three foresters already returning from their unsuccessful
pursuit

why so soon disheartened he exclaimed the scoundrel must be
concealed behind some of these trees and may yet be secured we are not
safe while he goes at large

would you set a cloud to chase the wind returned the disappointed
scout i heard the imp brushing over the dry leaves like a black
snake and blinking a glimpse of him just over ag'in yon big pine i
pulled as it might be on the scent but twouldn't do and yet for a
reasoning aim if anybody but myself had touched the trigger i should
call it a quick sight and i may be accounted to have experience in
these matters and one who ought to know look at this sumach its
leaves are red though everybody knows the fruit is in the yellow
blossom in the month of july

tis the blood of le subtil he is hurt and may yet fall

no no returned the scout in decided disapprobation of this opinion
i rubbed the bark off a limb perhaps but the creature leaped the
longer for it a rifle bullet acts on a running animal when it barks
him much the same as one of your spurs on a horse that is it quickens
motion and puts life into the flesh instead of taking it away but
when it cuts the ragged hole after a bound or two there is commonly
a stagnation of further leaping be it indian or be it deer

we are four able bodies to one wounded man

is life grievous to you interrupted the scout yonder red devil
would draw you within swing of the tomahawks of his comrades before you
were heated in the chase it was an unthoughtful act in a man who has so
often slept with the war-whoop ringing in the air to let off his piece
within sound of an ambushment but then it was a natural temptation
twas very natural come friends let us move our station and in such
fashion too as will throw the cunning of a mingo on a wrong scent or
our scalps will be drying in the wind in front of montcalm's marquee
ag'in this hour to-morrow

this appalling declaration which the scout uttered with the cool
assurance of a man who fully comprehended while he did not fear to face
the danger served to remind heyward of the importance of the charge
with which he himself had been intrusted glancing his eyes around with
a vain effort to pierce the gloom that was thickening beneath the
leafy arches of the forest he felt as if cut off from human aid
his unresisting companions would soon lie at the entire mercy of those
barbarous enemies who like beasts of prey only waited till the
gathering darkness might render their blows more fatally certain his
awakened imagination deluded by the deceptive light converted each
waving bush or the fragment of some fallen tree into human forms and
twenty times he fancied he could distinguish the horrid visages of
his lurking foes peering from their hiding places in never ceasing
watchfulness of the movements of his party looking upward he found
that the thin fleecy clouds which evening had painted on the blue
sky were already losing their faintest tints of rose-color while the
imbedded stream which glided past the spot where he stood was to be
traced only by the dark boundary of its wooded banks

what is to be done he said feeling the utter helplessness of doubt
in such a pressing strait desert me not for god's sake remain to
defend those i escort and freely name your own reward

his companions who conversed apart in the language of their tribe
heeded not this sudden and earnest appeal though their dialogue was
maintained in low and cautious sounds but little above a whisper
heyward who now approached could easily distinguish the earnest tones
of the younger warrior from the more deliberate speeches of his seniors
it was evident that they debated on the propriety of some measure that
nearly concerned the welfare of the travelers yielding to his powerful
interest in the subject and impatient of a delay that seemed fraught
with so much additional danger heyward drew still nigher to the dusky
group with an intention of making his offers of compensation more
definite when the white man motioning with his hand as if he conceded
the disputed point turned away saying in a sort of soliloquy and in
the english tongue

uncas is right it would not be the act of men to leave such harmless
things to their fate even though it breaks up the harboring place
forever if you would save these tender blossoms from the fangs of
the worst of serpents gentleman you have neither time to lose nor
resolution to throw away

how can such a wish be doubted have i not already offered 

offer your prayers to him who can give us wisdom to circumvent the
cunning of the devils who fill these woods calmly interrupted the
scout but spare your offers of money which neither you may live to
realize nor i to profit by these mohicans and i will do what man's
thoughts can invent to keep such flowers which though so sweet were
never made for the wilderness from harm and that without hope of
any other recompense but such as god always gives to upright dealings
first you must promise two things both in your own name and for your
friends or without serving you we shall only injure ourselves

name them

the one is to be still as these sleeping woods let what will happen
and the other is to keep the place where we shall take you forever a
secret from all mortal men

i will do my utmost to see both these conditions fulfilled

then follow for we are losing moments that are as precious as the
heart's blood to a stricken deer

heyward could distinguish the impatient gesture of the scout through
the increasing shadows of the evening and he moved in his footsteps
swiftly toward the place where he had left the remainder of the
party when they rejoined the expecting and anxious females he briefly
acquainted them with the conditions of their new guide and with the
necessity that existed for their hushing every apprehension in instant
and serious exertions although his alarming communication was not
received without much secret terror by the listeners his earnest and
impressive manner aided perhaps by the nature of the danger succeeded
in bracing their nerves to undergo some unlooked-for and unusual trial
silently and without a moment's delay they permitted him to assist
them from their saddles and when they descended quickly to the water's
edge where the scout had collected the rest of the party more by the
agency of expressive gestures than by any use of words

what to do with these dumb creatures muttered the white man on whom
the sole control of their future movements appeared to devolve it
would be time lost to cut their throats and cast them into the river
and to leave them here would be to tell the mingoes that they have not
far to seek to find their owners

then give them their bridles and let them range the woods heyward
ventured to suggest

no it would be better to mislead the imps and make them believe they
must equal a horse's speed to run down their chase ay ay that will
blind their fireballs of eyes chingach hist what stirs the bush

the colt

that colt at least must die muttered the scout grasping at the
mane of the nimble beast which easily eluded his hand uncas your
arrows

hold exclaimed the proprietor of the condemned animal aloud without
regard to the whispering tones used by the others spare the foal
of miriam it is the comely offspring of a faithful dam and would
willingly injure naught

when men struggle for the single life god has given them said the
scout sternly even their own kind seem no more than the beasts of the
wood if you speak again i shall leave you to the mercy of the maquas
draw to your arrow's head uncas we have no time for second blows

the low muttering sounds of his threatening voice were still audible
when the wounded foal first rearing on its hinder legs plunged forward
to its knees it was met by chingachgook whose knife passed across its
throat quicker than thought and then precipitating the motions of the
struggling victim he dashed into the river down whose stream it glided
away gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life this deed of
apparent cruelty but of real necessity fell upon the spirits of the
travelers like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood
heightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of the actors
in the scene the sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other
while heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had
just drawn from their holsters as he placed himself between his charge
and those dense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before
the bosom of the forest

the indians however hesitated not a moment but taking the bridles
they led the frightened and reluctant horses into the bed of the river

at a short distance from the shore they turned and were soon concealed
by the projection of the bank under the brow of which they moved in
a direction opposite to the course of the waters in the meantime the
scout drew a canoe of bark from its place of concealment beneath some
low bushes whose branches were waving with the eddies of the current
into which he silently motioned for the females to enter they complied
without hesitation though many a fearful and anxious glance was thrown
behind them toward the thickening gloom which now lay like a dark
barrier along the margin of the stream

so soon as cora and alice were seated the scout without regarding the
element directed heyward to support one side of the frail vessel
and posting himself at the other they bore it up against the stream
followed by the dejected owner of the dead foal in this manner they
proceeded for many rods in a silence that was only interrupted by the
rippling of the water as its eddies played around them or the low dash
made by their own cautious footsteps heyward yielded the guidance of
the canoe implicitly to the scout who approached or receded from the
shore to avoid the fragments of rocks or deeper parts of the river
with a readiness that showed his knowledge of the route they held
occasionally he would stop and in the midst of a breathing stillness
that the dull but increasing roar of the waterfall only served to render
more impressive he would listen with painful intenseness to catch any
sounds that might arise from the slumbering forest when assured that
all was still and unable to detect even by the aid of his practiced
senses any sign of his approaching foes he would deliberately resume
his slow and guarded progress at length they reached a point in the
river where the roving eye of heyward became riveted on a cluster of
black objects collected at a spot where the high bank threw a deeper
shadow than usual on the dark waters hesitating to advance he pointed
out the place to the attention of his companion

ay returned the composed scout the indians have hid the beasts with
the judgment of natives water leaves no trail and an owl's eyes would
be blinded by the darkness of such a hole

the whole party was soon reunited and another consultation was held
between the scout and his new comrades during which they whose fates
depended on the faith and ingenuity of these unknown foresters had a
little leisure to observe their situation more minutely

the river was confined between high and cragged rocks one of which
impended above the spot where the canoe rested as these again were
surmounted by tall trees which appeared to totter on the brows of the
precipice it gave the stream the appearance of running through a deep
and narrow dell all beneath the fantastic limbs and ragged tree tops
which were here and there dimly painted against the starry zenith
lay alike in shadowed obscurity behind them the curvature of the banks
soon bounded the view by the same dark and wooded outline but in front
and apparently at no great distance the water seemed piled against
the heavens whence it tumbled into caverns out of which issued those
sullen sounds that had loaded the evening atmosphere it seemed in
truth to be a spot devoted to seclusion and the sisters imbibed a
soothing impression of security as they gazed upon its romantic though
not unappalling beauties a general movement among their conductors
however soon recalled them from a contemplation of the wild charms that
night had assisted to lend the place to a painful sense of their real
peril

the horses had been secured to some scattering shrubs that grew in the
fissures of the rocks where standing in the water they were left to
pass the night the scout directed heyward and his disconsolate fellow
travelers to seat themselves in the forward end of the canoe and took
possession of the other himself as erect and steady as if he floated
in a vessel of much firmer materials the indians warily retraced their
steps toward the place they had left when the scout placing his pole
against a rock by a powerful shove sent his frail bark directly into
the turbulent stream for many minutes the struggle between the light
bubble in which they floated and the swift current was severe and
doubtful forbidden to stir even a hand and almost afraid to breath
lest they should expose the frail fabric to the fury of the stream
the passengers watched the glancing waters in feverish suspense
twenty times they thought the whirling eddies were sweeping them to
destruction when the master-hand of their pilot would bring the bows of
the canoe to stem the rapid a long a vigorous and as it appeared
to the females a desperate effort closed the struggle just as alice
veiled her eyes in horror under the impression that they were about
to be swept within the vortex at the foot of the cataract the canoe
floated stationary at the side of a flat rock that lay on a level
with the water

where are we and what is next to be done demanded heyward
perceiving that the exertions of the scout had ceased

you are at the foot of glenn's returned the other speaking aloud
without fear of consequences within the roar of the cataract and the
next thing is to make a steady landing lest the canoe upset and you
should go down again the hard road we have traveled faster than you came
up tis a hard rift to stem when the river is a little swelled and
five is an unnatural number to keep dry in a hurry-skurry with a
little birchen bark and gum there go you all on the rock and i will
bring up the mohicans with the venison a man had better sleep without
his scalp than famish in the midst of plenty

his passengers gladly complied with these directions as the last foot
touched the rock the canoe whirled from its station when the tall form
of the scout was seen for an instant gliding above the waters before
it disappeared in the impenetrable darkness that rested on the bed of
the river left by their guide the travelers remained a few minutes in
helpless ignorance afraid even to move along the broken rocks lest a
false step should precipitate them down some one of the many deep and
roaring caverns into which the water seemed to tumble on every side
of them their suspense however was soon relieved for aided by the
skill of the natives the canoe shot back into the eddy and floated
again at the side of the low rock before they thought the scout had
even time to rejoin his companions

we are now fortified garrisoned and provisioned cried heyward
cheerfully and may set montcalm and his allies at defiance how now
my vigilant sentinel can see anything of those you call the iroquois
on the main land

i call them iroquois because to me every native who speaks a foreign
tongue is accounted an enemy though he may pretend to serve the king
if webb wants faith and honesty in an indian let him bring out the
tribes of the delawares and send these greedy and lying mohawks and
oneidas with their six nations of varlets where in nature they belong
among the french

we should then exchange a warlike for a useless friend i have heard
that the delawares have laid aside the hatchet and are content to be
called women

aye shame on the hollanders and iroquois who circumvented them by
their deviltries into such a treaty but i have known them for twenty
years and i call him liar that says cowardly blood runs in the veins
of a delaware you have driven their tribes from the seashore and would
now believe what their enemies say that you may sleep at night upon an
easy pillow no no to me every indian who speaks a foreign tongue
is an iroquois whether the castle of his tribe be in canada or be in
york

 the principal villages of the indians are still called
 castles by the whites of new york oneida castle is no
 more than a scattered hamlet but the name is in general
 use

heyward perceiving that the stubborn adherence of the scout to the
cause of his friends the delawares or mohicans for they were branches
of the same numerous people was likely to prolong a useless discussion
changed the subject

treaty or no treaty i know full well that your two companions are
brave and cautious warriors have they heard or seen anything of our
enemies

an indian is a mortal to be felt afore he is seen returned the scout
ascending the rock and throwing the deer carelessly down i trust to
other signs than such as come in at the eye when i am outlying on the
trail of the mingoes

do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat

i should be sorry to think they had though this is a spot that stout
courage might hold for a smart scrimmage i will not deny however
but the horses cowered when i passed them as though they scented the
wolves and a wolf is a beast that is apt to hover about an indian
ambushment craving the offals of the deer the savages kill

you forget the buck at your feet or may we not owe their visit to the
dead colt ha what noise is that

poor miriam murmured the stranger thy foal was foreordained to
become a prey to ravenous beasts then suddenly lifting up his voice
amid the eternal din of the waters he sang aloud first born of egypt
smite did he of mankind and of beast also o egypt wonders sent
midst thee on pharaoh and his servants too

the death of the colt sits heavy on the heart of its owner said the
scout but it's a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb friends
he has the religion of the matter in believing what is to happen will
happen and with such a consolation it won't be long afore he submits
to the rationality of killing a four-footed beast to save the lives of
human men it may be as you say he continued reverting to the purport
of heyward's last remark and the greater the reason why we should cut
our steaks and let the carcass drive down the stream or we shall have
the pack howling along the cliffs begrudging every mouthful we swallow
besides though the delaware tongue is the same as a book to the
iroquois the cunning varlets are quick enough at understanding the
reason of a wolf's howl

the scout while making his remarks was busied in collecting certain
necessary implements as he concluded he moved silently by the group
of travelers accompanied by the mohicans who seemed to comprehend his
intentions with instinctive readiness when the whole three
disappeared in succession seeming to vanish against the dark face of
a perpendicular rock that rose to the height of a few yards within as
many feet of the water's edge




chapter 

 those strains that once did sweet in zion glide
 he wales a portion with judicious care
 and let us worship god he says with solemn air burns

heyward and his female companions witnessed this mysterious movement
with secret uneasiness for though the conduct of the white man had
hitherto been above reproach his rude equipments blunt address
and strong antipathies together with the character of his silent
associates were all causes for exciting distrust in minds that had been
so recently alarmed by indian treachery

the stranger alone disregarded the passing incidents he seated
himself on a projection of the rocks whence he gave no other signs
of consciousness than by the struggles of his spirit as manifested in
frequent and heavy sighs smothered voices were next heard as though
men called to each other in the bowels of the earth when a sudden light
flashed upon those without and laid bare the much-prized secret of the
place

at the further extremity of a narrow deep cavern in the rock whose
length appeared much extended by the perspective and the nature of the
light by which it was seen was seated the scout holding a blazing
knot of pine the strong glare of the fire fell full upon his sturdy
weather-beaten countenance and forest attire lending an air of romantic
wildness to the aspect of an individual who seen by the sober light of
day would have exhibited the peculiarities of a man remarkable for the
strangeness of his dress the iron-like inflexibility of his frame
and the singular compound of quick vigilant sagacity and of exquisite
simplicity that by turns usurped the possession of his muscular
features at a little distance in advance stood uncas his whole person
thrown powerfully into view the travelers anxiously regarded the
upright flexible figure of the young mohican graceful and unrestrained
in the attitudes and movements of nature though his person was more
than usually screened by a green and fringed hunting-shirt like that of
the white man there was no concealment to his dark glancing fearless
eye alike terrible and calm the bold outline of his high haughty
features pure in their native red or to the dignified elevation of his
receding forehead together with all the finest proportions of a noble
head bared to the generous scalping tuft it was the first opportunity
possessed by duncan and his companions to view the marked lineaments of
either of their indian attendants and each individual of the party felt
relieved from a burden of doubt as the proud and determined though
wild expression of the features of the young warrior forced itself on
their notice they felt it might be a being partially benighted in the
vale of ignorance but it could not be one who would willingly devote
his rich natural gifts to the purposes of wanton treachery the
ingenuous alice gazed at his free air and proud carriage as she would
have looked upon some precious relic of the grecian chisel to which
life had been imparted by the intervention of a miracle while heyward
though accustomed to see the perfection of form which abounds among
the uncorrupted natives openly expressed his admiration at such an
unblemished specimen of the noblest proportions of man

i could sleep in peace whispered alice in reply with such a
fearless and generous-looking youth for my sentinel surely duncan
those cruel murders those terrific scenes of torture of which we read
and hear so much are never acted in the presence of such as he

this certainly is a rare and brilliant instance of those natural
qualities in which these peculiar people are said to excel he
answered i agree with you alice in thinking that such a front and
eye were formed rather to intimidate than to deceive but let us not
practice a deception upon ourselves by expecting any other exhibition
of what we esteem virtue than according to the fashion of the savage
as bright examples of great qualities are but too uncommon among
christians so are they singular and solitary with the indians though
for the honor of our common nature neither are incapable of producing
them let us then hope that this mohican may not disappoint our wishes
but prove what his looks assert him to be a brave and constant friend

now major heyward speaks as major heyward should said cora who that
looks at this creature of nature remembers the shade of his skin

a short and apparently an embarrassed silence succeeded this remark
which was interrupted by the scout calling to them aloud to enter

this fire begins to show too bright a flame he continued as they
complied and might light the mingoes to our undoing uncas drop the
blanket and show the knaves its dark side this is not such a supper
as a major of the royal americans has a right to expect but i've
known stout detachments of the corps glad to eat their venison raw and
without a relish too here you see we have plenty of salt and can
make a quick broil there's fresh sassafras boughs for the ladies to sit
on which may not be as proud as their my-hog-guinea chairs but which
sends up a sweeter flavor than the skin of any hog can do be it of
guinea or be it of any other land come friend don't be mournful for
the colt twas an innocent thing and had not seen much hardship its
death will save the creature many a sore back and weary foot

 in vulgar parlance the condiments of a repast are called
 by the american a relish substituting the thing for its
 effect these provincial terms are frequently put in the
 mouths of the speakers according to their several
 conditions in life most of them are of local use and
 others quite peculiar to the particular class of men to
 which the character belongs in the present instance the
 scout uses the word with immediate reference to the salt
 with which his own party was so fortunate as to be provided

uncas did as the other had directed and when the voice of hawkeye
ceased the roar of the cataract sounded like the rumbling of distant
thunder

are we quite safe in this cavern demanded heyward is there no
danger of surprise a single armed man at its entrance would hold us
at his mercy

a spectral-looking figure stalked from out of the darkness behind the
scout and seizing a blazing brand held it toward the further extremity
of their place of retreat alice uttered a faint shriek and even cora
rose to her feet as this appalling object moved into the light but
a single word from heyward calmed them with the assurance it was only
their attendant chingachgook who lifting another blanket discovered
that the cavern had two outlets then holding the brand he crossed
a deep narrow chasm in the rocks which ran at right angles with the
passage they were in but which unlike that was open to the heavens
and entered another cave answering to the description of the first in
every essential particular

such old foxes as chingachgook and myself are not often caught in a
barrow with one hole said hawkeye laughing you can easily see the
cunning of the place the rock is black limestone which everybody knows
is soft it makes no uncomfortable pillow where brush and pine wood is
scarce well the fall was once a few yards below us and i dare to say
was in its time as regular and as handsome a sheet of water as any
along the hudson but old age is a great injury to good looks as these
sweet young ladies have yet to l'arn the place is sadly changed these
rocks are full of cracks and in some places they are softer than at
othersome and the water has worked out deep hollows for itself until
it has fallen back ay some hundred feet breaking here and wearing
there until the falls have neither shape nor consistency

in what part of them are we asked heyward

why we are nigh the spot that providence first placed them at but
where it seems they were too rebellious to stay the rock proved
softer on each side of us and so they left the center of the river bare
and dry first working out these two little holes for us to hide in

we are then on an island

ay there are the falls on two sides of us and the river above and
below if you had daylight it would be worth the trouble to step up
on the height of this rock and look at the perversity of the water it
falls by no rule at all sometimes it leaps sometimes it tumbles
there it skips here it shoots in one place tis white as snow and in
another tis green as grass hereabouts it pitches into deep hollows
that rumble and crush the arth and thereaways it ripples and sings
like a brook fashioning whirlpools and gullies in the old stone as if
twas no harder than trodden clay the whole design of the river seems
disconcerted first it runs smoothly as if meaning to go down the
descent as things were ordered then it angles about and faces the
shores nor are there places wanting where it looks backward as if
unwilling to leave the wilderness to mingle with the salt ay lady
the fine cobweb-looking cloth you wear at your throat is coarse
and like a fishnet to little spots i can show you where the river
fabricates all sorts of images as if having broke loose from order it
would try its hand at everything and yet what does it amount to after
the water has been suffered so to have its will for a time like a
headstrong man it is gathered together by the hand that made it and a
few rods below you may see it all flowing on steadily toward the sea
as was foreordained from the first foundation of the arth

while his auditors received a cheering assurance of the security of
their place of concealment from this untutored description of glenn's
they were much inclined to judge differently from hawkeye of its wild
beauties but they were not in a situation to suffer their thoughts to
dwell on the charms of natural objects and as the scout had not found
it necessary to cease his culinary labors while he spoke unless to
point out with a broken fork the direction of some particularly
obnoxious point in the rebellious stream they now suffered their
attention to be drawn to the necessary though more vulgar consideration
of their supper

 glenn's falls are on the hudson some forty or fifty miles
 above the head of tide or that place where the river
 becomes navigable for sloops the description of this
 picturesque and remarkable little cataract as given by the
 scout is sufficiently correct though the application of
 the water to uses of civilized life has materially injured
 its beauties the rocky island and the two caverns are known
 to every traveler since the former sustains the pier of a
 bridge which is now thrown across the river immediately
 above the fall in explanation of the taste of hawkeye it
 should be remembered that men always prize that most which
 is least enjoyed thus in a new country the woods and
 other objects which in an old country would be maintained
 at great cost are got rid of simply with a view of
 improving as it is called

the repast which was greatly aided by the addition of a few delicacies
that heyward had the precaution to bring with him when they left their
horses was exceedingly refreshing to the weary party uncas acted as
attendant to the females performing all the little offices within his
power with a mixture of dignity and anxious grace that served to amuse
heyward who well knew that it was an utter innovation on the
indian customs which forbid their warriors to descend to any menial
employment especially in favor of their women as the rights of
hospitality were however considered sacred among them this little
departure from the dignity of manhood excited no audible comment had
there been one there sufficiently disengaged to become a close observer
he might have fancied that the services of the young chief were not
entirely impartial that while he tendered to alice the gourd of sweet
water and the venison in a trencher neatly carved from the knot of the
pepperidge with sufficient courtesy in performing the same offices
to her sister his dark eye lingered on her rich speaking countenance
once or twice he was compelled to speak to command her attention
of those he served in such cases he made use of english broken and
imperfect but sufficiently intelligible and which he rendered so mild
and musical by his deep guttural voice that it never failed to cause
both ladies to look up in admiration and astonishment in the course
of these civilities a few sentences were exchanged that served to
establish the appearance of an amicable intercourse between the parties

in the meanwhile the gravity of chingcachgook remained immovable he
had seated himself more within the circle of light where the frequent
uneasy glances of his guests were better enabled to separate the natural
expression of his face from the artificial terrors of the war paint
they found a strong resemblance between father and son with the
difference that might be expected from age and hardships the fierceness
of his countenance now seemed to slumber and in its place was to be
seen the quiet vacant composure which distinguishes an indian warrior
when his faculties are not required for any of the greater purposes
of his existence it was however easy to be seen by the occasional
gleams that shot across his swarthy visage that it was only necessary
to arouse his passions in order to give full effect to the terrific
device which he had adopted to intimidate his enemies on the other
hand the quick roving eye of the scout seldom rested he ate and
drank with an appetite that no sense of danger could disturb but his
vigilance seemed never to desert him twenty times the gourd or the
venison was suspended before his lips while his head was turned aside
as though he listened to some distant and distrusted sounds a movement
that never failed to recall his guests from regarding the novelties
of their situation to a recollection of the alarming reasons that had
driven them to seek it as these frequent pauses were never followed by
any remark the momentary uneasiness they created quickly passed away
and for a time was forgotten

come friend said hawkeye drawing out a keg from beneath a cover of
leaves toward the close of the repast and addressing the stranger
who sat at his elbow doing great justice to his culinary skill try
a little spruce twill wash away all thoughts of the colt and quicken
the life in your bosom i drink to our better friendship hoping that
a little horse-flesh may leave no heart-burnings atween us how do you
name yourself

gamut david gamut returned the singing master preparing to wash
down his sorrows in a powerful draught of the woodsman's high-flavored
and well-laced compound

a very good name and i dare say handed down from honest forefathers
i'm an admirator of names though the christian fashions fall far below
savage customs in this particular the biggest coward i ever knew as
called lyon and his wife patience would scold you out of hearing
in less time than a hunted deer would run a rod with an indian tis a
matter of conscience what he calls himself he generally is not that
chingachgook which signifies big sarpent is really a snake big or
little but that he understands the windings and turnings of human
natur and is silent and strikes his enemies when they least expect
him what may be your calling

i am an unworthy instructor in the art of psalmody

anan

i teach singing to the youths of the connecticut levy

you might be better employed the young hounds go laughing and singing
too much already through the woods when they ought not to breathe
louder than a fox in his cover can you use the smoothbore or handle
the rifle

praised be god i have never had occasion to meddle with murderous
implements

perhaps you understand the compass and lay down the watercourses and
mountains of the wilderness on paper in order that they who follow may
find places by their given names

i practice no such employment

you have a pair of legs that might make a long path seem short you
journey sometimes i fancy with tidings for the general

never i follow no other than my own high vocation which is
instruction in sacred music

tis a strange calling muttered hawkeye with an inward laugh to
go through life like a catbird mocking all the ups and downs that may
happen to come out of other men's throats well friend i suppose it
is your gift and mustn't be denied any more than if twas shooting or
some other better inclination let us hear what you can do in that way
twill be a friendly manner of saying good-night for tis time that
these ladies should be getting strength for a hard and a long push in
the pride of the morning afore the maquas are stirring

with joyful pleasure do i consent said david adjusting his
iron-rimmed spectacles and producing his beloved little volume
which he immediately tendered to alice what can be more fitting
and consolatory than to offer up evening praise after a day of such
exceeding jeopardy

alice smiled but regarding heyward she blushed and hesitated

indulge yourself he whispered ought not the suggestion of the
worthy namesake of the psalmist to have its weight at such a moment

encouraged by his opinion alice did what her pious inclinations and
her keen relish for gentle sounds had before so strongly urged the
book was open at a hymn not ill adapted to their situation and in which
the poet no longer goaded by his desire to excel the inspired king
of israel had discovered some chastened and respectable powers cora
betrayed a disposition to support her sister and the sacred song
proceeded after the indispensable preliminaries of the pitchpipe and
the tune had been duly attended to by the methodical david

the air was solemn and slow at times it rose to the fullest compass of
the rich voices of the females who hung over their little book in holy
excitement and again it sank so low that the rushing of the waters ran
through their melody like a hollow accompaniment the natural taste and
true ear of david governed and modified the sounds to suit the confined
cavern every crevice and cranny of which was filled with the thrilling
notes of their flexible voices the indians riveted their eyes on the
rocks and listened with an attention that seemed to turn them into
stone but the scout who had placed his chin in his hand with an
expression of cold indifference gradually suffered his rigid features
to relax until as verse succeeded verse he felt his iron nature
subdued while his recollection was carried back to boyhood when his
ears had been accustomed to listen to similar sounds of praise in the
settlements of the colony his roving eyes began to moisten and before
the hymn was ended scalding tears rolled out of fountains that had long
seemed dry and followed each other down those cheeks that had oftener
felt the storms of heaven than any testimonials of weakness the singers
were dwelling on one of those low dying chords which the ear devours
with such greedy rapture as if conscious that it is about to lose them
when a cry that seemed neither human nor earthly rose in the outward
air penetrating not only the recesses of the cavern but to the inmost
hearts of all who heard it it was followed by a stillness apparently
as deep as if the waters had been checked in their furious progress at
such a horrid and unusual interruption

what is it murmured alice after a few moments of terrible suspense

what is it repeated hewyard aloud

neither hawkeye nor the indians made any reply they listened as if
expecting the sound would be repeated with a manner that expressed
their own astonishment at length they spoke together earnestly in the
delaware language when uncas passing by the inner and most concealed
aperture cautiously left the cavern when he had gone the scout first
spoke in english

what it is or what it is not none here can tell though two of us
have ranged the woods for more than thirty years i did believe there
was no cry that indian or beast could make that my ears had not heard
but this has proved that i was only a vain and conceited mortal

was it not then the shout the warriors make when they wish to
intimidate their enemies asked cora who stood drawing her veil about
her person with a calmness to which her agitated sister was a stranger

no no this was bad and shocking and had a sort of unhuman sound
but when you once hear the war-whoop you will never mistake it for
anything else well uncas speaking in delaware to the young chief as
he re-entered what see you do our lights shine through the blankets

the answer was short and apparently decided being given in the same
tongue

there is nothing to be seen without continued hawkeye shaking his
head in discontent and our hiding-place is still in darkness pass
into the other cave you that need it and seek for sleep we must
be afoot long before the sun and make the most of our time to get to
edward while the mingoes are taking their morning nap

cora set the example of compliance with a steadiness that taught the
more timid alice the necessity of obedience before leaving the place
however she whispered a request to duncan that he would follow uncas
raised the blanket for their passage and as the sisters turned to thank
him for this act of attention they saw the scout seated again before
the dying embers with his face resting on his hands in a manner which
showed how deeply he brooded on the unaccountable interruption which had
broken up their evening devotions

heyward took with him a blazing knot which threw a dim light through
the narrow vista of their new apartment placing it in a favorable
position he joined the females who now found themselves alone with
him for the first time since they had left the friendly ramparts of fort
edward

leave us not duncan said alice we cannot sleep in such a place as
this with that horrid cry still ringing in our ears

first let us examine into the security of your fortress he answered
and then we will speak of rest

he approached the further end of the cavern to an outlet which like
the others was concealed by blankets and removing the thick screen
breathed the fresh and reviving air from the cataract one arm of the
river flowed through a deep narrow ravine which its current had
worn in the soft rock directly beneath his feet forming an effectual
defense as he believed against any danger from that quarter the
water a few rods above them plunging glancing and sweeping along in
its most violent and broken manner

nature has made an impenetrable barrier on this side he continued
pointing down the perpendicular declivity into the dark current before
he dropped the blanket and as you know that good men and true are on
guard in front i see no reason why the advice of our honest host should
be disregarded i am certain cora will join me in saying that sleep is
necessary to you both

cora may submit to the justice of your opinion though she cannot put it
in practice returned the elder sister who had placed herself by the
side of alice on a couch of sassafras there would be other causes to
chase away sleep though we had been spared the shock of this mysterious
noise ask yourself heyward can daughters forget the anxiety a father
must endure whose children lodge he knows not where or how in such a
wilderness and in the midst of so many perils

he is a soldier and knows how to estimate the chances of the woods

he is a father and cannot deny his nature

how kind has he ever been to all my follies how tender and indulgent
to all my wishes sobbed alice we have been selfish sister in
urging our visit at such hazard

i may have been rash in pressing his consent in a moment of much
embarrassment but i would have proved to him that however others might
neglect him in his strait his children at least were faithful

when he heard of your arrival at edward said heyward kindly there
was a powerful struggle in his bosom between fear and love though
the latter heightened if possible by so long a separation quickly
prevailed it is the spirit of my noble-minded cora that leads them
duncan he said and i will not balk it would to god that he who
holds the honor of our royal master in his guardianship would show but
half her firmness

and did he not speak of me heyward demanded alice with jealous
affection surely he forgot not altogether his little elsie

that were impossible returned the young man he called you by a
thousand endearing epithets that i may not presume to use but to the
justice of which i can warmly testify once indeed he said 

duncan ceased speaking for while his eyes were riveted on those of
alice who had turned toward him with the eagerness of filial affection
to catch his words the same strong horrid cry as before filled the
air and rendered him mute a long breathless silence succeeded during
which each looked at the others in fearful expectation of hearing the
sound repeated at length the blanket was slowly raised and the scout
stood in the aperture with a countenance whose firmness evidently
began to give way before a mystery that seemed to threaten some danger
against which all his cunning and experience might prove of no avail




chapter 

 they do not sleep
 on yonder cliffs a grizzly band
 i see them sit gray

twould be neglecting a warning that is given for our good to lie hid
any longer said hawkeye when such sounds are raised in the forest
these gentle ones may keep close but the mohicans and i will watch upon
the rock where i suppose a major of the sixtieth would wish to keep us
company

is then our danger so pressing asked cora

he who makes strange sounds and gives them out for man's information
alone knows our danger i should think myself wicked unto rebellion
against his will was i to burrow with such warnings in the air even
the weak soul who passes his days in singing is stirred by the cry
and as he says is ready to go forth to the battle if twere only a
battle it would be a thing understood by us all and easily managed
but i have heard that when such shrieks are atween heaven and arth it
betokens another sort of warfare

if all our reasons for fear my friend are confined to such as proceed
from supernatural causes we have but little occasion to be alarmed
continued the undisturbed cora are you certain that our enemies have
not invented some new and ingenious method to strike us with terror
that their conquest may become more easy

lady returned the scout solemnly i have listened to all the sounds
of the woods for thirty years as a man will listen whose life and death
depend on the quickness of his ears there is no whine of the panther
no whistle of the catbird nor any invention of the devilish mingoes
that can cheat me i have heard the forest moan like mortal men in their
affliction often and again have i listened to the wind playing
its music in the branches of the girdled trees and i have heard the
lightning cracking in the air like the snapping of blazing brush as it
spitted forth sparks and forked flames but never have i thought that i
heard more than the pleasure of him who sported with the things of his
hand but neither the mohicans nor i who am a white man without a
cross can explain the cry just heard we therefore believe it a sign
given for our good

it is extraordinary said heyward taking his pistols from the place
where he had laid them on entering be it a sign of peace or a signal
of war it must be looked to lead the way my friend i follow

on issuing from their place of confinement the whole party instantly
experienced a grateful renovation of spirits by exchanging the pent
air of the hiding-place for the cool and invigorating atmosphere which
played around the whirlpools and pitches of the cataract a heavy
evening breeze swept along the surface of the river and seemed to drive
the roar of the falls into the recesses of their own cavern whence it
issued heavily and constant like thunder rumbling beyond the distant
hills the moon had risen and its light was already glancing here and
there on the waters above them but the extremity of the rock where they
stood still lay in shadow with the exception of the sounds produced
by the rushing waters and an occasional breathing of the air as it
murmured past them in fitful currents the scene was as still as night
and solitude could make it in vain were the eyes of each individual
bent along the opposite shores in quest of some signs of life that
might explain the nature of the interruption they had heard their
anxious and eager looks were baffled by the deceptive light or rested
only on naked rocks and straight and immovable trees

here is nothing to be seen but the gloom and quiet of a lovely
evening whispered duncan how much should we prize such a scene and
all this breathing solitude at any other moment cora fancy yourselves
in security and what now perhaps increases your terror may be made
conducive to enjoyment 

listen interrupted alice

the caution was unnecessary once more the same sound arose as if from
the bed of the river and having broken out of the narrow bounds of the
cliffs was heard undulating through the forest in distant and dying
cadences

can any here give a name to such a cry demanded hawkeye when the
last echo was lost in the woods if so let him speak for myself i
judge it not to belong to arth

here then is one who can undeceive you said duncan i know the
sound full well for often have i heard it on the field of battle and
in situations which are frequent in a soldier's life tis the horrid
shriek that a horse will give in his agony oftener drawn from him in
pain though sometimes in terror my charger is either a prey to the
beasts of the forest or he sees his danger without the power to avoid
it the sound might deceive me in the cavern but in the open air i know
it too well to be wrong

the scout and his companions listened to this simple explanation with
the interest of men who imbibe new ideas at the same time that they get
rid of old ones which had proved disagreeable inmates the two latter
uttered their usual expressive exclamation hugh as the truth first
glanced upon their minds while the former after a short musing pause
took upon himself to reply

i cannot deny your words he said for i am little skilled in horses
though born where they abound the wolves must be hovering above their
heads on the bank and the timorsome creatures are calling on man
for help in the best manner they are able uncas he spoke in
delaware uncas drop down in the canoe and whirl a brand among the
pack or fear may do what the wolves can't get at to perform and leave
us without horses in the morning when we shall have so much need to
journey swiftly

the young native had already descended to the water to comply when a
long howl was raised on the edge of the river and was borne swiftly
off into the depths of the forest as though the beasts of their
own accord were abandoning their prey in sudden terror uncas with
instinctive quickness receded and the three foresters held another of
their low earnest conferences

we have been like hunters who have lost the points of the heavens and
from whom the sun has been hid for days said hawkeye turning away
from his companions now we begin again to know the signs of our
course and the paths are cleared from briers seat yourselves in the
shade which the moon throws from yonder beech tis thicker than that
of the pines and let us wait for that which the lord may choose to
send next let all your conversation be in whispers though it would be
better and perhaps in the end wiser if each one held discourse with
his own thoughts for a time

the manner of the scout was seriously impressive though no longer
distinguished by any signs of unmanly apprehension it was evident that
his momentary weakness had vanished with the explanation of a mystery
which his own experience had not served to fathom and though he now
felt all the realities of their actual condition that he was prepared
to meet them with the energy of his hardy nature this feeling seemed
also common to the natives who placed themselves in positions which
commanded a full view of both shores while their own persons were
effectually concealed from observation in such circumstances common
prudence dictated that heyward and his companions should imitate a
caution that proceeded from so intelligent a source the young man drew
a pile of the sassafras from the cave and placing it in the chasm which
separated the two caverns it was occupied by the sisters who were
thus protected by the rocks from any missiles while their anxiety
was relieved by the assurance that no danger could approach without
a warning heyward himself was posted at hand so near that he might
communicate with his companions without raising his voice to a dangerous
elevation while david in imitation of the woodsmen bestowed his
person in such a manner among the fissures of the rocks that his
ungainly limbs were no longer offensive to the eye

in this manner hours passed without further interruption the moon
reached the zenith and shed its mild light perpendicularly on the
lovely sight of the sisters slumbering peacefully in each other's arms
duncan cast the wide shawl of cora before a spectacle he so much loved
to contemplate and then suffered his own head to seek a pillow on the
rock david began to utter sounds that would have shocked his delicate
organs in more wakeful moments in short all but hawkeye and the
mohicans lost every idea of consciousness in uncontrollable drowsiness
but the watchfulness of these vigilant protectors neither tired nor
slumbered immovable as that rock of which each appeared to form a
part they lay with their eyes roving without intermission along the
dark margin of trees that bounded the adjacent shores of the narrow
stream not a sound escaped them the most subtle examination could
not have told they breathed it was evident that this excess of caution
proceeded from an experience that no subtlety on the part of their
enemies could deceive it was however continued without any apparent
consequences until the moon had set and a pale streak above the
treetops at the bend of the river a little below announced the
approach of day

then for the first time hawkeye was seen to stir he crawled along the
rock and shook duncan from his heavy slumbers

now is the time to journey he whispered awake the gentle ones and
be ready to get into the canoe when i bring it to the landing-place

have you had a quiet night said heyward for myself i believe sleep
has got the better of my vigilance

all is yet still as midnight be silent but be quick

by this time duncan was thoroughly awake and he immediately lifted the
shawl from the sleeping females the motion caused cora to raise her
hand as if to repulse him while alice murmured in her soft gentle
voice no no dear father we were not deserted duncan was with us

yes sweet innocence whispered the youth duncan is here and while
life continues or danger remains he will never quit thee cora alice
awake the hour has come to move

a loud shriek from the younger of the sisters and the form of the other
standing upright before him in bewildered horror was the unexpected
answer he received

while the words were still on the lips of heyward there had arisen such
a tumult of yells and cries as served to drive the swift currents of his
own blood back from its bounding course into the fountains of his heart
it seemed for near a minute as if the demons of hell had possessed
themselves of the air about them and were venting their savage humors
in barbarous sounds the cries came from no particular direction though
it was evident they filled the woods and as the appalled listeners
easily imagined the caverns of the falls the rocks the bed of the
river and the upper air david raised his tall person in the midst of
the infernal din with a hand on either ear exclaiming

whence comes this discord has hell broke loose that man should utter
sounds like these

the bright flashes and the quick reports of a dozen rifles from the
opposite banks of the stream followed this incautious exposure of his
person and left the unfortunate singing master senseless on that rock
where he had been so long slumbering the mohicans boldly sent back the
intimidating yell of their enemies who raised a shout of savage triumph
at the fall of gamut the flash of rifles was then quick and close
between them but either party was too well skilled to leave even a limb
exposed to the hostile aim duncan listened with intense anxiety for the
strokes of the paddle believing that flight was now their only refuge
the river glanced by with its ordinary velocity but the canoe was
nowhere to be seen on its dark waters he had just fancied they were
cruelly deserted by their scout as a stream of flame issued from the
rock beneath them and a fierce yell blended with a shriek of agony
announced that the messenger of death sent from the fatal weapon of
hawkeye had found a victim at this slight repulse the assailants
instantly withdrew and gradually the place became as still as before
the sudden tumult

duncan seized the favorable moment to spring to the body of gamut
which he bore within the shelter of the narrow chasm that protected the
sisters in another minute the whole party was collected in this spot of
comparative safety

the poor fellow has saved his scalp said hawkeye coolly passing his
hand over the head of david but he is a proof that a man may be born
with too long a tongue twas downright madness to show six feet of
flesh and blood on a naked rock to the raging savages i only wonder
he has escaped with life

is he not dead demanded cora in a voice whose husky tones showed how
powerfully natural horror struggled with her assumed firmness can we
do aught to assist the wretched man

no no the life is in his heart yet and after he has slept awhile he
will come to himself and be a wiser man for it till the hour of his
real time shall come returned hawkeye casting another oblique glance
at the insensible body while he filled his charger with admirable
nicety carry him in uncas and lay him on the sassafras the longer
his nap lasts the better it will be for him as i doubt whether he can
find a proper cover for such a shape on these rocks and singing won't
do any good with the iroquois

you believe then the attack will be renewed asked heyward

do i expect a hungry wolf will satisfy his craving with a mouthful
they have lost a man and tis their fashion when they meet a loss
and fail in the surprise to fall back but we shall have them on again
with new expedients to circumvent us and master our scalps our main
hope he continued raising his rugged countenance across which a
shade of anxiety just then passed like a darkening cloud will be to
keep the rock until munro can send a party to our help god send it may
be soon and under a leader that knows the indian customs

you hear our probable fortunes cora said duncan and you know we
have everything to hope from the anxiety and experience of your father
come then with alice into this cavern where you at least will be
safe from the murderous rifles of our enemies and where you may bestow
a care suited to your gentle natures on our unfortunate comrade

the sisters followed him into the outer cave where david was beginning
by his sighs to give symptoms of returning consciousness and then
commending the wounded man to their attention he immediately prepared
to leave them

duncan said the tremulous voice of cora when he had reached the
mouth of the cavern he turned and beheld the speaker whose color had
changed to a deadly paleness and whose lips quivered gazing after him
with an expression of interest which immediately recalled him to her
side remember duncan how necessary your safety is to our own how
you bear a father's sacred trust how much depends on your discretion
and care in short she added while the telltale blood stole over her
features crimsoning her very temples how very deservedly dear you are
to all of the name of munro

if anything could add to my own base love of life said heyward
suffering his unconscious eyes to wander to the youthful form of
the silent alice it would be so kind an assurance as major of the
sixtieth our honest host will tell you i must take my share of the
fray but our task will be easy it is merely to keep these blood-hounds
at bay for a few hours

without waiting for a reply he tore himself from the presence of the
sisters and joined the scout and his companions who still lay within
the protection of the little chasm between the two caves

i tell you uncas said the former as heyward joined them you are
wasteful of your powder and the kick of the rifle disconcerts your aim
little powder light lead and a long arm seldom fail of bringing the
death screech from a mingo at least such has been my experience with
the creatur's come friends let us to our covers for no man can tell
when or where a maqua will strike his blow

 mingo was the delaware term of the five nations maquas
 was the name given them by the dutch the french from their
 first intercourse with them called them iroquois

the indians silently repaired to their appointed stations which were
fissures in the rocks whence they could command the approaches to the
foot of the falls in the center of the little island a few short and
stunted pines had found root forming a thicket into which hawkeye
darted with the swiftness of a deer followed by the active duncan here
they secured themselves as well as circumstances would permit among
the shrubs and fragments of stone that were scattered about the place
above them was a bare rounded rock on each side of which the water
played its gambols and plunged into the abysses beneath in the manner
already described as the day had now dawned the opposite shores no
longer presented a confused outline but they were able to look into the
woods and distinguish objects beneath a canopy of gloomy pines

a long and anxious watch succeeded but without any further evidences
of a renewed attack and duncan began to hope that their fire had
proved more fatal than was supposed and that their enemies had been
effectually repulsed when he ventured to utter this impression to his
companions it was met by hawkeye with an incredulous shake of the head

you know not the nature of a maqua if you think he is so easily
beaten back without a scalp he answered if there was one of the imps
yelling this morning there were forty and they know our number and
quality too well to give up the chase so soon hist look into the water
above just where it breaks over the rocks i am no mortal if the risky
devils haven't swam down upon the very pitch and as bad luck would
have it they have hit the head of the island hist man keep close or
the hair will be off your crown in the turning of a knife

heyward lifted his head from the cover and beheld what he justly
considered a prodigy of rashness and skill the river had worn away the
edge of the soft rock in such a manner as to render its first pitch
less abrupt and perpendicular than is usual at waterfalls with no other
guide than the ripple of the stream where it met the head of the island
a party of their insatiable foes had ventured into the current and
swam down upon this point knowing the ready access it would give if
successful to their intended victims

as hawkeye ceased speaking four human heads could be seen peering above
a few logs of drift-wood that had lodged on these naked rocks and which
had probably suggested the idea of the practicability of the hazardous
undertaking at the next moment a fifth form was seen floating over the
green edge of the fall a little from the line of the island the savage
struggled powerfully to gain the point of safety and favored by the
glancing water he was already stretching forth an arm to meet the grasp
of his companions when he shot away again with the shirling current
appeared to rise into the air with uplifted arms and starting eyeballs
and fell with a sudden plunge into that deep and yawning abyss over
which he hovered a single wild despairing shriek rose from the
cavern and all was hushed again as the grave

the first generous impulse of duncan was to rush to the rescue of the
hapless wretch but he felt himself bound to the spot by the iron grasp
of the immovable scout

would ye bring certain death upon us by telling the mingoes where we
lie demanded hawkeye sternly tis a charge of powder saved and
ammunition is as precious now as breath to a worried deer freshen the
priming of your pistols the midst of the falls is apt to dampen the
brimstone and stand firm for a close struggle while i fire on their
rush

he placed a finger in his mouth and drew a long shrill whistle which
was answered from the rocks that were guarded by the mohicans duncan
caught glimpses of heads above the scattered drift-wood as this signal
rose on the air but they disappeared again as suddenly as they had
glanced upon his sight a low rustling sound next drew his attention
behind him and turning his head he beheld uncas within a few feet
creeping to his side hawkeye spoke to him in delaware when the young
chief took his position with singular caution and undisturbed coolness
to heyward this was a moment of feverish and impatient suspense though
the scout saw fit to select it as a fit occasion to read a lecture
to his more youthful associates on the art of using firearms with
discretion

of all we'pons he commenced the long barreled true-grooved
soft-metaled rifle is the most dangerous in skillful hands though it
wants a strong arm a quick eye and great judgment in charging to put
forth all its beauties the gunsmiths can have but little insight into
their trade when they make their fowling-pieces and short horsemen's 

he was interrupted by the low but expressive hugh of uncas

i see them boy i see them continued hawkeye they are gathering
for the rush or they would keep their dingy backs below the logs well
let them he added examining his flint the leading man certainly
comes on to his death though it should be montcalm himself

at that moment the woods were filled with another burst of cries and at
the signal four savages sprang from the cover of the driftwood heyward
felt a burning desire to rush forward to meet them so intense was the
delirious anxiety of the moment but he was restrained by the deliberate
examples of the scout and uncas

when their foes who had leaped over the black rocks that divided them
with long bounds uttering the wildest yells were within a few rods
the rifle of hawkeye slowly rose among the shrubs and poured out its
fatal contents the foremost indian bounded like a stricken deer and
fell headlong among the clefts of the island

now uncas cried the scout drawing his long knife while his quick
eyes began to flash with ardor take the last of the screeching imps
of the other two we are sartain

he was obeyed and but two enemies remained to be overcome heyward had
given one of his pistols to hawkeye and together they rushed down a
little declivity toward their foes they discharged their weapons at the
same instant and equally without success

i know'd it and i said it muttered the scout whirling the despised
little implement over the falls with bitter disdain come on ye bloody
minded hell-hounds ye meet a man without a cross

the words were barely uttered when he encountered a savage of gigantic
stature of the fiercest mien at the same moment duncan found himself
engaged with the other in a similar contest of hand to hand with ready
skill hawkeye and his antagonist each grasped that uplifted arm of
the other which held the dangerous knife for near a minute they stood
looking one another in the eye and gradually exerting the power of
their muscles for the mastery

at length the toughened sinews of the white man prevailed over the less
practiced limbs of the native the arm of the latter slowly gave way
before the increasing force of the scout who suddenly wresting his
armed hand from the grasp of the foe drove the sharp weapon through his
naked bosom to the heart in the meantime heyward had been pressed in
a more deadly struggle his slight sword was snapped in the first
encounter as he was destitute of any other means of defense his
safety now depended entirely on bodily strength and resolution though
deficient in neither of these qualities he had met an enemy every way
his equal happily he soon succeeded in disarming his adversary whose
knife fell on the rock at their feet and from this moment it became a
fierce struggle who should cast the other over the dizzy height into a
neighboring cavern of the falls every successive struggle brought them
nearer to the verge where duncan perceived the final and conquering
effort must be made each of the combatants threw all his energies into
that effort and the result was that both tottered on the brink of the
precipice heyward felt the grasp of the other at his throat and
saw the grim smile the savage gave under the revengeful hope that he
hurried his enemy to a fate similar to his own as he felt his body
slowly yielding to a resistless power and the young man experienced the
passing agony of such a moment in all its horrors at that instant of
extreme danger a dark hand and glancing knife appeared before him the
indian released his hold as the blood flowed freely from around the
severed tendons of the wrist and while duncan was drawn backward by the
saving hand of uncas his charmed eyes still were riveted on the
fierce and disappointed countenance of his foe who fell sullenly and
disappointed down the irrecoverable precipice

to cover to cover cried hawkeye who just then had despatched the
enemy to cover for your lives the work is but half ended

the young mohican gave a shout of triumph and followed by duncan he
glided up the acclivity they had descended to the combat and sought the
friendly shelter of the rocks and shrubs




chapter 

 they linger yet
 avengers of their native land gray

the warning call of the scout was not uttered without occasion during
the occurrence of the deadly encounter just related the roar of the
falls was unbroken by any human sound whatever it would seem that
interest in the result had kept the natives on the opposite shores in
breathless suspense while the quick evolutions and swift changes in
the positions of the combatants effectually prevented a fire that might
prove dangerous alike to friend and enemy but the moment the struggle
was decided a yell arose as fierce and savage as wild and revengeful
passions could throw into the air it was followed by the swift flashes
of the rifles which sent their leaden messengers across the rock in
volleys as though the assailants would pour out their impotent fury on
the insensible scene of the fatal contest

a steady though deliberate return was made from the rifle of
chingachgook who had maintained his post throughout the fray with
unmoved resolution when the triumphant shout of uncas was borne to his
ears the gratified father raised his voice in a single responsive cry
after which his busy piece alone proved that he still guarded his pass
with unwearied diligence in this manner many minutes flew by with the
swiftness of thought the rifles of the assailants speaking at times
in rattling volleys and at others in occasional scattering shots
though the rock the trees and the shrubs were cut and torn in a
hundred places around the besieged their cover was so close and so
rigidly maintained that as yet david had been the only sufferer in
their little band

let them burn their powder said the deliberate scout while bullet
after bullet whizzed by the place where he securely lay there will be
a fine gathering of lead when it is over and i fancy the imps will tire
of the sport afore these old stones cry out for mercy uncas boy you
waste the kernels by overcharging and a kicking rifle never carries a
true bullet i told you to take that loping miscreant under the line
of white point now if your bullet went a hair's breadth it went two
inches above it the life lies low in a mingo and humanity teaches us
to make a quick end to the sarpents

a quiet smile lighted the haughty features of the young mohican
betraying his knowledge of the english language as well as of the
other's meaning but he suffered it to pass away without vindication of
reply

i cannot permit you to accuse uncas of want of judgment or of skill
said duncan he saved my life in the coolest and readiest manner and
he has made a friend who never will require to be reminded of the debt
he owes

uncas partly raised his body and offered his hand to the grasp of
heyward during this act of friendship the two young men exchanged
looks of intelligence which caused duncan to forget the character and
condition of his wild associate in the meanwhile hawkeye who looked
on this burst of youthful feeling with a cool but kind regard made the
following reply

life is an obligation which friends often owe each other in the
wilderness i dare say i may have served uncas some such turn myself
before now and i very well remember that he has stood between me
and death five different times three times from the mingoes once in
crossing horican and 

that bullet was better aimed than common exclaimed duncan
involuntarily shrinking from a shot which struck the rock at his side
with a smart rebound

hawkeye laid his hand on the shapeless metal and shook his head as he
examined it saying falling lead is never flattened had it come from
the clouds this might have happened

but the rifle of uncas was deliberately raised toward the heavens
directing the eyes of his companions to a point where the mystery was
immediately explained a ragged oak grew on the right bank of the river
nearly opposite to their position which seeking the freedom of the
open space had inclined so far forward that its upper branches overhung
that arm of the stream which flowed nearest to its own shore among the
topmost leaves which scantily concealed the gnarled and stunted limbs
a savage was nestled partly concealed by the trunk of the tree and
partly exposed as though looking down upon them to ascertain the effect
produced by his treacherous aim

these devils will scale heaven to circumvent us to our ruin said
hawkeye keep him in play boy until i can bring killdeer to bear
when we will try his metal on each side of the tree at once

uncas delayed his fire until the scout uttered the word

the rifles flashed the leaves and bark of the oak flew into the air
and were scattered by the wind but the indian answered their assault by
a taunting laugh sending down upon them another bullet in return that
struck the cap of hawkeye from his head once more the savage yells
burst out of the woods and the leaden hail whistled above the heads of
the besieged as if to confine them to a place where they might become
easy victims to the enterprise of the warrior who had mounted the tree

this must be looked to said the scout glancing about him with
an anxious eye uncas call up your father we have need of all our
we'pons to bring the cunning varmint from his roost

the signal was instantly given and before hawkeye had reloaded his
rifle they were joined by chingachgook when his son pointed out to the
experienced warrior the situation of their dangerous enemy the
usual exclamatory hugh burst from his lips after which no further
expression of surprise or alarm was suffered to escape him hawkeye and
the mohicans conversed earnestly together in delaware for a few moments
when each quietly took his post in order to execute the plan they had
speedily devised

the warrior in the oak had maintained a quick though ineffectual fire
from the moment of his discovery but his aim was interrupted by the
vigilance of his enemies whose rifles instantaneously bore on any
part of his person that was left exposed still his bullets fell in the
center of the crouching party the clothes of heyward which rendered
him peculiarly conspicuous were repeatedly cut and once blood was
drawn from a slight wound in his arm

at length emboldened by the long and patient watchfulness of his
enemies the huron attempted a better and more fatal aim the quick eyes
of the mohicans caught the dark line of his lower limbs incautiously
exposed through the thin foliage a few inches from the trunk of the
tree their rifles made a common report when sinking on his wounded
limb part of the body of the savage came into view swift as thought
hawkeye seized the advantage and discharged his fatal weapon into the
top of the oak the leaves were unusually agitated the dangerous rifle
fell from its commanding elevation and after a few moments of vain
struggling the form of the savage was seen swinging in the wind
while he still grasped a ragged and naked branch of the tree with hands
clenched in desperation

give him in pity give him the contents of another rifle cried
duncan turning away his eyes in horror from the spectacle of a fellow
creature in such awful jeopardy

not a karnel exclaimed the obdurate hawkeye his death is certain
and we have no powder to spare for indian fights sometimes last for
days tis their scalps or ours and god who made us has put into our
natures the craving to keep the skin on the head

against this stern and unyielding morality supported as it was by such
visible policy there was no appeal from that moment the yells in the
forest once more ceased the fire was suffered to decline and all
eyes those of friends as well as enemies became fixed on the hopeless
condition of the wretch who was dangling between heaven and earth
the body yielded to the currents of air and though no murmur or groan
escaped the victim there were instants when he grimly faced his foes
and the anguish of cold despair might be traced through the intervening
distance in possession of his swarthy lineaments three several times
the scout raised his piece in mercy and as often prudence getting the
better of his intention it was again silently lowered at length one
hand of the huron lost its hold and dropped exhausted to his side a
desperate and fruitless struggle to recover the branch succeeded and
then the savage was seen for a fleeting instant grasping wildly at
the empty air the lightning is not quicker than was the flame from the
rifle of hawkeye the limbs of the victim trembled and contracted the
head fell to the bosom and the body parted the foaming waters like
lead when the element closed above it in its ceaseless velocity and
every vestige of the unhappy huron was lost forever

no shout of triumph succeeded this important advantage but even the
mohicans gazed at each other in silent horror a single yell burst
from the woods and all was again still hawkeye who alone appeared to
reason on the occasion shook his head at his own momentary weakness
even uttering his self-disapprobation aloud

twas the last charge in my horn and the last bullet in my pouch and
twas the act of a boy he said what mattered it whether he struck
the rock living or dead feeling would soon be over uncas lad go down
to the canoe and bring up the big horn it is all the powder we have
left and we shall need it to the last grain or i am ignorant of the
mingo nature

the young mohican complied leaving the scout turning over the
useless contents of his pouch and shaking the empty horn with renewed
discontent from this unsatisfactory examination however he was soon
called by a loud and piercing exclamation from uncas that sounded
even to the unpracticed ears of duncan as the signal of some new and
unexpected calamity every thought filled with apprehension for the
previous treasure he had concealed in the cavern the young man started
to his feet totally regardless of the hazard he incurred by such an
exposure as if actuated by a common impulse his movement was imitated
by his companions and together they rushed down the pass to the
friendly chasm with a rapidity that rendered the scattering fire of
their enemies perfectly harmless the unwonted cry had brought the
sisters together with the wounded david from their place of refuge
and the whole party at a single glance was made acquainted with the
nature of the disaster that had disturbed even the practiced stoicism of
their youthful indian protector

at a short distance from the rock their little bark was to be seen
floating across the eddy toward the swift current of the river in a
manner which proved that its course was directed by some hidden agent
the instant this unwelcome sight caught the eye of the scout his rifle
was leveled as by instinct but the barrel gave no answer to the bright
sparks of the flint

tis too late tis too late hawkeye exclaimed dropping the useless
piece in bitter disappointment the miscreant has struck the rapid and
had we powder it could hardly send the lead swifter than he now goes

the adventurous huron raised his head above the shelter of the canoe
and while it glided swiftly down the stream he waved his hand and
gave forth the shout which was the known signal of success his cry was
answered by a yell and a laugh from the woods as tauntingly exulting
as if fifty demons were uttering their blasphemies at the fall of some
christian soul

well may you laugh ye children of the devil said the scout seating
himself on a projection of the rock and suffering his gun to fall
neglected at his feet for the three quickest and truest rifles in
these woods are no better than so many stalks of mullein or the last
year's horns of a buck

what is to be done demanded duncan losing the first feeling of
disappointment in a more manly desire for exertion what will become of
us

hawkeye made no other reply than by passing his finger around the crown
of his head in a manner so significant that none who witnessed the
action could mistake its meaning

surely surely our case is not so desperate exclaimed the youth
the hurons are not here we may make good the caverns we may oppose
their landing

with what coolly demanded the scout the arrows of uncas or such
tears as women shed no no you are young and rich and have friends
and at such an age i know it is hard to die but glancing his eyes at
the mohicans let us remember we are men without a cross and let us
teach these natives of the forest that white blood can run as freely as
red when the appointed hour is come

duncan turned quickly in the direction indicated by the other's eyes
and read a confirmation of his worst apprehensions in the conduct of the
indians chingachgook placing himself in a dignified posture on another
fragment of the rock had already laid aside his knife and tomahawk and
was in the act of taking the eagle's plume from his head and smoothing
the solitary tuft of hair in readiness to perform its last and revolting
office his countenance was composed though thoughtful while his dark
gleaming eyes were gradually losing the fierceness of the combat in
an expression better suited to the change he expected momentarily to
undergo

our case is not cannot be so hopeless said duncan even at this
very moment succor may be at hand i see no enemies they have sickened
of a struggle in which they risk so much with so little prospect of
gain

it may be a minute or it may be an hour afore the wily sarpents steal
upon us and it is quite in natur for them to be lying within hearing
at this very moment said hawkeye but come they will and in such
a fashion as will leave us nothing to hope chingachgook he spoke in
delaware my brother we have fought our last battle together and the
maquas will triumph in the death of the sage man of the mohicans and of
the pale face whose eyes can make night as day and level the clouds to
the mists of the springs

let the mingo women go weep over the slain returned the indian
with characteristic pride and unmoved firmness the great snake of the
mohicans has coiled himself in their wigwams and has poisoned their
triumph with the wailings of children whose fathers have not returned
eleven warriors lie hid from the graves of their tribes since the snows
have melted and none will tell where to find them when the tongue of
chingachgook shall be silent let them draw the sharpest knife and
whirl the swiftest tomahawk for their bitterest enemy is in their
hands uncas topmost branch of a noble trunk call on the cowards to
hasten or their hearts will soften and they will change to women

they look among the fishes for their dead returned the low soft
voice of the youthful chieftain the hurons float with the slimy eels
they drop from the oaks like fruit that is ready to be eaten and the
delawares laugh

ay ay muttered the scout who had listened to this peculiar burst
of the natives with deep attention they have warmed their indian
feelings and they'll soon provoke the maquas to give them a speedy end
as for me who am of the whole blood of the whites it is befitting that
i should die as becomes my color with no words of scoffing in my mouth
and without bitterness at the heart

why die at all said cora advancing from the place where natural
horror had until this moment held her riveted to the rock the path
is open on every side fly then to the woods and call on god for
succor go brave men we owe you too much already let us no longer
involve you in our hapless fortunes

you but little know the craft of the iroquois lady if you judge they
have left the path open to the woods returned hawkeye who however
immediately added in his simplicity the down stream current it is
certain might soon sweep us beyond the reach of their rifles or the
sound of their voices

then try the river why linger to add to the number of the victims of
our merciless enemies

why repeated the scout looking about him proudly because it is
better for a man to die at peace with himself than to live haunted by an
evil conscience what answer could we give munro when he asked us where
and how we left his children

go to him and say that you left them with a message to hasten to
their aid returned cora advancing nigher to the scout in her generous
ardor that the hurons bear them into the northern wilds but that
by vigilance and speed they may yet be rescued and if after all it
should please heaven that his assistance come too late bear to him
she continued her voice gradually lowering until it seemed nearly
choked the love the blessings the final prayers of his daughters
and bid him not mourn their early fate but to look forward with humble
confidence to the christian's goal to meet his children the hard
weather-beaten features of the scout began to work and when she had
ended he dropped his chin to his hand like a man musing profoundly on
the nature of the proposal

there is reason in her words at length broke from his compressed
and trembling lips ay and they bear the spirit of christianity what
might be right and proper in a red-skin may be sinful in a man who
has not even a cross in blood to plead for his ignorance chingachgook
uncas hear you the talk of the dark-eyed woman

he now spoke in delaware to his companions and his address though calm
and deliberate seemed very decided the elder mohican heard with deep
gravity and appeared to ponder on his words as though he felt the
importance of their import after a moment of hesitation he waved his
hand in assent and uttered the english word good with the peculiar
emphasis of his people then replacing his knife and tomahawk in his
girdle the warrior moved silently to the edge of the rock which was
most concealed from the banks of the river here he paused a moment
pointed significantly to the woods below and saying a few words in his
own language as if indicating his intended route he dropped into the
water and sank from before the eyes of the witnesses of his movements

the scout delayed his departure to speak to the generous girl whose
breathing became lighter as she saw the success of her remonstrance

wisdom is sometimes given to the young as well as to the old he
said and what you have spoken is wise not to call it by a better
word if you are led into the woods that is such of you as may be
spared for awhile break the twigs on the bushes as you pass and make
the marks of your trail as broad as you can when if mortal eyes can
see them depend on having a friend who will follow to the ends of the
arth afore he desarts you

he gave cora an affectionate shake of the hand lifted his rifle
and after regarding it a moment with melancholy solicitude laid it
carefully aside and descended to the place where chingachgook had just
disappeared for an instant he hung suspended by the rock and looking
about him with a countenance of peculiar care he added bitterly had
the powder held out this disgrace could never have befallen then
loosening his hold the water closed above his head and he also became
lost to view

all eyes now were turned on uncas who stood leaning against the ragged
rock in immovable composure after waiting a short time cora pointed
down the river and said

your friends have not been seen and are now most probably in safety
is it not time for you to follow

uncas will stay the young mohican calmly answered in english

to increase the horror of our capture and to diminish the chances of
our release go generous young man cora continued lowering her
eyes under the gaze of the mohican and perhaps with an intuitive
consciousness of her power go to my father as i have said and be the
most confidential of my messengers tell him to trust you with the means
to buy the freedom of his daughters go tis my wish tis my prayer
that you will go

the settled calm look of the young chief changed to an expression of
gloom but he no longer hesitated with a noiseless step he crossed the
rock and dropped into the troubled stream hardly a breath was drawn by
those he left behind until they caught a glimpse of his head emerging
for air far down the current when he again sank and was seen no more

these sudden and apparently successful experiments had all taken place
in a few minutes of that time which had now become so precious after
a last look at uncas cora turned and with a quivering lip addressed
herself to heyward

i have heard of your boasted skill in the water too duncan she
said follow then the wise example set you by these simple and
faithful beings

is such the faith that cora munro would exact from her protector said
the young man smiling mournfully but with bitterness

this is not a time for idle subtleties and false opinions she
answered but a moment when every duty should be equally considered to
us you can be of no further service here but your precious life may be
saved for other and nearer friends

he made no reply though his eye fell wistfully on the beautiful form of
alice who was clinging to his arm with the dependency of an infant

consider continued cora after a pause during which she seemed
to struggle with a pang even more acute than any that her fears had
excited that the worst to us can be but death a tribute that all must
pay at the good time of god's appointment

there are evils worse than death said duncan speaking hoarsely and
as if fretful at her importunity but which the presence of one who
would die in your behalf may avert

cora ceased her entreaties and veiling her face in her shawl drew the
nearly insensible alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner
cavern




chapter 

 be gay securely
 dispel my fair with smiles the tim'rous clouds
 that hang on thy clear brow death of agrippina

the sudden and almost magical change from the stirring incidents of the
combat to the stillness that now reigned around him acted on the heated
imagination of heyward like some exciting dream while all the images
and events he had witnessed remained deeply impressed on his memory he
felt a difficulty in persuading him of their truth still ignorant of
the fate of those who had trusted to the aid of the swift current he
at first listened intently to any signal or sounds of alarm which might
announce the good or evil fortune of their hazardous undertaking his
attention was however bestowed in vain for with the disappearance of
uncas every sign of the adventurers had been lost leaving him in total
uncertainty of their fate

in a moment of such painful doubt duncan did not hesitate to look
around him without consulting that protection from the rocks which just
before had been so necessary to his safety every effort however to
detect the least evidence of the approach of their hidden enemies was as
fruitless as the inquiry after his late companions the wooded banks of
the river seemed again deserted by everything possessing animal life
the uproar which had so lately echoed through the vaults of the forest
was gone leaving the rush of the waters to swell and sink on the
currents of the air in the unmingled sweetness of nature a fish-hawk
which secure on the topmost branches of a dead pine had been a distant
spectator of the fray now swooped from his high and ragged perch and
soared in wide sweeps above his prey while a jay whose noisy voice
had been stilled by the hoarser cries of the savages ventured again
to open his discordant throat as though once more in undisturbed
possession of his wild domains duncan caught from these natural
accompaniments of the solitary scene a glimmering of hope and he began
to rally his faculties to renewed exertions with something like a
reviving confidence of success

the hurons are not to be seen he said addressing david who had
by no means recovered from the effects of the stunning blow he had
received let us conceal ourselves in the cavern and trust the rest to
providence

i remember to have united with two comely maidens in lifting up
our voices in praise and thanksgiving returned the bewildered
singing-master since which time i have been visited by a heavy
judgment for my sins i have been mocked with the likeness of sleep
while sounds of discord have rent my ears such as might manifest the
fullness of time and that nature had forgotten her harmony

poor fellow thine own period was in truth near its accomplishment
but arouse and come with me i will lead you where all other sounds but
those of your own psalmody shall be excluded

there is melody in the fall of the cataract and the rushing of many
waters is sweet to the senses said david pressing his hand confusedly
on his brow is not the air yet filled with shrieks and cries as
though the departed spirits of the damned 

not now not now interrupted the impatient heyward they have
ceased and they who raised them i trust in god they are gone too
everything but the water is still and at peace in then where you may
create those sounds you love so well to hear

david smiled sadly though not without a momentary gleam of pleasure at
this allusion to his beloved vocation he no longer hesitated to be led
to a spot which promised such unalloyed gratification to his wearied
senses and leaning on the arm of his companion he entered the narrow
mouth of the cave duncan seized a pile of the sassafras which he
drew before the passage studiously concealing every appearance of an
aperture within this fragile barrier he arranged the blankets abandoned
by the foresters darkening the inner extremity of the cavern while its
outer received a chastened light from the narrow ravine through which
one arm of the river rushed to form the junction with its sister branch
a few rods below

i like not the principle of the natives which teaches them to submit
without a struggle in emergencies that appear desperate he said
while busied in this employment our own maxim which says while
life remains there is hope is more consoling and better suited to
a soldier's temperament to you cora i will urge no words of idle
encouragement your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach
you all that may become your sex but cannot we dry the tears of that
trembling weeper on your bosom

i am calmer duncan said alice raising herself from the arms of her
sister and forcing an appearance of composure through her tears much
calmer now surely in this hidden spot we are safe we are secret
free from injury we will hope everything from those generous men who
have risked so much already in our behalf

now does our gentle alice speak like a daughter of munro said
heyward pausing to press her hand as he passed toward the outer
entrance of the cavern with two such examples of courage before him a
man would be ashamed to prove other than a hero he then seated himself
in the center of the cavern grasping his remaining pistol with a hand
convulsively clenched while his contracted and frowning eye announced
the sullen desperation of his purpose the hurons if they come may
not gain our position so easily as they think he slowly muttered and
propping his head back against the rock he seemed to await the result
in patience though his gaze was unceasingly bent on the open avenue to
their place of retreat

with the last sound of his voice a deep a long and almost breathless
silence succeeded the fresh air of the morning had penetrated the
recess and its influence was gradually felt on the spirits of its
inmates as minute after minute passed by leaving them in undisturbed
security the insinuating feeling of hope was gradually gaining
possession of every bosom though each one felt reluctant to give
utterance to expectations that the next moment might so fearfully
destroy

david alone formed an exception to these varying emotions a gleam of
light from the opening crossed his wan countenance and fell upon
the pages of the little volume whose leaves he was again occupied in
turning as if searching for some song more fitted to their condition
than any that had yet met their eye he was most probably acting all
this time under a confused recollection of the promised consolation of
duncan at length it would seem his patient industry found its reward
for without explanation or apology he pronounced aloud the words isle
of wight drew a long sweet sound from his pitch-pipe and then ran
through the preliminary modulations of the air whose name he had just
mentioned with the sweeter tones of his own musical voice

may not this prove dangerous asked cora glancing her dark eye at
major heyward

poor fellow his voice is too feeble to be heard above the din of the
falls was the answer beside the cavern will prove his friend let
him indulge his passions since it may be done without hazard

isle of wight repeated david looking about him with that dignity
with which he had long been wont to silence the whispering echoes of his
school tis a brave tune and set to solemn words let it be sung with
meet respect

after allowing a moment of stillness to enforce his discipline the
voice of the singer was heard in low murmuring syllables gradually
stealing on the ear until it filled the narrow vault with sounds
rendered trebly thrilling by the feeble and tremulous utterance produced
by his debility the melody which no weakness could destroy gradually
wrought its sweet influence on the senses of those who heard it it even
prevailed over the miserable travesty of the song of david which the
singer had selected from a volume of similar effusions and caused the
sense to be forgotten in the insinuating harmony of the sounds alice
unconsciously dried her tears and bent her melting eyes on the pallid
features of gamut with an expression of chastened delight that she
neither affected or wished to conceal cora bestowed an approving smile
on the pious efforts of the namesake of the jewish prince and heyward
soon turned his steady stern look from the outlet of the cavern to
fasten it with a milder character on the face of david or to meet the
wandering beams which at moments strayed from the humid eyes of alice
the open sympathy of the listeners stirred the spirit of the votary of
music whose voice regained its richness and volume without losing that
touching softness which proved its secret charm exerting his renovated
powers to their utmost he was yet filling the arches of the cave
with long and full tones when a yell burst into the air without that
instantly stilled his pious strains choking his voice suddenly as
though his heart had literally bounded into the passage of his throat

we are lost exclaimed alice throwing herself into the arms of cora

not yet not yet returned the agitated but undaunted heyward the
sound came from the center of the island and it has been produced by
the sight of their dead companions we are not yet discovered and there
is still hope

faint and almost despairing as was the prospect of escape the words of
duncan were not thrown away for it awakened the powers of the sisters
in such a manner that they awaited the results in silence a second yell
soon followed the first when a rush of voices was heard pouring down
the island from its upper to its lower extremity until they reached
the naked rock above the caverns where after a shout of savage
triumph the air continued full of horrible cries and screams such
as man alone can utter and he only when in a state of the fiercest
barbarity

the sounds quickly spread around them in every direction some called to
their fellows from the water's edge and were answered from the heights
above cries were heard in the startling vicinity of the chasm between
the two caves which mingled with hoarser yells that arose out of the
abyss of the deep ravine in short so rapidly had the savage sounds
diffused themselves over the barren rock that it was not difficult
for the anxious listeners to imagine they could be heard beneath as in
truth they were above on every side of them

in the midst of this tumult a triumphant yell was raised within a few
yards of the hidden entrance to the cave heyward abandoned every hope
with the belief it was the signal that they were discovered again the
impression passed away as he heard the voices collect near the spot
where the white man had so reluctantly abandoned his rifle amid the
jargon of indian dialects that he now plainly heard it was easy to
distinguish not only words but sentences in the patois of the canadas
a burst of voices had shouted simultaneously la longue carabine
causing the opposite woods to re-echo with a name which heyward well
remembered had been given by his enemies to a celebrated hunter and
scout of the english camp and who he now learned for the first time
had been his late companion

la longue carabine la longue carabine passed from mouth to mouth
until the whole band appeared to be collected around a trophy which
would seem to announce the death of its formidable owner after a
vociferous consultation which was at times deafened by bursts of
savage joy they again separated filling the air with the name of a
foe whose body heywood could collect from their expressions they
hoped to find concealed in some crevice of the island

now he whispered to the trembling sisters now is the moment of
uncertainty if our place of retreat escape this scrutiny we are
still safe in every event we are assured by what has fallen from our
enemies that our friends have escaped and in two short hours we may
look for succor from webb

there were now a few minutes of fearful stillness during which heyward
well knew that the savages conducted their search with greater vigilance
and method more than once he could distinguish their footsteps as
they brushed the sassafras causing the faded leaves to rustle and the
branches to snap at length the pile yielded a little a corner of a
blanket fell and a faint ray of light gleamed into the inner part of
the cave cora folded alice to her bosom in agony and duncan sprang
to his feet a shout was at that moment heard as if issuing from the
center of the rock announcing that the neighboring cavern had at
length been entered in a minute the number and loudness of the voices
indicated that the whole party was collected in and around that secret
place

as the inner passages to the two caves were so close to each other
duncan believing that escape was no longer possible passed david and
the sisters to place himself between the latter and the first onset of
the terrible meeting grown desperate by his situation he drew nigh
the slight barrier which separated him only by a few feet from his
relentless pursuers and placing his face to the casual opening he even
looked out with a sort of desperate indifference on their movements

within reach of his arm was the brawny shoulder of a gigantic indian
whose deep and authoritative voice appeared to give directions to the
proceedings of his fellows beyond him again duncan could look into the
vault opposite which was filled with savages upturning and rifling the
humble furniture of the scout the wound of david had dyed the leaves
of sassafras with a color that the native well knew as anticipating the
season over this sign of their success they sent up a howl like an
opening from so many hounds who had recovered a lost trail after this
yell of victory they tore up the fragrant bed of the cavern and bore
the branches into the chasm scattering the boughs as if they suspected
them of concealing the person of the man they had so long hated and
feared one fierce and wild-looking warrior approached the chief
bearing a load of the brush and pointing exultingly to the deep red
stains with which it was sprinkled uttered his joy in indian yells
whose meaning heyward was only enabled to comprehend by the frequent
repetition of the name la longue carabine when his triumph had
ceased he cast the brush on the slight heap duncan had made before
the entrance of the second cavern and closed the view his example was
followed by others who as they drew the branches from the cave of the
scout threw them into one pile adding unconsciously to the security
of those they sought the very slightness of the defense was its chief
merit for no one thought of disturbing a mass of brush which all
of them believed in that moment of hurry and confusion had been
accidentally raised by the hands of their own party

as the blankets yielded before the outward pressure and the branches
settled in the fissure of the rock by their own weight forming a
compact body duncan once more breathed freely with a light step and
lighter heart he returned to the center of the cave and took the
place he had left where he could command a view of the opening next the
river while he was in the act of making this movement the indians as
if changing their purpose by a common impulse broke away from the chasm
in a body and were heard rushing up the island again toward the point
whence they had originally descended here another wailing cry betrayed
that they were again collected around the bodies of their dead comrades

duncan now ventured to look at his companions for during the most
critical moments of their danger he had been apprehensive that the
anxiety of his countenance might communicate some additional alarm to
those who were so little able to sustain it

they are gone cora he whispered alice they are returned whence
they came and we are saved to heaven that has alone delivered us from
the grasp of so merciless an enemy be all the praise

then to heaven will i return my thanks exclaimed the younger sister
rising from the encircling arm of cora and casting herself with
enthusiastic gratitude on the naked rock to that heaven who has spared
the tears of a gray-headed father has saved the lives of those i so
much love

both heyward and the more temperate cora witnessed the act of
involuntary emotion with powerful sympathy the former secretly
believing that piety had never worn a form so lovely as it had now
assumed in the youthful person of alice her eyes were radiant with the
glow of grateful feelings the flush of her beauty was again seated on
her cheeks and her whole soul seemed ready and anxious to pour out its
thanksgivings through the medium of her eloquent features but when her
lips moved the words they should have uttered appeared frozen by some
new and sudden chill her bloom gave place to the paleness of death
her soft and melting eyes grew hard and seemed contracting with horror
while those hands which she had raised clasped in each other toward
heaven dropped in horizontal lines before her the fingers pointed
forward in convulsed motion heyward turned the instant she gave a
direction to his suspicions and peering just above the ledge which
formed the threshold of the open outlet of the cavern he beheld the
malignant fierce and savage features of le renard subtil

in that moment of surprise the self-possession of heyward did not
desert him he observed by the vacant expression of the indian's
countenance that his eye accustomed to the open air had not yet
been able to penetrate the dusky light which pervaded the depth of the
cavern he had even thought of retreating beyond a curvature in the
natural wall which might still conceal him and his companions when by
the sudden gleam of intelligence that shot across the features of the
savage he saw it was too late and that they were betrayed

the look of exultation and brutal triumph which announced this terrible
truth was irresistibly irritating forgetful of everything but the
impulses of his hot blood duncan leveled his pistol and fired the
report of the weapon made the cavern bellow like an eruption from a
volcano and when the smoke it vomited had been driven away before the
current of air which issued from the ravine the place so lately occupied
by the features of his treacherous guide was vacant rushing to the
outlet heyward caught a glimpse of his dark figure stealing around a
low and narrow ledge which soon hid him entirely from sight

among the savages a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion which
had just been heard bursting from the bowels of the rock but when
le renard raised his voice in a long and intelligible whoop it was
answered by a spontaneous yell from the mouth of every indian within
hearing of the sound

the clamorous noises again rushed down the island and before duncan
had time to recover from the shock his feeble barrier of brush was
scattered to the winds the cavern was entered at both its extremities
and he and his companions were dragged from their shelter and borne into
the day where they stood surrounded by the whole band of the triumphant
hurons




chapter 

 i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
 as much as we this night have overwatched
 midsummer night's dream

the instant the shock of this sudden misfortune had abated duncan began
to make his observations on the appearance and proceedings of their
captors contrary to the usages of the natives in the wantonness of
their success they had respected not only the persons of the trembling
sisters but his own the rich ornaments of his military attire had
indeed been repeatedly handled by different individuals of the tribes
with eyes expressing a savage longing to possess the baubles but
before the customary violence could be resorted to a mandate in the
authoritative voice of the large warrior already mentioned stayed the
uplifted hand and convinced heyward that they were to be reserved for
some object of particular moment

while however these manifestations of weakness were exhibited by the
young and vain of the party the more experienced warriors continued
their search throughout both caverns with an activity that denoted they
were far from being satisfied with those fruits of their conquest which
had already been brought to light unable to discover any new victim
these diligent workers of vengeance soon approached their male
prisoners pronouncing the name la longue carabine with a fierceness
that could not be easily mistaken duncan affected not to comprehend
the meaning of their repeated and violent interrogatories while his
companion was spared the effort of a similar deception by his ignorance
of french wearied at length by their importunities and apprehensive
of irritating his captors by too stubborn a silence the former
looked about him in quest of magua who might interpret his answers
to questions which were at each moment becoming more earnest and
threatening

the conduct of this savage had formed a solitary exception to that of
all his fellows while the others were busily occupied in seeking
to gratify their childish passion for finery by plundering even
the miserable effects of the scout or had been searching with such
bloodthirsty vengeance in their looks for their absent owner le renard
had stood at a little distance from the prisoners with a demeanor so
quiet and satisfied as to betray that he had already effected the grand
purpose of his treachery when the eyes of heyward first met those of
his recent guide he turned them away in horror at the sinister though
calm look he encountered conquering his disgust however he was able
with an averted face to address his successful enemy

le renard subtil is too much of a warrior said the reluctant heyward
to refuse telling an unarmed man what his conquerors say

they ask for the hunter who knows the paths through the woods
returned magua in his broken english laying his hand at the same
time with a ferocious smile on the bundle of leaves with which a wound
on his own shoulder was bandaged la longue carabine his rifle
is good and his eye never shut but like the short gun of the white
chief it is nothing against the life of le subtil

le renard is too brave to remember the hurts received in war or the
hands that gave them

was it war when the tired indian rested at the sugartree to taste his
corn who filled the bushes with creeping enemies who drew the knife
whose tongue was peace while his heart was colored with blood did
magua say that the hatchet was out of the ground and that his hand had
dug it up

as duncan dared not retort upon his accuser by reminding him of his own
premeditated treachery and disdained to deprecate his resentment by any
words of apology he remained silent magua seemed also content to
rest the controversy as well as all further communication there for he
resumed the leaning attitude against the rock from which in momentary
energy he had arisen but the cry of la longue carabine was renewed
the instant the impatient savages perceived that the short dialogue was
ended

you hear said magua with stubborn indifference the red hurons call
for the life of the long rifle or they will have the blood of him
that keep him hid

he is gone escaped he is far beyond their reach

renard smiled with cold contempt as he answered

when the white man dies he thinks he is at peace but the red men know
how to torture even the ghosts of their enemies where is his body let
the hurons see his scalp

he is not dead but escaped

magua shook his head incredulously

is he a bird to spread his wings or is he a fish to swim without
air the white chief read in his books and he believes the hurons are
fools

though no fish the long rifle can swim he floated down the stream
when the powder was all burned and when the eyes of the hurons were
behind a cloud

and why did the white chief stay demanded the still incredulous
indian is he a stone that goes to the bottom or does the scalp burn
his head

that i am not stone your dead comrade who fell into the falls might
answer were the life still in him said the provoked young man using
in his anger that boastful language which was most likely to excite the
admiration of an indian the white man thinks none but cowards desert
their women

magua muttered a few words inaudibly between his teeth before he
continued aloud

can the delawares swim too as well as crawl in the bushes where is
le gros serpent

duncan who perceived by the use of these canadian appellations that
his late companions were much better known to his enemies than to
himself answered reluctantly he also is gone down with the water

le cerf agile is not here

i know not whom you call the nimble deer said duncan gladly
profiting by any excuse to create delay

uncas returned magua pronouncing the delaware name with even greater
difficulty than he spoke his english words bounding elk is what the
white man says when he calls to the young mohican

here is some confusion in names between us le renard said duncan
hoping to provoke a discussion daim is the french for deer and cerf
for stag elan is the true term when one would speak of an elk

yes muttered the indian in his native tongue the pale faces are
prattling women they have two words for each thing while a red-skin
will make the sound of his voice speak to him then changing his
language he continued adhering to the imperfect nomenclature of his
provincial instructors the deer is swift but weak the elk is swift
but strong and the son of le serpent is le cerf agile has he
leaped the river to the woods

if you mean the younger delaware he too has gone down with the
water

as there was nothing improbable to an indian in the manner of the
escape magua admitted the truth of what he had heard with a readiness
that afforded additional evidence how little he would prize such
worthless captives with his companions however the feeling was
manifestly different

the hurons had awaited the result of this short dialogue with
characteristic patience and with a silence that increased until there
was a general stillness in the band when heyward ceased to speak they
turned their eyes as one man on magua demanding in this expressive
manner an explanation of what had been said their interpreter pointed
to the river and made them acquainted with the result as much by
the action as by the few words he uttered when the fact was generally
understood the savages raised a frightful yell which declared the
extent of their disappointment some ran furiously to the water's
edge beating the air with frantic gestures while others spat upon the
element to resent the supposed treason it had committed against
their acknowledged rights as conquerors a few and they not the least
powerful and terrific of the band threw lowering looks in which the
fiercest passion was only tempered by habitual self-command at those
captives who still remained in their power while one or two even gave
vent to their malignant feelings by the most menacing gestures against
which neither the sex nor the beauty of the sisters was any protection
the young soldier made a desperate but fruitless effort to spring to the
side of alice when he saw the dark hand of a savage twisted in the rich
tresses which were flowing in volumes over her shoulders while a knife
was passed around the head from which they fell as if to denote the
horrid manner in which it was about to be robbed of its beautiful
ornament but his hands were bound and at the first movement he made
he felt the grasp of the powerful indian who directed the band pressing
his shoulder like a vise immediately conscious how unavailing any
struggle against such an overwhelming force must prove he submitted
to his fate encouraging his gentle companions by a few low and tender
assurances that the natives seldom failed to threaten more than they
performed

but while duncan resorted to these words of consolation to quiet the
apprehensions of the sisters he was not so weak as to deceive himself
he well knew that the authority of an indian chief was so little
conventional that it was oftener maintained by physical superiority
than by any moral supremacy he might possess the danger was therefore
magnified exactly in proportion to the number of the savage spirits
by which they were surrounded the most positive mandate from him who
seemed the acknowledged leader was liable to be violated at each moment
by any rash hand that might choose to sacrifice a victim to the manes of
some dead friend or relative while therefore he sustained an outward
appearance of calmness and fortitude his heart leaped into his throat
whenever any of their fierce captors drew nearer than common to the
helpless sisters or fastened one of their sullen wandering looks on
those fragile forms which were so little able to resist the slightest
assault

his apprehensions were however greatly relieved when he saw that
the leader had summoned his warriors to himself in counsel their
deliberations were short and it would seem by the silence of most of
the party the decision unanimous by the frequency with which the few
speakers pointed in the direction of the encampment of webb it was
apparent they dreaded the approach of danger from that quarter this
consideration probably hastened their determination and quickened the
subsequent movements

during his short conference heyward finding a respite from his gravest
fears had leisure to admire the cautious manner in which the hurons had
made their approaches even after hostilities had ceased

it has already been stated that the upper half of the island was a naked
rock and destitute of any other defenses than a few scattered logs of
driftwood they had selected this point to make their descent having
borne the canoe through the wood around the cataract for that purpose
placing their arms in the little vessel a dozen men clinging to its
sides had trusted themselves to the direction of the canoe which was
controlled by two of the most skillful warriors in attitudes that
enabled them to command a view of the dangerous passage favored by this
arrangement they touched the head of the island at that point which had
proved so fatal to their first adventurers but with the advantages of
superior numbers and the possession of firearms that such had been the
manner of their descent was rendered quite apparent to duncan for they
now bore the light bark from the upper end of the rock and placed it
in the water near the mouth of the outer cavern as soon as this change
was made the leader made signs to the prisoners to descend and enter

as resistance was impossible and remonstrance useless heyward set the
example of submission by leading the way into the canoe where he
was soon seated with the sisters and the still wondering david
notwithstanding the hurons were necessarily ignorant of the little
channels among the eddies and rapids of the stream they knew the common
signs of such a navigation too well to commit any material blunder
when the pilot chosen for the task of guiding the canoe had taken his
station the whole band plunged again into the river the vessel glided
down the current and in a few moments the captives found themselves on
the south bank of the stream nearly opposite to the point where they
had struck it the preceding evening

here was held another short but earnest consultation during which the
horses to whose panic their owners ascribed their heaviest misfortune
were led from the cover of the woods and brought to the sheltered spot
the band now divided the great chief so often mentioned mounting the
charger of heyward led the way directly across the river followed by
most of his people and disappeared in the woods leaving the prisoners
in charge of six savages at whose head was le renard subtil duncan
witnessed all their movements with renewed uneasiness

he had been fond of believing from the uncommon forbearance of the
savages that he was reserved as a prisoner to be delivered to montcalm
as the thoughts of those who are in misery seldom slumber and the
invention is never more lively than when it is stimulated by hope
however feeble and remote he had even imagined that the parental
feelings of munro were to be made instrumental in seducing him from his
duty to the king for though the french commander bore a high character
for courage and enterprise he was also thought to be expert in those
political practises which do not always respect the nicer obligations
of morality and which so generally disgraced the european diplomacy of
that period

all those busy and ingenious speculations were now annihilated by the
conduct of his captors that portion of the band who had followed the
huge warrior took the route toward the foot of the horican and no other
expectation was left for himself and companions than that they were to
be retained as hopeless captives by their savage conquerors anxious to
know the worst and willing in such an emergency to try the potency of
gold he overcame his reluctance to speak to magua addressing himself
to his former guide who had now assumed the authority and manner of one
who was to direct the future movements of the party he said in tones
as friendly and confiding as he could assume

i would speak to magua what is fit only for so great a chief to hear

the indian turned his eyes on the young soldier scornfully as he
answered

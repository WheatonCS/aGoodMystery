were sorry
his violent act has een drawn blood honour
and stained our honours 
thrown ink upon the forehead our fame
which envious spirits will dip their pens into
after our death and blot us in our tombs 
for that which would seem treason in our lives
is laughter when were dead who dares now whisper
that dares not then speak out and even proclaim
with loud words and broad pens our closest shame 
the revengers tragedy
stern indeed must that bosom be insensible
beyond even callous humanity that would
not thrill with gladness at the sight a long
absent child as tenderly as it was in her iron
nature to do did lady rosewood love her son
her love was the stronger perchance in that
if aught she loved was him and him alone 
 rosewood
all else she hated in him all her affection
was concentred for him no sacrifice was too
great for his worldly weal she would have
braved eternal perdition and now at an
unlookedfor moment when she deemed him
absent in a foreign land when his return was
what she wished for most what she would
have prayed for had she prayed for aught he
stood before her in her hour peril and
distress his succouring arm was upraised to
defend her her son was with her her
enemy his enemy within her grasp triumph
flashed within her eye and her heart exulted
for one instant she had gazed doubtfully upon
his face her frame shaking with emotion
spirits she had heard have wandered near
their fleshly tabernacles at such hours as these
and the features seemed so like his fathers that
she scarce knew what construction to put upon
the apparition she beheld the doubt was 
momentary duration the next instant saw her
in the attitude we have attempted to describe

with that quickness perception which at
once supplies information on such an emergency
luke instantly conjectured who was before him
startled as he was he yet retained his composure
abiding the result with his arms folded
upon his breast
seize him cried lady rosewood so soon
as she could command her speech
he rushes on his death if he but stirs
exclaimed luke pointing his pistol and you
his mother shall answer for his life he is
unarmed he cannot cope with me
bethink you where you are villain cried
ranulph you are entrapped in your own
toils submit yourself to our mercy resistance
is vain and will not secure your safety
while it will aggravate your offence surrender
yourself 
never answered luke know you whom
you ask to yield 
how should i answered ranulph

by that instinct which tells me who you
are ask her she can inform you if she
will
a villain an impostor returned lady
rosewood parley not with him seize him
at all hazards his life is our life he is a
robber a murderer who has assailed my life
beware cried luke to ranulph who
was preparing to obey his mothers commands 
i am no impostor no robber no murderer 
my soul is free from stain guilt like that
though i have many offences to answer for
do not thou make me a fratricide
fratricide echoed ranulph recoiling
ay fratricide in our dead fathers presence

heed him not ejaculated lady rook wood
it is false lie dares not harm thee for his
soul i will call assistance
hold mother exclaimed ranulph detaining
lady rosewood this man may be
what he represents himself before we proceed
to extremities i would question him i would
not have mentioned it in your hearing could it
have been avoided but my father had a son
lady rosewood frowned she would have
checked him but luke rejoined 
you have spoken the truth he had a son
be silent i command you vociferated
silent cried luke in a loud voice why
should i be silent at your bidding at yours 
who regard no laws human or divine who
pursue your own fell purposes without fear 
god or man waste not your frowns on me i
heed them not death do you think i am like a
tame hound to be cowed to silence i ivill speak
ranulph rosewood the name you bear is mine
and by a right as good as is your own from his
loins who lies a corpse before us i sprang no
brand shame is on my birth i am his son
his lawfully begotten his firstbon your

brother your elder brother to me pertains
all you now call your own nay glance not at
me so threaten me not hear me i say not
this to taunt you i assert no falsehood i avouch
the truth you bade me think within whose
presence i stood bring that thought home to
yourself for by that awful form i swear i
would call the dead to witness the oath ha 
do you heed me now continued luke observing
the shuddering effect which this last appeal
produced on ranulph yes cried he rushing
towards the bier here lies he within his
coffin cold and dead who through life deserted
me what if he could arise and speak forme
 what if the light life could animate
those senseless orbs i cannot look upon those
features still and stern without fear and trembling
what if even as they are the spirit
 existence should return and he could speak
for me then might the living tremble at the
tale he could tell hear me by this body my
fathers body i swear that i am his son his

legitimate his firstborn and though to me he
hath never been what to a son a father should
be though i have never known his smile never
felt his caresses never received his blessing yet
now be all forgiven all forgotten and he cast
himself with frantic violence upon the coffin 
it is difficult to describe the feelings with
which ranulph heard the avowal conveyed by
lukes passionate words amazement and dread
predominated coupling the fearful scene now
before his eyes with the remembrance the
phantasm he imagined he had beheld he
listened to lukes adjuration with a sensation
that made his flesh creep upon his bones his
worst fears seemed to be realized and in a
manner as appalling and almost as preternatural
as the vision itself unable to move
he stood gazing on in silence not so lady
rosewood the moment for action was arrived
yet even she had some doubts about
the line conduct most prudent to be pursued
luke was in her power should she summon the

household proclaim him a lunatic a robber 
an assailant imprison him or drive him from
the house all or any these expedients she
might have recourse to but none were unattended
by danger or difficulty she must do
this to secure him her retainers were still
faithful to her that ranulplfs presence
assured her as she at once saw her mistake in
attributing to lukes situation the chance expressions
she had overheard and which had alarmed
her so much at the moment when they so evidently
applied to her sons unexpected return
on their fidelity she could therefore depend
with all these aids with a certainty securing
him the task was nevertheless not without
hazard and might endanger all nay advance
the cause she would fain defeat this lady
rosewood felt luke was fearless eloquent 
desperate he might sell his life dearly but that
weighed little with her if he were slain on the
other hand he might escape he might be taken
with life this defence might be so gallant as to

produce a strong impression in his favour he
might she was sure he would blazon forth his
story and that at this season when all the neighbourhood
and perchance his friends amongst
the number were assembled was a scandal she
could not brook her eye rolled inwardly as
these thoughts swept darkly across her brain
suddenly she became tranquil there is a calm
within the storm more to be dreaded than the
whirl wilds self addressing her son she said
in a hollow voice
you have heard what he says 
i have answered he mournfully
and you believe him 
i can scarce do otherwise compare his
assertions with what my father himself declared
to me before my departure from england
you may remember it you spoke the enailment
 the lands rosewood averring
to be mine unalienably have you forgotten
his reply 
no answered lady rosewood i have

not forgotten it but i will baulk his designs
and now added she in a whisper thy prey is
within thy power attack him 
wherefore answered ranulph if hebe
my brother shall i raise my hand against him
wherefore not returned lady rook wood
twere an accursed deed replied ranulph
the mystery is solved twas for this that
i was summoned home
ha what sayest thou summoned 
who summoned thee 
my father 
thy father echoed lady rosewood in
great surprise
ay my dead father he hath appeared tome
since his decease nay on the moment when
his spirit departed to bid me return why i
knew not the doubt is now made clear
ranulph you rave you are distracted
with grief with astonishment
no mother he was in the right the dead
 
will witness for him i will not struggle against
my destiny
destiny ha craven dastard thou art
not my son not the child maude rook wood
no offspring hers would utter such a word
destiny ha ha thy destiny is rosewood
its manors its land its rentroll and its title 
nor shalt thou yield it to a baseborn churl like
this let him prove his rights let him obtain
them let the law adjudge them to him
and we will yield will cease to struggle but
not till then but i tell thee he has not the
right nor can he maintain it he is a deluded
dreamer who having heard some idle tale his
birth believes because it chimes with his wishes
and now asserts it he told it me i treated it
with the scorn it deserved i would have driven
him from my presence but he was armed as
thou seest and forced me hither perhaps to
murder me a deed he might have accomplished
had it not been for thy intervention his life
is already forfeit for an attempt the same sort
last night why else came he hither for what

else did he drag me to this spot let him
answer that 
i will answer it replied luke raising
himself from the bier his face was an ashy
paleness and ghastly as the corpse over which
he leaned i had a deed to do which i wished
you to witness it was a wild conception but
the means whereby i have acquired the information
 my rights was wild we are both
the slaves inevitable necessity thou hast
received thy summons hither i have had mine
thy fathers ghost called thee my mothers
spectral hand beckoned me both are arrived
one thing more remains and my mission is
completed saying which he drew forth the
skeleton hand and having first taken the
wedding ring from the finger and secured it
he placed the withered limb upon the left breast
 his fathers body rest there he cried
for ever
 will you suffer that said lady 
tauntingly to her son
no replied ranulph such profanarosewood

tion the dead shall not be endured were
he ten times my brother stand aside added
he advancing towards the bier and motioning
luke away withdraw your hand from my
fathers body and remove what you have placed
upon it
i will neither remove it nor suffer it to be
removed returned luke twas for that
purpose i came hither twas to that hand in
life he was united in death shall he not be
divided from it r
hear him cried lady rosewood
such irreverence shall not be exclaimed
ranulph seizing luke with one hand and
snatching at the sereclothes with the other
remove it or by heaven 
leave go your hold said luke in a voice
 thunder you strive in vain ranulph
ineffectually attempted to push him backwards 
and shaking away the grasp that was fixed upon
his collar seized his brothers wrist so as to
prevent the accomplishment his purpose in
 
this unnatural and indecorous strife the corpse
 their father was reft its covering and the
hand discovered lying upon the pallid breast
and as if the wanton impiety their conduct
called forth an immediate rebuke even
from the dead a frown seemed to pass over their
fathers features as their angry glances fell in
that direction this appalling effect was solely
occasioned by lady rosewoods approach her
shadow falling over the brow and visage 
the deceased produced the appearance we have
noticed simultaneously quitting each other
with a deep sense shame mingled with remorse
both remained with eyes fixed upon the dead
whose repose they had violated
folding the graveclothes decently over the
body luke prepared to depart
hold cried lady rosewood you go
not hence
indeed replied luke my brother
ranulph will not oppose my departure who
else shall prevent it 

that will i cried a voice behind him and
ere he could turn to ascertain from whom the
exclamation proceeded luke felt himself grappled
by two nervous assailants who snatching
the pistol from his hold fast pinioned his arms
this was scarce the work a moment and he
was a prisoner before he could offer any resistance
a strong smile exultation evinced lady
rosewoods satisfaction
bravo my lads bravo cried coates stepping
forward for he it was under whose skilful
superintendence the seizure had been effected 
famously managed the best bowstreet runners
could t have done it better capital hand
me that pistol loaded i see slugs no doubt 
oh hes a precious rascal search him thats
right turn his pockets inside out while i
speak to her ladyship saying which the
little attorney enchanted with the feat he had
performed approached lady rosewood with a
profound bow and an amazing smirk selfsatisfaction
 just in time to prevent mischief

said he hope your ladyship does not suffer
any inconvenience from the alarm beg pardon
annoyance i meant to say which this daring
outrage must have occasioned excessively disagreeable
this sort thing to a lady at anytime
but at a period like this more than usually
provoking however we have him safe enough
now at your ladyships disposal very lucky i
happened to be in the way smelt a rat in the
hall perhaps your ladyship would like to
know how i discovered 
not now replied lady rosewood checking
the volubility the man law i thank
you most heartily mr coates for the service
you have rendered me you will now add materially
to the obligation already conferred upon
me by removing the prisoner with all convenient
dispatched
certainly if your ladyship wishes it shall
i detain him a close prisoner in the hall for
tonight or remove him at once to the roundhouse

 
where you please so you do it quickly
replied lady rosewood noticing with great
uneasiness the agitated manner her son and
apprehensive lest in the presence so many
witnesses he might say or do something prejudicial
to their cause nor were her fears groundless
as coates was about to return to the
prisoner he was arrested by the voice 
ranulph commanding him to stay
mr coates said he however appearances
may be against this man he is no robber you
must therefore release him
release him sir ranulph 
yes sir i tell you he came here neither
to rob nor to offer violence
that is false ranulph replied lady 
 i was dragged hither by him at the
peril my life he is mr coatess prisoner
on another charge
unquestionably your ladyship is perfectly
right i have a warrant against him for assaults

ing hugh badger the keeper and for other misdemeanors

i will myself be responsible for his appearance
to that charge replied ranulph now
sir at once release him
at your peril exclaimed lady rosewood
well really muttered the perplexed attorney
 this is the most unaccountable proceeding
i ever witnessed
ranulph said lady rosewood sternly to
her son beware how you thwart me
yes sir ranulph let me venture to advise
you as a friend not to thwart her ladyship
interposed the attorney indeed she is in the
right but seeing his advice unheeded he withdrew
to a little distance
i will not see injustice done to my fathers
son replied ranulph in a low tone why
would you detain him 
why returned she our safety demands
it our honour
 
our honour demands his instant liberation 
each moment that he remains in those bonds
tends to our dishonour i will free him myself
from his fetters
and brave my curse foolish boy you
incurred your miserable fathers anathema fora
lighter cause than this our honour thy
honour my honour cries aloud for his destruction
have i not been injured in the nicest
point that a woman can be injured thickest
thou i could have wedded sir piers rosewood
had i known aught this marriage still more
had i dreamed there had been offspring born 
it have i not been duped hast thou not
been duped shall i lend my name to mockery
and scorn by base acknowledgment such
deceit or wilt thou where would be my
honour then stripped my fair estates my
son myself beggars dependent on the bounty
 him does honour ask thee to bear this 
it is a phantom sense honour unsubstantial
 
as thy fathers shade thou speaks that
would prompt thee otherwise
do not evoke his awful spirit mother
cried ranulph with a shudder do not arouse
his wrath
do not arouse my wrath returned lady
rosewood i am the more to be feared
think eleanor mowbray the bar between
your nuptials is removed would you raise up
a greater impediment 
mother mother
would you tamely suffer this newsprung
claimant whom you know not nor have ever
seen to wrest from you your inheritance without
a struggle without rosewood i tell you
eleanor never will be your s thus much i know
 mrs mowbray even there he may supplant
you nay i speak not at random let him be
in possession and abide the consequences he is
now in our power he will rot in gaol or be
driven from this country speak the word will
 
you raise up this giant in your path or crush
him yet unknown elect choose between him
and me
 mother
nay hear me yet further our cause is a
righteous one i have been deceived thou art
deceived great wrong hath been done to both
we are warranted by holy writ in such a
cause to have recourse to stratagem like
esau he hath lost his birthright and even as
rachel did unto jacob so will i do to thee i
will make thee the elder the ruler thy
brother and his house
but if he be my brother and if this house
lee his house i should sin before heaven to withhold
it from him i will not do it your own
words betray your conviction his rights
my conviction ranulph thou purest my
head to hear thee talk thus what to me is
conviction or doubt the line action is
plain let him prove his right it will then be
time enough to succumb meanwhile be hee

j 
what he may give him not this advantage she
is now in our power he hath committed an
offence against the laws his country which
will place his liberty if not his life in jeopardy 
let him first disprove that once for all i tell
thee were he thrice thy fathers son he cannot
prove the fact his mothers marriage and
well he cannot were it fitting that the son
 a lowborn village wench should usurp
the titles the offspring her who hath
borne the name daubeney a name which
was methinks degraded in merging itself in
thine own do as thou wilt act as thou
deepest best again a brother if thou seest fitting
and lose thine all and with thine all thy
mother decide quickly all eyes are directed
upon us the room is now filled with the
household the tenantry the guests proclaim
if you choose before all your own degradation
your nothingness and his elevation his
and here let us part for ever
enough mother more than enough you
rodkwood 
have decided though not convinced me detain
him within the house if you will until the
morrow in the mean time i will consider over
my line conduct
is this then thy resolve 
it is mr coates said ranulph calling
the attorney who had been an inquisitive spectator
though luckily not an auditor this
interview unbind the prisoner and bring
him hither
is it your ladyships pleasure asked mr
coates who regretted exceedingly that he could
not please both parties
lady rosewood signified her assent by a
slight bow
your bidding shall be done sir ranulph
said coates departing
sir ranulph r echoed lady rosewood
with strong emphasis markd you that 
well well muttered the attorney this
is the most extraordinary family to be sure
make way gentlemen if you please added he
 
pushing his way through the crowd toward the
prisoner
having described what took place between
lady rosewood and her son in one part the
room we must now briefly narrate some incidental
occurrences in the other the alarm 
a robber having been taken spread with great
rapidity through the house and almost all its
inmates rushed into the room including doctor
small titus tyrconnel and jack palmer
are you there honey said titus who
discovered his ally the birds caught you
see
caught be d d replied jack bluffly so
i see all his own fault infernal folly to come
here at such a time as this whats it all for
id like to know cursed nonsense however
it cant be helped now he must make the best 
it and as to that sneaking gimleteyed
parchmentskinned quilldriver if i dont serve
him out for his officiousness one these days
my names not jack palmer
 
och cush lama cree did i ever why what
the devils the boy to you jack fair plays a
jewel and surely mr coates only did his duty
im sorry hes catched for his relationship to sir
piers because i think hell be tucked up for
his pains and moreover i could forgive the
poaching but as to the breaking into a house on
such an occasion as this och its a plaguy bad
look im afraid hes worse than i expected
bah returned jack shrugging his shoulders

 is this luke bradley asked small the
unfortunate son sir piers 
the same doctor replied titus theres
no doubt his genealogy if you look at him
unquestionably not returned small 
old sir reginald rosewood who is looking
at us from out that picture might well father
that fierce face
a group the tenantry many them ina
state intoxication had in the meantime
formed themselves round the prisoner whatvol
ii c
rook wood
ever might be the nature his thoughts
no apprehension was visible in lukes countenance
he stood erect amidst the assemblage
his tall form towering above them all and
his eyes fixed upon the movements lady
rosewood and her son he had perceived the
anguish the latter and the vehemence the
former attributing both to their real causes
the taunts and jeers threats and insolent inquiries
from the hinds that thronged around
him passed unheeded yet one voice in his ear
sharp as the sting a serpent made him start
it was that the sexton
you have done well said peter have you
not your fetters are i hope to your liking
well a wilful man must have his own way
and perhaps the next time you will be content to
follow my advice you must now free yourself
the best way you can from these moabites and i
promise you it will be no easy matter ha ha 
peter withdrew into the crowd and luke
vainly endeavouring to discover his retreating
rook wood 
figure caught the eye jack palmer fixed
upon himself with a peculiar and very significant
expression
at this moment mr coates made his appearance

bring along the prisoners said the man law
to his two assistants and luke was accordingly
hurried along mr coates using his best efforts
to keep back the crowd it was during the
pressure that luke heard a voice whisper in his
ear never fear alps right and turning his
head became aware the close vicinity jack
palmer the latter elevated his eyebrows with
a gesture silence and luke passed on as if
nothing had occurred he was presently confronted
with lady rosewood and her son and
notwithstanding the efforts vir coates seconded
by some few others the crowd grew dense
around them
remove his fetters said ranulph and his
manacles were removed
 rook wood
you will consent to remain here a prisoner
till tomorrow 
i consent to nothing replied luke i
am in your hands
he does not deserve your clemency sir
ranulph interposed coates
let him take his own course said lady
rosewood he will reap the benefit it
anon
will you pledge yourself not to depart 
asked ranulph
 course cried the attorney to be sure
he will hahar
i will pledge nothing returned luke
detain me at your proper peril
 better and better exclaimed the attorney
this is the highest joke i ever heard 
i shall detain you then in custody until
proper inquiries can be made said ranulph
to your care mr coates and to that mr
tyrconnel whom i must request to lend you
rook wood 
his assistance i commit the charge and i must
further request that you will show him every
attention which his situation will permit remove
him we have a sacred duty to the dead
to fulfil to which even justice to the living must
give way disperse this crowd and let instant
preparations be made for the completion the
ceremonial you understand me sir
ranulph rosewood said luke sternly ashe
departed thou hast another a more sacred
office to perform fulfil thy duty to thy fathers
son
away with him cried lady rosewood i
am out all patience with this trifling follow
me to my chamber added she to her son
passing towards the door the concourse 
spectators who had listened to this extraordinary
scene in astonishment greatly admiring the
clemency ranulph made way for her
instantly and she left the room accompanied
by her son the prisoner was led out by the
other door
 
botheration cried titus to mr coates as
they followed in the wake why did he choose
out me til lose the funeral entirely by his
arrangement
that you will replied palmer shall i
be your deputy 
no no returned coates i will have no
other than mr tyrconnel it was sir ralphs
express wish
thats the devil it returned titus
and i that was to have been chief mourner
and have made all the preparations am to be
left out i wish sir ranulph had stayd till
tomorrow what could bring him here to spile
all its cursedly provoking
cursed provoking echoed jack
but then theres no help so i must make
the best it returned the goodhumoured
irishman

said the attorney in the lower gallery the
eastern wing with never a window and a com
rook wood 
portable antichamber there well dispose the
prisoner and keep watch in the front room ourselves
 and what with a bowl punch and a
yard or two clay well contrive to get through
the night tidily never fear as to the keeping

the night was wild and stormy the day
had been sultry with a lurid metalliclooking
sky hanging like a vast galvanic plate over the
face nature as evening drew on every
 rook wood
thing betokened the coming tempest unerring
indications its approach were noted by the
otherwise at the hall the swallow was seen
to skim the surface the pool so closely that
he ruffled its mirrored bosom as he passed
and then sharply darting round and round
with twittering scream he winged his rapid
flight to his claybuilt home beneath the barneaves
the kine that had herded to the muddied
margin the water and had sought
by splashing to relieve themselves from the
keen persecution their myriad insect tormentors
wended stall wards driven and deeply
lowing the deer that at twilight had trooped
thither also for refreshment suddenly with
expanded nostrils snuffed the air and bounded
off to their coverts amidst the sheltering fernbrake
the rooks obstreperous wing in
crowds combined cawed in a way that as
plainly as words could have done bespoke their
apprehension they were seen some hovering
and beating the air with flapping pinion others
hook wood 
shooting upwards in mid space as if to reconnoitre
the weather while others again were
croaking to their mates in loud discordant tone
from the highest branches the lime trees all
seemingly as anxious and as busy as mariners
before a gale wind
at sunset the hazy vapours which had
obscured the horizon throughout the day
rose up in spiral volumes like smoke from a
burning forest and becoming gradually condensed
assumed the form huge billowy
masses which reflecting the sun light changed
as the sinking orb declined from purple to
flame colour and thence to ashy angry grey
night rushed onwards like a sable steed there
was a dead calm the stillness was undisturbed
save by an intermittent sighing wind which
hollow as a murmur from the grave died as
it arose at once the clouds turned to an
inky blackness a single sharp intensely vivid
flash shot from the bosom the rack sheer
downwards and struck the earth with a report
 
like that a piece ordnance in ten minutes
it was densest night and a rattling thunderstorm

a thunderstorm by night what spectacle is
there so magnificently beautiful so awful so
sublime is there aught we can look upon that
can awaken similar feelings terror admiration
 dreadful by day night is the fitting
season to behold it in all its grandeur in all
its terrible beauty the face heaven is
shrouded as with a pall the darkness is
almost palpable a breath can scarce be drawn 
suddenly the sight is stricken with a broad
dazzling sheet flame rending asunder the
tenebrous shroud and illumining the dense
cope heaven tis gone darkness relieves
the aching vision darkness made more intense
by the contrast hark the skies resound with
the loud reverberating roar heavens artillery
echoing from cloud to cloud and seeming like
the voice the eternal to shake the firmament
to its foundation lo the vexed air is scathed
rook wood swith
forked flashes each succeeding the other
so fast that the eye is unable to follow their
thwart course again wis night again the
thunder peals such a storm it was once our
fate to witness belated amongst the eastern
appetites on our way from rome to terni
having descended the castellated heights 
narni we were speeding along a valley thick
with chestnut trees and hemmed in by mountains
on either side when night and the storm
overtook us we had perceived some symptoms
 the coming elemental strife at narni
but thought we might reach our destination
ere its outbreak and with this hope we urged
our course onwards we were deceived he
who thinks to fly before a storm amidst those
regions will reckon without his host we were
in the thick it night fell the tempest
arose the thunder roared the lightning blazed
we were involved in an atmosphere flame
the lightning could be seen even with eyes
closed the treeleaves rustled in the wind 
 
the mountain sides returned the thunders bray
all around was blinding light or pitchy gloom
still we dashed on through darkness or through
fire our offers a liberal huonomano were
not unheeded by the postillion who drove us
and he kept his way in gallant style now were
he and his horses utterly lost in the black void
snow we beheld him bolt upright in his stirrups
crossing himself whirling his whip round
his head or screaming at the top his voice
to the drivers the innumerable pains that
impeded our progress despite all these and
other risks we reached terni in safety by no
means indisposed to exchange our wellwindowed
britschka which appeared at that time to have
more attraction for the electric fluid than for
ourselves for the alberto to which it had served
as conductor
upon finishing this ride we were convinced
that a thunderstorm is the finest all possible
sights when seen at a distance but to be
actually exposed to its fury is another question
rook wood 
grand it is undoubtedly but the sense 
instant imminent danger that will in spite 
every effort suggest itself and the force and
distinctness with which every fatal casualty 
the kind with all its circumstances will intrude
itself upon the imagination renders one painfully
alive to the submit cf the scene terror
destroys delight and we could well barter
admiration for assurance security
to return to our tale the progress the
storm was watched with infinite apprehension
by the crowd tenantry assembled in the great
hall and loud and frequent were the ejaculations
uttered as each succeeding peal thunder
burst over their heads there was however
one amongst the assemblage who seemed to
enjoy the uproar a kindred excitement appeared
to blaze in his glances as he looked upon the
storm without this was peter bradley he
stood close by the window and shaded not his
eyes even before the fiercest flashes a grin 
unnatural exhilaration played upon his features
 
and he seemed to exult in and to court the
tempestuous horrors which affected the most
hardy amongst his companions with consternation
and made all shrink trembling into the
recesses the room peters conduct was not
unobserved nor his reputation for unholy dealing
unremembered to some he was almost
as much an object dread as the storm itself
didst ever see the like o that said farmer
burtenshaw whose round honest face good wine
had recently empurpled but fear had now mottled
white addressing his neighbour didst
ever hear any man that were a christian
laughing in the very face o a thunderstorm
with the lightning fit to put out his eyes and
the rattle above ready to break the drums o his
ears i always thought peter bradley was not
exactly what he should be and now im sure
on it
for my part i think neighbour burdens
returned the other that this great burst
 weathers all his raising for in all my
 
nafral life i never seed such a hourlyburly
and never hope to see such again ive heard
my grandfather tell folk as could command
wind and rain and belike peter may have the
power we all do know he can do more nor
any other man
we all do know at all events replied
burtenshaw that he do live like no other
man that he do spend night after night by
himself in that dreary churchyard that he do
keep no living thing except an old terrier dog
in his crazy cottage and that he never axes
nobody into his house from one years to
another ive never crossed his threshold these
twenty years bute continued he mysteriously
i happened to pass the house one dark dismal
night and there what dost think i seed through
the window
what what didst see r
peter bradley sitting with a great 
open on his knees it were a bible i think
and he crying like a child
 
crying art sure o that 
the tears were falling fast upon the
leaves returned burtenshaw but when i
knocked at the door peter hastily shut up
the and ordered me in a surly tone to
be gone
i thought no tear had ever dropped from
his eye said the other why he laughed
outright when his poor wife died and when his
daughter susan went off at the hall folks said
he received hushmoney to say nought about it
that were a bad business any how and now
that his grandson luke be taken in the fact 
housebreaking he minds it no more not he
than if nothing had happened
dont be too sure that replied burdens
 he may be scheming summit all this
time well ive known peter bradley now
these two and fifty years and excepting that
one night i never saw any good about him
and never heard nobody who could tell who
he be or where he do come from
eookwood 
one things certain at least replied the
other farmer he were never bon at rook wood
how he came here the devil only knows hark 
what a crash this storm be all his raising
i tell ve
he be what he certainly will be interposed
another speaker in a louder tone and with
less apprehension in his manner than his
comrade probably from his nerves being better
fortified with strong liquor dost thou think
simul plant as how providence would entrust
the like o him with the command the elements
 no no its rank blasphemy to suppose
such a thing and ive too much the true
catholic and apostate church about me to
stand by and hear that stated
may be then he gets his power from
satan replied plant no man else could goon
as he does only look at him he seems to
be watching for the thunderboat
i wish he may catch it then returned the
other
rook wood
that s an evil wish simon toft and thou
mayest repent it
repent it not i retorted toft it would
be a good clearance to th neighbourhood to get
rid o th old croaking curmudgeon 
whether or not peter overheard the conversation
we pretend not to say but at that moment
a blaze lightning showed him staring
towards the group
as i live hes overheard you simon
exclaimed plant i wouldnt be in your skin
for a trifle
nor i said burtenshaw
let him overhear answered toft who
cares he shall hear summit worth listening to
im not afraid o him or his arts were they as
black as lucifers owen and to show you im
not ill go and have a crack with him on the
spot
thought a fool for thy pains if thou dost
friend toft returned plant thats all i can
say
rosewood
be advised by me and stay here seconded
burtenshaw
but toft would not be advised 
kings may be blest but he was glorious
oer all the ills life victorious
staggering up to peter he laid a hard grasp
upon his shoulder and thus forcibly soliciting
his attention burst into a loud horse laugh
but peter was or affected to be too much
occupied to look at him
what dost see man that thou stares so 
it comes it comes the rain the rain 
a torrent a deluge ha ha blessed is the
corpse the rain rains on sir piers may be
drenched through his leaden covering by such
a downfall as that splash splash fire and
water and thunder all together is not that
fines ha ha the heavens will weep for him
though friends shed not a tear when did a
great mans heir feel sympathy for his sires
departure when did his widow mourn when
 
doth any man mourn for his fellow never 
he rejoiceth he maketh glad in his inmost
heart she cannot help it it is nature we all
pray for we all delight in each others destruction
we were created to do so or why else
should we feel so i never wept for any mans
death but i have often laughed no wedding
no christening ever did me good but a death
hath always brought grist to the mill it keeps
my spade from rusting ha ha natural sympathy
 out on the phrase the distant heavens
the senseless trees the impenetrable stones
shall regret you more than man shall weep
your loss with more sincerity ay tis well train
on splash splash it shall cool the hellfever
down down buckets and pails ha ha 
screaming which rather than giving it natural
utterance peter broke into one his dreadful
choking laughs which for some moments paralyzed
him and made even the hardy toft stand
aghast
there was a pause during which the sexton
 
almost exhausted by the frenzy in which he had
suffered himself to be involved seemed insensible
to all around him
 i tell you what said burtenshaw to plant
i have always thought there was more in peter
bradley nor appears on the outside he is not
what he seems to be take my word on it lord
bless you do you think a man such as he could
talk in that sort way about natural simpering
 no such thing
when peter recovered his merriment broke
out afresh having only acquired fury by the
pause
look out look out cried he hark to
the thunder hst to the rain marked ye that
flash marked ye the clockhouse and the bird
upon the roof tis the rook the great bird 
the house that hath borne away the soul the
departed there there can you not see it it
sits and croaks through storm and rain and
never heeds it all and wherefore should it heed 
vol ii d
 
see it flaps its broad black wings it croaks 
ha ha it comes it comes
and driven we conclude by the terror the
storm from more secure quarters the bird at
this instant was dashed against the window and
fell to the ground thats a call continued
peter it will be over soon and we must
set out the dead will not need to tarry
look at that trail fire along the avenue
dost see yon line sparkles like a rockets
tail thats the path the corpse will take st
hermes flickering fire robin bedfellows
dancing light or the blue flame the corpsecandle
which i saw flitting to the churchyard
last week was not so pretty a sight ha ha 
corpsecandle echoed toft who had in a
measure regained his confidence thouvt at
thy old tricks i see like the lying gipsy
queens thou it never be cured fortune telling
whose death dost think that candle did betoken
r
eookwood 
thy own said peter sharply
whose 
 thine
mine thou lying old cheat mine dost
dare to say that to my face why im as hale
and hearty as ever a man in the house dost
think theres no life and vigour in this arm thou
drivelling old dotard
upon which toft seized peter by the throat
with an energy that but for the timely intervention
 the company who rushed to his
assistance the prophet might himself have anticipated
the doom he prognosticated for the other
released from the grasp toft who was held
back by the bysanders peter again broke forth
into his enrich laugh and staring right into
the face his adversary with eyes glistening
with fury and with hands uplifted as if in
the act calling down an imprecation on
his head he screamed in a shrill and discordant
voice so you will not take my warning 
you revile me you flout me tis well your fate
 
shall prove a warning to all disbelievers they
shall remember this night though you will not 
fool fool your doom has long been sealed 
i saw your wraith choose out its last lodgment
on hallows een i know the spot your grave
is dug already ha ha i and with renewed
laughter peter rushed out the room
did i not caution thee not to provoke him
friend toft said plant its ill playing with
edged tools but dont let him fly off in that
tantrum one ye go after him
that will i replied burtenshaw and he
departed in search the sexton
id advise thee to make it up with peter so
soon as thou canst neighbour continued plant 
hes a bad friend but a worse enemy
why what harm can he do me returned
toft who however was not without some misgivings
 if i must die i cant help it i shall
go none the sooner for him even if he speak the
truth which i dont think he do and if i must
i slant go unprepared only i think as how if
eookwood 
it pleased providence i could have wished to
keep my old missis company some few years
longer and see those bits lasses mine grow
up into women and respectably provided for 
but his will be done i shant leave em quite
penniless and theres one eye at least that im
sure wont be dry at my departure here the
stout heart toft gave way and he shed some
few natural tears which however he speedily
brushed away i tell you what neighbours
continued he i think we may all as well be
thinking going to our own homes for to
my mind we shall never reach the churchyard
tonight
that you never will exclaimed a voice
behind him and toft turning round again
met the glance peter
come come master peter cried the goodnatured
farmer this be ugly jesting ax pardon
for my share it sorry for what i did 
so give us thy hand man and think no more
about it
 
peter extended his claw and the parties
were apparently once more upon terms 
friendship
a supply spirits was here introduced
lights were brought at the same time and placed
upon a long oak table the party gathering
round this illhumour was speedily dissipated
and even the storm disregarded in the copious
libations that ensued at this juncture a
loiterer appeared in the hall his movements
were unnoticed by all excepting the sexton who
watched his proceedings with some curiosity
the person walked to the window appearing
so far as could be discovered to eye the storm
with great impatience he then paced the hall
rapidly backwards and forwards and peter fancied
he could detect sounds disappointment
in his muttered exclamations again he returned
to the window as if to ascertain the
probable duration the shower it was a hopeless
endeavour all was pitchdark without the
lightning was now only seen at long intervals
 
but the rain still audibly descended in torrents
apparently seeing the impossibility controuling
the elements the person approached the
table the merriment the party waxed loud
and boisterous under the influence a stiff
glass brandy and water toft forgot his fears
and laughed in a manner so wild and frantic
that his friends began to entertain a new source
 apprehension as they whispered to each other
 that he was either fey or his wits gone a
woolgathering
 what think you the night mr palmer 
asked the sexton jack for he was the anxious
investigator the weather
dont know cant say set in i think 
damned unlucky for the funeral i mean we
shall be drowned if we go
and drunk if we stay rejoined the sexton
 but never fear it will hold up depend
upon it long before we can start why theyve
not half ready yet the coffins only just soldered
down and theres i dont know what 
lockwood
the ceremony to be gone through with the
gracecup to be handed round and the funeral
oration to be delivered by doctor small
you dont say theres any that infernal
stuff to come returned jack pettishly
why not if s no more to the doctors
taste than to your own but he cant help
himself he must go through with it it has
always been the custom here and customs are
sacred things with the rookwoods ha ha 
where have they put the prisoner asked
peter with a sudden change manner
i know the room but cant describe it its
two or three doors down the lower corridor 
the eastern gallery
good and who are on guard 
titus tyrconnel and that swiveleyed quilldriver
coates
 enough
come come master peter cried toft lets
have a stave a chaunt i know you can sing 
ive heard you give us one your odd snatches
 
a good move seconded jack a song
from you capital
ive nothing i can bring to mind but a
ditty which i sung some years ago at sir reginalds
funeral if such will serve you now you
shall have it and welcome
by all means returned jack
preparing himself like certain other accomplished
vocalists with a few preliminary hems
and haws the sexton struck forth the following
ballad which we shall entitle
the coffin
in a churchyard upon the sward a coffin there was laid
and leaning stood beside the wood a sexton on his spade
a coffin old and black it was and fashioned curiously
with quaint device carved oak in hideous fantasie
for here was wrought the sculptured thought a tormented face
with serpents lithe that round it writhe in folded strict
embrace
grim visages grinning fiends were at each corner set
and emblematic scrolls mortheads and bones together met
ah welladay that sexton gray unto himself did cry
beneath that lid much lieth hid much awful mysteries
d
 
it is an ancient coffin from the abbey that stood here
perchance it holds an abbots bones perchance those a
freer
in digging deep where monks do sleep beneath yon cloister
shrine
that coffin old within the mould it was my chance to find
the costly carvings the lid i scraped full carefully
in hope to get at name or date yet nothing could i see
with pick and spade ive plied my trade for sixty years and
more
yet never found beneath the ground shell strange as that
before 
full many coffins have i seen have seen them deep or flat
fantastical in fashion none fantastical as that
and saying so with heavy blow the lid he shattered wide
and pale with fright a ghastly sight that sexton gray espied
a miserable sight it was that loathsome corpse to see
the last last dreary darksome stage fallen humanity
though all was gone save reeky bone a green and grisly heap
with scarce a trace fleshly face strange posture did it keep
the hands were clenchd the teeth were wrench d as if the
wretch had risen
een after death had taen his breath to strive and burst his
prison
the neck was bent the nails were rent no limb or joint was
straight 
together glued with blood imbued black and coagulate
and as the sexton stooped him down to lift the coffin plank
his fingers were defiled all oer with slimy substance dank
eookwood 
ah welladay that sexton gray unto himself did cry
full well i see how fates decree foredoomed this wretch
to die 
a living man a breathing man within the cofln thrust
alack alack the agony ere he returned to dust
a vision drear did then appear unto that sextons eyes 
like that poor wight before him straight he in a coffin lies
he lieth in a trance within that coffin close and fast 
yet though he sleeper now he feels he shall awake at last
the coffin then by reverend men is borne with footstep slow
where tapers shine before the shrine where breathes the
requiem low
and for the dead the prayer is said for the soul that is net
flown
then all is drownd in hollow sound the earth is oer horn
thrown
he draweth breath he wakes from death to life more horrible
to agony i such agony no living tongue may tell
die die he must that wretched one he struggles strives
in vain 
no more heavens light nor sunshine bright shall he behold
again
gramercy lord the sexton roard awakening suddenly
if this be dream yet doth it seem most dreadful so to die
oh cast my body in the sea or hurl it on the shore i
but nail me not in coffin fast no grave will i dig more
it was not difficult to discover the effect produced
ley this song in the lengthened faces 
 lockwood
the greater part the audience jack palmer
however laughed loud and long
bravo bravo cried he that suits my
humour exactly i cant abide the thoughts 
being put underground no coffin for me
a gibbet might perhaps serve your turn as
well thought the sexton adding aloud i am
now entitled to call upon you a song a song
ay a song a song vociferated the hinds
well well replied jack ill give you an
old song composed upon one monsieur du val
a celebrated highwayman in his day its the
best i have and he commenced in the true
nasal whine the following
lament du val
ye bold undaunted souls attend
to me who did the laws offend 
for now i come to let you know
what proved my fatal overthrow
and brought my glory to decay 
it was my gang for whom hang
welladay welladay 
 this is a song written about the time the hero whom
it celebrates it has been extracted from an old blackletter
placard now in the library the british museum
eookwood 
unto a duke i was a page
and nurtured in my tender age 
until the devil did me entice
to leave off virtue and follow vice 
no sooner was i led astray
but wickedness did me possess
welladay welladay 
if i to mind my crimes should call
and lay them down before you all 
they would amount to such a sum
that there is none in christendom
so many merry pranks did play 
but now too late i know my fate
welladay welladay 
upon the road i do declare
i caused some lords and ladies fair
to quit their coach and dance with us 
this being done the case was thus
they for their music needs must pay 
but now at last those jokes are past
welladay welladay
when i was mounted on my steed
i thought myself a man indeed 
with pistol cockd and glittering sword
stand and deliver was the word 
which makes me now lament and say
pity the fall claude du val 
welladay welladay 
 
i did belong unto a crew
 swaggering blades as ever drew 
stout witherington and douglas both
we were all three engaged by oath
upon the road to take our way 
but now du val must pay for all
welladay welladay 
because i was a frenchman born
some persons treated me with scorn 
but being a daring soul
although my deeds were something foul 
my gaudy plumes i did display 
but now my pride is laid aside
welladay welladay 
i reign d with an undaunted mind
seven years but now at last i find
the pitcher that so often goes
unto the well as proverb shows
comes broken home at last we say
for now i see my destiny
welladay welladay 
then being brought to justice hall
tried and condemned before them ail 
where many noble lords did come
and ladies for to hear my doom 
then sentence past without delay
the halter first and tyburn last
in one day in one day
john witherington and sawney douglas two notorious
highwaymen the day
rook wood 
uproarious applause followed jacks song when
the joviality the mourners was interrupted
by a summons to attend in the state room
silence was at once completely restored and in
the best order they could assume they followed
their leader peter bradley jack palmer was
amongst the last to enter and looked a not incurious
spectator a by no means common scene
preparations had been made to give due solemnity
to the ceremonial the leaden coffin
was fastened down and enclosed in an outer
case oak upon the lid which stood a richlychased
massive silver flaggon filled with burnt
claret called the gracecup all the lights were
removed save two lofty wax flambeaux which
were placed to the back and threw a lurid glare
upon the group immediately about the body 
this group consisted ranulph rosewood and
some other friends the deceased doctor
small stood in front the bier and under the
directions peter bradley the tenantry and
household were formed into a wide halfmoon
across the chamber there was a hush 
 
expectation as doctor small looked gravely
around find even jack palmer who was as little
likely as any man to yield to an impression 
the kind felt himself moved by the scene
the very orthodox small as is well known
to our readers held every thing savouring the
superstitions the scarlet woman in supreme
abomination and entertaining such opinions
it can scarcely be supposed that a funeral oration
would find much favour in his eyes accompanied
as it was with the accessories censer 
candle cup all evidently derived from that
period when under the threecrowned pontiffs
sway the shaven priest pronounced his benediction
oer the dead and released the penitents
soul from purgatorial flames while he heavily
mulcted the price his redemption from the
possessions his successor small resented the
idea treading in such steps as an insult to
himself and to his cloth was he the intolerant
 papistry to tolerate this was he who could
not endure the odour catholicism to have his
nostrils thus polluted this garments thus defiled
 
by actual contact with it it was not to bethought
 and he had formally signified his
declination to mr coates when a little conversation
with that gentleman and certain weighty
considerations therein held forth the advowson
 the church rosewood residing with the
family and represented by him as well as the
placing in juxtaposition penalties to be incurred
by refusal that the scruples small
gave way and with the best grace he could
muster very reluctantly promised compliance
with these feelings it will be readily conceived
that the doctor was not in the best possible frame
 mind for the delivery his exhortation
his temper had been ruffled by a variety 
petty annoyances amongst the greatest which
was the condition whereunto the good cheer had
reduced his clerk zachariah trundletext whose
reeling eye pendulous position and open mouth
proclaimed him absolutely incapable office
zachariah was in consequence dismissed and
small commenced his discourse unsupported

but as our resorting it would not probably contribute
to the amusement our readers whatever
it might to their edification we shall pass
it over with very brief mention suffice it to
say that the oration was so thickly interstrewn
with lengthy quotations from the fathers 
chrysostom hieronymus ambrosius bailies
bernard and the rest with whose recondite latinity
notwithstanding the clashing their opinions
with his ovn the doctor was intimately
acquainted and which he moreover delighted to
quote that his auditors were absolutely mystified
and perplexed and probably not without design
countenances such amazement were turned
towards him that small who had a keen sense
 the ludicrous could scarce forbear smiling
as be proceeded and if we could suspect so
grave a personage waggery we should almost
think that by way retaliation he had palmed
some abstruse monkish funeral discourse upon his
astounded auditors a strong impression was
however produced upon his hearers more by
 
his manner than by the incomprehensible language
in which his admonitions were conveyed
after an eloquent and intelligible eulogium
upon his deceased friend which excited much
sympathy in the circle he thus concluded his
address turning towards the bier yet
wherefore should we lament him why should
our tears continue to flow forms tibicines et
turbo tumultuous lesson ill canons he is
not dead but sleeper he hath seen out his day
night hath set in and he is at rest let us
reflect that it is appointed unto all men once to
die let us reflect from how many miseries the
stroke death freeth us let us reflect also
before we regret the departed that he hath
exchanged this brief life for eternity let us
reflect also that but the worser part is dead that
the soul survive the body and finally that
whither he is gone we soon shall follow avhoso
knoweth not whatsoever be his station with
how many calamities life is beset we sojourn
amidst a vale tears whence st jerome in
 
his epistle to tyrasius maintained that jesus
wept not for lazarus dead but for lazarus
that should be raised from the dead plane
inquit lazarus mortuum dominus jlevit sed
non tuas lacrymal fuit doluit lazarus
non tormented sed potius resurgentem et
fiebat quern cogehatur propter salvador alios
ad vitam revocare hand vitam dans dominus
ingemiscebat quam tu doles esse sublatam
with st jerome agreed st ambrose who in
his oration on the resurrection in faith thus
mteth quae non jjrocellas tempestatesque
latimer in hac vita cujus parcetur merits f
and lastly st chrysostom in his sixtyninth
homily thus sayeth si defuncti diligences

timbered what remaineth for us is to offer one
common prayer for his repose and from the
bottom our hearts as a last farewell to
exclaim requiescat in pace
amen cried the sexton
the oration being concluded biscuits and
confectionery were according to old observance
handed to such the tenantry as chose to partake
 them the serving the gracecup
which ought to have formed part the duties 
zachariah had he been capable office fell to
the share the sexton the bowl was kissed
first by ranulph with lips that trembled with
emotion and afterwards by his surrounding
friends but no drop was tasted a circumstance
which did not escape peters observation proceeding
to the tenantry the first in order happened
to be farmer toft peter presented the cup
 
and as toft was about to draw a deep draught
 the wine peter whispered in his ear take
my advice for once friend toft and dont let a
bubble the liquid pass your lips for every
drop the wine you swallow sir piers will have
one sin the less and you a load the greater
on your conscience would you pawn your
soul for a mouthful sweet drink which shall
be pleasant in the mouth but bitter in the belly 
the grapes from which that wine was pressed
were grapes gall didst never hear sinswallowing
for what else was this custom
adopted seest thou not the cups brim hath
not yet been moistened well as you will 
ha ha and the sexton passed onwards
his work being nearly completed he looked
around for jack palmer whom he had remarked
during the discourse but could no where discover
him peter was about to place the flaggon
now almost digained its contents upon its
former resting place when small took it from
his hands
 a
in populi funds residing non relifiqiie
admonished pythagoras said he let there
be no dreg left in the cup thy task is complete
saying which he returned it to the sexton
my task here is ended muttered the
sexton but not elsewhere foul weather or
fine thunder or calm i must to the church
bequeathing his final instructions to certain 
the household who were to form part the
procession in case the procession set out he
opened the hall door and the pelting shower
dashing heavily in his face took his away up the
avenue now this is what i like thought he
when my skin is heated with drink to be soaked
through and through to hear the heavy rain
pattering amongst the leaves the trees it
will soon be over added he holding out his
hand thus is it ever your storm your deluging
shower pours down and is done but
your mizzling muddling mist drags out the
day give nne the storm ha ha

isaac commences
lights streamed through the chancel window
as the sexton entered the churchyard darkly
defining all the ramified tracery the noble
gothic arch and illumining the gorgeous dyes
 its richlystained glass profusely decorated
with the armorial bearings the founder the
fane and the many alliances his descendants
the sheen their blazonry gleamed bright in
 
the darkness as if to herald to his last home
another the line whose achievements it displayed
glowing colourings chequered like
rainbow tints were shed upon the broken leaves
 the adjoining yewtrees and upon the rounded
grassy tombs
opening the gate as he looked in that direction
peter became aware a dark figure enveloped
in a large black cloak and what appeared
to be a plumed hat standing at some
distance between the window and the tree and
so intervening as to receive the full influence 
the stream radiance which served to dilate its
already almost superhuman stature the sexton
stopped the figure remained stationary
there was something singular both in the costume
and situation the person peter being
naturally an inquisitive turn his curiosity was
speedily aroused and familiar with every inch 
the churchyard he determined to take the nearest
cut and to ascertain to whom the mysterious
cloak and hat belonged making his way over
vol ii e
 lockwood
the undulating graves and instinctively rounding
the headstones that intercepted his path he
speedily drew near the object his inquiry
from the moveless posture which it maintained
the figure appeared to be unconscious peter s
approach to his eyes it seemed to expand ashe
advanced he was now almost close upon it
when missing his footing owing to the uncertain
state the ground rendered slippery by the
rain he stumbled forwards and although he
arose upon the instant the figure had vanished
peter stared in amazement
what can this mean exclaimed he
who or what have i beheld this was the
exact spot upon which it stood this flag 
randolph crewes grave the stone clanks
firmly beneath my feet it could never be poor
randolphs ghost he could scarce afford a coat
to cover his back during his lifetime much
less a cloak and cap that might become a baron
and the devil is too wise to trust him avhat
if it be old sii ranulph that i have seen 
rook wood 
that feather looked like the sculptured plume
upon his marble helm i have heard he walks
on nights like these and then the voice i
heard last night tut it cannot be had i
not slipped over yon unlucky hillock it would not
have escaped me had it been human but i
must not tarry here for ghost or goblin the
funeral train will tread upon my kibes else
peter hastened to the church porch and after
shaking the wet from off his clothes as a waterdog
might shake the moisture from his curly
hide and wringing his broad felt hat he entered
the holy edifice the interior seemed one blaze
 light to the sexton in lies sudden transition
from outer darkness some few persons were
assembled probably such as were engaged in
the preparations but there was one small group
which immediately attracted his attention
near the communiontable were three persons
habited in deep mourning apparently occupied
in examining the various monumental sculpture
that enriched the walls peters office led him
 eookwood
to that part the church about to descend
into the vaults to make the last preparations
for the reception the dead with lantern in
hand keys and a crowbar he approached the
party little attention was paid to the sextons
proceedings till the harsh grating the lock
attracted their notice
peter started as he beheld the face one 
the three and relaxing his hold upon the key
the strong bolt shot back in the lock there
was a whisper amongst the party a light step
was heard advancing towards him and ere the
sexton could sufficiently recover his surprise
to force open the door a female figure stood
by his side
the keen inquiring stare which peter bestowed
upon the countenance the young lady
so abashed her that she hesitated in her purpose
 addressing him and hastily retired it was
not admiration the exquisite grace and beauty
 the person who had approached him that
attracted the sextons regard for peter was no
 
idolater feminine loveliness it was not the
witchery the dark blue eyes into whose
depths he gazed that drew enraptured worship
from his steely soul it was not to peruse the
enchanting outline that face or to mark her
free and fawnlike step it was with nothing 
pleasurable emotion but with a mixed feeling 
wonder and curiosity that he gazed upon her
reinforced by her companions an elderly
lady and a tall handsome man whose bearing
and deportment bespoke him to be a soldier the
fair stranger again ventured towards peter
you are the sexton said she addressing
him in a voice sweet and musical
i am c returned peter it was harmony
succeeded by dissonance
you perhaps can tell us then said the
elderly lady whether the funeral is likely to
take place tonight we thought it possible that
the storm might altogether prevent it
the storm is over as nearly as may be

replied peter the body will soon be on its
way i am but now arrived from the hall
indeed exclaimed the lady none 
the family will be present i suppose who is
the chief mourner 
who but young ranulph answered the
sexton there may be more the family
than were expected
is he returned asked the young lady
with great agitation manner i thought he
was abroad that he was not expected are you
sure you are rightly informed 
rightly informed echoed peter i parted
with him at the hall not ten minutes since
he returned tonight most unexpectedly
oh mother exclaimed the younger lady
that this should be that i should meet him
here why did we come let us depart

countries barbara with a celerity almost inconceivable
had received intelligence her
daughters imprisonment she set out crossing
france she scaled the pyrenees she
traversed spain she passed through madrid
she arrived at toledo in which town her
unfortunate child was confined there she lost
all trace her her agents could supply her
with no further information she was not in
the public prison and trembling with horror
anxiety and apprehension the mother was
obliged to await the day execution for a
glimpse her child and to postpone the
execution her plans until that period and
so double the danger and hazard a rescue
if she dared to attempt a rescue at all but
what will not a mother attempt and a mother
to whom fear is unknown 
meantime the wretched prisoner knew not 
all this she had experienced all the tortures
 the question the rack could extort nothing
from her there was nothing to be extorted
she was no magician she was no idolatress

but she was a gratia testa sin religion

wrote upon the expulsion this race from

no susan de des dispensations ni sacraments
algunos imagines rosaries bulas ni open

proof sorcery and to her misfortune she
was a mother sybil her child an infant then
was the companion her prison amidst all
this horror the child was affrighted till she
saw her mother pale lacerated bleeding fresh
from the teeth the rack brought back to the
dungeon the mother murmured not she
tried to smile but the child recoiled from her
bleeding touch a refinement cruelty suggested
itself to the minds these human
leeches the child should witness her mothers
torture it should stand beside her reversing
 discourse
 
the levitical law they purposed to seethe
the kid in the milk its mother the idea
was too horrible so soon as she understood
their meaning she confessed a falsehood she
proclaimed her heresiesshe condemned herself
to the stake
attired in all the tragical masquerade that
impious festival barefooted with the candle in
her hand clad in the garments the holy
office crowned with the flamecoloured cap
leading her child by the hand walked the
wretched woman in expectation her fate 
the bells rang the people shouted the lighthearted
laughed the bigots exulted some admired
her dark eyes and her small feet for she
was a beautiful woman some pitied the forlorn
little child whose bewildered gaze was turned
half in fear half in admiration upon the assembled
multitude some few wept at the
mothers anguish but more rejoiced at the death
 the heretic and the heathen all at once
there was a rush made amongst the crowd a
number masked inquisitors for such they

seemed enveloped in long sable cloaks accompanied
by their familiars by the alguacils the
corregidor masked likewise and by several
cowled priests started forward without a
word without a blow they seized upon the
victim and upon her child they bore them
off and before an attempt could be made at
rescue had disappeared this bold deed had
been so suddenly executed and by such a
formidable cavalcade that no one had dared to
interfere and though all the city was searched
every house ransacked every gate closed every
suspicious person examined every pass scrupulously
noted no trace the lost victim her
child or the perpetrators was discovered
the holy brotherhood was panicstricken the
ladrone refines the cigars and the whole
horde vagabonds who infested a certain portion
 the city were suspected but it could never
be brought home to them and in due season
the affair was hushed up or forgotten

barbara escaped and furthermore succeeded
in bringing her daughter and her grandchild to
england sybils mother did not long survive
she had suffered too much by the rack the
thumbscrew and other horrible treatment in
the abominable dungeon in which she had
been thrust but she died not at the stake and
that was enough she had been her mothers
youngest child the child her old age the
only daughter and as such the beloved the
favourite barbara nursed her tended her
but she could not restore the suppleness the
broken joints she could not heal those gasping
lungs burst by the weight imposed upon her
breast she died and bequeathed her daughter
to her mothers care and sybil had been to her
as a child yet not as her own child
this achievement was a subject unmingled
triumph to barbara she often boasted it
and with reason to have torn his prey from
the jaws the tiger in his own lair were
an easy task compared with the wresting 
a victim from the fangs the inquisition 
 
yet she had accomplished it with the assistance
 the gitanos who were disguised in the
manner described but not as she shrewdly
remarked in describing the event without an
awful waste gold which she poured out like
water buts added barbara you all know
that when i want gold i need only to dig for it
this staff showing her bifurcate hazel rod
without which she never stirred will always
show me where it lies
while on the subject the divining rod we
may mention that addicted to the practice 
divination barbara did not as is the case with
most her tribe confine herself to the pursuit 
a single branch that abstruse science as chiromancy
but followed it through its remotest
branches seeking to obtain knowledge good
and ill and to foresee the future fate and fortune
 those who consulted her like the augurs old
by what gaule in his magastromancer describes
as antinopomancy by the entrails
 men women and children theriomancy
by beasts ornithomancy by birds ickthyo
 
nancy by fishes hydromancy by water
botanomancy by herbs clemency by lots
catoxtromancy by lookingglasses though
we cannot avouch that she extended her inspections
so far in her typomancy or the
coagulation cheese or to that farthest flight
 art cephaleonomancy or consultation by
the brawling an asss head there were
few things however for which she did not draw
conclusions and her whole soul seemed absorbed
in pondering upon past events and muttering
prophetic speculations for the future
to return evincing her way she knew not
how through roofless halls over disjointed fragments
 fallen pillars sybil reached a flight 
steps a door studded with iron nails stayed her
progress it was an old strong oaken door surmounted
by a gothic arch in the keystone 
which was one those grotesque demoniacal faces
with which the fathers the church delighted
to adorn their shrines sybil looked up her
glance encountered the leering gaze the fantastical
visage it recalled the features the sexes
rook wood
ton and seemed to mock her to revile her her
fortitude at once deserted her her fingers were
upon the handle the door she hesitated 
she even drew back with the intention 
departing for she felt then that she dared not
face barbara it was too late she had moved
the handle a deep voice from within called
to her by her name she dared not disobey
that call she entered
the room in which sybil found herself was
the only entire apartment now existing in the
priory it had survived the ravages time
it had escaped the devastation man whose
ravages outstrip those time octagonal lofty
yet narrow you saw at once that it formed the
interior a turret it was lighted by a small
oriel window commanding a lovely view 
the scenery around and panelled with oak
richly wrought in ribs and groins and from
overhead depended a moulded ceiling honeycomb
plasterwork this room had something
even now in the days its desecration monastic
beauty about it where the odour 
 
sanctity had breathed forth the fumes idolatry
prevailed but imagination ever on the
wing flew back to that period and a tradition
to that effect warranted the supposition when
perchance it had been the sanctuary and the
privacy the priors self
wrapped in a cloak composed the skins 
various animals upon a low pallet covered with
stained scarlet cloth sat barbara around her
head was copied in folds like those an asiatic
turban a rich though faded shawl and her
waist was encircled with the magic zodiacal
zone proper to the sorceress the ago cineo
 the cigar whence the name according
to ioncada which barbara had brought
from spain from her ears depended long
golden drops curious antique fashioning 
and upon her withered fingers which were
like a coil lizards were hooped a multitude
 silver rings the purest but simplest
manufacture they seemed almost massive
inwrought metal her skin was yellow as the
body a toad corrugated as its back she
 
might have been steeped in saffron from her
finger tips the nails which were the same
hue to such portions her neck as were visible
and which was puckered up like the throat a
tortoise to look at her one might have thought
the embalmer had experimented her art upon
herself so dead so bloodless so blackened
seemed the flesh where flesh remained leather
could scarce be tougher than her skin she
seemed like an animated mummy such a
frame so prepared appeared calculated to endure
for ages and perhaps might have done so
but alas the soul cannot be embalmed no
oil can illume that precious lamp and that
barbaras vital spark was fast waning was evident
from her heavy bloodshot eyes once 
a swimming black and lengthy as a witchs
which were now sinister and sunken
the atmosphere the room was as strongly
impregnated as a museum with volatile odours
emitted from the stores drugs with which the
shelves were loaded as well as from various stuffed
specimens birds and wild animals barbaras
rook wood 
only living companion was a monstrous owl
which perched over the old gipsys head hissed
a token recognition as sybil advanced from
a hook which had been placed in the plaster
roof was suspended a globe crystal glass
about the size and shape a large gourd filled
vith a pure pellucid liquid in which a small
snake the egyptian aspic described perpetual
gyrations
dim were the eyes barbara yet not altogether
sightless the troubled demeanour 
her grandchild struck her as she entered she
felt the hot drops upon her hand as sybil stooped
to kiss it she heard her vainly stifled sobs
what ails thee child said barbara in a
voice that rattled in her throat and hollow as
the articulation a phantom hast thou
heard tidings luke bradley hath any ill
befallen him i told thee thou wouldst either
hear him or see him this morning he is not
returned i see what hast thou heard
he is returned replied sybil faintly and
no ill hath happened to him f
 
he is returned and thou heres echoed
barbara no ill hath happened to him thou
mayest am i to understand there is ill to thee 
sybil answered not she could not answer
i see i sees said barbara more gently her
head and hand shaking with paralytic affection 
a quarrel a lover s quarrel old as i am i
have not forgotten my feelings as a girl what
woman ever does if she be woman and thou
like thy poor mother art a true hearted wench
she loved her husband as a husband should
be loved sybil and though she loved me
well she loved him better as was right ah 
it was a bitter day when she left me and her
own land for though to one our wandering
race all countries are alike yet the soil our
birth is dear to us and the presence our
kindred dearer well well i will not think 
that she is gone nay take it not so to heart
wench luke hath a hasty temper tis not
the first time i have told thee so he will not
bear rebuke and thou hast questioned him too
shrewdly touching his absence is it not so 
rook wood 
heed it not trust me thou wilt have him seek
thy forgiveness ere the shadows shorten neath
the noontide sun
alas alas said sybil sadly this is no
lovers quarrel which may at once be forgotten
and forgiven would it were so
what is it thence asked barbara and
without waiting sybils answer she continued
with vehemence hath he stoned thee 
tell me girl in what way speak that i may
avenge thee if it be that thy wrong requires
revenge art thou blood mine and thickest
i will not do this for thee girl none the
blood barbara lovel was ever unrevenged
i will catch him though he run i will trip
him though he leap i will reach him though
he flee afar i will drag him hither by the hair
 his head added she with a livid smile and
clenching her hands as in the act dragging
some one towards her he shall wed thee
within the hour if thou wilt have it or if thy
honour need that it should be so my power is
not departed from me my people are yet at

my command i am still their queen and woe
to him that offended me or thee
mother mother cried sybil affrighted
at the storm she had unwittingly aroused he
hath not injured me tis i alone who am to
blame not luke he cannot help it
help what asked barbara you speak
in mysteries
 sir piers rook wood is dead
dead echoed barbara trembling with
surprise sir piers dead 
 and luke bradley 
har
is his successor 
who told thee that asked barbara with
increased astonishment
luke himself i know all all is disclosed
and sybil hastily recounted lukes adventures
he is now sir luke rosewood
this is news in truth said barbara yet
not news to weep for thou shouldst rejoice
for not lament it avell well i saw it i
knew it i shall live to see all accomplished 
rook wood 
to see my agathas child ennobled to see her
wedded ay to see her well wedded
dearest mother 
i can endow thee and i will do it thou
shalt bring to thy husband not alone thy beauty
thou shalt bring him wealth
 but mother 
my agathas daughter shall be lady 

 never it cannot be
what cannot be t
the match you now propose

be it must sit shall why should it not be ha
ha i perceive the meaning those tears the
truth flashes upon me he hath discarded thee
no by the heaven heavens he is still the
same unaltered in affection
if so thy tears are out place thy sorrow
out season
not so
i tell thee yea ha that look thou
 
wouldst not give me to understand that it is
thou who art the jilt 
mother it is not fitting that i a gipsy born
should wed with him
not fitting ha and thou my child not
fitting get up or i will spurn thee not
fitting dry thine eyes or i will stab thee 
not fitting this from thee to me i tell thee
it is fitting thou shalt have a dower as ample
as that any lady in the land not fitting is
it so thou mayest because thou thickest that he
derives himself from a proud and ancient line 
ancient and proud ha ha i tell thee girl
that for his one ancestor i can number twenty 
for the years in which his lineage hath flourished
my race can boast centuries and was a people 
a kingdom ere the land in which he dwells was
known what if by the curse heaven we
were driven forth the curse hell rests upon
his house
i know it said sybil a dreadful curse
which if i wed him will alight on me
 
no not on thee thou shalt avoid that
curse 
avoid it r
i know a means to satisfy the avenger
leave that to me
 i dare not as it never can be yet tell me 
you saw the body lukes illfated mother 
was she poisoned nay you may speak sir
pierss death releases you from your oath how
died she 
by strangulation said the old gipsy raising
her palsied hand to her throat
oh cried sybil gasping with horror
was there a ring upon her finger 
a ring a wedding ring the finger was
crooked
then there is no doubt that she was wedded
and that he is sir luke rosewood 
doubt i would have told luke all long
long ago had not my oath sealed fast my lips
listen to me girl when i was left alone to domine
office with the corpse susan i saw
vol ii o
 
indubitable proofs upon the body her fatal
 she was smothered sleeping and the ring
upon her finger told me by her husband i
thought that none but those accursed spanish
butchers who call themselves holy that maimed
my darling my agatha could have hearts
savage enough to perpetrate a deed so horrible 
for she looked so beautiful so innocent so
smiling even in death that little used to weeping
as i was mine eyes would scarce permit me
to complete mine office she was not unlike thy
mother girl except that her complexion was
more delicate and lacked thy mothers rich and
sunburnt warmth well i came forth her
murderer stood before me sir piers he trembled
in each joint as i looked at him he saw
that i knew his guilt he saw that he was in
my power peter bradley was with him likewise
the sexton watched my looks lie seemed to
read the secret in my countenance and as he
looked from the one to the other he smiled i
shall never forget that smile it was a father s
 
smile upon his daughters murderer carrying a
consciousness the crime along with it i
asked to be alone with sir piers he feared
to comply yet dared not refuse we were
alone thou wonder est how i ventured to trust
myself with him i was armed and then few
men could cope with barbara i would have stabbed
him if he had stirred i could have stabbed
him for a lighter offence you have seen her
said he i have i answered he dared not
continue the conversation i spoke boldly for
i hated him you were her assassin i said
he started deny it not i continued your
life is forfeit if i but speak but you will not
speak if gold will not purchase your silence
fear shall i deride your threats i returned 
and if you repeat them i will denounce you
there is a ring upon her finger again he
started she was your wife alas replied
he she was what demon prompted you to
kill her i added pride pride shrieked he
and the curse that is attached to our house the
 rook wood
insatiate spirit which will have its victim she
is gone she is gone would i were also dead
denounce me give me up to justice i deserve
it all his remorseful agony in a measure
overcame my anger and looking steadily upon
his face i saw that he was under the influence
 fate i even pitied him such was the extremity
 affliction to which he was reduced after
a while he partially recovered he brought out
gold a hoard gold it was mine he said 
i should have more if i would take the oath not
to divulge the dreadful secret in his lifetime he
renewed his entreaties i took the oath he then
led me into another chamber where an infant was
sleeping it was a beautiful boy it was luke
take this child said he the sight it will
only recall her its presence is dangerous take
the child and with it what gold thou wilt
appoint what place thou thickest proper and
more shall be sent thee but hence away the
sight that child maddens it is like an accusing
angel i took the child i took his gold i
eookwood 
did not remonstrate with him on the barbarous
and unnatural act he was committing the
child i thought would thrive as well with me
and it did thrive as thou knowest sybil under
my care amongst the bravest the boldest and
the handsomest our tribe ranked luke bradley
his was the education a man thickest
thou sybil i have forgotten the day when thou
returned with thy luckless mother thou wert
an infant then a very pretty darkeyed child
and he a boy some years in advance thee 
yet even then children as ye were ye seemed to
love each other and then first the thought flashed
across me your union i have watched you
ever since i have witnessed the growth the
progress your affection i have affianced you
the period reward is arrived he is sir luke
he is your husband
hold mother do not deceive yourself said
sybil with a fearful earnestness he is not
yet sir luke rosewood would he had no
claim to be so the fortune that hath hitherto
 
been so propitious may yet desert him bethink
you a prophecy you uttered
a prophecy ha 
and with slow enunciation sybil pronounced
the mystic words which she had heard repeated
by the sexton
as she spake a gloom like that a thundercloud
began to gather over the brow the
old gipsy the orbs her sunken eyes expanded
and wrath supplied her frame with
vigour she arose
who told thee that cried barbara
 peter bradley
peter bradley the sexton rosewood p
screamed the infuriate woman ha how
learnt he it it was to one who hath long been
in his grave i told it so long ago it had passedfrom
my memory tis strange reginald

the house

sir luke rosewood
mother shrieked sybil dost thou say
so oh recall thy speech
i may not it is spoken he shall wed her
oh god support me exclaimed sybil
silly wench be firm it must be as i say
he shall wed her yet shall he wed her not 
the altar and the grave are but a step apart 
the nuptial torch shall be quenched as soon as
lighted the curse the avenger shall fall yet
not on thee 
mother i comprehend you not cried sybil
 i would not comprehend you if sin
must fall upon some innocent head let it be

hurled on mine not upon hers i love him 
i could gladly die for him she is young she
is unoffending perhaps happy oh do not let
her perish 
peace i say cried barbara
there lives another his brother think 
that dear mother 
it is in vain
oh for my sake for my martyred mothers
sake cried sybil
touch not that chord girl said barbara 
trifle not with thy mothers name thus lightly
i owe it to her memory to look to thy advancement

advancement echoed sybil her voice
stifled with sobs it will advance me to my
grave oh mother lend not thine hand to sin
to sin repeated barbara to fate this
is thy birthday sybil eighteen summers have
flown over thy young head eighty winters
have sown their snows on mine thou hast yet
to learn years have brought wrinkles they
 
have brought wisdom likewise to struggle
with fate i tell thee is to wrestle with omnipotence
we may foresee but not avert our
destiny what will be shall be this is thy
eighteenth birthday sybil it is a day fate
to thee in it occurs thy planetary hour an hour
 good or ill according to thine actions i
have cast thy horoscope i have watched thy
natal star it is under the baneful influence
 scorpion and fiery saturn sheds his lurid
glance upon it let me see thy hand the
line life is drawn out distinct and clear 
it runs ha what means that intersection 
have a care beware my sybil thyself act
as i tell thee and thou art safe i will make
another trial by the crystal bowl attend
muttering some strange words which sounded
like a spell barbara with her divining rod described
a circle upon the floor within the circle
she drew other lines from angle to angle forming
seven triangles the bases which constituted
the seven sides a equilateral figure this
o
 
figure she studied intently for a few moments 
she then raised her wand and touched the owl
with it the bird unfolded its wings and
arose in flight then slowly circled round the
pendulous globe each time it drew nearer
until at length it touched the glassy bowl with
its flapping pinions
enough ejaculated barbara
the bird stayed its flight and returned to its
perch
barbara arose she struck the globe with her
staff the pure lymph became instantly tinged
with crimson as if blood had been commingled
with it the little serpent could be seen within
coiled up and knotted as in the struggles 
death
again i say beware ejaculated barbara
solemnly this is ominous ill
sybil had sunk from faintness on the pallet
a knock was heard at the door
 avho is without cried barbara
tis i balthazar c replied a voice
ifcsi

thou may st enter answered barbara and
an old man with a long beard white as snoav
and a costume which might be said to resemble
the ephod a jewish high priest made his
appearance
i come to tell you that there are strange
women within the priory said the patrick
gravely i have searched for you in vain
continued he addressing sybil the younger
 them seems to need your assistance
women exclaimed barbara whence
come they 
they have ridden i understand from
rosewood answered the patrico they
were on their way to davenham ashen they were
prevented
from rosewood echoed sybil their
names did you hear their names 
mowbray is the name both they area
mother and a daughter the younger is
called 
eleanor asked sybil with an acute foreboding
 calamity
rook wood
eleanor is the name assuredly replied the
patrico somewhat surprised
gracious god she here exclaimed sybil
here eleanor mowbray here cried barbara
 within my power not a moment is to
be lost balthazar hasten thee round the tents 
not a man must leave his place above all
luke bradley see that these iowbrays are
detained within the abbey let the bell be
sounded quick quick leave this wench tome
 she is not well i have much to do away
with thee man and let me know when thou
hast done it and as balthazar departed on
his mission with a glance triumph in her
eyes barbara exclaimed soh no sooner hath
the thought possessed me than the means 
accomplishment appear it shall be done at
once i will tie the knot i will untie and
then retie it this weak wench must be nerved
to the task added she regarding the senseless
form sybil here is that will stimulate
her opening a cupboard and taking a small
phial this will fortify her and this conrosewood

tinned she with a ghastly smile laying her
hand upon another vessel this philter shall
remove her rival when all is fulfilled this
liquid shall constrain her lover to be her

in consequence some few words which the
sexton let fall in the presence the attendants
during breakfast more perhaps by design than
accident it was speedily rumoured throughout
the camp that the redoubled richard turpin
 
was for the time its inmate this intelligence
produced some such sensation as is experienced
by the inhabitants some petty town on the
sudden arrival a prince the blood a
commanderincliief or other illustrious and
distinguished personage whose fame has been
vaunted abroad amongst his fellow men by
rumour and her thousand tongues and
who like our highwayman has rendered
himself sufficiently notorious to be an object
 admiration and emulation amongst his contemporaries

all started up at the news the upright
man the chief the crew arose from his
chair donned his gown state a very ancient
brocade dressing gown filched most probably
from the wardrobe some strolling player
grasped his baton office a stout oaken
truncheon and sallied forth the ruffler who
found his representative in a very magnificently
equipped and by no means illfavoured knave
whose chin was decorated with a beard as
lengthy and as black as sultan mahmoocrs
 
together with the dexterous hooker issued
forth from the hovel which they termed their
boozing ken eager to catch a glimpse the
prince the high toby cloaks the limping
galliard tore the bandages from off his
mock wounds shouldered his crutch and
trudged hastily after them the whip jack
unbuckled his strap threw away his timber
leg and leapt exulting like the bounding
roe with such a sail in sight he said
he must heave to like the rest the dumb
dummerar whose tongue had been cut outby
the algerine suddenly found the use 
it and made the welkin ring with his shouts
wonderful were the miracles dicks advent
wrought the lame became suddenly active
the blind saw and the dumb spake nay if
truth must be told absolutely gave utterance to
most vernacular execrations morts autem

each sunburnt varlet started fiom his shed

urchins followed at his heels each ripe
young maiden with the glossy eye lingered
but to sleek her raven tresses and to arrange her

each wrinkled beldame hobbled as quickly after
as her stiffened joints would permit while the
ancient patrico the priest the crew who
joined the couples together by the hedgeside
with the nice custom dead horse betweenf
brought up the rear all bent on one grand

 the parties to be wedded find out a dead horse or any
other beast and standing one on the one side and the other on

nothing but knocking cannes and the sauce none but

object that having a peep at the foremost
man all this rigging world
dick turpin at the period which we
treat was in the zenith his reputation his
deeds were full blown his exploits were in every
mans mouth and a heavy price was set upon
his head that he should show himself thus
openly where he might be so easily betrayed
excited no little surprise amongst the craftiest
 the crew and augured an excess temerity
on his part rash daring was the main feature
 turpin s character like our great nelson
he knew fear only by name and when he thus
trusted himself into the hands strangers confident
in himself and in his own resources he
felt perfectly easy as to the result he relied
also in the continuance his good fortune
which had as yet never deserted him possessed
 the belief that his hour was not yet come he
cared little or nothing for any risk he might
run and though he might undoubtedly have
some presentiment the probable termination
 his career he never suffered it to militate
 
against his present enjoyment which proved that
he was no despicable philosopher
dick turpin was the ultima romanum
the last a race which we were almost about
to say we regret is now altogether extinct
several successors he had it is true but no name
worthy to be recorded after his own with him
expired the chivalrous spirit which animated
successively the bosoms so many knights 
the road with him died away that passionate
love enterprise that high spirit devotion
to the fair sex which was first breathed upon the
highway by the gay gallant chevalier du val
the bayard the road le filou sans peur et
sans reproche but which was extinguished at
last by the cord which tied the heroic turpin
to the remorseless tree it were a subject well
worthy inquiry to trace this decline and fall

that with so many halfpay captains so many
poor curates so many lieutenants both services
without hopes promotion so many
 
pennyarliners and fashionable novelists so
many damned dramatists and damning critics
so jnany edinburgh and quarterly reviewers 
so many detrimental brothers and younger sons 
when there are horses to be hired pistols to be
borrowed purses to be taken and mails are as
plentiful as partridges it were worth serious
investigation we repeat to ascertain why with
the best material imaginable for a new race 
highwaymen we have none not so much as an
amateur why do not some these choice
spirits quit the salons pallsmall and take
to the road the air the heath is more bracing
and wholesome we should conceive than that 
any hell whatever and the chances success
incomparably greater we throw out this hint
without a doubt seeing it followed up probably
the solution our inquiry may be that
the supply is greater than the demand that in
the present state things embryo highwaymen
may be more abundant than purses and then
have we not the horse patrol with such an
admirablyorganized system conservation it is
rook wood 
vain to anticipate a change the highwaymen
we fear like their irish brothers the rapparees
went out with the tories they were averse
to reform and eschewed emancipation
lest any one should think we have overrated
the pleasures the highwaymans existence
they shall hear what the right villainous
jack hall a celebrated solyman his day
has got to say on the subject his life the
highwaymans has generally the most mirth
and the least care in it anv mans breathing
and all he deals for is clear profit he has that
point good conscience that he always sells ashe
buys a good pennyworth which is something
rare since he trades with so small a stock the
fence and he are like the devil and the doctor
they live by one another and like traitors tis
best to keep each others counsel he has this
point honesty that he never robs the house
he frequents turpin had the same scruples
respecting the hall rosewood in sir pierss

lifetime and perhaps pays his debts better
than some others for he holds it below the dignity
 his employment to commit so ungenteel
a crime as insolvency and loves to pay nobly
he has another quality not much amiss that
he takes no more than he has occasion for
jack we think was a little mistaken here
which he verifies this way he craves no more
while that lasts he is a less nuisance in a
commonwealth than a miser because the
money he engrosses all circulates again which
the other hoards as though twere only to be
found again at the day judgment he is
the tithepig his family which the gallows
instead the parson claims as its due he has
reason enough to be bold in his undertakings
for though all the world threaten him he stands
in fear but one man in it and thats the hangman
 and with him too he is generally in fee 
however i cannot affirm he is so valiant that he
dares look any man in the face for in that point
he is now and then a little modest newgate
may be said to be his countryhouse where he
 
frequently lives so many months in the year
and he is not so much concerned to be carried
thither for a small matter if twere only for the
benefit renewing his acquaintance there he
holds a petit larceny as light as a nun does
auricular confession though the priest has a
more compassionate character than the hangman
every man in this community is esteemed according
to his particular quality which there
are several degrees though it is contrary often
to public government for here a man shall be
valued purely for his merit and rise by it too
though it be but to a halter in which there is a
great deal glory in dying like a hero and
making a decent figure in the cart to the two
last staves the fiftyfirst psalm 
this we repeat is the plain statement a
practical man and again we throw out the hint
for adoption all that we regret is that we are
now degenerated from the grand solyman to the
memoirs the right villainous john hall the famous
and notorious robber penned from his mouth some time before
his death 
 
cracksman and the sneak about whom there
are no redeeming features how much lower
the next generation thieves will dive it boots

beyond dispute he ruled as master the
road his hands were as yet unstained with
blood he was ever prompt to check the disposition
to outrage and to prevent as much
as lay in his power the commission violence
by his associates late since he had possessed
himself his favourite mare black
bess his robberies had been perpetrated with
a suddenness succession and at distances
so apparently impracticable that the idea 
all having been executed by one man was
rejected as an impossibility and the only way
 reconciling the description the horse and
rider which tallied in each instance was the
supposition that these attacks were performed
by confederates similarly mounted and similarly
accoutered
there was in all this as much the famce
sacra fames as the ori the hungering
after distinction as well as the appetite
 gain enamoured his vocation turpin
delighted to hear himself designated as the
flying highwayman and it was with rapturous
wood 
vous triumph that he found his singlehanded
feats attributed to a band marauders but
this state things could not long endure his
secret was blown the vigilance the police
was aroused he was tracked to his haunts 
and after a number hairbreadth scapes
which he only effected by miracle or by the
aid his wonderworking mare he reluctantly
quitted the heathy hills bagshot the pampas
plains hounslow over which like an archetype
 the galloping captain head he had so
often scoured the gorsy commons highgate
hampstead and finchley the marshy fields 
battersea almost all which he had been
known to visit in a single night and leaving
these beaten tracks to the occupation younger
and less practised hands he bequeathed to
them at the same time his own reversionary
interest in the gibbets thereupon erected and
betook himself to the country
after a journey more or less success our
adventurer found himself at rosewood whither
he had been invited after a grand fieldday by
 hook wood
its hospitable and by no means inquisitive owner
breach faith and good fellowship formed
no part turpins character he had his lights
as well as his shades and so long as sir piers
lived his purse and coffers would have been free
from molestation except so far dick said
as a cog or two dice went my dice you
know are longs for odd and even a bale bar d
cinque deuces a pattern which he always
carried with him beyond this excepting a
takein at a steeple chase rosewood church
being the mark a do at a leap or some
such trifle to which the most scrupulous could
not raise an objection dick was all fair and
above board but when poor sir piers had
put on his wooden surtout to use dicks
own expressive metaphor his conscientious feelings
evaporated into thin air lady rosewood
was nothing to him there was excellent booty

he began to look about for hands and having
 
accidentally encountered his old comrades
rust and wilder they were let into the
business which was imperfectly accomplished
in the manner heretofore described
to return from this digression when
turpin presented himself at the threshold 
the door on his way to inquire after his mare
to his astonishment he found it closely invested
a cheering shout from the tawny throng succeeded
by a general clapping hands and
attended by a buzzing usurpation applause
such as welcomes the entrance a jxpular
actor upon the stage greeted the appearance 
the highwayman at the first sight the
crowd he was a little startled and involuntarily
sought for his pistols but the demonstrations
 admiration were too unequal local to
be for a moment mistaken his hand was
drawn from his pocket to raise his hat from
his brows
thunders applause
turpins external man we have before said
was singularly prepossessing it was especially
 rook wood
so in the eyes the sex fair we certainly cannot
say upon the present occasion amongst whom
not a single dissentient voice was to be heard
all concurred in thinking him a fine fellow 
could plainly read his high courage in his bearing
 his good breeding in his debonair deportment
 and his manly beauty in his extravagant
red whiskers dick saw the effect that he produced
he was at home in a moment your
true highwayman has ever a passion for effect
this does not desert him at the gallows it
rises superior to death itself and has been
known to influence the manner his dangling
from the gibbet to hear some one cry
there goes a proper handsome man saith
our previously quoted authority jack hall
somewhat ameliorates the terrible thoughts 
the meagre tyrant death and to go in a dirty
shirt were enough to save the hangman a
labour and make a man die with grief and
shame being in that deplorable condition
avith a gracious smile condescension like
a popular orator with a look blarney like
 
that oconnell and assurance like that
 hunt he surveyed the male portion the
spectators tipped a knowing wink at the
prettiest brunettes he could select and finally
cut a sort flinof with his wellbooted leers
which brought down another peal rapturous
applause
a rank scamp cried the upright man
and this exclamation however equivocal it may
sound was intended on his part to be highly
complimentary

that so fine a fellow should have a sconce like a

they impart to his face and then only look

they make his cheeks appear r
lady baussiere and the court the queen
 navarre were not more smitten with the
irresistible whiskers the sieur de croix
the hawks eye turpin ranged over the
whole assemblage amidst that throng dark
faces there was not one familiar to him
before him stood the upright man zoroaster
so was he called a sturdy stalwart rogue
p
 lockwood
whose superior strength and stature as has not
unfrequently been the case in the infancy 
governments that have risen to more importance
than is likely to be the case with that lesser
egypt had been the means his elevation
to his present dignified position zoroaster
literally fought his way upwards and had at
first to maintain his situation by the strong
arm but he now was enabled to repose upon
his hardwon laurels to smoke the calumet
 peace and quaff his tipple with impunity
for one gipsy blood he presented an unusually
jovial liquorloving countenance his
eye was mirthful his lip moist as if from
oft potations his cheek mellow as an orleans
plum which fruit in colour and texture it
mightily resembled strange to say also for
one that lithe race his person was heavy
and hebetudinous the consequence no doubt
 habitual intemperance like cribs he waxed
obese upon the championship there was a
kind mock state in his carriage as he placed
 
himself before turpin and with his left hand
twisted up the tail his dressing gown while
the right thrust his truncheon into his hip which
was infinitely diverting to the highwayman
turpins attention however was chiefly directed
towards his neighbour the ruffler in
whom he recognised a wellknown impostor 
the day with whose history he was sufficiently
well acquainted to be able at once to identify
the individual we have before stated that a
magnificent coalblack beard decorated the chin
 this singular character but this was not all 
his costume was in perfect keeping with his
beard and consisted a very theatricallooking
tunic upon the breast which was embroidered
in golden wire the maltese cross while over his
shoulders were thrown the ample folds a cloak
 tyrian hue to his side was girt a long and
doughty sword which he called in his knightly
phrase excalibur and upon his profuse hair
rested a hat as broad in the brim as a spanish
sombrero
exaggerated as this description may appear
 
we can assure our readers that it is not overdrawn
and that a counterpart the sketch
we have given the ruffler certainly strutted
his hour upon the stage human life and
that the very ancient and discriminating city
 canterbury to which be all honour was
his theatre action his history is so far
curious that it exemplifies more strongly thana
thousand discourses could do how prone we 
are to be governed by appearances and how
easily we may be made the dupes a plausible
impostor be it remembered however
that we treat the eighteenth century before
the march intellect had commenced we are
much too knowing to be similarly practised
upon in these enlightened times but we will
let the knight malta for such was the title
assumed by the ruffler tell his own story in
his own way hereafter contenting ourselves
with the moral precepts we have already
deduced from it
next to the knight malta stood the
whip jack habited in his sailor gear striped
 
shirt and dirty canvas trousers and adjoining
him was the galliard a loathsome 
his dress one heap rags and his
discoloured skin one mass artificial leprosy
and impostures
as turpins eye shifted from one to another
ot these figures he chanced upon an individual
who had been honos endeavouring to arrest his
attention this personage was completely in
the background all that dick could discern
 him was a brown curly head hair
carelessly arranged in the modern mode a
handsome impudent sunfreckled face with
one eye closed and the other occupied by
a broken bottle neck through which as a
substitute for a lorgnette the individual reconnoitred
him a cocked hat was placed in a
very degree manner under his arm and he
held a black ebony cane in his hand very much
in the style a fassionahle as the french
have it the year this glimpse was
sufficient to satisfy turpin he recognised
in this whimsical personage an acquaintance
i 
jerry juniper was what the classical rose
would designate a gentleman with three outs
and although he was not entirely without wit
nor his associates avouched without money
nor certainly in his own opinion had that
been asked without manners yet was he assuredly
without shoes without stockings without
shirt this latter deficiency was made up
by a voluminous cravat tied with proportionately
large bows a jaunty pair yellow
inexpressible somewhat faded a waistcoat 
silver brocade richly embroidered somewhat
tarnished and lacklustre a murreycoloured
velvet coat somewhat chafed completed the
costume this beggar brummell this mendicant
maccaroni 
jerry juniper was a character well known at
the time as a constant frequenter all races
fairs regattas shiplaunches bullbaits and
prizefights all which he attended and to
which he transported himself with an expedition
little less remarkable than that turpin you
met him at epsom at ascot at newmarket
rook wood 
at doncaster at the rooted chester at the
currant oaf kildare the most remote as well as
the most adjacent meeting attracted him the
cockpit was his constant haunt and in more
senses than one was he a leg no opera dancer
could be more agile more nimble scarcely
indeed more graceful than was jerry with his
hopeless and stockingless feet and the manner
in which he executed a pirouette or a pas before
a line carriages seldom failed to procure him
golden opinions from all sorts dames with
the ladies it must be owned jerry was rather
upon too easy terms but then perhaps the
ladies were upon too easy terms with jerry and
if a brighteyed fair one condescended to jest with
him what marvel if he should sometimes slightly
transgress the laws decorum these aberrations
however were trifling altogether he was
so well known and knew every body else so
well that he seldom committed himself and
singular to say could on occasions even be
serious in addition to his other faculties no
one cut a sly joke no one trolled a merry ditty
 
better than jerry his peculiarities in short
were on the pleasant side and he wai a general
favourite in consequence
no sooner did jerry perceive that he was
recognised than after kissing his hand with
the air a petitmaitre to the highwayman he
strove to edge his way through the crowd all
his efforts were fruitless and tired a situation
in the rear rank so inconsistent he conceived
with his own importance he had recourse
to an expedient often practised with success in
harlequinades and not unfrequently in real life
where a flying leap is occasionally taken over our
heads he ran back a few yards to give himself
an impetus returned and placing his hands
upon the shoulders a stalwart vagabond near
to him threw a somerset upon the broad cap
 a galliard who was so jammed in the midst
that he could not have stirred to avoid the
shock thence without pausing he vaulted
forwards and dropped lightly upon the ground
in front zoroaster and immediately before
the highwayman
 
dick laughed immoderately at jerrys manoeuvre
he shook his old chum cordially by
the hand saying in a whisper what the devil
brings you here jerry 
 i might retort and ask you that question
captain turpin replied jerry sotto voce it
is odd to see me here certainly quite out my
element quite lost amongst this canaille this
canting crew all the fault a pair gipsy
eyes bright as a diamond dark as a sloe you
comprehend a little affair ha liable to these
things bring your ear closer my boyje upon
your guard keep a sharp look out theres a
devil a reward upon your head i wont
answer for all these rascals
thank you for the hint jerry replied
dick in the same tone i calculated my
chances pretty nicely when i came here but
if i should perceive any symptoms foul play 
any attempt to snitch or nose amongst this pack
 pedlars i have a friend or two at hand who
wont be silent upon the occasion rest assured
i shall have my eye upon the gnarling scoundrels
 wont be sold for nothing
 
trust you for that returned juniper with
a wink stay added he a thought strikes
me i have a scheme in petty which may perhaps
afford you some fun and will at all events
ensure you safety during your stay
what is it asked dick
just amuse yourself with a flirtation for a
moment or two with that pretty damsel who
has been casting her ogles at you for the last
five minutes without success while i effect a
master stroke
and as turpin nothing loth followed his
advice jerry addressed himself to zoroaster
after a little conference accompanied by that
worthy and the knight malta the trio stepped
forward from the line and approached dick
when juniper assuming some such attitude as
the admirable jones the comedian is wont to
display delivered himself with as much propriety
 intonation as if he had been instructed
in his speech by that unrivalled master elocution
 the following address turpin listened
with the gravity one the distinguished persons
alluded to at the commencement the
rook wood 
present chapter upon their receiving the freedom
 a city at the hands a mayor and
corporation thus spoke jerry 
highest high tobymen rummest 
rum ladders and most scampish scampsmen
 we in the name barbara our most
tawny queen in the name zoroaster our
upright man timber amber or oui campoll
by all which titles his excellency is distinguished
 in our own respective najnes as
high pads and low pads rum gills and
queer gills patrick halliards printers whip
jacks and workmen from the arch rogue to
the needy miller fully sensible the honour
you have conferred upon us in gracing stophole
abbey with your presence and conceiving that
we can in no way evince our sense your condescension
so entirely as by offering you the
freedom our crew together with the privileges
 an upright man which you may be aware
are considerable and by creating you an honorary
member the vagrant club which we have
for an account these see rose they are much too
rose to be set down here
 llookwood
recently established and in so doing we would
fain express the sentiments gratification and
pride which we experience in enrolling among
our members the name one who has extended
the glory roguery so widely over the land and
who has kicked up a dust upon the highways 
england with which he most effectually blinded
the natives a name which is itself a legion 
 highwaymen awaiting with respectful deference
the acquiescence captain turpin
we beg to tender him the freedom our crew
really gentlemen said turpin who did
not exactly see the drift this harangue you
do me a vast deal honour i am quite at
a loss to conceive how i possibly have merited
so much attention at your hands and indeed
i feel myself so unworthy here dick received
an expressive wink from juniper and therefore
thought it prudent to alter his expression
could i conceive myself at all deserving 
so much distinction continued the modest
speaker i should at once accept your very
obliging offer but 
 
none so worthy said the upright tian
cant hear a refusal said the knight 
malta
refusal impossible reiterated juniper
no no refusal exclaimed a chorus 
voices dick turpin must be one us
he shall be our timber amber
well gentlemen since you are so pressing
replied turpin even so be it i ivill be your
timber amber 
bravo bravo cried the mob not 
gentlemen
about it palls at once said the knight
 malta flourishing excalibur by st
thomas a becket well have as fine a scene
as i myself ever furnished to the canterbury
lieges
about what asked dick
your matriculation replied jerry there
are certain forms to be gone through with an
oath to be taken merely a trifle well have a
jolly boose when alls over come bing avast
my merry palls to the green to the green a
turpin a turpin a new brother 
 rook wood
 a turpin a turpin a new brother 
echoed the crew
ive brought you throughout said jerry
taking advantage the uproar that ensued to
whisper to his chum none them will dare
to lift a finger against you now they are all
your friends for life
nevertheless returned turpin i should
be glad to know what has become bess
if its your prancer you are wanting chirped
a fluttering creature whom turpin recognised as
lukes groom grasshopper i gave her a fresh
loaf and a stoup stingo as you bade me and
there she be under yon tree as quiet as a lamb
i see her replied turpin just tighten
her girths grasshopper and bring her after me
and thou shalt have wherewithal to chirp over
thy cups at supper
away bounded the elfin dwarf to execute his
behest
a loud shout now rent the skies and presently
afterwards was heard the vile scraping 
a fiddle accompanied by the tattoo a drum
approaching turpin a host gipsies elevated
rook wood 
the highwayman upon their shoulders in this
way he was carried to the centre the green
where the long oaken table which had once
served the franciscans for refection was now
destined for the stage the pageant
upon this table three drums were placed and
turpin was requested to seat himself on the central
one a solemn prelude more unearthly than
the incantation in the freyschiitz was played
by the orchestra the band conducted by the
paganini the place who elicited the most marvellous
notes from his shell a couple shams 
emitted sepulchral sounds while the hollow
rolling the drum broke ever and anon uxn
the ear the effect was prodigiously grand
during this overture the patrico and the upright
iman had ascended the rostrum each taking
their places the former on the right hand 
turpin the latter upon his left below them
stood the knight ialtawith excalibur drawn
 the shall or sham was a wind instrument like a
pipe with a swelling protuberance in the middle
earl northumberlands household 
ss 
in his hand and gleaming in the sunshine on
the whole dick was amused with what he saw
and with the novel situation in which he found
himself placed around the table were congregated
a compact mass heads so compact indeed
that they looked like one creature an
argus with each eye upturned upon the highwayman
the idea struck turpin that the restless
mass parti coloured shreds and patches
 vivid hues and varied tin tings singularly
though accidentally disposed to produce such an
effect resembled an immense tigermoth or it
might be a turkey carpet spread out upon the
grass 
the scene was a joyous one it was a
brilliant sunshiny morning the air freshened
and purified by the storm the preceding night
breathed a balm upon the nerves and senses 
the robber the wooded hills were glittering in
light the brook was flowing swiftly past the
edge the verdant slope glancing like a wreathed
snake in the sunshine its quiet song lost in
the rude harmony the mummers as were the
 
thousand twittering the rejoicing birds the
rocks bared their bosoms to the sun or were
buried in deepcast gloom the shadows the
pillars and arches the old walls the priory
were projected afar while the roselike ramifications
 the magnificent marigold window were
traced as if by a pencil upon the verdant tablet
 the sod
the overture was finished with the appearance
 the principal figures in this strange
picture the reader is already familiar it remains
only to give him some idea the patrico
imagine then an old superannuated goat reared
upon its hind legs and clad in a white sheet
disposed in folds like those an ephod about
its limbs and you will have some idea balthazar
the patrico this resemblance to the
animal before mentioned was rendered the more
striking by his huge hanging goatlike underlip
his lengthy white beard and a sort 
cap covering his head which was ornamented
with a pair horns such as are to be seen in
michael angelos tremendous statue moses
vol ii q
 lockwood
balthazar besides being the patrico the tribe
was its principal professor divination and had
been the longtried and faithful minister 
barbara lovel from whose secret instructions
he was supposed to have derived much his
magical skill
placing a pair spectacles upon his prognosticating
nose and unrolling a vellum skin
upon which strange characters were written
balthazar turning to turpin thus commenced
in a solemn voice 
thou who wouldst our brother he
say how shall we enter thee 
name the name that thou wilt bear
ere our livery thou wear
i see no reason why i should alter my designations
replied the noviciate but as popes
change their titles on their creation there can
be no objection to a scampsman following so
excellent an example let me be known as the
night hawk
the night hawk good returned the
hierophant proceeding to register the name
beery gtujkikotavw
 
upon the parchment kneel down continued
he
after some hesitation turpin complied
you must repeat the salamon or oath 
our creed after my dictation said the patrico 
and turpin signifying his assent by a nod
balthazar propounded the following adjuration
 
oath the canting crew
i crankcoffin swear to be
true to this fraternity 
that i will in all obey
rule and order the lay
never blow the gab or squeak
never snitch to bum or beak 
but religiously maintain
authority those who reign
over stop hole abbey green
be they tawny king or queen
in their cause alone will fight 
think what they think wrong or right 
serve them truly and no other
and be faithful to my brother 
suffer none from far or near
with their rights to interfere 
no strange abram ruffler crack 
hooker another pack 
rogue or rascal frater murderer
irish boyle or other wanderer 
slip lockwood
no timber amber angler dancer
prig cackle prig prancer 
no stigma saddler clapper dudgeon 
cadgecloak curtal or curmudgeon 
no whipjack galliard patrick 
no workman be he high or low
no dumraerar or romany 
no member the family 
no balladbasket bouncing buffer
nor any other will i suffer 
but stalloff now and for ever
all outliers whatsoever 
and as i keep to the foregone
so may help me salamon 
perhaps the most whimsical laws that were ever prescribed
to a gang thieves were those framed by william holliday
one the rigging community who was hanged in 
art i directs that none his company should presume
to wear shirts upon pain being cashiered
ii that none should lie in any other places than stables
empty houses or other bulks
iii that they should eat nothing but what they begged
and that they should give away all the money they got by
cleaning boots among one another for the good the
fraternity
iv that they should neither learn to read nor write that
he may have them the better under command
v that they should appear every morning by nine on the
parade to receive necessary orders
vi that none should presume to follow the scent but
such as he ordered on that party
vii that if any one gave them shoes or stockings he
should convert them into money to play
 
so help me salamon repeated turpin
with emphasis
zoroaster said the patrico to the upright
man do thy part this ceremonial
zoroaster obeyed and taking excalibur
from the knight malta bestowed a hearty
thwack with the blade upon the shoulders 
the kneeling highwayman assisting him afterwards
to arise
the inauguration was complete
well exclaimed dick im glad its allover
my leg feels a little stiffish im not much
given to kneeling i must dance it off saying
which he began to shuffle upon the boards i
tell you what continued he most reverend
patrico that same salmon yours has a
cursed long tail i could scarce swallow it all
viii that they should steal nothing they could not come
at for fear bringing a scandal upon the company
ix that they should not endeavour to clear themselves 
vermin by killing or eating them
x that they should cant better than the newgate birds
pick pockets without bungling outline a quaker outswear a
lord at a gaming table and brazen out all their villainies
beyond an irishman
 
and its strange if it dont give me an indigestion
as to you sage zory from the dexterity with
which you flourish your sword i should say
you had practised at court his majesty could
scarce do the thing better when slapping some
fat alderman upon the shoulder he bids him
rise sir richard and now palls added he
glancing round as i am one you lets have
a boose together ere i depart for i dont think
my stay will be long in the land egypt
this suggestion turpin was so entirely
consonant to the wishes the assemblage that
it met with universal approbation and upon
a sign from zoroaster some his followers
departed in search supplies for the carousal
zoroaster leaped from the table and his example
was followed by turpin and more leisurely by
the patrico
it was rather early in the day for a drinking
bout but the canting crew were not remarkably
particular the chairs were removed
and the jingling glasses announced the
arrival the preliminaries the matting
 
symposium poles canvas and cords were next
brought and in almost as short space time as
one scene is substituted for another in a theatrical
representation was a tent erected benches
stools and chairs appeared with equal celerity
and the interior soon presented an appearance
like that a booth at a fair a keg brandy
was broached and the health the new
brother quaffed in trimmers
 our highwayman returned thanks zoroaster
was in the chair the knight vfalta
acting as croupier a second toast was proposed
 the tawny queen this was drunk
with a like enthusiasm and with a like allowance
 the potent spirit but as bumpers 
brandy are not to be repeated with impunity
it became evident to the president the board
that he must not repeat his toasts quite so
expeditiously to create a temporary diversion
therefore he called for a song
the dulcet notes the fiddle now broke
through the clamour and in answer to the call
jerry juniper volunteered the following

the numerous notes which we have appended toit
may not be quite obvious to our readers we
can assure them that it was perfectly intelligible
to the canting crew jerry was now entitled
to a call and happening at the moment to
meet the fine dark eyes a sentimental gipsy
one that better class mendicants who wandered
about the country with a guitar at his
back his election fell upon him the youth
without prelude struck up a
gipsy serenade
merry maid rnerry maid wilt thou wander with me 
we will roam through the forest the meadow and lea
we will haunt the sunny bowers and when day begins to flee
our couch shall be the ferny brake our canopy the tree
merry maid merry maid come and wander with me
no life like the gipsys so joyous and free 
merry maid merry maid though a roving life be ours
we will laugh away the laughing and quickly fleeting hours
our hearts are free as is the free and open sky above
and we know what tamer souls know not how lovers ought
to love
merry maid merry maid come and wander with me 
no life like the gipsys so joyous and free 
the words this song have been published accompanied
with music by mr alexander roche
 
zoroaster now removed the pipe from his upright
lips to intimate his intention proposing
a toast
an universal knocking knuckles by the
knuckles was followed by profound silence
the sage spoke 
the city canterbury palls said he
and may it never want a knight malta
the toast was pledged with much laughter
and in many bumpers
the knight upon whom all eyes were turned
rose with stately bearing and majestic motion
to return thanks
i return you an infinitude thanks brother
palls said he glancing round the assemblage 
and bowing to the president and to you most
upright zory for the honour you have done
me in associating my name with that city
believe me i sincerely appreciate the compliment
and echo the sentiment from the bottom
 my soul i trust it never will want a knight
pickpockets
 
 malta in return for your consideration buta
poor one you will say you shall have a chatty
which i composed upon the occasion my pilgrimage
to that city and which i have thought
proper to name after myself 
the knight malta
a canterbury tale
come list to me and you shall have without a hem or haw sirs
a canterbury pilgrimage much better than old chaucers
tis a hoax i once played off upon that city clever
the memory which i hope will stick to it for ever
with my coal black beard and purple cloak
jackboots and broadbrimmed castor
hey ho for the knight malta 
to execute my purpose in the first place you must know sirs
my locks i let hang down my neck my beard and whiskers
grow sirs
a purple cloak i next clapped on a sword tagged to my side sirs
and mounted on a charger black i to the town did ride sirs
with my coalblack beard c
two pages were there by my side upon two little ponies
decked out in scarlet uniform as spruce as maccaronies 
caparisoned my charger was as grandly as his master
and oer my long and curly locks i wore a broadbrimmed
castor
with my coalblack beard c
 
the people all flocked forth amazed to see a man so hairy
oh such a sight had neer before been seen in canterbury 
my flowing robe my flowing beard my horse with flowing
mane sirs 
they stared the days chivalry they thought were come
again sirs
with my coalblack beard c
i told them a long rigmarole romance that did not halt a
jot that they beheld in me a real knight malta 
tom a becket had i sworn i was that saint and martyr
hallowed
i doubt not just as readily the bait they would have swallowed
with my coalblack beard c
i rode about and speechified and everybody gulled
the tavern keepers diddled and the magistracy bullied 
like puppets were the townsfolk led in that show they all
a raree 
the gotham sages were a joke to those canterbury
with my coalblack beard c
the theatre i next engaged where i addressed the crowd sirs
and on retrenchment and reform i spouted long and loud sirs
on tithes and on taxation i enlarged with skill and zeal sirs
who so able as a malta knight the malt tax to repeal sirs
with my coalblack beard c
as a candidate i then stepped forth to represent their city
and my non election to that place was certainly a pity 
for surely i the fittest was and very proper very
to represent the wisdom and the wit canterbury
with my coalblack beard c
 
at the trial some smugglers next one thing i rather queer did
and the justices upon the bench i literally bearded 
for i swore that i some casks did see though proved as clear
as day sirs
that i happened at the time to be some fifty miles away sirs
with my coalblack beard c
this last assertion i must own was somewhat a blunder
and for perjury indicted they compelled me to knock under 
to my prosperous career this slight error put a stop sirs
and thus crossed the knight malta was at length obliged
to hop sirs
with his coalblack beard and purple cloak
jackboots and broadbrimmed castor
good bye to the knight malta
the knight sat down amidst the general
plaudits the company
the party meanwhile had been increased by
the arrival luke and the sexton the former
who was in no mood for revelry refused
to comply with his grandsires solicitation to
enter and remained sullenly at the door with
his arms folded and his eyes fixed upon turpin
whose movements he commanded through the
canvas aperture the sexton walked up to
dick who was seated at the post honour and
clapping him upon the shoulder congratulated
 rook wood
him upon the comfortable position in which he
found him
ha ha are you there my old deaths
head on a mop stick said turpin with a
laugh aint we merry mummers eh keeping
it up in style sit down old noah make
yourself comfortable jerusalem
what say you to a drop as fine old nantes
as you ever tasted in your life old cove said
zoroaster
 say returned peter that i have no
sort objection to it provided you will all
pledge my toast
that i will were it old rufrn himself
shouted turpin
heres to the three legd mare cried peter
to the tree that bears fruit all the year round
and that yet has neither bark nor branch you
wont refuse that toast captain turpin 
not i answered dick i owe the gallows
no grudge if as jerrys song says i must have
a hearty choke and caper sauce for my breakfast
one these fine mornings it shall never be said
 s
that i fell to my meal without appetite or neglected
saying grace before it gentlemen heres
peter bradleys toast the scragging post the
three legd mare with three times threes
appropriate as this sentiment was it did
not appear to be so inviting to the party as
might have been anticipated and the shouts
soon died away
they like not the thoughts the gallows
said turpin to peter iiore fools they a
mere bugbear to frighten children believe me
and never yet alarmed a brave man the gallows
pshaw one can but die once and what
signifies it how so that it be over quickly i
think no more the last leap into eternity than
 clearing a fivebarred gate a ropesend for
it so let us be merry and make the most our
time and thats true philosophy i know you
can throw off a rum chaunt added he turning to
peter i heard you sing last night at the hall
troll us a stave my antediluvian file and in the
mean time tip me a gage focus jerry 
a pipe tobacco
 
and if thats a bowl hucklem ybutt you
are brewing sir williams added he addressing
the knight malta you may send mea
jorum thereof at your convenience
jerry handed the highwayman a pipe together
with a tumbler the beverage which the
knight had prepared which he pronounced
excellent and while the huge bowl was passed
round to the company a prelude shams
announced that peter was ready to break into
song
accordingly after the symphony was ended
accompanied at intervals by a single instrument
peter began his melody in a key so high that
the utmost exertion the shawmblowe failed
to approach its altitudes the burthen his
minstrelsy was 
the mandrake f
the mandrake grows neath the gallowstree
and rank and green are its leaves to see 
a drink composed tf beer eggs and brandy
f the imaginary malignant and fatal influence this
plant is frequently alluded to by our elder dramatists and
rook wood 
green and rank as the grass that waves
over the unctuous earth graves
and though all around it be bleak and bare
freely the mandrake flourished there
maranatha anathema 
dread is the curse mandragora 
euthanasy i 
at the foot the gibbet the mandrake springs
just where the creaking carcass swings 
with one the greatest them webster as might be
expected from a charnel muse that revels like a ghoul in
graves and sepulchres and rakes up hideous and revolting
lore it is an especial favourite for illustration but none
have plunged so deeply into the disquisition the suppositious
virtues the mandrake as the learned and profound
sir thomas browne he tears up the fable root and branch
concerning the danger ensuing from eradication the mandrake
he thus write the last assertion is that there follows
a hazard life to them that pull it up that some evil fate pursues
them and that they live not very long hereafter therefore
the attempt hereof among the ancients was not in ordinary
way but as pliny informed when they intended to take
up the root this plant they took the wind thereof and with
a sword describing three circles about it they digged it up
looking toward the west a conceit not only injurious unto
truth and constable by daily experience but somewhat derogatory
unto the providence god that is not only to impose
so destructive a quality on any plant but to conceive a vegetable
whose parts are so useful unto many should in the only
taking up prove mortal unto any this were to introduce a
second forbidden fruit and enhance the first malediction
making it not only mortal for adam to taste the one but
capital for his posterity to eradicate or dig up the other 
vulvar errors ii c vi
 rook wood
some have thought it engendered
from the fat that drops from the bones the dead 
some have thought it a human thing 
but this is a vain imagining
maranatha anathema 
dread is the curse mandragora 
euthanasy 
a charnel leaf doth the mandrake wear
a charnel fruit doth the mandrake bear 
yet none like the mandrake hath such great power
such virtue resides not in herb or flower 
aconite hemlock or moonshine i ween
none hath a poison so subtle and keen
maranatha anathema 
dread is the curse mandragora 
euthanasy 
and whether the mandrake be create
flesh with the flower incorporate
i know not yet if from the earth tis rent
shrieks and groans from the root are sent 
shrieks and groans and a sweat like gore
oozes and drops from the clammy core
amaranth anathema 
dread is the curse mandragora 
euthanasy 
whoso gathered the mandrake shall surely die 
blood for blood is his destiny
some who have plucked it have died with groans
like to the mandrakes expiring moans 
some have died raving and some beside 
with penitent prayers but all have died
jesu save us by night and day
from the terrible death mandragora 
euthanasy 
 
a queer client that said zoroaster
coughing loudly in token his disapprobation
not much to my taste quoth the knight
 malta we like something more sprightly
in canterbury
 nor to mine added jerry dont think
its likely to have an encore pon my soul
dick you must give us something yourself
or we shall never cry euthanasy at the triple
tree
with all my heart replied turpin you
shall have but what do i see my friend sir
luke devil take my tongue luke bradley i

to sir luke rook wood i see you are surprised
 this gentlemen is sir luke rosewood
somewhile luke bradley heir to the house 
that name not ten miles distant from this say
shall we not diink a bumper to his health 
astonishment prevailed amongst the crew
luke himself had been taken by surprise
when turpin had discovered lii at the door
 the tent and summoned him to appear he
had most reluctantly complied with the request 
but when in a half bantering vein dick had
begun to rally him upon his pretensions he
would most gladly have retreated had it been
in his power it was then too late he
felt he must stand the ordeal the disclosure
was now made every eye was fixed upon him
with a look inquiry
port
 
zoroaster took his everlasting pipe from his
mouth
this ain t true surely asked the perplexed
sage
he has said it replied luke i may not
deny it
this was sufficient there was a wild hubbub
 delight amongst the crew for luke was
a favourite with all
sir luke rosewood cried jerry juniper
who liked a title as much as tommy moore is
said to doat upon a lord lpon my soul i
sincerely congratulate you devilish fortunate
fellow always cursed unlucky myself i could
never find out my own father unless it were one
monsieur des caprices a french dancing master
and he never left anything behind him that
i could hear except a broken kit and a
hempen widow sir luke rosewood we shall
do ourselves the pleasure drinking your health
and prosperity
fresh bumpers and immense cheering
silence being in a measure restored zoroaster
claimed turpins promise a song
 
true true replied dick i have not
forgotten it stand to your bows my hearties
the game high toby
now oliver l puts his black nightcap on
and every star its glim is hiding
and forth to the heath is the scampsman gone
his matchless cherryblack c prancer riding 
merrily over the common he flies
fast and free as the rush rocket
his crapecovered vizard drawn over his eyes
his tol by his side and his pops in his pocket
chorus
then who can name
so merry a game
as the game all games high toby 
the traveller hears him away away 
over the wide wide heath he scurries 
he heeds not the thunderbolt summons to stay
but ever the faster and faster he hurries
but what daisycutter can match that black tit 
he is caught he must stand and deliver 
then out with the dummy and off with the bit 
oh the game high toby for ever 
then who can name
so merry a game
as the game all games high toby 
 the moon light highwayman cherrycoloured
 black there being black cherries as well as red
rose sword pistols highway robbery
 pocket money
 
believe me there is not a game my brave boys
to compare with the game high toby 
no rapture can equal the solymans joys
to blue devils blue plumbs give the gobye 
and what if at length boys he come to the crap h
even rack punch has some bitter in it
for the marewiththreelegs boys i care not a rap
twill be over in less than a minute 
grand chorus
then hip hurrah
fling care away 
hurrah for the game high toby 
and now gentlemen said dick who
began to feel the influence these morning
cups i vote that we adjourn believe me i
shall always bear in mind that i am a brother
 your band sir luke and i must have a
little chat together ere i take my leave
adieu
and taking luke by the arm he walked out
 the tent peter bradley rose and followed
them
at the door they found the dwarfish grasshopper
with black bess rewarding the urchin
 bullets the gallows i ditto
vol ii r
 rosewood
for his trouble and slipping the bridle his
mare over his hand turpin continued his
walk over the green for a few minutes he
seemed to be lost in rumination
i tell you what sir luke said he i
should like to do a generous thing and make
you a present this bit paper but one
ought not to throw away ones luck you know 
there is a tide in the affairs thieves as the
player coves say which must be taken at the
flood or else but no matter your old dad
sir piers god help him had the gingerbread
that i know he was as we say a regular rhinoclerical
cull you wont feel a few thousands
especially at starting and besides there are two
others rust and wilder who row in the same
boat with me and must therefore come in for
their share the regulars all this considered
you cant complain i think if i ask five thousand
for it that old harridan lady 
offered me nearly as much
r
i will not talk to you fairness said luke 
i will not say that document belongs right
rook wood 
to me it fell by accident into your hands
having possessed yourself it i blame you not
that you dispose it to the best advantage i
must perforce agree to your terms
oh no replied dick its quite optional 
lady rosewood will give as much and make
no mouths about it so ho lass avhat makes
bess prick her earsin that fashion ha carriage
wheels in the distance that jade knows the sound
as well as i do ill just see what its like 
you will have ten minutes for reflection who
knows if i may not have come in for a good
thing here 
at that instant a carriage passed the angle 
a rock some three hundred yards distant and
was seen slowly ascending the hill side eager
as a hawk after his quarry turpin dashed
after it
in vain the sexton whom he nearly overthrew
in his career called after him to halt he sped
like a bolt from the bow
may the devil break his neck cried peter
as he saw him dash through the brook could
he not let them alone
 
this must not bess said luke know you
whose carriage it is 
it is a shrine that holds the jewel that
should be dearest in thine eyes returned
peter haste and arrest the spoilers hand
 whom dost thou mean asked luke
eleanor mowbray replied peter she
is there to the rescue away
eleanor mowbray echoed luke and
sybil
at this instant a pistolshot was heard
wilt thou let murder be done and upon thy
cousin cried peter with a bitter look thou
art not what i took thee for
luke answered not but swift as a hound from
the leash darted in the direction the carriage

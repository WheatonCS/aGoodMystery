during the dread reign of the cholera in new york i had accepted the

invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement

of his cottage ornee on the banks of the hudson we had here around

us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling

in the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books

we should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful

intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city

not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some

acquaintance then as the fatality increased we learned to expect daily

the loss of some friend at length we trembled at the approach of every

messenger the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death

that palsying thought indeed took entire possession of my soul i

could neither speak think nor dream of any thing else my host was

of a less excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in

spirits exerted himself to sustain my own his richly philosophical

intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities to the substances

of terror he was sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no

apprehension



his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into

which i had fallen were frustrated in great measure by certain

volumes which i had found in his library these were of a character to

force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition

lay latent in my bosom i had been reading these books without his

knowledge and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible

impressions which had been made upon my fancy



a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens a belief

which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed

to defend on this subject we had long and animated discussions he

maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters i

contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity-

that is to say without apparent traces of suggestion had in itself the

unmistakable elements of truth and was entitled to as much respect

as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of

genius



the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had

occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had

in it so much of the portentous character that i might well have been

excused for regarding it as an omen it appalled and at the same time

so confounded and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could

make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend



near the close of exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at

an open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a

view of a distant hill the face of which nearest my position had been

denuded by what is termed a land-slide of the principal portion of its

trees my thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to

the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city uplifting my eyes

from the page they fell upon the naked face of the bill and upon an

object upon some living monster of hideous conformation which very

rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally

in the dense forest below as this creature first came in sight i

doubted my own sanity or at least the evidence of my own eyes and

many minutes passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was

neither mad nor in a dream yet when i described the monster which

i distinctly saw and calmly surveyed through the whole period of

its progress my readers i fear will feel more difficulty in being

convinced of these points than even i did myself



estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of

the large trees near which it passed the few giants of the forest which

had escaped the fury of the land-slide i concluded it to be far larger

than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line because

the shape of the monster suggested the idea the hull of one of our

seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general

outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a

proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as

the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was

an immense quantity of black shaggy hair more than could have been

supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and projecting from this

hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike

those of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimensions extending

forward parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a

gigantic staff thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure

crystal and in shape a perfect prism it reflected in the most gorgeous

manner the rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a

wedge with the apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs

of wings each wing nearly one hundred yards in length one pair being

placed above the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each

scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that

the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but

the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a

death's head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and

which was as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of

the body as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while

i regarded the terrific animal and more especially the appearance

on its breast with a feeling or horror and awe with a sentiment of

forthcoming evil which i found it impossible to quell by any effort of

the reason i perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis

suddenly expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so

loud and so expressive of wo that it struck upon my nerves like a knell

and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once

fainting to the floor



upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend

of what i had seen and heard and i can scarcely explain what feeling of

repugnance it was which in the end operated to prevent me



at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we

were sitting together in the room in which i had seen the apparition i

occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa

near at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to

give him an account of the phenomenon he heard me to the end at first

laughed heartily and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as

if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again

had a distinct view of the monster to which with a shout of absolute

terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerly but maintained

that he saw nothing although i designated minutely the course of the

creature as it made its way down the naked face of the hill



i was now immeasurably alarmed for i considered the vision either as an

omen of my death or worse as the fore-runner of an attack of mania i

threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried

my face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no

longer apparent



my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his

demeanor and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the

conformation of the visionary creature when i had fully satisfied

him on this head he sighed deeply as if relieved of some intolerable

burden and went on to talk with what i thought a cruel calmness of

various points of speculative philosophy which had heretofore formed

subject of discussion between us i remember his insisting very

especially among other things upon the idea that the principle

source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of

the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an

object through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity to estimate

properly for example he said the influence to be exercised on

mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of democracy the distance

of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should

not fail to form an item in the estimate yet can you tell me one writer

on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch

of the subject worthy of discussion at all



he here paused for a moment stepped to a book-case and brought forth

one of the ordinary synopses of natural history requesting me then to

exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine

print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the

book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before



but for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the

monster i might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you

what it was in the first place let me read to you a schoolboy

account of the genus sphinx of the family crepuscularia of the order

lepidoptera of the class of insecta or insects the account runs thus



four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic

appearance mouth forming a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation

of the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of

mandibles and downy palpi the inferior wings retained to the superior

by a stiff hair antennae in the form of an elongated club prismatic

abdomen pointed the death's headed sphinx has occasioned much terror

among the vulgar at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it

utters and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet



he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing

himself accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of

beholding the monster



ah here it is he presently exclaimed it is reascending the face

of the hill and a very remarkable looking creature i admit it to be

still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it for

the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some

spider has wrought along the window-sash i find it to be about the

sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth

of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye

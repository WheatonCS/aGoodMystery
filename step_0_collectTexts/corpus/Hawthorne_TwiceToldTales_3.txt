gown of
wrought velvet and a doublet and hose of black satin he carried a
roll of manuscript in his hand close behind these two came a young
man of very striking countenance and demeanor with deep thought and
contemplation on his brow and perhaps a flash of enthusiasm in his
eye his garb like that of his predecessors was of an antique
fashion and there was a stain of blood upon his ruff in the same
group with these were three or four others all men of dignity and
evident command and bearing themselves like personages who were
accustomed to the gaze of the multitude it was the idea of the
beholders that these figures went to join the mysterious funeral that
had halted in front of the province-house yet that supposition seemed
to be contradicted by the air of triumph with which they waved their
hands as they crossed the threshold and vanished through the portal

in the devil's name what is this muttered sir william howe to a
gentleman beside him a procession of the regicide judges of king
charles the martyr

these said colonel joliffe breaking silence almost for the first
time that evening these if i interpret them aright are the
puritan governors the rulers of the old original democracy of
massachusetts endicott with the banner from which he had torn the
symbol of subjection and winthrop and sir henry vane and dudley
haynes bellingham and leverett

why had that young man a stain of blood upon his ruff asked miss
joliffe

because in after-years answered her grandfather he laid down the
wisest head in england upon the block for the principles of liberty

will not your excellency order out the guard whispered lord percy
who with other british officers had now assembled round the general
there may be a plot under this mummery

tush we have nothing to fear carelessly replied sir william howe
there can be no worse treason in the matter than a jest and that
somewhat of the dullest even were it a sharp and bitter one our best
policy would be to laugh it off see here come more of these gentry

another group of characters had now partly descended the staircase
the first was a venerable and white-bearded patriarch who cautiously
felt his way downward with a staff treading hastily behind him and
stretching forth his gauntleted hand as if to grasp the old man's
shoulder came a tall soldier-like figure equipped with a plumed cap
of steel a bright breastplate and a long sword which rattled against
the stairs next was seen a stout man dressed in rich and courtly
attire but not of courtly demeanor his gait had the swinging motion
of a seaman's walk and chancing to stumble on the staircase he
suddenly grew wrathful and was heard to mutter an oath he was
followed by a noble-looking personage in a curled wig such as are
represented in the portraits of queen anne's time and earlier and the
breast of his coat was decorated with an embroidered star while
advancing to the door he bowed to the right hand and to the left in a
very gracious and insinuating style but as he crossed the threshold
unlike the early puritan governors he seemed to wring his hands with
sorrow

prithee play the part of a chorus good dr byles said sir william
howe what worthies are these

if it please your excellency they lived somewhat before my day
answered the doctor but doubtless our friend the colonel has been
hand and glove with them

their living faces i never looked upon said colonel joliffe
gravely although i have spoken face to face with many rulers of this
land and shall greet yet another with an old man's blessing ere i
die but we talk of these figures i take the venerable patriarch to
be bradstreet the last of the puritans who was governor at ninety or
thereabouts the next is sir edmund andros a tyrant as any new
england schoolboy will tell you and therefore the people cast him
down from his high seat into a dungeon then comes sir william phipps
shepherd cooper sea-captain and governor may many of his countrymen
rise as high from as low an origin lastly you saw the gracious earl
of bellamont who ruled us under king william

but what is the meaning of it all asked lord percy

now were i a rebel said miss joliffe half aloud i might fancy
that the ghosts of these ancient governors had been summoned to form
the funeral procession of royal authority in new england

several other figures were now seen at the turn of the staircase the
one in advance had a thoughtful anxious and somewhat crafty
expression of face and in spite of his loftiness of manner which was
evidently the result both of an ambitious spirit and of long
continuance in high stations he seemed not incapable of cringing to a
greater than himself a few steps behind came an officer in a scarlet
and embroidered uniform cut in a fashion old enough to have been worn
by the duke of marlborough his nose had a rubicund tinge which
together with the twinkle of his eye might have marked him as a lover
of the wine-cup and good-fellowship notwithstanding which tokens he
appeared ill at ease and often glanced around him as if apprehensive
of some secret mischief next came a portly gentleman wearing a coat
of shaggy cloth lined with silken velvet he had sense shrewdness and
humor in his face and a folio volume under his arm but his aspect was
that of a man vexed and tormented beyond all patience and harassed
almost to death he went hastily down and was followed by a dignified
person dressed in a purple velvet suit with very rich embroidery his
demeanor would have possessed much stateliness only that a grievous
fit of the gout compelled him to hobble from stair to stair with
contortions of face and body when dr byles beheld this figure on the
staircase he shivered as with an ague but continued to watch him
steadfastly until the gouty gentleman had reached the threshold made
a gesture of anguish and despair and vanished into the outer gloom
whither the funeral music summoned him

governor belcher my old patron in his very shape and dress gasped
dr byles this is an awful mockery

a tedious foolery rather said sir william howe with an air of
indifference but who were the three that preceded him

governor dudley a cunning politician yet his craft once brought him
to a prison replied colonel joliffe governor shute formerly a
colonel under marlborough and whom the people frightened out of the
province and learned governor burnett whom the legislature tormented
into a mortal fever

methinks they were miserable men these royal governors of
massachusetts observed miss joliffe heavens how dim the light
grows

it was certainly a fact that the large lamp which illuminated the
staircase now burned dim and duskily so that several figures which
passed hastily down the stairs and went forth from the porch appeared
rather like shadows than persons of fleshly substance

sir william howe and his guests stood at the doors of the contiguous
apartments watching the progress of this singular pageant with various
emotions of anger contempt or half-acknowledged fear but still with
an anxious curiosity the shapes which now seemed hastening to join
the mysterious procession were recognized rather by striking
peculiarities of dress or broad characteristics of manner than by any
perceptible resemblance of features to their prototypes their faces
indeed were invariably kept in deep shadow but dr byles and other
gentlemen who had long been familiar with the successive rulers of the
province were heard to whisper the names of shirley of pownall of
sir francis bernard and of the well-remembered hutchinson thereby
confessing that the actors whoever they might be in this spectral
march of governors had succeeded in putting on some distant
portraiture of the real personages as they vanished from the door
still did these shadows toss their arms into the gloom of night with a
dread expression of woe following the mimic representative of
hutchinson came a military figure holding before his face the cocked
hat which he had taken from his powdered head but his epaulettes and
other insignia of rank were those of a general officer and something
in his mien reminded the beholders of one who had recently been master
of the province-house and chief of all the land

the shape of gage as true as in a looking-glass exclaimed lord
percy turning pale

no surely cried miss joliffe laughing hysterically it could not
be gage or sir william would have greeted his old comrade in arms
perhaps he will not suffer the next to pass unchallenged

of that be assured young lady answered sir william howe fixing
his eyes with a very marked expression upon the immovable visage of
her grandfather i have long enough delayed to pay the ceremonies of
a host to these departing guests the next that takes his leave shall
receive due courtesy

a wild and dreary burst of music came through the open door it seemed
as it the procession which had been gradually filling up its ranks
were now about to move and that this loud peal of the wailing
trumpets and roll of the muffled drums were a call to some loiterer to
make haste many eyes by an irresistible impulse were turned upon
sir william howe as if it were he whom the dreary music summoned to
the funeral of departed power

see here comes the last whispered miss joliffe pointing her
tremulous finger to the staircase

a figure had come into view as if descending the stairs although so
dusky was the region whence it emerged some of the spectators fancied
that they had seen this human shape suddenly moulding itself amid the
gloom downward the figure came with a stately and martial tread and
reaching the lowest stair was observed to be a tall man booted and
wrapped in a military cloak which was drawn up around the face so as
to meet the napped brim of a laced hat the features therefore were
completely hidden but the british officers deemed that they had seen
that military cloak before and even recognized the frayed embroidery
on the collar as well as the gilded scabbard of a sword which
protruded from the folds of the cloak and glittered in a vivid gleam
of light apart from these trifling particulars there were
characteristics of gait and bearing which impelled the wondering
guests to glance from the shrouded figure to sir william howe as if
to satisfy themselves that their host had not suddenly vanished from
the midst of them with a dark flush of wrath upon his brow they saw
the general draw his sword and advance to meet the figure in the cloak
before the latter had stepped one pace upon the floor

villain unmuffle yourself cried he you pass no farther

the figure without blenching a hair's-breadth from the sword which
was pointed at his breast made a solemn pause and lowered the cape of
the cloak from about his face yet not sufficiently for the spectators
to catch a glimpse of it but sir william howe had evidently seen
enough the sternness of his countenance gave place to a look of wild
amazement if not horror while he recoiled several steps from the
figure and let fall his sword upon the floor the martial shape again
drew the cloak about his features and passed on but reaching the
threshold with his back toward the spectators he was seen to stamp
his foot and shake his clenched hands in the air it was afterward
affirmed that sir william howe had repeated that selfsame gesture of
rage and sorrow when for the last time and as the last royal
governor he passed through the portal of the province-house

hark the procession moves said miss joliffe

the music was dying away along the street and its dismal strains were
mingled with the knell of midnight from the steeple of the old south
and with the roar of artillery which announced that the beleaguered
army of washington had intrenched itself upon a nearer height than
before as the deep boom of the cannon smote upon his ear colonel
joliffe raised himself to the full height of his aged form and smiled
sternly on the british general

would your excellency inquire further into the mystery of the
pageant said he

take care of your gray head cried sir william howe fiercely
though with a quivering lip it has stood too long on a traitor's
shoulders

you must make haste to chop it off then calmly replied the
colonel for a few hours longer and not all the power of sir william
howe nor of his master shall cause one of these gray hairs to fall
the empire of britain in this ancient province is at its last gasp
to-night almost while i speak it is a dead corpse and methinks the
shadows of the old governors are fit mourners at its funeral

with these words colonel joliffe threw on his cloak and drawing his
granddaughter's arm within his own retired from the last festival
that a british ruler ever held in the old province of massachusetts
bay it was supposed that the colonel and the young lady possessed
some secret intelligence in regard to the mysterious pageant of that
night however this might be such knowledge has never become general
the actors in the scene have vanished into deeper obscurity than even
that wild indian hand who scattered the cargoes of the tea-ships on
the waves and gained a place in history yet left no names but
superstition among other legends of this mansion repeats the
wondrous tale that on the anniversary night of britain's discomfiture
the ghosts of the ancient governors of massachusetts still glide
through the portal of the province house and last of all comes a
figure shrouded in a military cloak tossing his clenched hands into
the air and stamping his iron-shod boots upon the broad freestone
steps with a semblance of feverish despair but without the sound of a
foot-tramp

 

when the truth-telling accents of the elderly gentleman were hushed i
drew a long breath and looked round the room striving with the best
energy of my imagination to throw a tinge of romance and historic
grandeur over the realities of the scene but my nostrils snuffed up a
scent of cigar-smoke clouds of which the narrator had emitted by way
of visible emblem i suppose of the nebulous obscurity of his tale
moreover my gorgeous fantasies were woefully disturbed by the
rattling of the spoon in a tumbler of whiskey-punch which mr thomas
waite was mingling for a customer nor did it add to the picturesque
appearance of the panelled walls that the slate of the brookline stage
was suspended against them instead of the armorial escutcheon of some
far-descended governor a stage-driver sat at one of the windows
reading a penny paper of the day the boston times and presenting a
figure which could nowise be brought into any picture of times in
boston seventy or a hundred years ago on the window-seat lay a
bundle neatly done up in brown paper the direction of which i had the
idle curiosity to read miss susan huggins at the province house a
pretty chambermaid no doubt in truth it is desperately hard work
when we attempt to throw the spell of hoar antiquity over localities
with which the living world and the day that is passing over us have
aught to do yet as i glanced at the stately staircase down which the
procession of the old governors had descended and as i emerged
through the venerable portal whence their figures had preceded me it
gladdened me to be conscious of a thrill of awe then diving through
the narrow archway a few strides transported me into the densest
throng of washington street




ii

edward randolph's portrait


the old legendary guest of the province house abode in my remembrance
from midsummer till january one idle evening last winter confident
that he would be found in the snuggest corner of the bar-room i
resolved to pay him another visit hoping to deserve well of my
country by snatching from oblivion some else unheard-of fact of
history the night was chill and raw and rendered boisterous by
almost a gale of wind which whistled along washington street causing
the gaslights to flare and flicker within the lamps

as i hurried onward my fancy was busy with a comparison between the
present aspect of the street and that which it probably wore when the
british governors inhabited the mansion whither i was now going brick
edifices in those times were few till a succession of destructive
fires had swept and swept again the wooden dwellings and warehouses
from the most populous quarters of the town the buildings stood
insulated and independent not as now merging their separate
existences into connected ranges with a front of tiresome identity
but each possessing features of its own as if the owner's individual
taste had shaped it and the whole presenting a picturesque
irregularity the absence of which is hardly compensated by any
beauties of our modern architecture such a scene dimly vanishing
from the eye by the ray of here and there a tallow candle glimmering
through the small panes of scattered windows would form a sombre
contrast to the street as i beheld it with the gaslights blazing from
corner to corner flaming within the shops and throwing a noonday
brightness through the huge plates of glass but the black lowering
sky as i turned my eyes upward wore doubtless the same visage as
when it frowned upon the ante-revolutionary new englanders the wintry
blast had the same shriek that was familiar to their ears the old
south church too still pointed its antique spire into the darkness
and was lost between earth and heaven and as i passed its clock
which had warned so many generations how transitory was their
lifetime spoke heavily and slow the same unregarded moral to myself
only seven o'clock thought i my old friend's legends will
scarcely kill the hours twixt this and bedtime

passing through the narrow arch i crossed the courtyard the confined
precincts of which were made visible by a lantern over the portal of
the province house on entering the bar-room i found as i expected
the old tradition-monger seated by a special good fire of anthracite
compelling clouds of smoke from a corpulent cigar he recognized me
with evident pleasure for my rare properties as a patient listener
invariably make me a favorite with elderly gentlemen and ladies of
narrative propensites drawing a chair to the fire i desired mine
host to favor us with a glass apiece of whiskey-punch which was
speedily prepared steaming hot with a slice of lemon at the bottom
a dark-red stratum of port wine upon the surface and a sprinkling of
nutmeg strewn over all as we touched our glasses together my
legendary friend made himself known to me as mr bela tiffany and i
rejoiced at the oddity of the name because it gave his image and
character a sort of individuality in my conception the old
gentleman's draught acted as a solvent upon his memory so that it
overflowed with tales traditions anecdotes of famous dead people and
traits of ancient manners some of which were childish as a nurse's
lullaby while others might have been worth the notice of the grave
historian nothing impressed me more than a story of a black
mysterious picture which used to hang in one of the chambers of the
province house directly above the room where we were now sitting the
following is as correct a version of the fact as the reader would be
likely to obtain from any other source although assuredly it has a
tinge of romance approaching to the marvellous

 

in one of the apartments of the province-house there was long
preserved an ancient picture the frame of which was as black as ebony
and the canvas itself so dark with age damp and smoke that not a
touch of the painter's art could be discerned time had thrown an
impenetrable veil over it and left to tradition and fable and
conjecture to say what had once been there portrayed during the rule
of many successive governors it had hung by prescriptive and
undisputed right over the mantel piece of the same chamber and it
still kept its place when lieutenant-governor hutchinson assumed the
administration of the province on the departure of sir francis
bernard

the lieutenant-governor sat one afternoon resting his head against the
carved back of his stately arm-chair and gazing up thoughtfully at the
void blackness of the picture it was scarcely a time for such
inactive musing when affairs of the deepest moment required the
ruler's decision for within that very hour hutchinson had received
intelligence of the arrival of a british fleet bringing three
regiments from halifax to overawe the insubordination of the people
these troops awaited his permission to occupy the fortress of castle
william and the town itself yet instead of affixing his signature to
an official order there sat the lieutenant-governor so carefully
scrutinizing the black waste of canvas that his demeanor attracted the
notice of two young persons who attended him one wearing a military
dress of buff was his kinsman francis lincoln the provincial
captain of castle william the other who sat on a low stool beside
his chair was alice vane his favorite niece she was clad entirely
in white a pale ethereal creature who though a native of new
england had been educated abroad and seemed not merely a stranger
from another clime but almost a being from another world for several
years until left an orphan she had dwelt with her father in sunny
italy and there had acquired a taste and enthusiasm for sculpture and
painting which she found few opportunities of gratifying in the
undecorated dwellings of the colonial gentry it was said that the
early productions of her own pencil exhibited no inferior genius
though perhaps the rude atmosphere of new england had cramped her hand
and dimmed the glowing colors of her fancy but observing her uncle's
steadfast gaze which appeared to search through the mist of years to
discover the subject of the picture her curiosity was excited

is it known my dear uncle inquired she what this old picture
once represented possibly could it be made visible it might prove a
masterpiece of some great artist else why has it so long held such a
conspicuous place

as her uncle contrary to his usual custom for he was as attentive to
all the humors and caprices of alice as if she had been his own
best-beloved child did not immediately reply the young captain of
castle william took that office upon himself

this dark old square of canvas my fair cousin said he has been
an heirloom in the province-house from time immemorial as to the
painter i can tell you nothing but if half the stories told of it be
true not one of the great italian masters has ever produced so
marvellous a piece of work as that before you

captain lincoln proceeded to relate some of the strange fables and
fantasies which as it was impossible to refute them by ocular
demonstration had grown to be articles of popular belief in reference
to this old picture one of the wildest and at the same time the
best-accredited accounts stated it to be an original and authentic
portrait of the evil one taken at a witch-meeting near salem and
that its strong and terrible resemblance had been confirmed by several
of the confessing wizards and witches at their trial in open court it
was likewise affirmed that a familiar spirit or demon abode behind the
blackness of the picture and had shown himself at seasons of public
calamity to more than one of the royal governors shirley for
instance had beheld this ominous apparition on the eve of general
abercrombie's shameful and bloody defeat under the walls of
ticonderoga many of the servants of the province-house had caught
glimpses of a visage frowning down upon them at morning or evening
twilight or in the depths of night while raking up the fire that
glimmered on the hearth beneath although if any were bold enough to
hold a torch before the picture it would appear as black and
undistinguishable as ever the oldest inhabitant of boston recollected
that his father in whose days the portrait had not wholly faded out
of sight had once looked upon it but would never suffer himself to
be questioned as to the face which was there represented in
connection with such stories it was remarkable that over the top of
the frame there were some ragged remnants of black silk indicating
that a veil had formerly hung down before the picture until the
duskiness of time had so effectually concealed it but after all it
was the most singular part of the affair that so many of the pompous
governors of massachusetts had allowed the obliterated picture to
remain in the state-chamber of the province-house

some of these fables are really awful observed alice vane who had
occasionally shuddered as well as smiled while her cousin spoke it
would be almost worth while to wipe away the black surface of the
canvas since the original picture can hardly be so formidable as
those which fancy paints instead of it

but would it be possible inquired her cousin to restore this dark
picture to its pristine hues

such arts are known in italy said alice

the lieutenant-governor had roused himself from his abstracted mood
and listened with a smile to the conversation of his young relatives
yet his voice had something peculiar in its tones when he undertook
the explanation of the mystery

i am sorry alice to destroy your faith in the legends of which you
are so fond remarked he but my antiquarian researches have long
since made me acquainted with the subject of this picture if picture
it can be called which is no more visible nor ever will be than the
face of the long-buried man whom it once represented it was the
portrait of edward randolph the founder of this house a person
famous in the history of new england

of that edward randolph exclaimed captain lincoln who obtained the
repeal of the first provincial charter under which our forefathers
had enjoyed almost democratic privileges he that was styled the
arch-enemy of new england and whose memory is still held in detestation
as the destroyer of our liberties

it was the same randolph answered hutchinson moving uneasily in
his chair it was his lot to taste the bitterness of popular odium

our annals tell us continued the captain of castle william that
the curse of the people followed this randolph where he went and
wrought evil in all the subsequent events of his life and that its
effect was seen likewise in the manner of his death they say too
that the inward misery of that curse worked itself outward and was
visible on the wretched man's countenance making it too horrible to
be looked upon if so and if this picture truly represented his
aspect it was in mercy that the cloud of blackness has gathered over
it

these traditions are folly to one who has proved as i have how little
of historic truth lies at the bottom said the lieutenant-governor
as regards the life and character of edward randolph too implicit
credence has been given to dr cotton mather who i must say it
though some of his blood runs in my veins has filled our early
history with old women's tales as fanciful and extravagant as those of
greece or rome

and yet whispered alice vane may not such fables have a moral
and methinks if the visage of this portrait be so dreadful it is not
without a cause that it has hung so long in a chamber of the
province-house when the rulers feel themselves irresponsible it were
well that they should be reminded of the awful weight of a people's
curse

the lieutenant-governor started and gazed for a moment at his niece
as if her girlish fantasies had struck upon some feeling in his own
breast which all his policy or principles could not entirely subdue
he knew indeed that alice in spite of her foreign education
retained the native sympathies of a new england girl

peace silly child cried he at last more harshly than he had ever
before addressed the gentle alice the rebuke of a king is more to
be dreaded than the clamor of a wild misguided multitude captain
lincoln it is decided the fortress of castle william must be
occupied by the royal troops the two remaining regiments shall be
billeted in the town or encamped upon the common it is time after
years of tumult and almost rebellion that his majesty's government
should have a wall of strength about it

trust sir trust yet a while to the loyalty of the people said
captain lincoln nor teach them that they can ever be on other terms
with british soldiers than those of brotherhood as when they fought
side by side through the french war do not convert the streets of
your native town into a camp think twice before you give up old
castle william the key of the province into other keeping than that
of true-born new englanders

young man it is decided repeated hutchinson rising from his
chair a british officer will be in attendance this evening to
receive the necessary instructions for the disposal of the troops
your presence also will be required till then farewell

with these words the lieutenant-governor hastily left the room while
alice and her cousin more slowly followed whispering together and
once pausing to glance back at the mysterious picture the captain of
castle william fancied that the girl's air and mien were such as might
have belonged to one of those spirits of fable fairies or creatures
of a more antique mythology who sometimes mingled their agency with
mortal affairs half in caprice yet with a sensibility to human weal
or woe as he held the door for her to pass alice beckoned to the
picture and smiled

come forth dark and evil shape cried she it is thine hour

in the evening lieutenant-governor hutchinson sat in the same chamber
where the foregoing scene had occurred surrounded by several persons
whose various interests had summoned them together there were the
selectmen of boston plain patriarchal fathers of the people
excellent representatives of the old puritanical founders whose sombre
strength had stamped so deep an impress upon the new england
character contrasting with these were one or two members of council
richly dressed in the white wigs the embroidered waistcoats and other
magnificence of the time and making a somewhat ostentatious display
of courtier-like ceremonial in attendance likewise was a major of
the british army awaiting the lieutenant-governor's orders for the
landing of the troops which still remained on board the transports
the captain of castle william stood beside hutchinson's chair with
folded arms glancing rather haughtily at the british officer by whom
he was soon to be superseded in his command on a table in the centre
of the chamber stood a branched silver candlestick throwing down the
glow of half a dozen waxlights upon a paper apparently ready for the
lieutenant-governor's signature

partly shrouded in the voluminous folds of one of the window-curtains
which fell from the ceiling to the floor was seen the white drapery
of a lady's robe it may appear strange that alice vane should have
been there at such a time but there was something so childlike so
wayward in her singular character so apart from ordinary rules that
her presence did not surprise the few who noticed it meantime the
chairman of the selectmen was addressing to the lieutenant-governor a
long and solemn protest against the reception of the british troops
into the town

and if your honor concluded this excellent but somewhat prosy old
gentleman shall see fit to persist in bringing these mercenary
sworders and musketeers into our quiet streets not on our heads be
the responsibility think sir while there is yet time that if one
drop of blood be shed that blood shall be an eternal stain upon your
honor's memory you sir have written with an able pen the deeds of
our forefathers the more to be desired is it therefore that
yourself should deserve honorable mention as a true patriot and
upright ruler when your own doings shall be written down in history

i am not insensible my good sir to the natural desire to stand well
in the annals of my country replied hutchinson controlling his
impatience into courtesy nor know i any better method of attaining
that end than by withstanding the merely temporary spirit of mischief
which with your pardon seems to have infected older men than myself
would you have me wait till the mob shall sack the province-house as
they did my private mansion trust me sir the time may come when you
will be glad to flee for protection to the king's banner the raising
of which is now so distasteful to you

yes said the british major who was impatiently expecting the
lieutenant-governor's orders the demagogues of this province have
raised the devil and cannot lay him again we will exorcise him in
god's name and the king's

if you meddle with the devil take care of his claws answered the
captain of castle william stirred by the taunt against his
countrymen

craving your pardon young sir said the venerable selectman let
not an evil spirit enter into your words we will strive against the
oppressor with prayer and fasting as our forefathers would have done
like them moreover we will submit to whatever lot a wise providence
may send us always after our own best exertions to amend it

and there peep forth the devil's claws muttered hutchinson who
well understood the nature of puritan submission this matter shall
be expedited forthwith when there shall be a sentinel at every corner
and a court of guard before the town-house a loyal gentleman may
venture to walk abroad what to me is the outcry of a mob in this
remote province of the realm the king is my master and england is my
country upheld by their armed strength i set my foot upon the rabble
and defy them

he snatched a pen and was about to affix his signature to the paper
that lay on the table when the captain of castle william placed his
hand upon his shoulder the freedom of the action so contrary to the
ceremonious respect which was then considered due to rank and dignity
awakened general surprise and in none more than in the
lieutenant-governor himself looking angrily up he perceived that his
young relative was pointing his finger to the opposite wall
hutchinson's eye followed the signal and he saw what had hitherto
been unobserved that a black silk curtain was suspended before the
mysterious picture so as completely to conceal it his thoughts
immediately recurred to the scene of the preceding afternoon and in
his surprise confused by indistinct emotions yet sensible that his
niece must have had an agency in this phenomenon he called loudly
upon her

alice come hither alice

no sooner had he spoken than alice vane glided from her station and
pressing one hand across her eyes with the other snatched away the
sable curtain that concealed the portrait an exclamation of surprise
burst from every beholder but the lieutenant-governor's voice had a
tone of horror

by heaven said he in a low inward murmur speaking rather to
himself than to those around him if the spirit of edward randolph
were to appear among us from the place of torment he could not wear
more of the terrors of hell upon his face

for some wise end said the aged selectman solemnly hath
providence scattered away the mist of years that had so long hid this
dreadful effigy until this hour no living man hath seen what we
behold

within the antique frame which so recently had enclosed a sable waste
of canvas now appeared a visible picture-still dark indeed in its
hues and shadings but thrown forward in strong relief it was a
half-length figure of a gentleman in a rich but very old-fashioned
dress of embroidered velvet with a broad ruff and a beard and
wearing a hat the brim of which overshadowed his forehead beneath
this cloud the eyes had a peculiar glare which was almost lifelike
the whole portrait started so distinctly out of the background that it
had the effect of a person looking down from the wall at the
astonished and awe-stricken spectators the expression of the face if
any words can convey an idea of it was that of a wretch detected in
some hideous guilt and exposed to the bitter hatred and laughter and
withering scorn of a vast surrounding multitude there was the
struggle of defiance beaten down and overwhelmed by the crushing
weight of ignominy the torture of the soul had come forth upon the
countenance it seemed as if the picture while hidden behind the
cloud of immemorial years had been all the time acquiring an intenser
depth and darkness of expression till now it gloomed forth again and
threw its evil omen over the present hour such if the wild legend
may be credited was the portrait of edward randolph as he appeared
when a people's curse had wrought its influence upon his nature

twould drive me mad that awful face said hutchinson who seemed
fascinated by the contemplation of it

be warned then whispered alice he trampled on a people's rights
behold his punishment and avoid a crime like his

the lieutenant-governor actually trembled for an instant but
exerting his energy which was not however his most characteristic
feature he strove to shake off the spell of randolph's countenance

girl cried he laughing bitterly as he turned to alice have you
brought hither your painter's art your italian spirit of intrigue
your tricks of stage-effect and think to influence the councils of

stay yet a while said the selectman as hutchinson again snatched
the pen for if ever mortal man received a warning from a tormented
soul your honor is that man

away answered hutchinson fiercely though yonder senseless
picture cried forbear it should not move me

casting a scowl of defiance at the pictured face which seemed at that
moment to intensify the horror of its miserable and wicked look he
scrawled on the paper in characters that betokened it a deed of
desperation the name of thomas hutchinson then it is said he
shuddered as if that signature had granted away his salvation

it is done said he and placed his hand upon his brow

may heaven forgive the deed said the soft sad accents of alice
vane like the voice of a good spirit flitting away

when morning came there was a stifled whisper through the household and
spreading thence about the town that the dark mysterious picture had
started from the wall and spoken face to face with lieutenant-governor
hutchinson if such a miracle had been wrought however no traces of
it remained behind for within the antique frame nothing could be
discerned save the impenetrable cloud which had covered the canvas
since the memory of man if the figure had indeed stepped forth it
had fled back spirit-like at the day-dawn and hidden itself behind
a century's obscurity the truth probably was that alice vane's secret
for restoring the hues of the picture had merely effected a temporary
renovation but those who in that brief interval had beheld the awful
visage of edward randolph desired no second glance and ever afterward
trembled at the recollection of the scene as if an evil spirit had
appeared visibly among them and as for hutchinson when far over
the ocean his dying-hour drew on he gasped for breath and complained
that he was choking with the blood of the boston massacre and francis
lincoln the former captain of castle william who was standing at his
bedside perceived a likeness in his frenzied look to that of edward
randolph did his broken spirit feel at that dread hour the tremendous
burden of a people's curse

 

at the conclusion of this miraculous legend i inquired of mine host
whether the picture still remained in the chamber over our heads but
mr tiffany informed me that it had long since been removed and was
supposed to be hidden in some out-of-the-way corner of the new england
museum perchance some curious antiquary may light upon it there and
with the assistance of mr howorth the picture-cleaner may supply a
not unnecessary proof of the authenticity of the facts here set down

during the progress of the story a storm had been gathering abroad and
raging and rattling so loudly in the upper regions of the province
house that it seemed as if all the old governors and great men were
running riot above stairs while mr bela tiffany babbled of them
below in the course of generations when many people have lived and
died in an ancient house the whistling of the wind through its
crannies and the creaking of its beams and rafters become strangely
like the tones of the human voice or thundering laughter or heavy
footsteps treading the deserted chambers it is as if the echoes of
half a century were revived such were the ghostly sounds that roared
and murmured in our ears when i took leave of the circle round the
fireside of the province house and plunging down the doorsteps
fought my way homeward against a drifting snow-storm

lady eleanore's mantle


mine excellent friend the landlord of the province house was pleased
the other evening to invite mr tiffany and myself to an
oyster-supper this slight mark of respect and gratitude as he
handsomely observed was far less than the ingenious tale-teller and
i the humble note-taker of his narratives had fairly earned by the
public notice which our joint lucubrations had attracted to his
establishment many a cigar had been smoked within his premises many
a glass of wine or more potent aqua vitæ had been quaffed many
a dinner had been eaten by curious strangers who save for the
fortunate conjunction of mr tiffany and me would never have ventured
through that darksome avenue which gives access to the historic
precincts of the province house in short if any credit be due to the
courteous assurances of mr thomas waite we had brought his forgotten
mansion almost as effectually into public view as if we had thrown
down the vulgar range of shoe-shops and dry-good stores which hides
its aristocratic front from washington street it may be unadvisable
however to speak too loudly of the increased custom of the house
lest mr waite should find it difficult to renew the lease on so
favorable terms as heretofore

being thus welcomed as benefactors neither mr tiffany nor myself
felt any scruple in doing full justice to the good things that were
set before us if the feast were less magnificent than those same
panelled walls had witnessed in a bygone century if mine host
presided with somewhat less of state than might have befitted a
successor of the royal governors if the guests made a less imposing
show than the bewigged and powdered and embroidered dignitaries who
erst banqueted at the gubernatorial table and now sleep within their
armorial tombs on copp's hill or round king's chapel yet never i
may boldly say did a more comfortable little party assemble in the
province-house from queen anne's days to the revolution the occasion
was rendered more interesting by the presence of a venerable personage
whose own actual reminiscences went back to the epoch of gage and
howe and even supplied him with a doubtful anecdote or two of
hutchinson he was one of that small and now all but extinguished
class whose attachment to royalty and to the colonial institutions
and customs that were connected with it had never yielded to the
democratic heresies of after-times the young queen of britain has not
a more loyal subject in her realm perhaps not one who would kneel
before her throne with such reverential love as this old grandsire
whose head has whitened beneath the mild sway of the republic which
still in his mellower moments he terms a usurpation yet prejudices so
obstinate have not made him an ungentle or impracticable companion if
the truth must be told the life of the aged loyalist has been of such
a scrambling and unsettled character he has had so little choice of
friends and been so often destitute of any that i doubt whether he
would refuse a cup of kindness with either oliver cromwell or john
hancock to say nothing of any democrat now upon the stage in another
paper of this series i may perhaps give the reader a closer glimpse of
his portrait

our host in due season uncorked a bottle of madeira of such exquisite
perfume and admirable flavor that he surely must have discovered it in
an ancient bin down deep beneath the deepest cellar where some jolly
old butler stored away the governor's choicest wine and forgot to
reveal the secret on his death-bed peace to his red-nosed ghost and a
libation to his memory this precious liquor was imbibed by mr
tiffany with peculiar zest and after sipping the third glass it was
his pleasure to give us one of the oddest legends which he had yet
raked from the storehouse where he keeps such matters with some
suitable adornments from my own fancy it ran pretty much as follows

 

not long after colonel shute had assumed the government of
massachusetts bay now nearly a hundred and twenty years ago a young
lady of rank and fortune arrived from england to claim his protection
as her guardian he was her distant relative but the nearest who had
survived the gradual extinction of her family so that no more
eligible shelter could be found for the rich and high-born lady
eleanore rochcliffe than within the province-house of a transatlantic
colony the consort of governor shute moreover had been as a mother
to her childhood and was now anxious to receive her in the hope that
a beautiful young woman would be exposed to infinitely less peril from
the primitive society of new england than amid the artifices and
corruptions of a court if either the governor or his lady had
especially consulted their own comfort they would probably have
sought to devolve the responsibility on other hands since with some
noble and splendid traits of character lady eleanore was remarkable
for a harsh unyielding pride a haughty consciousness of her
hereditary and personal advantages which made her almost incapable of
control judging from many traditionary anecdotes this peculiar
temper was hardly less than a monomania or if the acts which it
inspired were those of a sane person it seemed due from providence
that pride so sinful should be followed by as severe a retribution
that tinge of the marvellous which is thrown over so many of these
half-forgotten legends has probably imparted an additional wildness to
the strange story of lady eleanore rochcliffe

the ship in which she came passenger had arrived at newport whence
lady eleanore was conveyed to boston in the governor's coach attended
by a small escort of gentlemen on horseback the ponderous equipage
with its four black horses attracted much notice as it rumbled
through cornhill surrounded by the prancing steeds of half a dozen
cavaliers with swords dangling to their stirrups and pistols at their
holsters through the large glass windows of the coach as it rolled
along the people could discern the figure of lady eleanore strangely
combining an almost queenly stateliness with the grace and beauty of a
maiden in her teens a singular tale had gone abroad among the ladies
of the province that their fair rival was indebted for much of the
irresistible charm of her appearance to a certain article of dress an
embroidered mantle which had been wrought by the most skilful artist
in london and possessed even magical properties of adornment on the
present occasion however she owed nothing to the witchery of dress
being clad in a riding-habit of velvet which would have appeared stiff
and ungraceful on any other form

the coachman reined in his four black steeds and the whole cavalcade
came to a pause in front of the contorted iron balustrade that fenced
the province-house from the public street it was an awkward
coincidence that the bell of the old south was just then tolling for a
funeral so that instead of a gladsome peal with which it was
customary to announce the arrival of distinguished strangers lady
eleanore rochcliffe was ushered by a doleful clang as if calamity had
come embodied in her beautiful person

a very great disrespect exclaimed captain langford an english
officer who had recently brought despatches to governor shute the
funeral should have been deferred lest lady eleanore's spirits be
affected by such a dismal welcome

with your pardon sir replied dr clarke a physician and a famous
champion of the popular party whatever the heralds may pretend a
dead beggar must have precedence of a living queen king death confers
high privileges

these remarks-were interchanged while the speakers waited a passage
through the crowd which had gathered on each side of the gateway
leaving an open avenue to the portal of the province-house a black
slave in livery now leaped from behind the coach and threw open the
door while at the same moment governor shute descended the flight of
steps from his mansion to assist lady eleanore in alighting but the
governor's stately approach was anticipated in a manner that excited
general astonishment a pale young man with his black hair all in
disorder rushed from the throng and prostrated himself beside the
coach thus offering his person as a footstool for lady eleanore
rochcliffe to tread upon she held back an instant yet with an
expression as if doubting whether the young man were worthy to bear
the weight of her footstep rather than dissatisfied to receive such
awful reverence from a fellow-mortal

up sir said the governor sternly at the same time lifting his
cane over the intruder what means the bedlamite by this freak

nay answered lady eleanore playfully but with more scorn than
pity in her tone your excellency shall not strike him when men seek
only to be trampled upon it were a pity to deny them a favor so
easily granted and so well deserved then though as lightly as a
sunbeam on a cloud she placed her foot upon the cowering form and
extended her hand to meet that of the governor

there was a brief interval during which lady eleanore retained this
attitude and never surely was there an apter emblem of aristocracy
and hereditary pride trampling on human sympathies and the kindred of
nature than these two figures presented at that moment yet the
spectators were so smitten with her beauty and so essential did pride
seem to the existence of such a creature that they gave a
simultaneous acclamation of applause

who is this insolent young fellow inquired captain langford who
still remained beside dr clarke if he be in his senses his
impertinence demands the bastinado if mad lady eleanore should be
secured from further inconvenience by his confinement

his name is jervase helwyse answered the doctor a youth of no
birth or fortune or other advantages save the mind and soul that
nature gave him and being secretary to our colonial agent in london
it was his misfortune to meet this lady eleanore rochcliffe he loved
her and her scorn has driven him mad

he was mad so to aspire observed the english officer

it may be so said dr clarke frowning as he spoke but i tell
you sir i could wellnigh doubt the justice of the heaven above us if
no signal humiliation overtake this lady who now treads so haughtily
into yonder mansion she seeks to place herself above the sympathies
of our common nature which envelops all human souls see if that
nature do not assert its claim over her in some mode that shall bring
her level with the lowest

never cried captain langford indignantly neither in life nor
when they lay her with her ancestors

not many days afterward the governor gave a ball in honor of lady
eleanore rochcliffe the principal gentry of the colony received
invitations which were distributed to their residences far and near
by messengers on horseback bearing missives sealed with all the
formality of official despatches in obedience to the summons there
was a general gathering of rank wealth and beauty and the wide door
of the province-house had seldom given admittance to more numerous and
honorable guests than on the evening of lady eleanore's ball without
much extravagance of eulogy the spectacle might even be termed
splendid for according to the fashion of the times the ladies shone
in rich silks and satins outspread over wide-projecting hoops and the
gentlemen glittered in gold embroidery laid unsparingly upon the
purple or scarlet or sky-blue velvet which was the material of their
coats and waistcoats the latter article of dress was of great
importance since it enveloped the wearer's body nearly to the knees
and was perhaps bedizened with the amount of his whole year's income
in golden flowers and foliage the altered taste of the present day a
taste symbolic of a deep change in the whole system of society would
look upon almost any of those gorgeous figures as ridiculous although
that evening the guests sought their reflections in the pier-glasses
and rejoiced to catch their own glitter amid the glittering crowd
what a pity that one of the stately mirrors has not preserved a
picture of the scene which by the very traits that were so transitory
might have taught us much that would be worth knowing and remembering

would at least that either painter or mirror could convey to us some
faint idea of a garment already noticed in this legend the lady
eleanore's embroidered mantle which the gossips whispered was
invested with magic properties so as to lend a new and untried grace
to her figure each time that she put it on idle fancy as it is this
mysterious mantle has thrown an awe around my image of her partly
from its fabled virtues and partly because it was the handiwork of a
dying woman and perchance owed the fantastic grace of its conception
to the delirium of approaching death

after the ceremonial greetings had been paid lady eleanore rochcliffe
stood apart from the mob of guests insulating herself within a small
and distinguished circle to whom she accorded a more cordial favor
than to the general throng the waxen torches threw their radiance
vividly over the scene bringing out its brilliant points in strong
relief but she gazed carelessly and with now and then an expression
of weariness or scorn tempered with such feminine grace that her
auditors scarcely perceived the moral deformity of which it was the
utterance she beheld the spectacle not with vulgar ridicule as
disdaining to be pleased with the provincial mockery of a
court-festival but with the deeper scorn of one whose spirit held
itself too high to participate in the enjoyment of other human souls
whether or no the recollections of those who saw her that evening were
influenced by the strange events with which she was subsequently
connected so it was that her figure ever after recurred to them as
marked by something wild and unnatural although at the time the
general whisper was of her exceeding beauty and of the indescribable
charm which her mantle threw around her some close observers indeed
detected a feverish flush and alternate paleness of countenance with
a corresponding flow and revulsion of spirits and once or twice a
painful and helpless betrayal of lassitude as if she were on the
point of sinking to the ground then with a nervous shudder she
seemed to arouse her energies and threw some bright and playful yet
half-wicked sarcasm into the conversation there was so strange a
characteristic in her manners and sentiments that it astonished every
right-minded listener till looking in her face a lurking and
incomprehensible glance and smile perplexed them with doubts both as
to her seriousness and sanity gradually lady eleanore rochcliffe's
circle grew smaller till only four gentlemen remained in it these
were captain langford the english officer before mentioned a
virginian planter who had come to massachusetts on some political
errand a young episcopal clergyman the grandson of a british earl
and lastly the private secretary of governor shute whose
obsequiousness had won a sort of tolerance from lady eleanore

at different periods of the evening the liveried servants of the
province-house passed among the guests bearing huge trays of
refreshments and french and spanish wines lady eleanore rochcliffe
who refused to wet her beautiful lips even with a bubble of champagne
had sunk back into a large damask chair apparently overwearied either
with the excitement of the scene or its tedium and while for an
instant she was unconscious of voices laughter and music a young
man stole forward and knelt down at her feet he bore a salver in his
hand on which was a chased silver goblet filled to the brim with wine
which he offered as reverentially as to a crowned queen or rather
with the awful devotion of a priest doing sacrifice to his idol
conscious that some one touched her robe lady eleanore started and
unclosed her eyes upon the pale wild features and dishevelled hair of
jervase helwyse

why do you haunt me thus said she in a languid tone but with a
kindlier feeling than she ordinarily permitted herself to express
they tell me that i have done you harm

heaven knows if that be so replied the young man solemnly but
lady eleanore in requital of that harm if such there be and for
your own earthly and heavenly welfare i pray you to take one sip of
this holy wine and then to pass the goblet round among the guests and
this shall be a symbol that you have not sought to withdraw yourself
from the chain of human sympathies which whoso would shake off must
keep company with fallen angels

where has this mad fellow stolen that sacramental vessel exclaimed
the episcopal clergyman

this question drew the notice of the guests to the silver cup which
was recognized as appertaining to the communion-plate of the old south
church and for aught that could be known it was brimming over with
the consecrated wine

perhaps it is poisoned half whispered the governor's secretary

pour it down the villain's throat cried the virginian fiercely

turn him out of the house cried captain langford seizing jervase
helwyse so roughly by the shoulder that the sacramental cup was
overturned and its contents sprinkled upon lady eleanore's mantle
whether knave fool or bedlamite it is intolerable that the fellow
should go at large

pray gentlemen do my poor admirer no harm said lady eleanore
with a faint and weary smile take him out of my sight if such be
your pleasure for i can find in my heart to do nothing but laugh at
him whereas in all decency and conscience it would become me to
weep for the mischief i have wrought

but while the bystanders were attempting to lead away the unfortunate
young man he broke from them and with a wild impassioned earnestness
offered a new and equally strange petition to lady eleanore it was no
other than that she should throw off the mantle which while he
pressed the silver cup of wine upon her she had drawn more closely
around her form so as almost to shroud herself within it

cast it from you exclaimed jervase helwyse clasping his hands in
an agony of entreaty it may not yet be too late give the accursed
garment to the flames

but lady eleanore with a laugh of scorn drew the rich folds of the
embroidered mantle over her head in such a fashion as to give a
completely new aspect to her beautiful face which half hidden half
revealed seemed to belong to some being of mysterious character and
purposes

farewell jervase helwyse said she keep my image in your
remembrance as you behold it now

alas lady he replied in a tone no longer wild but sad as a
funeral-bell we must meet shortly when your face may wear another
aspect and that shall be the image that must abide within me he
made no more resistance to the violent efforts of the gentlemen and
servants who almost dragged him out of the apartment and dismissed him
roughly from the iron gate of the province-house

captain langford who had been very active in this affair was
returning to the presence of lady eleanore rochcliffe when he
encountered the physician dr clarke with whom he had held some
casual talk on the day of her arrival the doctor stood apart
separated from lady eleanore by the width of the room but eying her
with such keen sagacity that captain langford involuntarily gave him
credit for the discovery of some deep secret

you appear to be smitten after all with the charms of this queenly
maiden said he hoping thus to draw forth the physician's hidden
knowledge

god forbid answered dr clarke with a grave smile and if you be
wise you will put up the same prayer for yourself woe to those who
shall be smitten by this beautiful lady eleanore but yonder stands
the governor and i have a word or two for his private ear
good-night he accordingly advanced to governor shute and addressed
him in so low a tone that none of the bystanders could catch a word of
what he said although the sudden change of his excellency's hitherto
cheerful visage betokened that the communication could be of no
agreeable import a very few moments afterward it was announced to the
guests that an unforeseen circumstance rendered it necessary to put a
premature close to the festival

the ball at the province-house supplied a topic of conversation for
the colonial metropolis for some days after its occurrence and might
still longer have been the general theme only that a subject of
all-engrossing interest thrust it for a time from the public
recollection this was the appearance of a dreadful epidemic which in
that age and long before and afterward was wont to slay its hundreds
and thousands on both sides of the atlantic on the occasion of which
we speak it was distinguished by a peculiar virulence insomuch that
it has left its traces its pitmarks to use an appropriate figure on
the history of the country the affairs of which were thrown into
confusion by its ravages at first unlike its ordinary course the
disease seemed to confine itself to the higher circles of society
selecting its victims from among the proud the well-born and the
wealthy entering unabashed into stately chambers and lying down with
the slumberers in silken beds some of the most distinguished guests
of the province-house even those whom the haughty lady eleanore
rochcliffe had deemed not unworthy of her favor were stricken by this
fatal scourge it was noticed with an ungenerous bitterness of feeling
that the four gentlemen the virginian the british officer the young
clergyman and the governor's secretary who had been her most devoted
attendants on the evening of the ball were the foremost on whom the
plague-stroke fell but the disease pursuing its onward progress
soon ceased to be exclusively a prerogative of aristocracy its red
brand was no longer conferred like a noble's star or an order of
knighthood it threaded its way through the narrow and crooked
streets and entered the low mean darksome dwellings and laid its
hand of death upon the artisans and laboring classes of the town it
compelled rich and poor to feel themselves brethren then and stalking
to and fro across the three hills with a fierceness which made it
almost a new pestilence there was that mighty conqueror that scourge
and horror of our forefathers the small-pox

we cannot estimate the affright which this plague inspired of yore by
contemplating it as the fangless monster of the present day we must
remember rather with what awe we watched the gigantic footsteps of
the asiatic cholera striding from shore to shore of the atlantic and
marching like destiny upon cities far remote which flight had already
half depopulated there is no other fear so horrible and unhumanizing
as that which makes man dread to breathe heaven's vital air lest it be
poison or to grasp the hand of a brother or friend lest the grip of
the pestilence should clutch him such was the dismay that now
followed in the track of the disease or ran before it throughout the
town graves were hastily dug and the pestilential relics as hastily
covered because the dead were enemies of the living and strove to
draw them headlong as it were into their own dismal pit the public
councils were suspended as if mortal wisdom might relinquish its
devices now that an unearthly usurper had found his way into the
ruler's mansion had an enemy's fleet been hovering on the coast or
his armies trampling on our soil the people would probably have
committed their defence to that same direful conqueror who had wrought
their own calamity and would permit no interference with his sway
this conqueror had a symbol of his triumphs it was a blood-red flag
that fluttered in the tainted air over the door of every dwelling into
which the small-pox had entered

such a banner was long since waving over the portal of the
province-house for thence as was proved by tracking its footsteps
back had all this dreadful mischief issued it had been traced back
to a lady's luxurious chamber to the proudest of the proud to her
that was so delicate and hardly owned herself of earthly mould to the
haughty one who took her stand above human sympathies to lady
eleanore there remained no room for doubt that the contagion had
lurked in that gorgeous mantle which threw so strange a grace around
her at the festival its fantastic splendor had been conceived in the
delirious brain of a woman on her death-bed and was the last toil of
her stiffening fingers which had interwoven fate and misery with its
golden threads this dark tale whispered at first was now bruited
far and wide the people raved against the lady eleanore and cried out
that her pride and scorn had evoked a fiend and that between them
both this monstrous evil had been born at times their rage and
despair took the semblance of grinning mirth and whenever the red
flag of the pestilence was hoisted over another and yet another door
they clapped their hands and shouted through the streets in bitter
mockery behold a new triumph for the lady eleanore

one day in the midst of these dismal times a wild figure approached
the portal of the province-house and folding his arms stood
contemplating the scarlet banner which a passing breeze shook
fitfully as if to fling abroad the contagion that it typified at
length climbing one of the pillars by means of the iron balustrade
he took down the flag and entered the mansion waving it above his
head at the foot of the staircase he met the governor booted and
spurred with his cloak drawn around him evidently on the point of
setting forth upon a journey

wretched lunatic what do you seek here exclaimed shute extending
his cane to guard himself from contact there is nothing here but
death back or you will meet him

death will not touch me the banner-bearer of the pestilence cried
jervase helwyse shaking the red flag aloft death and the
pestilence who wears the aspect of the lady eleanore will walk
through the streets to-night and i must march before them with this
banner

why do i waste words on the fellow muttered the governor drawing
his cloak across his mouth what matters his miserable life when
none of us are sure of twelve hours breath on fool to your own
destruction

he made way for jervase helwyse who immediately ascended the
staircase but on the first landing-place was arrested by the firm
grasp of a hand upon his shoulder looking fiercely up with a madman's
impulse to struggle with and rend asunder his opponent he found
himself powerless beneath a calm stern eye which possessed the
mysterious property of quelling frenzy at its height the person whom
he had now encountered was the physician dr clarke the duties of
whose sad profession had led him to the province-house where he was
an infrequent guest in more prosperous times

young man what is your purpose demanded he

i seek the lady eleanore answered jervase helwyse submissively

all have fled from her said the physician why do you seek her
now i tell you youth her nurse fell death-stricken on the threshold
of that fatal chamber know ye not that never came such a curse to our
shores as this lovely lady eleanore that her breath has filled the
air with poison that she has shaken pestilence and death upon the
land from the folds of her accursed mantle

let me look upon her rejoined the mad youth more wildly let me
behold her in her awful beauty clad in the regal garments of the
pestilence she and death sit on a throne together let me kneel down
before them

poor youth said dr clarke and moved by a deep sense of human
weakness a smile of caustic humor curled his lip even then wilt
thou still worship the destroyer and surround her image with fantasies
the more magnificent the more evil she has wrought thus man doth ever
to his tyrants approach then madness as i have noted has that
good efficacy that it will guard you from contagion and perhaps its
own cure may be found in yonder chamber ascending another flight of
stairs he threw open a door and signed to jervase helwyse that he
should enter

the poor lunatic it seems probable had cherished a delusion that his
haughty mistress sat in state unharmed herself by the pestilential
influence which as by enchantment she scattered round about her he
dreamed no doubt that her beauty was not dimmed but brightened into
superhuman splendor with such anticipations he stole reverentially to
the door at which the physician stood but paused upon the threshold
gazing fearfully into the gloom of the darkened chamber

where is the lady eleanore whispered he

call her replied the physician

lady eleanore princess queen of death cried jervase helwyse
advancing three steps into the chamber she is not here there on
yonder table i behold the sparkle of a diamond which once she wore
upon her bosom there and he shuddered there hangs her mantle on
which a dead woman embroidered a spell of dreadful potency but where
is the lady eleanore

something stirred within the silken curtains of a canopied bed and a
low moan was uttered which listening intently jervase helwyse began
to distinguish as a woman's voice complaining dolefully of thirst he
fancied even that he recognized its tones

my throat my throat is scorched murmured the voice a drop of
water

what thing art thou said the brain-stricken youth drawing near the
bed and tearing asunder its curtains whose voice hast thou stolen
for thy murmurs and miserable petitions as if lady eleanore could be
conscious of mortal infirmity fie heap of diseased mortality why
lurkest thou in my lady's chamber

oh jervase helwyse said the voice and as it spoke the figure
contorted itself struggling to hide its blasted face look not now
on the woman you once loved the curse of heaven hath stricken me
because i would not call man my brother nor woman sister i wrapped
myself in pride as in a mantle and scorned the sympathies of nature
and therefore has nature made this wretched body the medium of a
dreadful sympathy you are avenged they are all avenged nature is
avenged for i am eleanore rochcliffe

the malice of his mental disease the bitterness lurking at the bottom
of his heart mad as he was for a blighted and ruined life and love
that had been paid with cruel scorn awoke within the breast of
jervase helwyse he shook his finger at the wretched girl and the
chamber echoed the curtains of the bed were shaken with his outburst
of insane merriment

another triumph for the lady eleanore he cried all have been her
victims who so worthy to be the final victim as herself impelled by
some new fantasy of his crazed intellect he snatched the fatal mantle
and rushed from the chamber and the house

that night a procession passed by torchlight through the streets
bearing in the midst the figure of a woman enveloped with a
richly-embroidered mantle while in advance stalked jervase helwyse
waving the red flag of the pestilence arriving opposite the
province-house the mob burned the effigy and a strong wind came and
swept away the ashes it was said that from that very hour the
pestilence abated as if its sway had some mysterious connection from
the first plague-stroke to the last with lady elcanore's mantle a
remarkable uncertainty broods over that unhappy lady's fate there is
a belief however that in a certain chamber of this mansion a female
form may sometimes be duskily discerned shrinking into the darkest
corner and muffling her face within an embroidered mantle supposing
the legend true can this be other than the once proud lady eleanore

 

mine host and the old loyalist and i bestowed no little warmth of
applause upon this narrative in which we had all been deeply
interested for the reader can scarcely conceive how unspeakably the
effect of such a tale is heightened when as in the present case we
may repose perfect confidence in the veracity of him who tells it for
my own part knowing how scrupulous is mr tiffany to settle the
foundation of his facts i could not have believed him one whit the
more faithfully had he professed himself an eyewitness of the doings
and sufferings of poor lady eleanore some sceptics it is true might
demand documentary evidence or even require him to produce the
embroidered mantle forgetting that heaven be praised it was
consumed to ashes

but now the old loyalist whose blood was warmed by the good cheer
began to talk in his turn about the traditions of the province
house and hinted that he if it were agreeable might add a few
reminiscences to our legendary stock mr tiffany having no cause to
dread a rival immediately besought him to favor us with a specimen
my own entreaties of course were urged to the same effect and our
venerable guest well pleased to find willing auditors awaited only
the return of mr thomas waite who had been summoned forth to provide
accommodations for several new arrivals perchance the public but be
this as its own caprice and ours shall settle the matter may read the
result in another tale of the province house

old esther dudley


our host having resumed the chair he as well as mr tiffany and
myself expressed much eagerness to be made acquainted with the story
to which the loyalist had alluded that venerable man first of all saw
lit to moisten his throat with another glass of wine and then
turning his face toward our coal-fire looked steadfastly for a few
moments into the depths of its cheerful glow finally he poured forth
a great fluency of speech the generous liquid that he had imbibed
while it warmed his age-chilled blood likewise took off the chill
from his heart and mind and gave him an energy to think and feel
which we could hardly have expected to find beneath the snows of
fourscore winters his feelings indeed appeared to me more excitable
than those of a younger man or at least the same degree of feeling
manifested itself by more visible effects than if his judgment and
will had possessed the potency of meridian life at the pathetic
passages of his narrative he readily melted into tears when a breath
of indignation swept across his spirit the blood flushed his withered
visage even to the roots of his white hair and he shook his clinched
fist at the trio of peaceful auditors seeming to fancy enemies in
those who felt very kindly toward the desolate old soul but ever and
anon sometimes in the midst of his most earnest talk this ancient
person's intellect would wander vaguely losing its hold of the matter
in hand and groping for it amid misty shadows then would he cackle
forth a feeble laugh and express a doubt whether his wits for by that
phrase it pleased our ancient friend to signify his mental
powers were not getting a little the worse for wear

under these disadvantages the old loyalist's story required more
revision to render it fit for the public eye than those of the series
which have preceded it nor should it be concealed that the sentiment
and tone of the affair may have undergone some slight or perchance
more than slight metamorphosis in its transmission to the reader
through the medium of a thoroughgoing democrat the tale itself is a
mere sketch with no involution of plot nor any great interest of
events yet possessing if i have rehearsed it aright that pensive
influence over the mind which the shadow of the old province house
flings upon the loiterer in its court-yard

 

the hour had come the hour of defeat and humiliation when sir
william howe was to pass over the threshold of the province-house and
embark with no such triumphal ceremonies as he once promised himself
on board the british fleet he bade his servants and military
attendants go before him and lingered a moment in the loneliness of
the mansion to quell the fierce emotions that struggled in his bosom
as with a death-throb preferable then would he have deemed his fate
had a warrior's death left him a claim to the narrow territory of a
grave within the soil which the king had given him to defend with an
ominous perception that as his departing footsteps echoed adown the
staircase the sway of britain was passing for ever from new england
he smote his clenched hand on his brow and cursed the destiny that had
flung the shame of a dismembered empire upon him

would to god cried he hardly repressing his tears of rage that
the rebels were even now at the doorstep a blood-stain upon the floor
should then bear testimony that the last british ruler was faithful to
his trust

the tremulous voice of a woman replied to his exclamation

heaven's cause and the king's are one it said go forth sir
william howe and trust in heaven to bring back a royal governor in
triumph

subduing at once the passion to which he had yielded only in the faith
that it was unwitnessed sir william howe became conscious that an
aged woman leaning on a gold-headed staff was standing betwixt him and
the door it was old esther dudley who had dwelt almost immemorial
years in this mansion until her presence seemed as inseparable from
it as the recollections of its history she was the daughter of an
ancient and once eminent family which had fallen into poverty and
decay and left its last descendant no resource save the bounty of the
king nor any shelter except within the walls of the province-house
an office in the household with merely nominal duties had been
assigned to her as a pretext for the payment of a small pension the
greater part of which she expended in adorning herself with an antique
magnificence of attire the claims of esther dudley's gentle blood
were acknowledged by all the successive governors and they treated
her with the punctilious courtesy which it was her foible to demand
not always with success from a neglectful world the only actual
share which she assumed in the business of the mansion was to glide
through its passages and public chambers late at night to see that the
servants had dropped no fire from their flaring torches nor left
embers crackling and blazing on the hearths perhaps it was this
invariable custom of walking her rounds in the hush of midnight that
caused the superstition of the times to invest the old woman with
attributes of awe and mystery fabling that she had entered the portal
of the province-house none knew whence in the train of the first
royal governor and that it was her fate to dwell there till the last
should have departed

but sir william howe if he ever heard this legend had forgotten it

mistress dudley why are you loitering here asked he with some
severity of tone it is my pleasure to be the last in this mansion of
the king

not so if it please your excellency answered the time-stricken
woman this roof has sheltered me long i will not pass from it until
they bear me to the tomb of my forefathers what other shelter is
there for old esther dudley save the province-house or the grave

now heaven forgive me said sir william howe to himself i was
about to leave this wretched old creature to starve or beg take
this good mistress dudley he added putting a purse into her hands
king george's head on these golden guineas is sterling yet and will
continue so i warrant you even should the rebels crown john hancock
their king that purse will buy a better shelter than the
province-house can now afford

while the burden of life remains upon me i will have no other shelter
than this roof persisted esther dudley striking her stuff upon the
floor with a gesture that expressed immovable resolve and when your
excellency returns in triumph i will totter into the porch to welcome
you

my poor old friend answered the british general and all his manly
and martial pride could no longer restrain a gush of bitter tears
this is an evil hour for you and me the province which the king
entrusted to my charge is lost i go hence in misfortune perchance in
disgrace to return no more and you whose present being is
incorporated with the past who have seen governor after governor in
stately pageantry ascend these steps whose whole life has been an
observance of majestic ceremonies and a worship of the king how will
you endure the change come with us bid farewell to a land that has
shaken off its allegiance and live still under a royal government at
halifax

never never said the pertinacious old dame here will i abide
and king george shall still have one true subject in his disloyal
province

beshrew the old fool muttered sir william howe growing impatient
of her obstinacy and ashamed of the emotion into which he had been
betrayed she is the very moral of old-fashioned prejudice and could
exist nowhere but in this musty edifice well then mistress dudley
since you will needs tarry i give the province-house in charge to
you take this key and keep it safe until myself or some other royal
governor shall demand it of you smiling bitterly at himself and her
he took the heavy key of the province-house and delivering it into
the old lady's hands drew his clonk around him for departure

as the general glanced back at esther dudley's antique figure he
deemed her well fitted for such a charge as being so perfect a
representative of the decayed past of an age gone by with its
manners opinions faith and feelings all fallen into oblivion or
scorn of what had once been a reality but was now merely a vision of
faded magnificence then sir william howe strode forth smiting his
clenched hands together in the fierce anguish of his spirit and old
esther dudley was left to keep watch in the lonely province-house
dwelling there with memory and if hope ever seemed to flit around
her still it was memory in disguise

the total change of affairs that ensued on the departure of the
british troops did not drive the venerable lady from her stronghold
there was not for many years afterward a governor of massachusetts
and the magistrates who had charge of such matters saw no objection to
esther dudley's residence in the province-house especially as they
must otherwise have paid a hireling for taking care of the premises
which with her was a labor of love and so they left her the
undisturbed mistress of the old historic edifice many and strange
were the fables which the gossips whispered about her in all the
chimney-corners of the town

among the time-worn articles of furniture that had been left in the
mansion there was a tall antique mirror which was well worthy of a
tale by itself and perhaps may hereafter be the theme of one the
gold of its heavily-wrought frame was tarnished and its surface so
blurred that the old woman's figure whenever she paused before it
looked indistinct and ghostlike but it was the general belief that
esther could cause the governors of the overthrown dynasty with the
beautiful ladies who had once adorned their festivals the indian
chiefs who had come up to the province-house to hold council or swear
allegiance the grim provincial warriors the severe clergymen in
short all the pageantry of gone days all the figures that ever swept
across the broad-plate of glass in former times she could cause the
whole to reappear and people the inner world of the mirror with
shadows of old life such legends as these together with the
singularity of her isolated existence her age and the infirmity that
each added winter flung upon her made mistress dudley the object both
of fear and pity and it was partly the result of either sentiment
that amid all the angry license of the times neither wrong nor
insult ever fell upon her unprotected head indeed there was so much
haughtiness in her demeanor toward intruders among whom she reckoned
all persons acting under the new authorities that it was really an
affair of no small nerve to look her in the face and to do the
people justice stern republicans as they had now become they were
well content that the old gentlewoman in her hoop-petticoat and faded
embroidery should still haunt the palace of ruined pride and
overthrown power the symbol of a departed system embodying a history
in her person so esther dudley dwelt year after year in the
province-house still reverencing all that others had flung aside
still faithful to her king who so long as the venerable dame yet
held her post might be said to retain one true subject in new england
and one spot of the empire that had been wrested from him

and did she dwell there in utter loneliness rumor said not so
whenever her chill and withered heart desired warmth she was wont to
summon a black slave of governor shirley's from the blurred mirror and
send him in search of guests who had long ago been familiar in those
deserted chambers forth went the sable messenger with the starlight
or the moonshine gleaming through him and did his errand in the
burial-grounds knocking at the iron doors of tombs or upon the marble
slabs that covered them and whispering to those within my mistress
old esther dudley bids you to the province-house at midnight and
punctually as the clock of the old south told twelve came the shadows
of the olivers the hutchinsons the dudleys all the grandees of a
bygone generation gliding beneath the portal into the well-known
mansion where esther mingled with them as if she likewise were a
shade without vouching for the truth of such traditions it is
certain that mistress dudley sometimes assembled a few of the stanch
though crestfallen old tories who had lingered in the rebel town
during those days of wrath and tribulation out of a cobwebbed bottle
containing liquor that a royal governor might have smacked his lips
over they quaffed healths to the king and babbled treason to the
republic feeling as if the protecting shadow of the throne were still
flung around them but draining the last drops of their liquor they
stole timorously homeward and answered not again if the rude mob
reviled them in the street

yet esther dudley's most frequent and favored guests were the children
of the town toward them she was never stern a kindly and loving
nature hindered elsewhere from its free course by a thousand rocky
prejudices lavished itself upon these little ones by bribes of
gingerbread of her own making stamped with a royal crown she tempted
their sunny sportiveness beneath the gloomy portal of the
province-house and would often beguile them to spend a whole play-day
there sitting in a circle round the verge of her hoop-petticoat
greedily attentive to her stories of a dead world and when these
little boys and girls stole forth again from the dark mysterious
mansion they went bewildered full of old feelings that graver people
had long ago forgotten rubbing their eyes at the world around them as
if they had gone astray into ancient times and become children of the
past at home when their parents asked where they had loitered such a
weary while and with whom they had been at play the children would
talk of all the departed worthies of the province as far back as
governor belcher and the haughty dame of sir william phipps it would
seem as though they had been sitting on the knees of these famous
personages whom the grave had hidden for half a century and had
toyed with the embroidery of their rich waistcoats or roguishly pulled
the long curls of their flowing wigs but governor belcher has been
dead this many a year would the mother say to her little boy and
did you really see him at the province-house oh yes dear
mother yes the half-dreaming child would answer but when old
esther had done speaking about him he faded away out of his chair
thus without affrighting her little guests she led them by the hand
into the chambers of her own desolate heart and made childhood's fancy
discern the ghosts that haunted there

living so continually in her own circle of ideas and never regulating
her mind by a proper reference to present things esther dudley
appears to have grown partially crazed it was found that she had no
right sense of the progress and true state of the revolutionary war
but held a constant faith that the armies of britain were victorious
on every field and destined to be ultimately triumphant whenever the
town rejoiced for a battle won by washington or gates or morgan or
greene the news in passing through the door of the province-house as
through the ivory gate of dreams became metamorphosed into a strange
tale of the prowess of howe clinton or cornwallis sooner or later
it was her invincible belief the colonies would be prostrate at the
footstool of the king sometimes she seemed to take for granted that
such was already the case on one occasion she startled the
townspeople by a brilliant illumination of the province-house with
candles at every pane of glass and a transparency of the king's
initials and a crown of light in the great balcony-window the figure
of the aged woman in the most gorgeous of her mildewed velvets and
brocades was seen passing from casement to casement until she paused
before the balcony and flourished a huge key above her head her
wrinkled visage actually gleamed with triumph as if the soul within
her were a festal lamp

what means this blaze of light what does old esther's joy portend
whispered a spectator it is frightful to see her gliding about the
chambers and rejoicing there without a soul to bear her company

it is as if she were making merry in a tomb said another

pshaw it is no such mystery observed an old man after some brief
exercise of memory mistress dudley is keeping jubilee for the king
of england's birthday

then the people laughed aloud and would have thrown mud against the
blazing transparency of the king's crown and initials only that they
pitied the poor old dame who was so dismally triumphant amid the wreck
and ruin of the system to which she appertained

oftentimes it was her custom to climb the weary staircase that wound
upward to the cupola and thence strain her dimmed eyesight seaward
and countryward watching for a british fleet or for the march of a
grand procession with the king's banner floating over it the
passengers in the street below would discern her anxious visage and
send up a shout when the golden indian on the province-house shall
shoot his arrow and when the cock on the old south spire shall crow
then look for a royal governor again for this had grown a by-word
through the town and at last after long long years old esther
dudley knew or perchance she only dreamed that a royal governor was
on the eve of returning to the province-house to receive the heavy key
which sir william howe had committed to her charge now it was the
fact that intelligence bearing some faint analogy to esther's version
of it was current among the townspeople she set the mansion in the
best order that her means allowed and arraying herself in silks and
tarnished gold stood long before the blurred mirror to admire her own
magnificence as she gazed the gray and withered lady moved her ashen
lips murmuring half aloud talking to shapes that she saw within the
mirror to shadows of her own fantasies to the household friends of
memory and bidding them rejoice with her and come forth to meet the
governor and while absorbed in this communion mistress dudley heard
the tramp of many footsteps in the street and looking out at the
window beheld what she construed as the royal governor's arrival

oh happy day oh blessed blessed hour she exclaimed let me but
bid him welcome within the portal and my task in the province-house
and on earth is done then with tottering feet which age and
tremulous joy caused to tread amiss she hurried down the grand
staircase her silks sweeping and rustling as she went so that the
sound was as if a train of special courtiers were thronging from the
dim mirror

and esther dudley fancied that as soon as the wide door should be
flung open all the pomp and splendor of bygone times would pace
majestically into the province-house and the gilded tapestry of the
past would be brightened by the sunshine of the present she turned
the key withdrew it from the lock unclosed the door and stepped
across the threshold advancing up the court-yard appeared a person of
most dignified mien with tokens as esther interpreted them of
gentle blood high rank and long-accustomed authority even in his walk
and every gesture he was richly dressed but wore a gouty shoe
which however did not lessen the stateliness of his gait around and
behind him were people in plain civic dresses and two or three
war-worn veterans evidently officers of rank arrayed in a uniform of
blue and buff but esther dudley firm in the belief that had fastened
its roots about her heart beheld only the principal personage and
never doubted that this was the long-looked-for governor to whom she
was to surrender up her charge as he approached she involuntarily
sank down on her knees and tremblingly held forth the heavy key

receive my trust take it quickly cried she for methinks death is
striving to snatch away my triumph but he conies too late thank
heaven for this blessed hour god save king george

that madam is a strange prayer to be offered up at such a moment
replied the unknown guest of the province-house and courteously
removing his hat he offered his arm to raise the aged woman yet in
reverence for your gray hairs and long-kept faith heaven forbid that
any here should say you nay over the realms which still acknowledge
his sceptre god save king george

esther dudley started to her feet and hastily clutching back the
key gazed with fearful earnestness at the stranger and dimly and
doubtfully as if suddenly awakened from a dream her bewildered eyes
half recognized his face years ago she had known him among the gentry
of the province but the ban of the king had fallen upon him how
then came the doomed victim here proscribed excluded from mercy
the monarch's most dreaded and hated foe this new england merchant
had stood triumphantly against a kingdom's strength and his foot now
trod upon humbled royalty as he ascended the steps of the
province-house the people's chosen governor of massachusetts

wretch wretch that i am muttered the old woman with such a
heartbroken expression that the tears gushed from the stranger's eyes
have i bidden a traitor welcome come death come quickly

alas venerable lady said governor hancock lending her his support
with all the reverence that a courtier would have shown to a queen
your life has been prolonged until the world has changed around you
you have treasured up all that time has rendered worthless the
principles feelings manners modes of being and acting which another
generation has flung aside and you are a symbol of the past and i
and these around me we represent a new race of men living no longer
in the past scarcely in the present but projecting our lives forward
into the future ceasing to model ourselves on ancestral superstitions
it is our faith and principle to press onward onward yet continued
he turning to his attendants let us reverence for the last time the
stately and gorgeous prejudices of the tottering past

while the republican governor spoke he had continued to support the
helpless form of esther dudley her weight grew heavier against his
arm but at last with a sudden effort to free herself the ancient
woman sank down beside one of the pillars of the portal the key of
the province-house fell from her grasp and clanked against the stone

i have been faithful unto death murmured she god save the king

she hath done her office said hancock solemnly we will follow her
reverently to the tomb of her ancestors and then my fellow-citizens
onward onward we are no longer children of the past



as the old loyalist concluded his narrative the enthusiasm which had
been fitfully flashing within his sunken eyes and quivering across his
wrinkled visage faded away as if all the lingering fire of his soul
were extinguished just then too a lamp upon the mantelpiece threw
out a dying gleam which vanished as speedily as it shot upward
compelling our eyes to grope for one another's features by the dim
glow of the hearth with such a lingering fire methought with such a
dying gleam had the glory of the ancient system vanished from the
province-house when the spirit of old esther dudley took its flight
and now again the clock of the old south threw its voice of ages on
the breeze knolling the hourly knell of the past crying out far and
wide through the multitudinous city and filling our ears as we sat
in the dusky chamber with its reverberating depth of tone in that
same mansion in that very chamber what a volume of history had been
told off into hours by the same voice that was now trembling in the
air many a governor had heard those midnight accents and longed to
exchange his stately cares for slumber and as for mine host and mr
bela tiffany and the old loyalist and me we had babbled about dreams
of the past until we almost fancied that the clock was still striking
in a bygone century neither of us would have wondered had a
hoop-petticoated phantom of esther dudley tottered into the chamber
walking her rounds in the hush of midnight as of yore and motioned us
to quench the fading embers of the fire and leave the historic
precincts to herself and her kindred shades but as no such vision
was vouchsafed i retired unbidden and would advise mr tiffany to
lay hold of another auditor being resolved not to show my face in the
province house for a good while hence if ever




the haunted mind


what a singular moment is the first one when you have hardly begun to
recollect yourself after starting from midnight slumber by unclosing
your eyes so suddenly you seem to have surprised the personages of
your dream in full convocation round your bed and catch one broad
glance at them before they can flit into obscurity or to vary the
metaphor you find yourself for a single instant wide awake in that
realm of illusions whither sleep has been the passport and behold its
ghostly inhabitants and wondrous scenery with a perception of their
strangeness such as you never attain while the dream is undisturbed
the distant sound of a church-clock is borne faintly on the wind you
question with yourself half seriously whether it has stolen to your
waking ear from some gray tower that stood within the precincts of
your dream while yet in suspense another clock flings its heavy clang
over the slumbering town with so full and distinct a sound and such a
long murmur in the neighboring air that you are certain it must
proceed from the steeple at the nearest corner you count the
strokes one two and there they cease with a booming sound like the
gathering of a third stroke within the bell

if you could choose an hour of wakefulness out of the whole night it
would be this since your sober bedtime at eleven you have had rest
enough to take off the pressure of yesterday's fatigue while before
you till the sun comes from far cathay to brighten your window
there is almost the space of a summer night one hour to be spent in
thought with the mind's eye half shut and two in pleasant dreams and
two in that strangest of enjoyments the forgetfulness alike of joy and
woe the moment of rising belongs to another period of time and
appears so distant that the plunge out of a warm bed into the frosty
air cannot yet be anticipated with dismay yesterday has already
vanished among the shadows of the past to-morrow has not yet emerged
from the future you have found an intermediate space where the
business of life does not intrude where the passing moment lingers
and becomes truly the present a spot where father time when he
thinks nobody is watching him sits down by the wayside to take
breath oh that he would fall asleep and let mortals live on without
growing older

hitherto you have lain perfectly still because the slightest motion
would dissipate the fragments of your slumber now being irrevocably
awake you peep through the half-drawn window-curtain and observe
that the glass is ornamented with fanciful devices in frost-work and
that each pane presents something like a frozen dream there will be
time enough to trace out the analogy while waiting the summons to
breakfast seen through the clear portion of the glass where the
silvery mountain-peaks of the frost-scenery do not ascend the most
conspicuous object is the steeple the white spire of which directs
you to the wintry lustre of the firmament you may almost distinguish
the figures on the clock that has just told the hour such a frosty
sky and the snow-covered roofs and the long vista of the frozen
street all white and the distant water hardened into rock might
make you shiver even under four blankets and a woollen comforter yet
look at that one glorious star its beams are distinguishable from all
the rest and actually cast the shadow of the casement on the bed with
a radiance of deeper hue than moonlight though not so accurate an
outline

you sink down and muffle your head in the clothes shivering all the
while but less from bodily chill than the bare idea of a polar
atmosphere it is too cold even for the thoughts to venture abroad
you speculate on the luxury of wearing out a whole existence in bed
like an oyster in its shell content with the sluggish ecstasy of
inaction and drowsily conscious of nothing but delicious warmth such
as you now feel again ah that idea has brought a hideous one in its
train you think how the dead are lying in their cold shrouds and
narrow coffins through the drear winter of the grave and cannot
persuade your fancy that they neither shrink nor shiver when the snow
is drifting over their little hillocks and the bitter blast howls
against the door of the tomb that gloomy thought will collect a
gloomy multitude and throw its complexion over your wakeful hour

in the depths of every heart there is a tomb and a dungeon though the
lights the music and revelry above may cause us to forget their
existence and the buried ones or prisoners whom they hide but
sometimes and oftenest at midnight those dark receptacles are flung
wide open in an hour like this when the mind has a passive
sensibility but no active strength when the imagination is a mirror
imparting vividness to all ideas without the power of selecting or
controlling them then pray that your griefs may slumber and the
brotherhood of remorse not break their chain it is too late a
funeral train comes gliding by your bed in which passion and feeling
assume bodily shape and things of the mind become dim spectres to the
eye there is your earliest sorrow a pale young mourner wearing a
sister's likeness to first love sadly beautiful with a hallowed
sweetness in her melancholy features and grace in the flow of her
sable robe next appears a shade of ruined loveliness with dust among
her golden hair and her bright garments all faded and defaced
stealing from your glance with drooping head as fearful of reproach
she was your fondest hope but a delusive one so call her
disappointment now a sterner form succeeds with a brow of wrinkles
a look and gesture of iron authority there is no name for him unless
it be fatality an emblem of the evil influence that rules your
fortunes a demon to whom you subjected yourself by some error at the
outset of life and were bound his slave for ever by once obeying him
see those fiendish lineaments graven on the darkness the writhed lip
of scorn the mockery of that living eye the pointed finger touching
the sore place in your heart do you remember any act of enormous
folly at which you would blush even in the remotest cavern of the
earth then recognize your shame

pass wretched band well for the wakeful one if riotously miserable
a fiercer tribe do not surround him the devils of a guilty heart that
holds its hell within itself what if remorse should assume the
features of an injured friend what if the fiend should come in
woman's garments with a pale beauty amid sin and desolation and lie
down by your side what if he should stand at your bed's foot in the
likeness of a corpse with a bloody stain upon the shroud sufficient
without such guilt is this nightmare of the soul this heavy heavy
sinking of the spirits this wintry gloom about the heart this
indistinct horror of the mind blending itself with the darkness of the
chamber

by a desperate effort you start upright breaking from a sort of
conscious sleep and gazing wildly round the bed as if the fiends were
anywhere but in your haunted mind at the same moment the slumbering
embers on the hearth send forth a gleam which palely illuminates the
whole outer room and flickers through the door of the bedchamber but
cannot quite dispel its obscurity your eye searches for whatever may
remind you of the living world with eager minuteness you take note of
the table near the fireplace the book with an ivory knife between its
leaves the unfolded letter the hat and the fallen glove soon the
flame vanishes and with it the whole scene is gone though its image
remains an instant in your mind's eye when darkness has swallowed the
reality throughout the chamber there is the same obscurity as before
but not the same gloom within your breast

as your head falls back upon the pillow you think in a whisper be it
spoken how pleasant in these night solitudes would be the rise and
fall of a softer breathing than your own the slight pressure of a
tenderer bosom the quiet throb of a purer heart imparting its
peacefulness to your troubled one as if the fond sleeper were
involving you in her dream her influence is over you though she have
no existence but in that momentary image you sink down in a flowery
spot on the borders of sleep and wakefulness while your thoughts rise
before you in pictures all disconnected yet all assimilated by a
pervading gladsomeness and beauty the wheeling of gorgeous squadrons
that glitter in the sun is succeeded by the merriment of children
round the door of a schoolhouse beneath the glimmering shadow of old
trees at the corner of a rustic lane you stand in the sunny rain of a
summer shower and wander among the sunny trees of an autumnal wood
and look upward at the brightest of all rainbows overarching the
unbroken sheet of snow on the american side of niagara your mind
struggles pleasantly between the dancing radiance round the hearth of
a young man and his recent bride and the twittering flight of birds in
spring about their new-made nest you feel the merry bounding of a
ship before the breeze and watch the tuneful feet of rosy girls as
they twine their last and merriest dance in a splendid ball-room and
find yourself in the brilliant circle of a crowded theatre as the
curtain falls over a light and airy scene

with an involuntary start you seize hold on consciousness and prove
yourself but half awake by running a doubtful parallel between human
life and the hour which has now elapsed in both you emerge from
mystery pass through a vicissitude that you can but imperfectly
control and are borne onward to another mystery now comes the peal
of the distant clock with fainter and fainter strokes as you plunge
farther into the wilderness of sleep it is the knell of a temporary
death your spirit has departed and strays like a free citizen among
the people of a shadowy world beholding strange sights yet without
wonder or dismay so calm perhaps will be the final change so
undisturbed as if among familiar things the entrance of the soul to
its eternal home




the village uncle

an imaginary retrospect


come another log upon the hearth true our little parlor is
comfortable especially here where the old man sits in his old
arm-chair but on thanksgiving-night the blaze should dance higher up
the chimney and send a shower of sparks into the outer darkness toss
on an armful of those dry oak chips the last relicts of the mermaid's
knee-timbers the bones of your namesake susan higher yet and
clearer be the blaze till our cottage windows glow the ruddiest in
the village and the light of our household mirth flash far across the
bay to nahant

and now come susan come my children draw your chairs round me all
of you there is a dimness over your figures you sit quivering
indistinctly with each motion of the blaze which eddies about you
like a flood so that you all have the look of visions or people that
dwell only in the firelight and will vanish from existence as
completely as your own shadows when the flame shall sink among the
embers

hark let me listen for the swell of the surf it should be audible a
mile inland on a night like this yes there i catch the sound but
only an uncertain murmur as if a good way down over the beach though
by the almanac it is high tide at eight o'clock and the billows must
now be dashing within thirty yards of our door ah the old man's ears
are failing him and so is his eyesight and perhaps his mind else
you would not all be so shadowy in the blaze of his thanksgiving fire

how strangely the past is peeping over the shoulders of the present
to judge by my recollections it is but a few moments since i sat in
another room yonder model of a vessel was not there nor the old
chest of drawers nor susan's profile and mine in that gilt
frame nothing in short except this same fire which glimmered on
books papers and a picture and half discovered my solitary figure in
a looking-glass but it was paler than my rugged old self and
younger too by almost half a century

speak to me susan speak my beloved ones for the scene is
glimmering on my sight again and as it brightens you fade away oh i
should be loth to lose my treasure of past happiness and become once
more what i was then a hermit in the depths of my own mind
sometimes yawning over drowsy volumes and anon a scribbler of wearier
trash than what i read a man who had wandered out of the real world
and got into its shadow where his troubles joys and vicissitudes
were of such slight stuff that he hardly knew whether he lived or only
dreamed of living thank heaven i am an old man now and have done with
all such vanities

still this dimness of mine eyes come nearer susan and stand before
the fullest blaze of the hearth now i behold you illuminated from
head to foot in your clean cap and decent gown with the dear lock of
gray hair across your forehead and a quiet smile about your mouth
while the eyes alone are concealed by the red gleam of the fire upon
your spectacles there you made me tremble again when the flame
quivered my sweet susan you quivered with it and grew indistinct as
if melting into the warm light that my last glimpse of you might be
as visionary as the first was full many a year since do you remember
it you stood on the little bridge over the brook that runs across
king's beach into the sea it was twilight the waves rolling in the
wind sweeping by the crimson clouds fading in the west and the silver
moon brightening above the hill and on the bridge were you
fluttering in the breeze like a sea-bird that might skim away at your
pleasure you seemed a daughter of the viewless wind a creature of
the ocean-foam and the crimson light whose merry life was spent in
dancing on the crests of the billows that threw up their spray to
support your footsteps as i drew nearer i fancied you akin to the
race of mermaids and thought how pleasant it would be to dwell with
you among the quiet coves in the shadow of the cliffs and to roam
along secluded beaches of the purest sand and when our northern
shores grew bleak to haunt the islands green and lonely far amid
summer seas and yet it gladdened me after all this nonsense to find
you nothing but a pretty young girl sadly perplexed with the rude
behavior of the wind about your petticoats thus i did with susan as
with most other things in my earlier days dipping her image into my
mind and coloring it of a thousand fantastic hues before i could see
her as she really was

now susan for a sober picture of our village it was a small
collection of dwellings that seemed to have been cast up by the sea
with the rock-weed and marine plants that it vomits after a storm or
to have come ashore among the pipe-staves and other lumber which had
been washed from the deck of an eastern schooner there was just space
for the narrow and sandy street between the beach in front and a
precipitous hill that lifted its rocky forehead in the rear among a
waste of juniper-bushes and the wild growth of a broken pasture the
village was picturesque in the variety of its edifices though all
were rude here stood a little old hovel built perhaps of
driftwood there a row of boat-houses and beyond them a two-story
dwelling of dark and weatherbeaten aspect the whole intermixed with
one or two snug cottages painted white a sufficiency of pig-styes and
a shoemaker's shop two grocery stores stood opposite each other in
the centre of the village these were the places of resort at their
idle hours of a hardy throng of fishermen in red baize shirts
oilcloth trousers and boots of brown leather covering the whole
leg true seven-league boots but fitter to wade the ocean than walk
the earth the wearers seemed amphibious as if they did but creep out
of salt water to sun themselves nor would it have been wonderful to
see their lower limbs covered with clusters of little shellfish such
as cling to rocks and old ship-timber over which the tide ebbs and
flows when their fleet of boats was weather-bound the butchers
raised their price and the spit was busier than the frying-pan for
this was a place of fish and known as such to all the country round
about the very air was fishy being perfumed with dead sculpins
hard-heads and dogfish strewn plentifully on the beach you see
children the village is but little changed since your mother and i
were young

how like a dream it was when i bent over a pool of water one pleasant
morning and saw that the ocean had dashed its spray over me and made
me a fisherman there was the tarpaulin the baize shirt the oilcloth
trousers and seven-league boots and there my own features but so
reddened with sunburn and sea-breezes that methought i had another
face and on other shoulders too the seagulls and the loons and i had
now all one trade we skimmed the crested waves and sought our prey
beneath them the man with as keen enjoyment as the birds always when
the east grew purple i launched my dory my little flat-bottomed
skiff and rowed cross-handed to point ledge the middle ledge or
perhaps beyond egg rock often too did i anchor off dread ledge a
spot of peril to ships unpiloted and sometimes spread an adventurous
sail and tracked across the bay to south shore casting my lines in
sight of scituate ere nightfall i hauled my skiff high and dry on the
beach laden with red rock-cod or the white-bellied ones of deep
water haddock bearing the black marks of st peter's fingers near the
gills the long-bearded hake whose liver holds oil enough for a
midnight lamp and now and then a mighty halibut with a back broad as
my boat in the autumn i toled and caught those lovely fish the
mackerel when the wind was high when the whale-boats anchored off
the point nodded their slender masts at each other and the dories
pitched and tossed in the surf when nahant beach was thundering three
miles off and the spray broke a hundred feet in the air round the
distant base of egg rock when the brimful and boisterous sea
threatened to tumble over the street of our village then i made a
holiday on shore

many such a day did i sit snugly in mr bartlett's store attentive to
the yarns of uncle parker uncle to the whole village by right of
seniority but of southern blood with no kindred in new england his
figure is before me now enthroned upon a mackerel-barrel a lean old
man of great height but bent with years and twisted into an uncouth
shape by seven broken limbs furrowed also and weatherworn as if
every gale for the better part of a century had caught him somewhere
on the sea he looked like a harbinger of tempest a shipmate of the
flying dutchman after innumerable voyages aboard men-of-war and
merchantmen fishing-schooners and chebacco-boats the old salt had
become master of a hand-cart which he daily trundled about the
vicinity and sometimes blew his fish-horn through the streets of
salem one of uncle parker's eyes had been blown out with gunpowder
and the other did but glimmer in its socket turning it upward as he
spoke it was his delight to tell of cruises against the french and
battles with his own shipmates when he and an antagonist used to be
seated astride of a sailor's chest each fastened down by a spike-nail
through his trousers and there to fight it out sometimes he
expatiated on the delicious flavor of the hagden a greasy and
goose-like fowl which the sailors catch with hook and line on the
grand banks he dwelt with rapture on an interminable winter at the
isle of sables where he had gladdened himself amid polar snows with
the rum and sugar saved from the wreck of a west india schooner and
wrathfully did he shake his fist as he related how a party of cape cod
men had robbed him and his companions of their lawful spoils and
sailed away with every keg of old jamaica leaving him not a drop to
drown his sorrow villains they were and of that wicked brotherhood
who are said to tie lanterns to horses tails to mislead the mariner
along the dangerous shores of the cape

even now i seem to see the group of fishermen with that old salt in
the midst one fellow sits on the counter a second bestrides an
oil-barrel a third lolls at his length on a parcel of new cod-lines
and another has planted the tarry seat of his trousers on a heap of
salt which will shortly be sprinkled over a lot of fish they are a
likely set of men some have voyaged to the east indies or the
pacific and most of them have sailed in marblehead schooners to
newfoundland a few have been no farther than the middle banks and
one or two have always fished along the shore but as uncle parker
used to say they have all been christened in salt water and know more
than men ever learn in the bushes a curious figure by way of
contrast is a fish-dealer from far up-country listening with eyes
wide open to narratives that might startle sinbad the sailor be it
well with you my brethren ye are all gone some to your graves
ashore and others to the depths of ocean but my faith is strong that
ye are happy for whenever i behold your forms whether in dream or
vision each departed friend is puffing his long nine and a mug of
the right blackstrap goes round from lip to lip

but where was the mermaid in those delightful times at a certain
window near the centre of the village appeared a pretty display of
gingerbread men and horses picture-books and ballads small
fish-hooks pins needles sugarplums and brass thimbles articles on
which the young fishermen used to expend their money from pure
gallantry what a picture was susan behind the counter a slender
maiden though the child of rugged parents she had the slimmest of
all waists brown hair curling on her neck and a complexion rather
pale except when the sea-breeze flushed it a few freckles became
beauty-spots beneath her eyelids how was it susan that you talked
and acted so carelessly yet always for the best doing whatever was
right in your own eyes and never once doing wrong in mine nor
shocked a taste that had been morbidly sensitive till now and whence
had you that happiest gift of brightening every topic with an unsought
gayety quiet but irresistible so that even gloomy spirits felt your
sunshine and did not shrink from it nature wrought the charm she
made you a frank simple kind-hearted sensible and mirthful girl
obeying nature you did free things without indelicacy displayed a
maiden's thoughts to every eye and proved yourself as innocent as
naked eve it was beautiful to observe how her simple and happy
nature mingled itself with mine she kindled a domestic fire within my
heart and took up her dwelling there even in that chill and lonesome
cavern hung round with glittering icicles of fancy she gave me warmth
of feeling while the influence of my mind made her contemplative i
taught her to love the moonlight hour when the expanse of the
encircled bay was smooth as a great mirror and slept in a transparent
shadow while beyond nahant the wind rippled the dim ocean into a
dreamy brightness which grew faint afar off without becoming gloomier
i held her hand and pointed to the long surf-wave as it rolled calmly
on the beach in an unbroken line of silver we were silent together
till its deep and peaceful murmur had swept by us when the sabbath
sun shone down into the recesses of the cliffs i led the mermaid
thither and told her that those huge gray shattered rocks and her
native sea that raged for ever like a storm against them and her own
slender beauty in so stern a scene were all combined into a strain of
poetry but on the sabbath-eve when her mother had gone early to bed
and her gentle sister had smiled and left us as we sat alone by the
quiet hearth with household things around it was her turn to make me
feel that here was a deeper poetry and that this was the dearest hour
of all thus went on our wooing till i had shot wild-fowl enough to
feather our bridal-bed and the daughter of the sea was mine

i built a cottage for susan and myself and made a gateway in the form
of a gothic arch by setting up a whale's jaw-bones we bought a heifer
with her first calf and had a little garden on the hillside to supply
us with potatoes and green sauce for our fish our parlor small and
neat was ornamented with our two profiles in one gilt frame and with
shells and pretty pebbles on the mantelpiece selected from the sea's
treasury of such things on nahant beach on the desk beneath the
looking-glass lay the bible which i had begun to read aloud at the
book of genesis and the singing-book that susan used for her evening
psalm except the almanac we had no other literature all that i
heard of books was when an indian history or tale of shipwreck was
sold by a pedler or wandering subscription-man to some one in the
village and read through its owner's nose to a slumbrous auditory

like my brother-fishermen i grew into the belief that all human
erudition was collected in our pedagogue whose green spectacles and
solemn phiz as he passed to his little schoolhouse amid a waste of
sand might have gained him a diploma from any college in new england
in truth i dreaded him when our children were old enough to claim
his care you remember susan how i frowned though you were pleased
at this learned man's encomiums on their proficiency i feared to
trust them even with the alphabet it was the key to a fatal treasure
but i loved to lead them by their little hands along the beach and
point to nature in the vast and the minute the sky the sea the
green earth the pebbles and the shells then did i discourse of the
mighty works and coextensive goodness of the deity with the simple
wisdom of a man whose mind had profited by lonely days upon the deep
and his heart by the strong and pure affections of his evening home
sometimes my voice lost itself in a tremulous depth for i felt his
eye upon me as i spoke once while my wife and all of us were gazing
at ourselves in the mirror left by the tide in a hollow of the sand i
pointed to the pictured heaven below and bade her observe how religion
was strewn everywhere in our path since even a casual pool of water
recalled the idea of that home whither we were travelling to rest for
ever with our children suddenly your image susan and all the little
faces made up of yours and mine seemed to fade away and vanish around
me leaving a pale visage like my own of former days within the frame
of a large looking-glass strange illusion

my life glided on the past appearing to mingle with the present and
absorb the future till the whole lies before me at a glance my
manhood has long been waning with a stanch decay my earlier
contemporaries after lives of unbroken health are all at rest
without having known the weariness of later age and now with a
wrinkled forehead and thin white hair as badges of my dignity i have
become the patriarch the uncle of the village i love that name it
widens the circle of my sympathies it joins all the youthful to my
household in the kindred of affection

like uncle parker whose rheumatic bones were dashed against egg rock
full forty years ago i am a spinner of long yarns seated on the
gunnel of a dory or on the sunny side of a boat-house where the
warmth is grateful to my limbs or by my own hearth when a friend or
two are there i overflow with talk and yet am never tedious with a
broken voice i give utterance to much wisdom such heaven be praised
is the vigor of my faculties that many a forgotten usage and
traditions ancient in my youth and early adventures of myself or
others hitherto effaced by things more recent acquire new
distinctness in my memory i remember the happy days when the haddock
were more numerous on all the fishing-grounds than sculpins in the
surf when the deep-water cod swam close in-shore and the dogfish
with his poisonous horn had not learnt to take the hook i can number
every equinoctial storm in which the sea has overwhelmed the street
flooded the cellars of the village and hissed upon our kitchen hearth
i give the history of the great whale that was landed on whale beach
and whose jaws being now my gateway will last for ages after my
coffin shall have passed beneath them thence it is an easy digression
to the halibut scarcely smaller than the whale which ran out six
codlines and hauled my dory to the mouth of boston harbor before i
could touch him with the gaff

if melancholy accidents be the theme of conversation i tell how a
friend of mine was taken out of his boat by an enormous shark and the
sad true tale of a young man on the eve of marriage who had been nine
days missing when his drowned body floated into the very pathway on
marble-head neck that had often led him to the dwelling of his bride
as if the dripping corpse would have come where the mourner was with
such awful fidelity did that lover return to fulfil his vows another
favorite story is of a crazy maiden who conversed with angels and had
the gift of prophecy and whom all the village loved and pitied
though she went from door to door accusing us of sin exhorting to
repentance and foretelling our destruction by flood or earthquake if
the young men boast their knowledge of the ledges and sunken rocks i
speak of pilots who knew the wind by its scent and the wave by its
taste and could have steered blindfold to any port between boston and
mount desert guided only by the rote of the shore the peculiar sound
of the surf on each island beach and line of rocks along the coast
thus do i talk and all my auditors grow wise while they deem it
pastime

i recollect no happier portion of my life than this my calm old age
it is like the sunny and sheltered slope of a valley where late in the
autumn the grass is greener than in august and intermixed with golden
dandelions that had not been seen till now since the first warmth of
the year but with me the verdure and the flowers are not frost-bitten
in the midst of winter a playfulness has revisited my mind a
sympathy with the young and gay an unpainful interest in the business
of others a light and wandering curiosity arising perhaps from the
sense that my toil on earth is ended and the brief hour till bedtime
may be spent in play still i have fancied that there is a depth of
feeling and reflection under this superficial levity peculiar to one
who has lived long and is soon to die

show me anything that would make an infant smile and you shall behold
a gleam of mirth over the hoary ruin of my visage i can spend a
pleasant hour in the sun watching the sports of the village children
on the edge of the surf now they chase the retreating wave far down
over the wet sand now it steals softly up to kiss their naked feet
now it comes onward with threatening front and roars after the
laughing crew as they scamper beyond its reach why should not an old
man be merry too when the great sea is at play with those little
children i delight also to follow in the wake of a pleasure-party
of young men and girls strolling along the beach after an early supper
at the point here with handkerchiefs at nose they bend over a heap
of eel-grass entangled in which is a dead skate so oddly accoutred
with two legs and a long tail that they mistake him for a drowned
animal a few steps farther the ladies scream and the gentlemen make
ready to protect them against a young shark of the dogfish kind
rolling with a lifelike motion in the tide that has thrown him up
next they are smit with wonder at the black shells of a wagon-load of
live lobsters packed in rock-weed for the country-market and when
they reach the fleet of dories just hauled ashore after the day's
fishing how do i laugh in my sleeve and sometimes roar outright at
the simplicity of these young folks and the sly humor of the
fishermen in winter when our village is thrown into a bustle by the
arrival of perhaps a score of country dealers bargaining for frozen
fish to be transported hundreds of miles and eaten fresh in vermont or
canada i am a pleased but idle spectator in the throng for i launch
my boat no more

when the shore was solitary i have found a pleasure that seemed even
to exalt my mind in observing the sports or contentions of two gulls
as they wheeled and hovered about each other with hoarse screams one
moment flapping on the foam of the wave and then soaring aloft till
their white bosoms melted into the upper sunshine in the calm of the
summer sunset i drag my aged limbs with a little ostentation of
activity because i am so old up to the rocky brow of the hill there
i see the white sails of many a vessel outward bound or homeward from
afar and the black trail of a vapor behind the eastern steamboat
there too is the sun going down but not in gloom and there the
illimitable ocean mingling with the sky to remind me of eternity

but sweetest of all is the hour of cheerful musing and pleasant talk
that comes between the dusk and the lighted candle by my glowing
fireside and never even on the first thanksgiving-night when susan
and i sat alone with our hopes nor the second when a stranger had
been sent to gladden us and be the visible image of our affection did
i feel such joy as now all that belongs to me are here death has
taken none nor disease kept them away nor strife divided them from
their parents or each other with neither poverty nor riches to
disturb them nor the misery of desires beyond their lot they have
kept new england's festival round the patriarch's board for i am a
patriarch here i sit among my descendants in my old arm-chair and
immemorial corner while the firelight throws an appropriate glory
round my venerable frame susan my children something whispers me
that this happiest hour must be the final one and that nothing
remains but to bless you all and depart with a treasure of recollected
joys to heaven will you meet me there alas your figures grow
indistinct fading into pictures on the air and now to fainter
outlines while the fire is glimmering on the walls of a familiar
room and shows the book that i flung down and the sheet that i left
half written some fifty years ago i lift my eyes to the
looking-glass and perceive myself alone unless those be the
mermaid's features retiring into the depths of the mirror with a
tender and melancholy smile

ah one feels a chilliness not bodily but about the heart and
moreover a foolish dread of looking behind him after these pastimes
i can imagine precisely how a magician would sit down in gloom and
terror after dismissing the shadows that had personated dead or
distant people and stripping his cavern of the unreal splendor which
had changed it to a palace

and now for a moral to my reverie shall it be that since fancy can
create so bright a dream of happiness it were better to dream on from
youth to age than to awake and strive doubtfully for something real
oh the slight tissue of a dream can no more preserve us from the
stern reality of misfortune than a robe of cobweb could repel the
wintry blast be this the moral then in chaste and warm affections
humble wishes and honest toil for some useful end there is health for
the mind and quiet for the heart the prospect of a happy life and the
fairest hope of heaven




the ambitious guest


one september night a family had gathered round their hearth and piled
it high with the driftwood of mountain-streams the dry cones of the
pine and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing
down the precipice up the chimney roared the fire and brightened the
room with its broad blaze the faces of the father and mother had a
sober gladness the children laughed the eldest daughter was the
image of happiness at seventeen and the aged grandmother who sat
knitting in the warmest place was the image of happiness grown old
they had found the herb heart's-ease in the bleakest spot of all new
england this family were situated in the notch of the white hills
where the wind was sharp throughout the year and pitilessly cold in
the winter giving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it
descended on the valley of the saco they dwelt in a cold spot and a
dangerous one for a mountain towered above their heads so steep that
the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at
midnight

the daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all
with mirth when the wind came through the notch and seemed to pause
before their cottage rattling the door with a sound of wailing and
lamentation before it passed into the valley for a moment it saddened
them though there was nothing unusual in the tones but the family
were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some
traveller whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which
heralded his approach and wailed as he was entering and went moaning
away from the door

though they dwelt in such a solitude these people held daily converse
with the world the romantic pass of the notch is a great artery
through which the life-blood of internal commerce is continually
throbbing between maine on one side and the green mountains and the
shores of the st lawrence on the other the stage-coach always drew
up before the door of the cottage the wayfarer with no companion but
his staff paused here to exchange a word that the sense of loneliness
might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of
the mountain or reach the first house in the valley and here the
teamster on his way to portland market would put up for the night
and if a bachelor might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime and
steal a kiss from the mountain-maid at parting it was one of those
primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging
but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price when the footsteps
were heard therefore between the outer door and the inner one the
whole family rose up grandmother children and all as if about to
welcome some one who belonged to them and whose fate was linked with
theirs

the door was opened by a young man his face at first wore the
melancholy expression almost despondency of one who travels a wild
and bleak road at nightfall and alone but soon brightened up when he
saw the kindly warmth of his reception he felt his heart spring
forward to meet them all from the old woman who wiped a chair with
her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him one
glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent
familiarity with the eldest daughter

ah this fire is the right thing cried he especially when there
is such a pleasant circle round it i am quite benumbed for the notch
is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows it has blown a
terrible blast in my face all the way from bartlett

then you are going toward vermont said the master of the house as
he helped to take a light knapsack off the young man's shoulders

yes to burlington and far enough beyond replied he i meant to
have been at ethan crawford's to-night but a pedestrian lingers along
such a road as this it is no matter for when i saw this good fire
and all your cheerful faces i felt as if you had kindled it on
purpose for me and were waiting my arrival so i shall sit down among
you and make myself at home

the frank-hearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when
something like a heavy footstep was heard without rushing down the
steep side of the mountain as with long and rapid strides and taking
such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite
precipice the family held their breath because they knew the sound
and their guest held his by instinct

the old mountain has thrown a stone at us for fear we should forget
him said the landlord recovering himself he sometimes nods his
head and threatens to come down but we are old neighbors and agree
together pretty well upon the whole besides we have a sure place of
refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest

let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bear's
meat and by his natural felicity of manner to have placed himself on
a footing of kindness with the whole family so that they talked as
freely together as if he belonged to their mountain-brood he was of a
proud yet gentle spirit haughty and reserved among the rich and
great but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door and
be like a brother or a son at the poor man's fireside in the
household of the notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling the
pervading intelligence of new england and a poetry of native growth
which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the
mountain-peaks and chasms and at the very threshold of their romantic
and dangerous abode he had travelled far and alone his whole life
indeed had been a solitary path for with the lofty caution of his
nature he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have
been his companions the family too though so kind and hospitable
had that consciousness of unity among themselves and separation from
the world at large which in every domestic circle should still keep a
holy place where no stranger may intrude but this evening a prophetic
sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart
before the simple mountaineers and constrained them to answer him
with the same free confidence and thus it should have been is not
the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth

the secret of the young man's character was a high and abstracted
ambition he could have borne to live an undistinguished life but not
to be forgotten in the grave yearning desire had been transformed to
hope and hope long cherished had become like certainty that
obscurely as he journeyed now a glory was to beam on all his pathway
though not perhaps while he was treading it but when posterity
should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present they
would trace the brightness of his footsteps brightening as meaner
glories faded and confess that a gifted one had passed from his
cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him

as yet cried the stranger his cheek glowing and his eye flashing
with enthusiasm as yet i have done nothing were i to vanish from
the earth to-morrow none would know so much of me as you that a
nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the saco and
opened his heart to you in the evening and passed through the notch
by sunrise and was seen no more not a soul would ask who was he
whither did the wanderer go but i cannot die till i have achieved my
destiny then let death come i shall have built my monument

there was a continual flow of natural emotion gushing forth amid
abstracted reverie which enabled the family to understand this young
man's sentiments though so foreign from their own with quick
sensibility of the ludicrous he blushed at the ardor into which he
had been betrayed

you laugh at me said he taking the eldest daughter's hand and
laughing himself you think my ambition as nonsensical as if i were
to freeze myself to death on the top of mount washington only that
people might spy at me from the country roundabout and truly that
would be a noble pedestal for a man's statue

it is better to sit here by this fire answered the girl blushing
and be comfortable and contented though nobody thinks about us

i suppose said her father after a fit of musing there is
something natural in what the young man says and if my mind had been
turned that way i might have felt just the same it is strange
wife how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty
certain never to come to pass

perhaps they may observed the wife is the man thinking what he
will do when he is a widower

no no cried he repelling the idea with reproachful kindness
when i think of your death esther i think of mine too but i was
wishing we had a good farm in bartlett or bethlehem or littleton or
some other township round the white mountains but not where they
could tumble on our heads i should want to stand well with my
neighbors and be called squire and sent to general court for a term or
two for a plain honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer
and when i should be grown quite an old man and you an old woman so
as not to be long apart i might die happy enough in my bed and leave
you all crying around me a slate gravestone would suit me as well as
a marble one with just my name and age and a verse of a hymn and
something to let people know that i lived an honest man and died a
christian

there now exclaimed the stranger it is our nature to desire a
monument be it slate or marble or a pillar of granite or a glorious
memory in the universal heart of man

we're in a strange way to-night said the wife with tears in her
eyes they say it's a sign of something when folks minds go
a-wandering so hark to the children

they listened accordingly the younger children had been put to bed in
another room but with an open door between so that they could be
heard talking busily among themselves one and all seemed to have
caught the infection from the fireside circle and were outvying each
other in wild wishes and childish projects of what they would do when
they came to be men and women at length a little boy instead of
addressing his brothers and sisters called out to his mother

i'll tell you what i wish mother cried he i want you and father
and grandma'm and all of us and the stranger too to start right
away and go and take a drink out of the basin of the flume

nobody could help laughing at the child's notion of leaving a warm bed
and dragging them from a cheerful fire to visit the basin of the
flume a brook which tumbles over the precipice deep within the notch

the boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road and
stopped a moment before the door it appeared to contain two or three
men who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song
which resounded in broken notes between the cliffs while the singers
hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the
night

father said the girl they are calling you by name

but the good man doubted whether they had really called him and was
unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to
patronize his house he therefore did not hurry to the door and the
lash being soon applied the travellers plunged into the notch still
singing and laughing though their music and mirth came back drearily
from the heart of the mountain

there mother cried the boy again they'd have given us a ride to
the flume

again they laughed at the child's pertinacious fancy for a
night-ramble but it happened that a light cloud passed over the
daughter's spirit she looked gravely into the fire and drew a breath
that was almost a sigh it forced its way in spite of a little
struggle to repress it then starting and blushing she looked
quickly around the circle as if they had caught a glimpse into her
bosom the stranger asked what she had been thinking of

nothing answered she with a downcast smile only i felt lonesome
just then

oh i have always had a gift of feeling what is in other people's
hearts said he half seriously shall i tell the secrets of yours
for i know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth
and complains of lonesomeness at her mother's side shall i put these
feelings into words

they would not be a girl's feelings any longer if they could be put
into words replied the mountain-nymph laughing but avoiding his
eye

all this was said apart perhaps a germ of love was springing in their
hearts so pure that it might blossom in paradise since it could not
be matured on earth for women worship such gentle dignity as his and
the proud contemplative yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by
simplicity like hers but while they spoke softly and he was watching
the happy sadness the lightsome shadows the shy yearnings of a
maiden's nature the wind through the notch took a deeper and drearier
sound it seemed as the fanciful stranger said like the choral
strain of the spirits of the blast who in old indian times had their
dwelling among these mountains and made their heights and recesses a
sacred region there was a wail along the road as if a funeral were
passing to chase away the gloom the family threw pine-branches on
their fire till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose
discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness the
light hovered about them fondly and caressed them all there were the
little faces of the children peeping from their bed apart and here
the father's frame of strength the mother's subdued and careful mien
the high-browed youth the budding girl and the good old grandam
still knitting in the warmest place

the aged woman looked up from her task and with fingers ever busy was
the next to speak

old folks have their notions said she as well as young ones
you've been wishing and planning and letting your heads run on one
thing and another till you've set my mind a-wandering too now what
should an old woman wish for when she can go but a step or two before
she comes to her grave children it will haunt me night and day till
i tell you

what is it mother cried the husband and wife at once

then the old woman with an air of mystery which drew the circle
closer round the fire informed them that she had provided her
grave-clothes some years before a nice linen shroud a cap with a
muslin ruff and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since
her wedding-day but this evening an old superstition had strangely
recurred to her it used to be said in her younger days that if
anything were amiss with a corpse if only the ruff were not smooth or
the cap did not set right the corpse in the coffin and beneath the
clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it the bare
thought made her nervous

don't talk so grandmother said the girl shuddering

now continued the old woman with singular earnestness yet smiling
strangely at her own folly i want one of you my children when your
mother is dressed and in the coffin i want one of you to hold a
looking-glass over my face who knows but i may take a glimpse at
myself and see whether all's right

old and young we dream of graves and monuments murmured the
stranger-youth i wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking
and they unknown and undistinguished are to be buried together in
the ocean that wide and nameless sepulchre

for a moment the old woman's ghastly conception so engrossed the minds
of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night rising like the roar
of a blast had grown broad deep and terrible before the fated group
were conscious of it the house and all within it trembled the
foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken as if this awful sound
were the peal of the last trump young and old exchanged one wild
glance and remained an instant pale affrighted without utterance or
power to move then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all
their lips

the slide the slide

the simplest words must intimate but not portray the unutterable
horror of the catastrophe the victims rushed from their cottage and
sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spot where in
contemplation of such an emergency a sort of barrier had been reared
alas they had quitted their security and fled right into the pathway
of destruction down came the whole side of the mountain in a cataract
of ruin just before it reached the house the stream broke into two
branches shivered not a window there but overwhelmed the whole
vicinity blocked up the road and annihilated everything in its
dreadful course long ere the thunder of that great slide had ceased
to roar among the mountains the mortal agony had been endured and the
victims were at peace their bodies were never found

the next morning the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage
chimney up the mountain-side within the fire was yet smouldering on
the hearth and the chairs in a circle round it as if the inhabitants
had but gone forth to view the devastation of the slide and would
shortly return to thank heaven for their miraculous escape all had
left separate tokens by which those who had known the family were made
to shed a tear for each who has not heard their name the story has
been told far and wide and will for ever be a legend of these
mountains poets have sung their fate

there were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had
been received into the cottage on this awful night and had shared the
catastrophe of all its inmates others denied that there were
sufficient grounds for such a conjecture woe for the high-souled
youth with his dream of earthly immortality his name and person
utterly unknown his history his way of life his plans a mystery
never to be solved his death and his existence equally a
doubt whose was the agony of that death-moment




the sister-years


last night between eleven and twelve o'clock when the old year was
leaving her final footprints on the borders of time's empire she
found herself in possession of a few spare moments and sat down of
all places in the world on the steps of our new city-hall the wintry
moonlight showed that she looked weary of body and sad of heart like
many another wayfarer of earth her garments having been exposed to
much foul weather and rough usage were in very ill condition and as
the hurry of her journey had never before allowed her to take an
instant's rest her shoes were so worn as to be scarcely worth the
mending but after trudging only a little distance farther this poor
old year was destined to enjoy a long long sleep i forgot to mention
that when she seated herself on the steps she deposited by her side a
very capacious bandbox in which as is the custom among travellers of
her sex she carried a great deal of valuable property besides this
luggage there was a folio book under her arm very much resembling the
annual volume of a newspaper placing this volume across her knees and
resting her elbows upon it with her forehead in her hands the weary
bedraggled world-worn old year heaved a heavy sigh and appeared to be
taking no very pleasant retrospect of her past existence

while she thus awaited the midnight knell that was to summon her to
the innumerable sisterhood of departed years there came a young
maiden treading lightsomely on tip-toe along the street from the
direction of the railroad dépôt she was evidently a stranger and
perhaps had come to town by the evening train of cars there was a
smiling cheerfulness in this fair maiden's face which bespoke her
fully confident of a kind reception from the multitude of people with
whom she was soon to form acquaintance her dress was rather too airy
for the season and was bedizened with fluttering ribbons and other
vanities which were likely soon to be rent away by the fierce storms
or to fade in the hot sunshine amid which she was to pursue her
changeful course but still she was a wonderfully pleasant-looking
figure and had so much promise and such an indescribable hopefulness
in her aspect that hardly anybody could meet her without anticipating
some very desirable thing the consummation of some long-sought
good from her kind offices a few dismal characters there may be here
and there about the world who have so often been trifled with by young
maidens as promising as she that they have now ceased to pin any faith
upon the skirts of the new year but for my own part i have great
faith in her and should i live to see fifty more such still from
each of those successive sisters i shall reckon upon receiving
something that will be worth living for

the new year for this young maiden was no less a personage carried
all her goods and chattels in a basket of no great size or weight
which hung upon her arm she greeted the disconsolate old year with
great affection and sat down beside her on the steps of the
city-hall waiting for the signal to begin her rambles through the
world the two were own sisters being both granddaughters of time
and though one looked so much older than the other it was rather
owing to hardships and trouble than to age since there was but a
twelvemonth's difference between them

well my dear sister said the new year after the first
salutations you look almost tired to death what have you been about
during your sojourn in this part of infinite space

oh i have it all recorded here in my book of chronicles answered
the old year in a heavy tone there is nothing that would amuse you
and you will soon get sufficient knowledge of such matters from your
own personal experience it is but tiresome reading

nevertheless she turned over the leaves of the folio and glanced at
them by the light of the moon feeling an irresistible spell of
interest in her own biography although its incidents were remembered
without pleasure the volume though she termed it her book of
chronicles seemed to be neither more nor less than the salem
gazette for in the accuracy of which journal this sagacious
old year had so much confidence that she deemed it needless to record
her history with her own pen

what have you been doing in the political way asked the new year

why my course here in the united states said the old year though
perhaps i ought to blush at the confession my political course i
must acknowledge has been rather vacillatory sometimes inclining
toward the whigs then causing the administration party to shout for
triumph and now again uplifting what seemed the almost prostrate
banner of the opposition so that historians will hardly know what to
make of me in this respect but the loco-focos 

i do not like these party nicknames interrupted her sister who
seemed remarkably touchy about some points perhaps we shall part in
better humor if we avoid any political discussion

with all my heart replied the old year who had already been
tormented half to death with squabbles of this kind i care not if
the name of whig or tory with their interminable brawls about banks
and the sub-treasury abolition texas the florida war and a million
of other topics which you will learn soon enough for your own
comfort i care not i say if no whisper of these matters ever
reaches my ears again yet they have occupied so large a share of my
attention that i scarcely know what else to tell you there has
indeed been a curious sort of war on the canada border where blood
has streamed in the names of liberty and patriotism but it must
remain for some future perhaps far-distant year to tell whether or
no those holy names have been rightfully invoked nothing so much
depresses me in my view of mortal affairs as to see high energies
wasted and human life and happiness thrown away for ends that appear
oftentimes unwise and still oftener remain unaccomplished but the
wisest people and the best keep a steadfast faith that the progress of
mankind is onward and upward and that the toil and anguish of the
path serve to wear away the imperfections of the immortal pilgrim and
will be felt no more when they have done their office

perhaps cried the hopeful new year perhaps i shall see that happy
day

i doubt whether it be so close at hand answered the old year
gravely smiling you will soon grow weary of looking for that blessed
consummation and will turn for amusement as has frequently been my
own practice to the affairs of some sober little city like this of
salem here we sit on the steps of the new city-hall which has been
completed under my administration and it would make you laugh to see
how the game of politics of which the capitol at washington is the
great chess-board is here played in miniature burning ambition finds
its fuel here here patriotism speaks boldly in the people's behalf
and virtuous economy demands retrenchment in the emoluments of a
lamplighter here the aldermen range their senatorial dignity around
the mayor's chair of state and the common council feel that they have
liberty in charge in short human weakness and strength passion and
policy man's tendencies his aims and modes of pursuing them his
individual character and his character in the mass may be studied
almost as well here as on the theatre of nations and with this great
advantage that be the lesson ever so disastrous its liliputian
scope still makes the beholder smile

have you done much for the improvement of the city asked the new
year judging from what little i have seen it appears to be ancient
and time-worn

i have opened the railroad said the elder year and half a dozen
times a day you will hear the bell which once summoned the monks of a
spanish convent to their devotions announcing the arrival or departure
of the cars old salem now wears a much livelier expression than when
i first beheld her strangers rumble down from boston by hundreds at a
time new faces throng in essex street railroad-hacks and omnibuses
rattle over the pavements there is a perceptible increase of
oyster-shops and other establishments for the accommodation of a
transitory diurnal multitude but a more important change awaits the
venerable town an immense accumulation of musty prejudices will be
carried off by the free circulation of society a peculiarity of
character of which the inhabitants themselves are hardly sensible will
be rubbed down and worn away by the attrition of foreign substances
much of the result will be good there will likewise be a few things
not so good whether for better or worse there will be a probable
diminution of the moral influence of wealth and the sway of an
aristocratic class which from an era far beyond my memory has held
firmer dominion here than in any other new england town

the old year having talked away nearly all of her little remaining
breath now closed her book of chronicles and was about to take her
departure but her sister detained her a while longer by inquiring the
contents of the huge bandbox which she was so painfully lugging along
with her

these are merely a few trifles replied the old year which i have
picked up in my rambles and am going to deposit in the receptacle of
things past and forgotten we sisterhood of years never carry anything
really valuable out of the world with us here are patterns of most of
the fashions which i brought into vogue and which have already lived
out their allotted term you will supply their place with others
equally ephemeral here put up in little china pots like rouge is a
considerable lot of beautiful women's bloom which the disconsolate
fair ones owe me a bitter grudge for stealing i have likewise a
quantity of men's dark hair instead of which i have left gray locks
or none at all the tears of widows and other afflicted mortals who
have received comfort during the last twelve months are preserved in
some dozens of essence-bottles well corked and sealed i have several
bundles of love-letters eloquently breathing an eternity of burning
passion which grew cold and perished almost before the ink was dry
moreover here is an assortment of many thousand broken promises and
other broken ware all very light and packed into little space the
heaviest articles in my possession are a large parcel of disappointed
hopes which a little while ago were buoyant enough to have inflated
mr lauriat's balloon

i have a fine lot of hopes here in my basket remarked the new year
they are a sweet-smelling flower a species of rose

they soon lose their perfume replied the sombre old year what
else have you brought to insure a welcome from the discontented race
of mortals

why to say the truth little or nothing else said her sister with
a smile save a few new annuals and almanacs and some new year's
gifts for the children but i heartily wish well to poor mortals and
mean to do all i can for their improvement and happiness

it is a good resolution rejoined the old year and by the way i
have a plentiful assortment of good resolutions which have now grown
so stale and musty that i am ashamed to carry them any farther only
for fear that the city authorities would send constable mansfield with
a warrant after me i should toss them into the street at once many
other matters go to make up the contents of my bandbox but the whole
lot would not fetch a single bid even at an auction of worn-out
furniture and as they are worth nothing either to you or anybody
else i need not trouble you with a longer catalogue

and must i also pick up such worthless luggage in my travels asked
the new year

most certainly and well if you have no heavier load to bear
replied the other and now my dear sister i must bid you farewell
earnestly advising and exhorting you to expect no gratitude nor
good-will from this peevish unreasonable inconsiderate
ill-intending and worse-behaving world however warmly its inhabitants
may seem to welcome you yet do what you may and lavish on them what
means of happiness you please they will still be complaining still
craving what it is not in your power to give still looking forward to
some other year for the accomplishment of projects which ought never
to have been formed and which if successful would only provide new
occasions of discontent if these ridiculous people ever see anything
tolerable in you it will be after you are gone for ever

but i cried the fresh-hearted new year i shall try to leave men
wiser than i find them i will offer them freely whatever good gifts
providence permits me to distribute and will tell them to be thankful
for what they have and humbly hopeful for more and surely if they
are not absolute fools they will condescend to be happy and will
allow me to be a happy year for my happiness must depend on them

alas for you then my poor sister said the old year sighing as
she uplifted her burden we grandchildren of time are born to
trouble happiness they say dwells in the mansions of eternity but
we can only lead mortals thither step by step with reluctant
murmurings and ourselves must perish on the threshold but hark my
task is done

the clock in the tall steeple of dr emerson's church struck twelve
there was a response from dr flint's in the opposite quarter of the
city and while the strokes were yet dropping into the air the old
year either flitted or faded away and not the wisdom and might of
angels to say nothing of the remorseful yearnings of the millions who
had used her ill could have prevailed with that departed year to
return one step but she in the company of time and all her kindred
must hereafter hold a reckoning with mankind so shall it be
likewise with the maidenly new year who as the clock ceased to
strike arose from the steps of the city-hall and set out rather
timorously on her earthly course

a happy new year cried a watchman eying her figure very
questionably but without the least suspicion that he was addressing
the new year in person

thank you kindly said the new year and she gave the watchman one
of the roses of hope from her basket may this flower keep a sweet
smell long after i have bidden you good-bye

then she stepped on more briskly through the silent streets and such
as were awake at the moment heard her footfall and said the new year
is come wherever there was a knot of midnight roisterers they
quaffed her health she sighed however to perceive that the air was
tainted as the atmosphere of this world must continually be with the
dying breaths of mortals who had lingered just long enough for her to
bury them but there were millions left alive to rejoice at her
coming and so she pursued her way with confidence strewing
emblematic flowers on the doorstep of almost every dwelling which
some persons will gather up and wear in their bosoms and others will
trample under foot the carrier-boy can only say further that early
this morning she filled his basket with new year's addresses assuring
him that the whole city with our new mayor and the aldermen and
common council at its head would make a general rush to secure
copies kind patrons will not you redeem the pledge of the new year




snowflakes


there is snow in yonder cold gray sky of the morning and through the
partially-frosted window-panes i love to watch the gradual beginning
of the storm a few feathery flakes are scattered widely through the
air and hover downward with uncertain flight now almost alighting on
the earth now whirled again aloft into remote regions of the
atmosphere these are not the big flakes heavy with moisture which
melt as they touch the ground and are portentous of a soaking rain it
is to be in good earnest a wintry storm the two or three people
visible on the sidewalks have an aspect of endurance a blue-nosed
frosty fortitude which is evidently assumed in anticipation of a
comfortless and blustering day by nightfall or at least before the
sun sheds another glimmering smile upon us the street and our little
garden will be heaped with mountain snowdrifts the soil already
frozen for weeks past is prepared to sustain whatever burden may be
laid upon it and to a northern eye the landscape will lose its
melancholy bleakness and acquire a beauty of its own when mother
earth like her children shall have put on the fleecy garb of her
winter's wear the cloud-spirits are slowly weaving her white mantle
as yet indeed there is barely a rime like hoar-frost over the brown
surface of the street the withered green of the grass-plat is still
discernible and the slated roofs of the houses do but begin to look
gray instead of black all the snow that has yet fallen within the
circumference of my view were it heaped up together would hardly
equal the hillock of a grave thus gradually by silent and stealthy
influences are great changes wrought these little snow-particles
which the storm-spirit flings by handfuls through the air will bury
the great earth under their accumulated mass nor permit her to behold
her sister sky again for dreary months we likewise shall lose sight
of our mother's familiar visage and must content ourselves with
looking heavenward the oftener

now leaving the storm to do his appointed office let us sit down
pen in hand by our fireside gloomy as it may seem there is an
influence productive of cheerfulness and favorable to imaginative
thought in the atmosphere of a snowy day the native of a southern
clime may woo the muse beneath the heavy shade of summer foliage
reclining on banks of turf while the sound of singing-birds and
warbling rivulets chimes in with the music of his soul in our brief
summer i do not think but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a
dream my hour of inspiration if that hour ever comes is when the
green log hisses upon the hearth and the bright flame brighter for
the gloom of the chamber rustles high up the chimney and the coals
drop tinkling down among the growing heaps of ashes when the casement
rattles in the gust and the snowflakes or the sleety raindrops pelt
hard against the window-panes then i spread out my sheet of paper
with the certainty that thoughts and fancies will gleam forth upon it
like stars at twilight or like violets in may perhaps to fade as
soon however transitory their glow they at least shine amid the
darksome shadow which the clouds of the outward sky fling through the
room blessed therefore and reverently welcomed by me her true-born
son be new england's winter which makes us one and all the nurslings
of the storm and sings a familiar lullaby even in the wildest shriek
of the december blast now look we forth again and see how much of his
task the storm-spirit has done

slow and sure he has the day perchance the week before him and may
take his own time to accomplish nature's burial in snow a smooth
mantle is scarcely yet thrown over the withered grass-plat and the
dry stalks of annuals still thrust themselves through the white
surface in all parts of the garden the leafless rose-bushes stand
shivering in a shallow snowdrift looking poor things as
disconsolate as if they possessed a human consciousness of the dreary
scene this is a sad time for the shrubs that do not perish with the
summer they neither live nor die what they retain of life seems but
the chilling sense of death very sad are the flower-shrubs in
midwinter the roofs of the houses are now all white save where the
eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners to discern the
real intensity of the storm we must fix upon some distant object as
yonder spire and observe how the riotous gust fights with the
descending snow throughout the intervening space sometimes the entire
prospect is obscured then again we have a distinct but transient
glimpse of the tall steeple like a giant's ghost and now the dense
wreaths sweep between as if demons were flinging snowdrifts at each
other in mid-air look next into the street where we have an amusing
parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions
it is a snow-battle of schoolboys what a pretty satire on war and
military glory might be written in the form of a child's story by
describing the snow-ball fights of two rival schools the alternate
defeats and victories of each and the final triumph of one party or
perhaps of neither what pitched battles worthy to be chanted in
homeric strains what storming of fortresses built all of massive
snow-blocks what feats of individual prowess and embodied onsets of
martial enthusiasm and when some well-contested and decisive victory
had put a period to the war both armies should unite to build a lofty
monument of snow upon the battlefield and crown it with the victor's
statue hewn of the same frozen marble in a few days or weeks
thereafter the passer-by would observe a shapeless mound upon the
level common and unmindful of the famous victory would ask how
came it there who reared it and what means it the shattered
pedestal of many a battle-monument has provoked these questions when
none could answer

turn we again to the fireside and sit musing there lending our ears
to the wind till perhaps it shall seem like an articulate voice and
dictate wild and airy matter for the pen would it might inspire me to
sketch out the personification of a new england winter and that idea
if i can seize the snow-wreathed figures that flit before my fancy
shall be the theme of the next page

how does winter herald his approach by the shrieking blast of latter
autumn which is nature's cry of lamentation as the destroyer rushes
among the shivering groves where she has lingered and scatters the
sear leaves upon the tempest when that cry is heard the people wrap
themselves in cloaks and shake their heads disconsolately saying
winter is at hand then the axe of the woodcutter echoes sharp and
diligently in the forest then the coal-merchants rejoice because each
shriek of nature in her agony adds something to the price of coal per
ton then the peat-smoke spreads its aromatic fragrance through the
atmosphere a few days more and at eventide the children look out of
the window and dimly perceive the flaunting of a snowy mantle in the
air it is stern winter's vesture they crowd around the hearth and
cling to their mother's gown or press between their father's knees
affrighted by the hollow roaring voice that bellows adown the wide
flue of the chimney

it is the voice of winter and when parents and children hear it they
shudder and exclaim winter is come cold winter has begun his reign
already now throughout new england each hearth becomes an altar
sending up the smoke of a continued sacrifice to the immitigable deity
who tyrannizes over forest country-side and town wrapped in his
white mantle his staff a huge icicle his beard and hair a
wind-tossed snowdrift he travels over the land in the midst of the
northern blast and woe to the homeless wanderer whom he finds upon
his path there he lies stark and stiff a human shape of ice on the
spot where winter overtook him on strides the tyrant over the rushing
rivers and broad lakes which turn to rock beneath his footsteps his
dreary empire is established all around stretches the desolation of
the pole yet not ungrateful be his new england children for winter
is our sire though a stern and rough one not ungrateful even for
the severities which have nourished our unyielding strength of
character and let us thank him too for the sleigh-rides cheered by
the music of merry bells for the crackling and rustling hearth when
the ruddy firelight gleams on hardy manhood and the blooming cheek of
woman for all the home-enjoyments and the kindred virtues which
flourish in a frozen soil not that we grieve when after some seven
months of storm and bitter frost spring in the guise of a
flower-crowned virgin is seen driving away the hoary despot pelting
him with violets by the handful and strewing green grass on the path
behind him often ere he will give up his empire old winter rushes
fiercely buck and hurls a snowdrift at the shrinking form of spring
yet step by step he is compelled to retreat northward and spends the
summer month within the arctic circle

such fantasies intermixed among graver toils of mind have made the
winter's day pass pleasantly meanwhile the storm has raged without
abatement and now as the brief afternoon declines is tossing denser
volumes to and fro about the atmosphere on the window-sill there is a
layer of snow reaching halfway up the lowest pane of glass the garden
is one unbroken bed along the street are two or three spots of
uncovered earth where the gust has whirled away the snow heaping it
elsewhere to the fence-tops or piling huge banks against the doors of
houses a solitary passenger is seen now striding mid-leg deep across
a drift now scudding over the bare ground while his cloak is swollen
with the wind and now the jingling of bells a sluggish sound
responsive to the horse's toilsome progress through the unbroken
drifts announces the passage of a sleigh with a boy clinging behind
and ducking his head to escape detection by the driver next comes a
sledge laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper whom winter has
surprised at a cold hearth but what dismal equipage now struggles
along the uneven street a sable hearse bestrewn with snow is bearing
a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed oh how dreary is a
burial in winter when the bosom of mother earth has no warmth for her
poor child

evening the early eve of december begins to spread its deepening
veil over the comfortless scene the firelight gradually brightens and
throws my flickering shadow upon the walls and ceiling of the chamber
but still the storm rages and rattles against the windows alas i
shiver and think it time to be disconsolate but taking a farewell
glance at dead nature in her shroud i perceive a flock of snowbirds
skimming lightsomely through the tempest and flitting from drift to
drift as sportively as swallows in the delightful prime of summer
whence come they where do they build their nests and seek their food
why having airy wings do they not follow summer around the earth
instead of making themselves the playmates of the storm and fluttering
on the dreary verge of the winter's eve i know not whence they come
nor why yet my spirit has been cheered by that wandering flock of
snow-birds




the seven vagabonds


rambling on foot in the spring of my life and the summer of the year
i came one afternoon to a point which gave me the choice of three
directions straight before me the main road extended its dusty length
to boston on the left a branch went toward the sea and would have
lengthened my journey a trifle of twenty or thirty miles while by the
right-hand path i might have gone over hills and lakes to canada
visiting in my way the celebrated town of stamford on a level spot of
grass at the foot of the guide-post appeared an object which though
locomotive on a different principle reminded me of gulliver's
portable mansion among the brobdignags it was a huge covered
wagon or more properly a small house on wheels with a door on one
side and a window shaded by green blinds on the other two horses
munching provender out of the baskets which muzzled them were fastened
near the vehicle a delectable sound of music proceeded from the
interior and i immediately conjectured that this was some itinerant
show halting at the confluence of the roads to intercept such idle
travellers as myself a shower had long been climbing up the western
sky and now hung so blackly over my onward path that it was a point
of wisdom to seek shelter here

halloo who stands guard here is the doorkeeper asleep cried i
approaching a ladder of two or three steps which was let down from the
wagon

the music ceased at my summons and there appeared at the door not
the sort of figure that i had mentally assigned to the wandering
showman but a most respectable old personage whom i was sorry to have
addressed in so free a style he wore a snuff-colored coat and
small-clothes with white top-boots and exhibited the mild dignity of
aspect and manner which may often be noticed in aged schoolmasters
and sometimes in deacons selectmen or other potentates of that kind
a small piece of silver was my passport within his premises where i
found only one other person hereafter to be described

this is a dull day for business said the old gentleman as he
ushered me in but i merely tarry here to refresh the cattle being
bound for the camp-meeting at stamford

perhaps the movable scene of this narrative is still peregrinating new
england and may enable the reader to test the accuracy of my
description the spectacle for i will not use the unworthy term of
puppet-show consisted of a multitude of little people assembled on
a miniature stage among them were artisans of every kind in the
attitudes of their toil and a group of fair ladies and gay gentlemen
standing ready for the dance a company of foot-soldiers formed a line
across the stage looking stern grim and terrible enough to make it a
pleasant consideration that they were but three inches high and
conspicuous above the whole was seen a merry andrew in the pointed cap
and motley coat of his profession all the inhabitants of this mimic
world were motionless like the figures in a picture or like that
people who one moment were alive in the midst of their business and
delights and the next were transformed to statues preserving an
eternal semblance of labor that was ended and pleasure that could be
felt no more anon however the old gentleman turned the handle of a
barrel-organ the first note of which produced a most enlivening
effect upon the figures and awoke them all to their proper occupations
and amusements by the selfsame impulse the tailor plied his needle
the blacksmith's hammer descended upon the anvil and the dancers
whirled away on feathery tiptoes the company of soldiers broke into
platoons retreated from the stage and were succeeded by a troop of
horse who came prancing onward with such a sound of trumpets and
trampling of hoofs as might have startled don quixote himself while
an old toper of inveterate ill-habits uplifted his black bottle and
took off a hearty swig meantime the merry andrew began to caper and
turn somersets shaking his sides nodding his head and winking his
eyes in as lifelike a manner as if he were ridiculing the nonsense of
all human affairs and making fun of the whole multitude beneath him
at length the old magician for i compared the showman to prospero
entertaining his guests with a masque of shadows paused that i might
give utterance to my wonder

what an admirable piece of work is this exclaimed i lifting up my
hands in astonishment

indeed i liked the spectacle and was tickled with the old man's
gravity as he presided at it for i had none of that foolish wisdom
which reproves every occupation that is not useful in this world of
vanities if there be a faculty which i possess more perfectly than
most men it is that of throwing myself mentally into situations
foreign to my own and detecting with a cheerful eye the desirable
circumstances of each i could have envied the life of this
gray-headed showman spent as it had been in a course of safe and
pleasurable adventure in driving his huge vehicle sometimes through
the sands of cape cod and sometimes over the rough forest-roads of the
north and east and halting now on the green before a village
meeting-house and now in a paved square of the metropolis how often
must his heart have been gladdened by the delight of children as they
viewed these animated figures or his pride indulged by haranguing
learnedly to grown men on the mechanical powers which produced such
wonderful effects or his gallantry brought into play for this is an
attribute which such grave men do not lack by the visits of pretty
maidens and then with how fresh a feeling must he return at intervals
to his own peculiar home i would i were assured of as happy a life
as his thought i

though the showman's wagon might have accommodated fifteen or twenty
spectators it now contained only himself and me and a third person
at whom i threw a glance on entering he was a neat and trim young man
of two or three and twenty his drab hat and green frock-coat with
velvet collar were smart though no longer new while a pair of green
spectacles that seemed needless to his brisk little eyes gave him
something of a scholar-like and literary air after allowing me a
sufficient time to inspect the puppets he advanced with a bow and
drew my attention to some books in a corner of the wagon these he
forthwith began to extol with an amazing volubility of well-sounding
words and an ingenuity of praise that won him my heart as being myself
one of the most merciful of critics indeed his stock required some
considerable powers of commendation in the salesman there were
several ancient friends of mine the novels of those happy days when
my affections wavered between the scottish chiefs and thomas
thumb besides a few of later date whose merits had not been
acknowledged by the public i was glad to find that dear little
venerable volume the new england primer looking as antique as
ever though in its thousandth new edition a bundle of superannuated
gilt picture-books made such a child of me that partly for the
glittering covers and partly for the fairy-tales within i bought the
whole and an assortment of ballads and popular theatrical songs drew
largely on my purse to balance these expenditures i meddled neither
with sermons nor science nor morality though volumes of each were
there nor with a life of franklin in the coarsest of paper
but so showily bound that it was emblematical of the doctor himself in
the court-dress which he refused to wear at paris nor with webster's
spelling-book nor some of byron's minor poems nor half a dozen
little testaments at twenty-five cents each thus far the collection
might have been swept from some great bookstore or picked up at an
evening auction-room but there was one small blue-covered pamphlet
which the pedler handed me with so peculiar an air that i purchased it
immediately at his own price and then for the first time the thought
struck me that i had spoken face to face with the veritable author of
a printed book

the literary-man now evinced a great kindness for me and i ventured
to inquire which way he was travelling

oh said he i keep company with this old gentlemen here and we
are moving now toward the camp-meeting at stamford

he then explained to me that for the present season he had rented a
corner of the wagon as a book-store which as he wittily observed
was a true circulating library since there were few parts of the
country where it had not gone its rounds i approved of the plan
exceedingly and began to sum up within my mind the many uncommon
felicities in the life of a book-pedler especially when his character
resembled that of the individual before me at a high rate was to be
reckoned the daily and hourly enjoyment of such interviews as the
present in which he seized upon the admiration of a passing stranger
and made him aware that a man of literary taste and even of literary
achievement was travelling the country in a showman's wagon a more
valuable yet not infrequent triumph might be won in his conversations
with some elderly clergyman long vegetating in a rocky woody watery
back-settlement of new england who as he recruited his library from
the pedler's stock of sermons would exhort him to seek a college
education and become the first scholar in his class sweeter and
prouder yet would be his sensations when talking poetry while he sold
spelling-books he should charm the mind and haply touch the heart
of a fair country schoolmistress herself an unhonored poetess a
wearer of blue stockings which none but himself took pains to look at
but the scene of his completest glory would be when the wagon had
halted for the night and his stock of books was transferred to some
crowded bar-room then would he recommend to the multifarious company
whether traveller from the city or teamster from the hills or
neighboring squire or the landlord himself or his loutish hostler
works suited to each particular taste and capacity proving all the
while by acute criticism and profound remark that the lore in his
books was even exceeded by that in his brain thus happily would he
traverse the land sometimes a herald before the march of mind
sometimes walking arm in arm with awful literature and reaping
everywhere a harvest of real and sensible popularity which the
secluded bookworms by whose toil he lived could never hope for

if ever i meddle with literature thought i fixing myself in
adamantine resolution it shall be as a travelling bookseller

though it was still mid-afternoon the air had now grown dark about
us and a few drops of rain came down upon the roof of our vehicle
pattering like the feet of birds that had flown thither to rest a
sound of pleasant voices made us listen and there soon appeared
halfway up the ladder the pretty person of a young damsel whose rosy
face was so cheerful that even amid the gloomy light it seemed as if
the sunbeams were peeping under her bonnet we next saw the dark and
handsome features of a young man who with easier gallantry than might
have been expected in the heart of yankee-land was assisting her into
the wagon it became immediately evident to us when the two strangers
stood within the door that they were of a profession kindred to those
of my companions and i was delighted with the more than
hospitable the even paternal kindness of the old showman's manner as
he welcomed them while the man of literature hastened to lead the
merry-eyed girl to a seat on the long bench

you are housed but just in time my young friends said the master
of the wagon the sky would have been down upon you within five
minutes

the young man's reply marked him as a foreigner not by any variation
from the idiom and accent of good english but because he spoke with
more caution and accuracy than if perfectly familiar with the
language

we knew that a shower was hanging over us said he and consulted
whether it were best to enter the house on the top of yonder hill
but seeing your wagon in the road 

we agreed to come hither interrupted the girl with a smile
because we should be more at home in a wandering house like this

i meanwhile with many a wild and undetermined fantasy was narrowly
inspecting these two doves that had flown into our ark the young man
tall agile and athletic wore a mass of black shining curls
clustering round a dark and vivacious countenance which if it had not
greater expression was at least more active and attracted readier
notice than the quiet faces of our countrymen at his first
appearance he had been laden with a neat mahogany box of about two
feet square but very light in proportion to its size which he had
immediately unstrapped from his shoulders and deposited on the floor
of the wagon

the girl had nearly as fair a complexion as our own beauties and a
brighter one than most of them the lightness of her figure which
seemed calculated to traverse the whole world without weariness
suited well with the glowing cheerfulness of her face and her gay
attire combining the rainbow hues of crimson green and a deep
orange was as proper to her lightsome aspect as if she had been born
in it this gay stranger was appropriately burdened with that
mirth-inspiring instrument the fiddle which her companion took from
her hands and shortly began the process of tuning neither of us the
previous company of the wagon needed to inquire their trade for this
could be no mystery to frequenters of brigade-musters ordinations
cattle-shows commencements and other festal meetings in our sober
land and there is a dear friend of mine who will smile when this page
recalls to his memory a chivalrous deed performed by us in rescuing
the show-box of such a couple from a mob of great double-fisted
countrymen

come said i to the damsel of gay attire shall we visit all the
wonders of the world together

she understood the metaphor at once though indeed it would not much
have troubled me if she had assented to the literal meaning of my
words the mahogany box was placed in a proper position and i peeped
in through its small round magnifying-window while the girl sat by my
side and gave short descriptive sketches as one after another the
pictures were unfolded to my view we visited together at least our
imaginations did full many a famous city in the streets of which i
had long yearned to tread once i remember we were in the harbor of
barcelona gazing townward next she bore me through the air to
sicily and bade me look up at blazing ætna then we took wing to
venice and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the rialto and anon
she set me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of
napoleon but there was one scene its locality she could not
tell which charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous
palaces and churches because the fancy haunted me that i myself the
preceding summer had beheld just such a humble meeting-house in just
such a pine-surrounded nook among our own green mountains all these
pictures were tolerably executed though far inferior to the girl's
touches of description nor was it easy to comprehend how in so few
sentences and these as i supposed in a language foreign to her she
contrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene

when we had travelled through the vast extent of the mahogany box i
looked into my guide's face

where are you going my pretty maid inquired i in the words of
an old song

ah said the gay damsel you might as well ask where the summer
wind is going we are wanderers here and there and everywhere
wherever there is mirth our merry hearts are drawn to it to-day
indeed the people have told us of a great frolic and festival in
these parts so perhaps we may be needed at what you call the
camp-meeting at stamford

then in my happy youth and while her pleasant voice yet sounded in
my ears i sighed for none but myself i thought should have been
her companion in a life which seemed to realize my own wild fancies
cherished all through visionary boyhood to that hour to these two
strangers the world was in its golden age not that indeed it was
less dark and sad than ever but because its weariness and sorrow had
no community with their ethereal nature wherever they might appear in
their pilgrimage of bliss youth would echo back their gladness
care-stricken maturity would rest a moment from its toil and age
tottering among the graves would smile in withered joy for their
sakes the lonely cot the narrow and gloomy street the sombre shade
would catch a passing gleam like that now shining on ourselves as
these bright spirits wandered by blessed pair whose happy home was
throughout all the earth i looked at my shoulders and thought them
broad enough to sustain those pictured towns and mountains mine too
was an elastic foot as tireless as the wing of the bird of paradise
mine was then an untroubled heart that would have gone singing on its
delightful way

oh maiden said i aloud why did you not come hither alone

while the merry girl and myself were busy with the show-box the
unceasing rain had driven another wayfarer into the wagon he seemed
pretty nearly of the old showman's age but much smaller leaner and
more withered than he and less respectably clad in a patched suit of
gray withal he had a thin shrewd countenance and a pair of
diminutive gray eyes which peeped rather too keenly out of their
puckered sockets this old fellow had been joking with the showman in
a manner which intimated previous acquaintance but perceiving that
the damsel and i had terminated our affairs he drew forth a folded
document and presented it to me as i had anticipated it proved to be
a circular written in a very fair and legible hand and signed by
several distinguished gentlemen whom i had never heard of stating
that the bearer had encountered every variety of misfortune and
recommending him to the notice of all charitable people previous
disbursements had left me no more than a five-dollar bill out of
which however i offered to make the beggar a donation provided he
would give me change for it the object of my beneficence looked
keenly in my face and discerned that i had none of that abominable
spirit characteristic though it be of a full-blooded yankee which
takes pleasure in detecting every little harmless piece of knavery

why perhaps said the ragged old mendicant if the bank is in good
standing i can't say but i may have enough about me to change your
bill

it is a bill of the suffolk bank said i and better than the
specie

as the beggar had nothing to object he now produced a small buff
leather bag tied up carefully with a shoe-string when this was
opened there appeared a very comfortable treasure of silver coins of
all sorts and sizes and i even fancied that i saw gleaming among them
the golden plumage of that rare bird in our currency the american
eagle in this precious heap was my bank-note deposited the rate of
exchange being considerably against me

his wants being thus relieved the destitute man pulled out of his
pocket an old pack of greasy cards which had probably contributed to
fill the buff leather bag in more ways than one

come said he i spy a rare fortune in your face and for
twenty-five cents more i'll tell you what it is

i never refuse to take a glimpse into futurity so after shuffling
the cards and when the fair damsel had cut them i dealt a portion to
the prophetic beggar like others of his profession before predicting
the shadowy events that were moving on to meet me he gave proof of his
preternatural science by describing scenes through which i had already
passed

here let me have credit for a sober fact when the old man had read a
page in his book of fate he bent his keen gray eyes on mine and
proceeded to relate in all its minute particulars what was then the
most singular event of my life it was one which i had no purpose to
disclose till the general unfolding of all secrets nor would it be a
much stranger instance of inscrutable knowledge or fortunate
conjecture if the beggar were to meet me in the street today and
repeat word for word the page which i have here written

the fortune-teller after predicting a destiny which time seems loth
to make good put up his cards secreted his treasure-bag and began to
converse with the other occupants of the wagon

well old friend said the showman you have not yet told us which
way your face is turned this afternoon

i am taking a trip northward this warm weather replied the
conjurer across the connecticut first and then up through vermont
and maybe into canada before the fall but i must stop and see the
breaking up of the camp-meeting at stamford

i began to think that all the vagrants in new england were converging
to the camp-meeting and had made this wagon their rendezvous by the
way

the showman now proposed that when the shower was over they should
pursue the road to stamford together it being sometimes the policy of
these people to form a sort of league and confederacy

and the young lady too observed the gallant bibliopolist bowing to
her profoundly and this foreign gentleman as i understand are on a
jaunt of pleasure to the same spot it would add incalculably to my
own enjoyment and i presume to that of my colleague and his friend
if they could be prevailed upon to join our party

this arrangement met with approbation on all hands nor were any of
those concerned more sensible of its advantages than myself who had
no title to be included in it

having already satisfied myself as to the several modes in which the
four others attained felicity i next set my mind at work to discover
what enjoyments were peculiar to the old straggler as the people of
the country would have termed the wandering mendicant and prophet as
he pretended to familiarity with the devil so i fancied that he was
fitted to pursue and take delight in his way of life by possessing
some of the mental and moral characteristics the lighter and more
comic ones of the devil in popular stories among them might be
reckoned a love of deception for its own sake a shrewd eye and keen
relish for human weakness and ridiculous infirmity and the talent of
petty fraud thus to this old man there would be pleasure even in the
consciousness so insupportable to some minds that his whole life was
a cheat upon the world and that so far as he was concerned with the
public his little cunning had the upper hand of its united wisdom
every day would furnish him with a succession of minute and pungent
triumphs as when for instance his importunity wrung a pittance out
of the heart of a miser or when my silly good-nature transferred a
part of my slender purse to his plump leather bag or when some
ostentatious gentleman should throw a coin to the ragged beggar who
was richer than himself or when though he would not always be so
decidedly diabolical his pretended wants should make him a sharer in
the scanty living of real indigence and then what an inexhaustible
field of enjoyment both as enabling him to discern so much folly and
achieve such quantities of minor mischief was opened to his sneering
spirit by his pretensions to prophetic knowledge

all this was a sort of happiness which i could conceive of though i
had little sympathy with it perhaps had i been then inclined to
admit it i might have found that the roving life was more proper to
him than to either of his companions for satan to whom i had
compared the poor man has delighted ever since the time of job in
wandering up and down upon the earth and indeed a crafty
disposition which operates not in deep-laid plans but in disconnected
tricks could not have an adequate scope unless naturally impelled to
a continual change of scene and society

my reflections were here interrupted

another visitor exclaimed the old showman

the door of the wagon had been closed against the tempest which was
roaring and blustering with prodigious fury and commotion and beating
violently against our shelter as if it claimed all those homeless
people for its lawful prey while we caring little for the
displeasure of the elements sat comfortably talking there was now an
attempt to open the door succeeded by a voice uttering some strange
unintelligible gibberish which my companions mistook for greek and i
suspected to be thieves latin however the showman stepped forward
and gave admittance to a figure which made me imagine either that our
wagon had rolled back two hundred years into past ages or that the
forest and its old inhabitants had sprung up around us by enchantment
it was a red indian armed with his bow and arrow his dress was a sort
of cap adorned with a single feather of some wild bird and a frock of
blue cotton girded tight about him on his breast like orders of
knighthood hung a crescent and a circle and other ornaments of
silver while a small crucifix betokened that our father the pope had
interposed between the indian and the great spirit whom he had
worshipped in his simplicity this son of the wilderness and pilgrim
of the storm took his place silently in the midst of us when the
first surprise was over i rightly conjectured him to be one of the
penobscot tribe parties of which i had often seen in their summer
excursions down our eastern rivers there they paddle their birch
canoes among the coasting-schooners and build their wigwam beside
some roaring mill-dam and drive a little trade in basket-work where
their fathers hunted deer our new visitor was probably wandering
through the country toward boston subsisting on the careless charity
of the people while he turned his archery to profitable account by
shooting at cents which were to be the prize of his successful aim

the indian had not long been seated ere our merry damsel sought to
draw him into conversation she indeed seemed all made up of
sunshine in the month of may for there was nothing so dark and dismal
that her pleasant mind could not cast a glow over it and the wild
man like a fir tree in his native forest soon began to brighten into
a sort of sombre cheerfulness at length she inquired whether his
journey had any particular end or purpose

i go shoot at the camp-meeting at stamford replied the indian

and here are five more said the girl all aiming at the
camp-meeting too you shall be one of us for we travel with light
hearts and as for me i sing merry songs and tell merry tales and am
full of merry thoughts and i dance merrily along the road so that
there is never any sadness among them that keep me company but oh
you would find it very dull indeed to go all the way to stamford
alone

my ideas of the aboriginal character led me to fear that the indian
would prefer his own solitary musings to the gay society thus offered
him on the contrary the girl's proposal met with immediate
acceptance and seemed to animate him with a misty expectation of
enjoyment

i now gave myself up to a course of thought which whether it flowed
naturally from this combination of events or was drawn forth by a
wayward fancy caused my mind to thrill as if i were listening to deep
music i saw mankind in this weary old age of the world either
enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke and dust of cities or
if they breathed a purer air still lying down at night with no hope
but to wear out to-morrow and all the to-morrows which make up life
among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched toil that had
darkened the sunshine of today but there were some full of the
primeval instinct who preserved the freshness of youth to their latest
years by the continual excitement of new objects new pursuits and new
associates and cared little though their birthplace might have been
here in new england if the grave should close over them in central
asia fate was summoning a parliament of these free spirits
unconscious of the impulse which directed them to a common centre
they had come hither from far and near and last of all appeared the
representatives of those mighty vagrants who had chased the deer
during thousands of years and were chasing it now in the spirit-land
wandering down through the waste of ages the woods had vanished
around his path his arm had lost somewhat of its strength his foot
of its fleetness his mien of its wild regality his heart and mind of
their savage virtue and uncultured force but here untamable to the
routine of artificial life roving now along the dusty road as of old
over the forest-leaves here was the indian still

well said the old showman in the midst of my meditations here is
an honest company of us one two three four five six all going
to the camp-meeting at stamford now hoping no offence i should like
to know where this young gentleman may be going

i started how came i among these wanderers the free mind that
preferred its own folly to another's wisdom the open spirit that
found companions everywhere above all the restless impulse that had
so often made me wretched in the midst of enjoyments these were my
claims to be of their society

my friends cried i stepping into the centre of the wagon i am
going with you to the camp-meeting at stamford

but

 the spaewife
gained an effectual dalliance with a fair and
comely damsel called elizabeth the daughter
 sir adam mure rowallan and by
her he hqd a progeny sons and daughters
for causes and reasons but whether 
state or inconstancy is not set forth neither
in the histories the time nor in the chronicles
 the kingdom this robert during the
life and reign his uncle king david the
second estranged himself from the gentle
elizabeth mure by which great disloyalty
on his part she was stricken with sorrow and
languishing in the solitude neglect she
drooped her head and became pale and pining
and died with a heavy sigh
he afterwards addressed his amorous aspirations
to euphemia boss the daughter
 the proud and warlike earl that name
and was to her publicly married with all
the pomp and pageantries befitting the wedding
 the heir to the scottish crown with
this lady he lived several years and begat
 he spaewife 
according to the custom die age sons
and daughters whom walter lord 
buchan and earl atholl caithness and
strathearn is ordained to act a principal part
in this our olden and eventful history
about the king david's reign the
lady euphemia boss being dead robert
repented his infidelity towards that sweet
and patient gentlewoman elisabeth mure
and acknowledged before the king his uncle
that she had been his wedded wife and
that he had procured from his holiness pope
clement the sixth a dispensation by which
his children by her were legitimated and
when on the death the king he ascended
the throne the first exercise his regal
authority and princely influence was to procure
by a strong handling the interests
and loyalty the states the kingdom in
parliament assembled an act declaration
whereby the children his first love elizabeth
mure were admitted as his rightful

 the spaewife
heirs and an elder order than those the
lady euphemia ross
thus was the venom dissension from
the beginning instilled as it were into the blood
 the princes the royal house stuart
and thus did their progenitor while intending
justice and atonement work out against his
own offspring a machination prerogative
fraught with the seeds irremediable enmity
is it therefore to be wondered that the
righteous heavens with an unparalleled amstance
 displeasure have continued through
so long a succession bloody and funereal
events to manifest their judgment on the
doomed and guilty race 
but not to expatiate on those old and early
crimes let it suffice to say that although
during the remainder king robert's days
he partook some calm and consolation in
the reflection having atoned as far as he
then could to the fair and mild elizabeth
mure for the blight he had cast on her fame

the space wife 
and honour ill the bloom her youth and
beauty he had not long departed this life in
the ancient castle duridonald when the
seed that fatal policy began to germinate
and sprout into effect
john the lord kyle and earl carrick
the firstborn son elizabeth mure was according
to the beforementioned settlement 
the order succession acknowledged as the
heir the kingdom but at that er strange
and dismal presages haying become rife
amongst the people and it appearing that
they were too deeply impressed and farspread
for the government to treat as fantastical he
was advised to allow himself to be proclaimed
king by the style and title robert the
third in the hope thereby dispersing those
gloomy movementsthe name robert
from the renown and glories the bruce's
time and from the peaceful prosperity his
father's reign being deemed singularly auspicious
the devices statesmen however

 the spabwipb
oouid prove no avail against the decrees 
fate sentence hod been pronounced on high
against the race and generations the starts
aid die revolutions time have but served
to bring to pass the necessary consequences
 their direful and irremediable doom
this third robert being an indolent inclination
and infirm health as mind left
his brother tee duke albany in the ex
erciee the royal power to which he had
been appointed in the latter days their
father and this duke a restless and ambitious
man striving by all expedients and contrivances
 policy to make a way for himself
to the kingly possession the throne so
turned the youthful incontinence his
nephew the heir to the crown to the furtherance
 the purpose he had in view that
he caused him to perish hunger in the
palace falklandan occurrence which so
moved the grieved and dismayed father that
he sent his next and only son prince james
the spakwot 
out scotland to be educated at the french
court in order that be might be safe from the
crafty policy this ruthless uncle and his
other treacherous kinsmen but in the voyage
to france die young prince was taken by
the english and carried a prisoner to london
where he was detained many years
meantime walter earl athos the eldest
son which the lady euphenria boss bore
to the second robert and who but for the
act settlement by which the pretensions
 his mother's offspring were set aside and
preference given to those elizabeth mure
would have succeeded to the crown remained
moody and discontented with his fortunes
but though the duke so yearned to be all
king and though the earl athos repined
at the unjust exclusion which as he conceived
he was suffering from his right still there
was no immediate prospect that either the
one would be gratified in his wishes or the
other indemnified for his privations by any
 the spabwife
change ih the order succession for the
states scotland haying assembled in parliament
at perth oh the death robert the
third the right prince james was universally
acknowledged and he was accordingly
proclaimed king so that between atholl and
the throne the preference given to the sons
 elizabeth mure was thus again recognised
and established by law
the spaewife 

when the estates the realm had proclaimed
prince james king scotland the lords
barons and clergy then assembled at perth
rose to return to their respective castles and
dwellings and the earl atholl and the
duke albany who was appointed regent
together with divers other noblemen high
renown and ancient pedigree came riding in
gallant array with their intermingled trains
towards that ancient seat abrogated royalty
the pictish town abernethy where they
divided themselves according to the different
arts which it behoved them to take
the regent proceeded with his officers and
retinue eastward to his princely residence at
falkland and the earl atholl courteously
bidding him farewell turned his horse's head
a
 the spaewife
towards glenphaerg being minded to pass
thorough the same to kinross and thence to
dunfermline where at the time his lady was
then abiding but on reaching the entrance 
the glen he found the road had been so damaged
by die torrents the bygone winter
that it was almost impassable he had however
set his heart on going that way and he
would not return so ordering his men to
dismount he dismounted himself and giving
the bridle to a groom walked on alone while
the youth led forward the charger before him
it was then the green and pleasant month
 may when the leaves are bright and the
waters clear and the birds and bees and
blossoms and butterflies are all fluttering in
the bhtheness the sunshine cheerfulness
shone on the foreheads the mountains and
the valley strathern smiled to the gracious
heavens that ware shedding with a bountiful
hand the treasures summer into her broad
and flowery apron the stripling pages 
xhe spabwieh 
lord atholl shouted and tapped their hands
as they startled the mavis and the blackbird
from the toughs the hazel that feathered
the steeps the glen the meftiataita
whistled and carolled and the cupbearer who
was too corpulent to dismount and who intermission
from die earl on account his
weight and age to keep the saddle often ashe
travelled up the narrow margin the
noisy brook snatched a leaf from the overhanging
birch and rubbing it between his
thumb and fingers inhaled the scent and declared
it more delicious than the perfume 
the oldest malveskfe
but their lord was sullen his brows were
knotted with cogitation and when the horse
which the groom led before him paused and
looked down from the perilous cornice a
precipice along which the road lay seemingly
afraid to pass a sharp and jutting rock which
loosened by the thaws the early spring
had in its fell almost blocked up the passage

he elided impatiently and was angry whbout
reason 
what male's you so wud at the brave
gelding lord atholl it's a wise beast cried
a voice from behind the rock and in the
same moment a young woman a wild and
uncouth appearance came into view stretching
out her hand as if to intercept the horse
from coining forward
who are you said the earl surprised
at the salutation and the interruption
 do ye no ken me ample o dunblane 
i thought every bodie kent the ta'enwa
replied anniple adding when marion
drummond the weaver's wife was brought to
bed o as bonny a lassiebairn as ever the
hodie had in her arms it was laid in a
cradle and lappet wt tow but when lucky
fisher gaed in the morning to bring the baby
to its mother she found but me and they say
i'm a between that the fairies have dressed in
the likeness o a christian creature and left
the spaewife is
in the stead o the weaver's wife's bairn
that they carried away into the fairyland
ayant the seas and neath the hills but
the fairies have nae power to put heavenly
souls until their effigies which is the cause
folks say that i have a want some o the
seven senses but stand ye there lord
atholl for i was on my way to seek you
 indeed r add the el smiling com
skmataly at the rhapsody the poor creature
and what is your pleasureanrople with me
a word wisdom that should be told in
secret bid your men bide where they are
and come ye here afore your horse to this hole
o the rock and til tell you
the earl almost unconscious what he
did stepped forward and went round the rock
while the groom that had hold his horse
by the bridle waved his hand to those who
were behind and they all halted
well resumed the earl what have
you to tell me 
 tjse spabwepk
u i have dreamt a dream replied anniple
tmmg her hands exultingly and it was a
about you lord atholl o it was a visum
 grandeur if i had a soul to live after
the weaver's wife's wean dies among the
fairiesfor when that happens and were
it to happen even now ye would see me fell
down on the ground forefeet you just a
withered between but i was saying that
had i a soul to be saved i would na wish to
be ta'en into a brighter heaven than i saw in
my dream
but how came i anniple into your
dream said atholl somewhat seriously i
never saw you before 
i have seen you though cried ample
 the tower on the hillhead canna be hidden
though a wee bush will geog the poor
man's bield
and what may your dream have been
about to bring you so far in quest me 
u ye'll have to gfe me something before i
the spasm is
tali your replied anniple importantly tossing
back her long matted locks with her right
and left hand and erecting herself into a
posture which showed how highly she considered
the value her apocalypse
lord atholl smiled and taking a parse from
his belt presented her with a piece silver
another said she holding out her hand
with the money lying in it
the earl drew out another piece and hid
h in her palm
three's aye canny my lord said annile
 make it three or w 
the tone and look with which she said
this still holding her hand stretched out
struck the earl and he stood for a moment
with his forefinger in the mouth his purse
evidently surprised and in some degree
daunted
a free heart make a fair fortune said
anniple and if ye get what i bode yell
no grudge me gold
 the spabwife
the earl dipped his hand into his purse
but having no more silver he drew it out
empty
anniple started at the motion and retiring
aside said with an offended air
pass on my lord atholl and let your
train pass on it's an ill omen that ye canna
make good your purpose
i have been fooled said the earl to
himself and he called to his groom kelso
by name to bring his horse forward but
anniple laid her right hand on his left
arm and showing him the two pieces 
silver looked sharply in his face as she
 is that a fit largess to one who comes to
tell you
what exclaimed the earl eagerly
but in the same moment he flung off the hand
with which she held him by the arm
lord atholl twelve maun dee or i bethe
laird f was the sang that sir laurie
the spaewefb 
gramme drones sung when but a page
in the hall o monteith and yet or thirty
years were come and gave he was the laird
himsel how many stand atween you and
the crown lord atholl 
the earl looked sternly but made no
answer
i can tell though ye canna exclaimed
anniple triumphantly and she began to
count on her fingers the different sons and
descendants in the male line robert the
second beginning
 there's jamie the prince and robin
the regent and murdoch his son and his
sons three six already that's no right i
saw but five
tis strange said the earl to himself 
but his colour fled as he looked at her where
she stood muttering and counting her fingers

there were but five said she but
five burials in my dream before the sparkling
 the spaewife
was placed upon your head oh pale
and wan i thought ye were and the crown
sat so heavy that drops o blood fell trickling
down your cheeks
kelso fering forward the horse cried
the earl sharply and die groom obeying
he instantly mounted and galloped forward
annipk scrambling up the side the hill
ran wildly towards another obstructed turn 
the road where she knew he must check
his speed there standing on a ledge the
rock as he passed under she clamoured a
loud and shrill raving masons till he
had die road again free before him when as
soon as he slackened his rein and peed his
rowels she set up a frtqatic shout and hallooed
and screamed in an ecstasy after him

though it could not well be said that he ww
a doer ill deeds yet might it be averred
justly that he permitted them to be done fora

 the paewife
by his indolence crimes were allowed to grow
to customs
those weak qualities however which u
mounted to vices in his public faculties were
in the minor duties his household such endearing
virtues that his lady loved him with a
matchless constancy affection and his
sons while they were merry playing boys
could never find a happier sharer their
pranks so that the castle falkland wfcile
the kingdom was rent with feuds and raids
and all the woes that flow frojjmeble seep
land was for many a day the
lest dwelling high or low that could be
flgpad in any lan
the sides the hills were then rough with
farce and heather the waters winter were
still raging in the burns themosses were it
divers places deep and flooded and though
in summer the journey to a deerfooted highlander
was not more than three hours time
yet to bishop finlay on horseback with a
train fourandtwenty men it was a lull
equinoctial day's travel for not only did
many impediments obligate him to choose a
winding way but ecclesiastical decorum re
qakedhat he should proceed gravely
this embassy was certes a very solemn
apparition on the hills first there was the
bishop aloft with his pastoral crook headed
with a ramvhorn made beaten silver
in his left hand holding the bridle in his
rights and two celts leading the shelty
then the mien and garb his train were

been imagined that they were the legions
 the host df diabolic carrying away bishop
pinlay
in the sunny calm the i afternoon they
had reached the crown the ridgy mus that
rise between the clyde and lochomond
and where the bishop bade his train stop
the shelty and help him to alight that he
might partake some repast from their wallet
 stores was the brow a mountain
which for the far and fair prospects that
spread around may well be called the eye
 lennox truly it is a restingplace where
the languor weary limbs may be forgotten 
for there the traveller needs no other solace

ef his train was setting jbrth the provisions
h the shores were hanging
headlong within like the brim and inside
 some indian bowl curiously enamelled
a lone ferryboat slowly plying her heavy
oars was all the commerce moving then mi
that cairn solitude
when the bishop had been some time seated
in this still contemplation being informed
that the repast was set out he rose and went
to partake the same but he was so ravished
by the scene which he thai beheld that he
stood for some time in a state wonderment
unspeakable below lay loehlomond withall
its marvels cliffy islets and woody
shores far eastward spread the rich vales
 buchanan and like a champion in the van
 some mighty host before him with his
helmet clouds on stood belmont the
the pabwwr ot
dark mantle us shadow covering a wide
apace the brand blue lake 
verily said bishop finlay to himself ashe
turned round and gazed again on all lie
had seen if we thrive in the endeavour t
push sang james from the throne it wouldbe
a worthy achievement for the church if i
would get a grant all the lands seen from
this hilltop to build an abbey it would
make a saint me if not a cardinal
after his refreshment the shelty was again
brought and bishop finlay being elevated on
the top the rock was lifted therefrom into
the saddle if saddle it might be catted which
was but the skin ane seaotter
all things being again ordered the embassy
began to descend the slope the hill
slanting northerly into and across a valley
towards the castle the gfanfruins which
was soon seen standing by itself on the brow 
a jutting hill that was rocky and shaggy
and difficult to climb
 tlfcie nutim was tww tail finnaft hsttifinjpntbd
structure with alum or chimney at the one
cod and two little turrets parched on the
corners at the other and round about it was
a wall goodly masonry strong and high
mod pierced in many places with holes for
the valiant men the clan to shoot therefrom
their arrows and in this wall these
was a gate with a bulwark at each side very
fair to look upon and over the same was n
loophole window for espial before opening the
gtfte to let strangers in
as bishop finlay and has train drew near
some halfsccnte the glenfruins came to
the outside the gate very wild and
dreadful they were and they had round their
thins and cast over their shoulders a plaid
not jsktn but really weaver's work
though in likeness it was much shniliar to
the geafcskbis whereof the bishop's hoots
wee made and when they saw it was a
bishop and above all bishop finfoy who
fht sfakwjp t
hachgteaff reverence hr those parts they threw
themselves on the ground before his shetland
as he was lifted from its back they kissed
the henrofhis garment and he bestowed his
benediction upon them
then bishop pinlay washed thorough the
gate into the court the caste wherein he
tew five cows chewing their code in accrue
behind dunghill whereon divers swine groves
at their pleasure and hens and cocks
were rampaging a store for hospitality such
as well befitted the castkyard sudrafiigh
land chieftain and when he had looked around
and saw that there was indeed a competent
store victual in those living creatures for his
train he war right glad heart for all the
way thither he had thought what was said
concerning the spare feasts glenfruin abc
was thereby much troubled hi mind
 from the forecourt bishop finlay was
conducted round the the turreted keep
 the castle and brought to alow and narrow
i
 the spaewife
door in a wall that was built from the corner
 the keep to the outer wall and having
stooped his plead he entered in and found
himself in another court and before him a
stair which stood out from the keep but led
to a door high in the wall thereof when
he had been conducted up the steps this
stair an old door which had been the half 
a gate that had suffered in some raid for it
was charred or burnt was laid from the
stairhead to the door in the keep and he
having passed over the same with some fear
stepped into the hall glenfruin
at the upper this hall in a vault or
pen a mighty fire was blazing and roaring
and before the same a pleasant sight as
bishop finlay thought there was the carcass
 a sheep still adorned with the head and
horns roasting on a spit made a young tree
four or five veterans were sitting on a form
in the dark side the chimney and one 
them was instructing a stripling who was
tflfi paewife 
kneeling on the hearth screening his face with
his shield from the scorching fire where the
roast needed basting
this stripling was the young laird and
ins instructor was the chief himself a
strong hale gruff and rough carle with a
bald head and a toosie grey beard he wasattired
in plakfcng divers colours which
his lady and her daughters and handmaidens
bad carded spun and woven and round him
be wore a spacious toga the ike exhfttture
the corner being buckled on his left shoulder
with ane broach as broad asthe palm a
man's hand knobbed and gnarled with an
array glass beads and other similar precious
gems he had moreover a sword on
his thigh on the hilt whereof were many rich
carvings and cunning devices oversea work 
the which sword was among the clan accounted
worth twenty head the best cattle
ever lifted by them or their fathers from the
lands buchanan 
 tbebjubwtb
 the stir and din cawwd by the entrance
 the bishop drew th eyes the chief 
and those who were with hon arotttfd the
hallfire toward the door and glenfruin
seeing who was his visitor advanced towards
him and greeted him hi an hospitable manner
the which was the more to be remarked as
in these days the chief pains were prouder than
the bishops and many cf them could not
brook the privileges which the churchmen
domed among their plans bishop eraky
however as is akeady rehearsed was much beloved
among the highlanders far he meddled
not with their controversies nor put any inter
diet on their raids into the lowlandsindeed
considering how much gear was thereby
brought into the highlands it would not
have been a wise thing him to have marred
the helping his own trencher by counselling
companion towards the aaaalekhes as he was
wont the castle halls to call the fainthearted
lowlanders
hebabwhr 
after due interchange salutations the
chief led the way for the bishop to the foot
 a moveable timber stair so made that it
might be drawn up in sudden alarms or during
quarrelling in the hall and ascended the
same followed by his guest and the young
chioftjun
when they were about halfway up the
steps the old warrior happened to look down
sad sftmg who was coming after the prelate

the part the castle into which glenfruin
led the way for the prelate was that which is
called in the saracenic tongue the harem in
the chamber up into which they ascended
the lady and her two daughters with the help
 an aged crone that filled the manifold offices
 nurse and midwife to the family mistress
 the yarn weaver the tartan and
chemist the potdyes were thriftily teazing
and garbling wool
in one corner stood a bed and under it
with two large handles curiously fashioned
and adorned plainly great antiquity probably
one the chattels which the daughter 
godfridus macarkyll brought with her when
she married the ancestor glenfruin was
to be seen an ark or coffer with large brazen
the spajwife 
bands and massy clasps and a lock cunning
workmanship in this coffer all the treasures
and precious things were deposited which the
chiefs the glenfruins had gathered and
hoarded in the course many generations
raids and readings
at the foot the bed hung a bundle 
many leers harps and spindles worsted
yarn divers hues a trophy and testimony 
the household thrift the lady glenfruin 
and on a shelf hard by the same lay a cheese
with two neighbourly wooden gardener
and a drinking horn with a brim graven
silver beneath this shelf was a costly oaken
elbowchair gnarled with flowery chisel work
such as could not be surpassed for device and
intricacy in any lowland castle that age
how it came into the castle glenfruin
whether brought among the spoils some
bold adventure or purchased at the price 
sheep and cattle lifted from the lands 
buchanan were a vain thing now to deters

daughters and swords that the chkfeofthe
race had taken from their foes in battle over

for te goose all our sowlls and going
to the carved elbowchair before spoken o
the spaswife 
he drew it to some distance from the wall
and turning to the prelate added fe
pleasured my lord peeshop to make a sederunt

bishop fifthly so invited sat down
glenfruiri then seated himself on one the
stools and the lady who had with her daughters
risen from the floor sat down on the
other while the young ladies found seats on
the bedside old nora after kissing the hem
 the bight reverend father's garment
gathered the wool into her lap and retired
with it into an adjacent room
to bless or to pray was seldom any part 
bishop finny's business and course he
was not at all times prepared to answer a call
for either but on this occasion seeing that
the pious chief the glenfruins regarded
his visit as a pastoral advent he resolved to
look the difficulties the emergency bravely
in the face accordingly after a brief space
 time spent in silence and rumination he
vol i e
 the spaewife

rose and while glenfruin with his lady and
daughters knelt on the floor lifted up his
eyes and hands and seemed to supplicate in
the latin tongue
when he had made an praying his
pious auditors went and kissed his hand as he
again seated himself in the elbowchair after
which glenfruin went to the door and cried
down the stair
nigel nigel are ye a too nail nigel 
nigel answered and the chief then continued

till te morton poke pe ready ye'll
pit te troth come up for my lord peeshop
has gotten a naething py his presentations this
plessis mornings
this order was speedily obeyed with all
the alacrity characteristic highland hospitality
the young chief himself to do the
more homage to their holy guest brought
up the wooden bicker soup which he
gave to his father who held it till the
the paewife 
ladies had set out the table with the six feet
then on officer high in the household brought
five shells choke does or barefootmussels
for in those days there were no spoons among
the celts and glenfruin and the ladies together
with bishop finlay and the young
chief began to dip their shells into the wooden
dish and to eat the broth which was
a seething venison and barley
when they had partaken thereof which
by reason the heat in it was not easy to be
done nigel was despatched below to select a
fitting portion the roasted sheep and the
bishop began to break the purpose and object
 his visit
well glenfe said he what is
your notion this new way ruling the
realm pno doubt you have heard that duke
murdoch and his sons have fallen under the
king's displeasure and your old friend and
good neighbour lennox he too is taken up

that certainly said bishop finlay
was not so kind in him as it might have
been but perhaps at that time there was
some paction between him and buchanan by
which he had undertaken to protect his cattle
against the raids your an as well as

the bishop was somewhat startled by the
complacency with which glenfruin spoke
but he said
no doubt he looks to what he will gam 
but is it not however very alarming to think
that noblemen such high blood pedigree
and privilege should be laid hold bylaws
made for varlet and obliged to show
by what other charters than their swords
they hold possession their lands how
would you like to have your right so questioned

quite the contrary replied bishop finlay
 i know not a baron in the land that is
more truly the lord his own lordship than
you are chief and master your own estate
and vassals but i would ask you if it is to
be endured that men family are to be questioned
how they came by their lands a stop
glenfruin ought to be put to the attempt at
once and that too by a show in the field
there is no other way making king james
sensible that english laws and practices will
never do in scotland our forefathers might as
well have submitted to king edward as to
be brought under english thraldom in this
w
way

king's majesty got bliss him have had
a potential to poor take murdoch an heirs 
his body into a custody and to make a similitude

 the spabwife
but the lord james is still free and
will revenge the injury done to his family
te lord hemies my lord peeshop

skirt o te lands o lennox for my lord
peeshop some te lands o lennox would
be great commodity and a plenty o pleasure
to all te glenfiruins
by this time the board had been replenished
and bishop finlay discerning that the
chief saw it might not be profitable to join
in the rebellion turned the discourse to pleathe
spaewipe 
sentries in the celtic tongue with the ladies
who were so highly accomplished in that erudite
language that they never thought conversing
in any other

chap x
while bishop finlay was on his embassade
the countess ross passed by the castle 
ballot with a goodly troop fair damsels
and a redoubtable guard gallant squires to
see her kinswoman the beautiful sibilla macdonald
daughter to the lord the isles
embarked at dumbarton in a galley for the
isle skye they knew not that the lord
james stuart was then in the castle else
they would not have come by that road for
he was betrothed to the lady sibilla and the
ruin which had fallen on all his family was
the cause that made the countess send her
home it happened however shortly after
the bishop had departed from ballot castle
that the lord james with a numerous train
the paewife 
had gone forth to take the pastime hunting
 and while he was on the hills he discovered
the gay retinue the ladies moving
down the banks the river and curious
to know who they were and for what occasion
so many gentles in glittering attire
should be travelling at such a time in that
direction he rode hastily towards them
but when he came near enough to discern
that the gallants were gentlemen the earl 
ross's train and saw the stately countess
herself on her quiet grey palfrey with her
hood thrown back that she might be fanned
by the cool freshness the gale and beheld
by her side on an ambling jennet a slender
and delicate lady all veiled like a cistercian
nun he was shaken with a strange anxiety 
for in the graceful movements that gentle
lady albeit the dejection with which she
drooped her head was unlike the sprightly
air her wonted carriage he discerned the
bride to whom but for the sudden visitation
 the pabwife
 the king's displeasure he was soon to
have been married and the thought came to
him as it were with the flash and scorching
 lightning that all hope their union was
destroyed and that she was then departing
back to the house her father never to return
for him
he reined his horse on the brow the
hill that overlooked the road and then alighted
and held it by the bridle his heart beat
thickly hitherto the spirit indignation
and revenge had animated him with fierce
resolutions and the sense the adversity
which had overtaken himself and the thought
 the ruin which hung over his father and
his father's friends had borne him above the
grief his condition but the sight the
approaching cavalcade made him feel that his
situation was one too in which sorrow had a
heavy part
his first motion was to advance and make
himself known but without being almost
the spaewife 
conscious the reason why he did so he had
suddenly leapt from the saddle and he remained
irresolute with the bridle in his hand
till he was observed by one the gentlemen
 the lady ross's retinue by that time
several his own train had seen the party
approaching and they came towards him
that they might be ready to assist or to obey
the attention the countess was directed
towards the spot where the lord james stood
and she halted her palfrey and raising her
right hand to skreen her eyes from the sun
looked up the hill for the space two or three
minutes without speaking
she then called one her servants to send
him forward to inquire who the stranger was
that seemed disposed to interrupt her progress
 for so she interpreted the attitude and
intention the lord james from the numbers
and haste his followers assembling
from all parts the hill but her train had
quickly discovered that it was the outlawed
 the spaewipe
prince and the man whom she had summoned
to send forward knowing the effect
that the news would have on the lady sibilla
informed the countess in a whisper that it
was her betrothed bridegroom
for a moment the lady ross wist not what
to do but after a short reflection she ordered
the servant to ride up to the lord james
and tell him to come to her at the same
moment bidding the lady sibilla remain
where she was she touched her grey palfrey
and ambled forward to a distance attended
only by two gentlemen whom she ordered
to remain apart as the lord james joined
her
 what do you intend by this said the
countess surely you can never think 
involving a lady whom you have professed to
love in the present ruin and jeopardy 
your fortunes i entreat you james stuart
not to exasperate by any new outrage the
king's justice which is already sufficiently
the sfaewife ill
roused against the bouse albany but
allow us to pass unmolested sibilla's grief
are more than she can well beardp for the
mercy heaven and the sake the blessed
virgin retire and let us pursue our journey
in peace
chance alone replied the lord james
has thrown me in your way but what you
say sibilla's sorrow is reason enough to
make me stop you it is for me and on my
account that she is grieved and i cannot asa
knight and nobleman but desire to lighten
her grief 
truly it is a kind way to do it replied
the countess you would console her by
adding to those offences which have brought
on the proceedings that have withered her
hopes be you assured that the king is
much more likely to pardon treason against
himself than the abduction a lady sibill's
rank but my lord you shall not
take her from mesmy train is in bravery and
 the spaewife
numbers more than equal to yours in so
saying the countess waved her hand and ina
moment all the gallants and servants 
her retinue were around her like a whirlwind
the damsels who were left behind screamed
and flocked towards sibilla where they alighted
from their horses and assisted her
also to alight
the train the lord james had followed
him with anxious eyes and seeing him thus
suddenly in the power strangers they instinctively
thought that the readiest way 
extricating him from the danger into which
he had fallen was to make towards the defenceless
ladies conceiving that by so doing
they would probably draw off the main part
 the guard by whom he was surrounded
and thereby afford him a chance to escape
you have been rash lady said the
lord james when he found himself environed
by her train on all sides i meant
you no harm and surely my concern for sithe
spaewife 
bill to whom i have caused as you say so
much sorrow ought not to have been thus
promptly visited by an arrestment which may
bring my head to the axe you have however
made me your prisoner lady and i
submit to you as such
if i did not know the cunning that is in
you james stuart exclaimed the countess
i would repent me this but until sibill
is safe i will not trust to your protestations

safe my lady she is free and i am
your prisoner
i would it ware indeed so replied the
countess see your men have her in their
power 
but you may soon have her with you
said stuart with a smile shall i order the
ladies to be brought hither 
 i may not trust you said the countess
eagerly i cannot be answerable to my
brother macdonald if i bring his daughter
 the spaewife
into the risk being with you situated as
you now are
you cherish a harsh opinion me said
the lord james gravely this encounter
is accidental and having no warrant nor authority
to arrest me why do you deal so
hardly by me in truth lady i throw
myself upon the compassion and clemency 
your sex consider in what situation sibilla
and i so lately stood you say that the ruin
which has fallen upon me has pierced her
heart and blighted her happiness i do assure
you by the honour my knighthood
that she cannot suffer more for me than i do
for her this meeting has indeed made me
know what it is to be unfortunate do with
me however as you plea se g ive me up to
my enemies carry me to them in sibilla's
company it is meet that she who was to be
my bride should see me taken to the scaffold
for to that consummation i doubt not my
misfortunes will now come but lady
the spaewife 
you will not so far forego the gentleness 
your own nature as to do all that you will
still commiserate the fate that has divided me
from sibilla and permit us before we are
for ever separated to bid each other farewell 
will you order your train then to retire
 said the countess with hesitation
undoubtedly replied the lord james
eagerly and he desired a gentleman the
guard by whom he was surrounded to go for
one his men
when this storm has blown over said
he addressing himself again to the countess
surely macdonald will allow the marriage
to proceed
it is broken off for the present replied
the countess coldly but what have you
to say to sibilla 
the lord james smiled as he said a
lady so renowned for beauty and lovers
as the countess ross has been needs no
answer to that question but it cannot be
 the spaewife
that you intend we shall take farewell before
so many spectators 
i will not permit her to be out my
sight i know what you are james stuart
and the desperation your fortunes is not
likely to make you less adventurous than you
were before
while this was passing the rossman
whom the lord james had sent to his train
came back with one them and his master
ordered him to bid his fellows bring the ladies
forward
not so not so exclaimed the countess
 your train shall not come nigh us w
the man halted and looked towards his
master
you put ill thoughts into my head
lady said the lord james and turning to
the servant he added u then let the ladies
come by themselves
send off your men rejoined the countess
anxiously whereon he said aloud
spaewife 
tell them to retire but in giving this
order he glanced his eye to the hill and the
river which the countess observing clapped
her hands as the man rode off and exclaimed
 we are undone 
you allow your terrors lady to overcome
the wisdom and discretion for which
you are so justly renowned said the lord
james coolly and raising his bridle he moved
his horse close to her palfrey which as if by
accident he touched so sharply with his spur
that it bolted and almost threw her from the
saddle the confusion which this alarm
occasioned caused an opening in the circle
 horses round the prince through which
he suddenly darted into the rapid river and
soon gained the opposite bank in the same
moment the man who had carried the message
to his train having alighted seized the
lady sibilla by the waist and threw her up
before one his companions who instantly
galloped off with her to the castle
 the paewipe
the outcries the panic the rushing into
the river the trampling the flight and the
consternation which these headlong incidents
at once produced is not to be told but the
countess ross before she could rein her
paltry found herself alone the prisoner
flown her niece carried off and her train
scattering themselves at full speed on both
sides the river in pursuit the fugitives
the spaewix 
chap xi
leaving for a time the lord james stuart
and the lady sibilla macdonald to the uncertainty
 their fortunes it is expedient to
consider what in the meantime was doing
elsewhere as soon as the earl atholl
bad arrived at scone the king held a session
 the council at which it was determined
to proceed against the prisoners without
any respect to their propinquity by
whom this advice was urged whether it
was a suggestion his majesty's own wisdom
or insinuated by the earl atholl
has not been divulged but in consequence
thereof a high and solemn tribunal for the
trial duke murdoch with his fatherinlaw
and two sons all then in custody was ordered
to be formed and held at stirling
 the spaewife
whereat the king in person should preside in
his regal estate
in coming forth from the councilchamber
after this austere resolution his majesty took
hold the earl atholl by the arm and
they walked together in the verdant meadows
that lie between the abbeypalace scone
and the swirling waters the river tay
it was a pleasant afternoon and the greenventured
spring sat smiling in her arbour 
budding wands and interwoven boughs with
many a sweet blossom in her lap and a young
bird on her finger which she was teaching to
hop and sing
while the king and his uncle the earl
were walking along sedately discoursing 
the cares which then oppressed the royal
mind and weighing in the scales discreet
reason the considerations that had prevailed
at the councilboard touching the high crimes
and misdemeanours duke murdoch's family
his majesty would often stop and look
the spaewfe 
around and sigh as he inhaled the fragrant
freshness the free air and beheld the farseen
mountaincoronal breadalbane then
glowing like the purple amethyst to the setting
sun for in his youth he was wont to
sit in an ancient turret the towers his
captivity enjoying the gladdening sense 
liberty in the contemplation the bright and
broad freedom that lies in the boundless expanse
 the view from windsorhill
what eye v said he to the earl can
look on this fair scene without delight and
what heart think the misrule that makes it
scarcely fit for the abode man without anger
and sorrow r
your highness replied athos has
but to go on with your intents aggressions
restrained justice impartially awarded and
offences punished will soon make it worthy
 the beauty it has received from heaven
and i will go on yes by the help 
god though i should myself lead the life 
vol i f
 the spaewife
a dog i will make the key keep the castle
and the bush protect the cow but it is a
dreadful thing that the first my task should
require such severity towards my own kin w
is your majesty then really resolved to
bring the prisoners to trial said atholl
with a look that betokened some latent purpose
in the question but the king not heeding
his manner for he esteemed his uncle beyond
all his counsellors replied frankly
is it not so decided can you doubt
it give me leave to say my lord that i
was not altogether content with you today
had the duke done nothing else than stript
the crown the lands which he has squandered
on his partizans he had done enough
to deserve the heaviest punishment long
must the kingdom rue the consequences 
the poverty that he has entailed on your
kings he has not left us the means to reward
the fidelity a menial how shall weever
be able to keep in check the arrogance
the spaewife 
 a nobility so accustomed to rapine we
have neither the means to make it their interest
to serve us nor wherewithal to enforce
their allegiance yes my lord i am resolved
to go on and i look to your able and
experienced wisdom for encouragement and
support
 but surely replied the earl should
they be found guilty as i doubt not they
must it cannot be your majesty's intention to
bring them to punishment 
why not exclaimed the king surprised
at the remark do you think that
out any consideration for the power their
friends or any foe i shall be afraid to do
my duty
i but thought said atholl humbly
u that as they are so near kin to your
majesty their lives might be spared
they are not yet found guilty at least
according to law replied the king a bat
if they were justice knows not propinquity
 the spaewipe
the proceedings against them however shall
be open and before all the world no man
shall accuse me in this stern business 
being actuated by malice or any other base
motive though the trial will perhaps bring
disgrace on our blood it shall yet be a proud
thing for scotland and a glorious vindication
 her longabused justice
i cannot however but grieve for duke
murdoch said the earl with a sorrowful
cadence he is my cousin
so is he mine interrupted the king
and i grieve that he is so because he has
proved himself so bad a man and his vice
wants the grace bravery for it seems almost
questionable whether his weakness or
wickedness is most in fault the nation might
have pardoned his misrule but humanity
can never forgive the licentiousness in which
he has indulged his sons as a kinsman
my lord i have more cause to grieve
for them than you for by their deaths i
the spaewife 
can gain nothing which may not be obtained
by the forfeiture their estates but you will
come so much nearer the throne
the countenance the earl changed at
the observation and he looked troubled and
cast down his eyes saying 
your majesty cannot suppose that any
consideration that kind would to me
lighten the thought the sad destiny which
inevitably awaits so many friends 
he would have proceeded to say something
still more calculated to win the king's
charitable interpretation the compassion
which he had shown throughout for the misfortunes
 the house albany but just at
that moment anniple dunblane rushed
from behind a hollybush nigh to where they
were then standing
king james was not only startled by this
sudden obtrusion but filled with wonder at
the wildness her small bright piercing eyes 
and his wonder grew to awe as she placed
 the spaewife
herself immediately before him and leaning
with both hands on a rude sapling which
served her for a staff gazed steadily at him
for some time and then looked round to
atholl with an expression pleasure so
ghastly charnel and yet triumphant that the
king shuddered and hastily turned away
from the contemplation an object too hideous
mystical and undaunted to be seen in
that mood without astonishment mingled with
horror
she is a poor harmless natural said
the earl observing the revolting effect which
she had produced on the king but the
country folk regard her with superstitious re
terence
i do not wonder at their dread said his
majesty solemnly but come my lord let
us return to the palace
stop cried anniple and advancing upto
the king she laid her staff softly on his
shoulder as he moved away atholl surthe
spaewife 
prised at this bold familiarity ran forward
and pushed it off and at the same moment the
king who was not less amazed turned round
u stop james stuart she resumed dropping
the her staff on the ground
what would you said the king willing
to indulge her infirmity and struck with
sore pity at the remnants beggary which
hung around but hid not the anatomy her
shrunken and withered form
ye wear the crown and the velvet gown
cried anniple to his majesty and i have buta
blanket and a boodle but for all the lands 
badenoch atholl breadalbane strathern
and stratford i would change my build in
dunblane kirkyard for your bonny queenlady's
silken bower to dree the penance that
she maun dree
and wherefore would ye not said the
king however she gave no heed to the
question but dropping her eyes and speaking
to herself she murmured out
 the spaewifb
often i have sat on the town braehead
and seen the reek o the happy townhouses
and great my een sair that the illdeeds fairies
had made me to live and to be without any
kind mother and often in the blithe summer
nights when other weans were leaping w
gladness at through the needleee and would
na let me play wf them i yearned to steal
some holy abbot's purse to buy myself a wee
singing sister or a brother but it's weel
for me i may say now that i never had and
never can know the peril kith and kin
the earl athos whole frame was
shaken to so great a degree as she uttered this
disconsolate soliloquy that notwithstanding
the fascination with which such extreme
wretchedness had arrested the king's attention
he observed his emotion and said
i wonder not she says so for the whole
country cannot but sorrow that i am forced
to proceed so cruelly against so many that
should have been my best friends
the spaewife 
the earl was unable to answer or was
perhaps prevented by his surprise at the freedom
with which anniple went close to the
king and raising his surcoat aside touched
him on many parts the body with her
finger
what is this for said the king adding
to the earl let her alone my lord i am
not afraid any spells
eightandtwenty bloody wounds i see
them all and the hands that bear the knives 
let me look at your's lord atholl exclaimed
anniple and suddenly grasping him
firmly by the right wrist she looked at his
hand and alternately at something about
the king 
yours is not among them my lord
and she dropt the hand carelessly at that
moment two officers came hastily towards
them and anniple darted away
messengers said one the officers
have arrived from glasgow with tidings 
f
iso the spaewife
a rebellion in lennox headed by the lord
james stuart and the bishop argyll
what already in such power exclaimed
the king you see my lord atholl how
much our worthy kinsmen show themselves
deserving mercy this is the submission
you and others undertook the lord james
would send in but no matter his quickness
in ill shall not outrun our justice let
us return to the palace and call the council
together again it is demanded us at
once to quench this treason and to bring the
other traitors to their audit else the wild woman's
prediction may be too soon fulfilled
the spaewifb 
chap xii
but it was not from the lord james stuart
and bishop finlay only that the king had
cause to fear adversaries in arms against his
determination to administer justice without
respect persons or kin all the adherents
 the house albany there was
not one so bold a spirit as the sir robert
gramme before spoken and no sooner
was it known that he had made his peace
by submission and had been delivered from
durance than he was expected to show himself
in his true colours and so it came to
pass for in the same hour in which he was released
from custody he began to plan devices
and stratagems to revenge the wrong which
in his own notion he had sustained and also
partly to show his gratitude for the manifold
 the spaewife
favours which he had received at the hands
both the regent robert and duke
murdoch
though a man singular obduracy in
his lawless undertakings and ruthless bold
and bloody beyond any other chieftain 
his time yet sir robert held the virtues 
friendship in such esteem that he used to say
as it is the duty all men to support the sufferer
in a just cause so in like manner is it the
duty friends to stand by one another bethe
cause quarrel right or wrong
his first endeavours were directed to
achieve the deliverance the lord walter
stuart from the bass where as it is already
told he had been sent on his arrest for secure
ward for the lord walter being a knight
 undaunted valour in enterprise stout 
heart strong limb and dauntless in danger
it was thought no castle on the main land was
redoubtable enough to contain so subtle and
intrepid a spirit
the spaewife 
gramme was chiefly moved to think first 
the lord walter on account his offence
against the king having been a more open
and daring description than the treasons imputed
to his father and brothers many holy
churchmen had besides accused him riotous
extortions and sacrilegious pillage and gentlemen
 good ancestry charged him with irremediable
outrages in their families moreover the
pious lady abbess the nunnery at north
berwick had with her own pen written to
bishop wardle st andrews that it was
not to be told what the lord walter stuart
and his reprobate companions had perpetrated
in her house
but as the bass stands far in the sea and
is difficult access from a boat save when
the winds are propitious gramme was for
some time perplexed to know in what manner
he could convey his mind and intents to the
prisoner at last he bethought him an
expedient very bold and perilous but the
 the spaewife
more recommended to him by the bravery it
demanded
he hired at the south queen ferry a boat
and mariners purposing as he gave out to
pass thither to frail and thence to st andrews
in fulfilment a vow which he had
made in prison as if it was a thing within the
compass chance that sir robert gramme
should have in sincerity ever any pilgrimage
 piety to perform and having embarked
therein the mariners spread the sails a lively
breeze was then blowing from the westward
and the boat rushed before the wind as if it
had been instinct with eagerness to reach her
port but as she approached inch keith
gramme began to feign afraid the waves
he that knew not what fear was and to picture
rising blasts and raging seas such as no man
in his right mind as he said ought that evening
to encounter by dint which and exhortations
following thereon he caused the
mariners to take shelter under the lea the
the spaewife 
island in the hope that the wind would in
the course the night abate for in vain did
they assure him there was no danger and represented
that kirkcaldy was a safer haven
since he was not content to continue his voyages

under the eastern cliff inch keith they
lay till the sun was set and the lights on the
shore and the stars in the lift were kindled
the moon but four days old was setting in
the clouds over the pentlandhills and seemed
as if she was trailing from the sea a long
and rippled line cold and watery light for
though sir robert gramme still would maintain
that the waves were too rough for his
small bark to encounter the mariners saw
that they were but twinkling in the moonshine
like the wimpling a running river
when the moon had sunk behind the hills
and the land lay black between the restless
sea and the starry sky gramme ordered the
sails to be again spread but when the maris
the spaewife
news as their course lay steered in towards the
coast fife he rose in wellacted displeasure
and accused them not only having lost their
way but making for the lothian coast
they protested that they could not be mistaken
that the darkness was not so thick but
they could discern the landmarks and beseeched
him to have confidence in their knowledge
and skill
he was not however to be appeased by their
protestations on the contrary the more they
controverted his opinion his anger waxed the
fiercer and he insisted that if they would not
go on as he ordered they should return
they told him it was then too late to return
for the tide was drifting down but at
last by oaths and imprecations they were induced
to keep more out in a southerly course
to sea and towards morning the bass isle
grey and dark was seen rising over the starboard
before them
gramme affected great alarm when he beheld
the spaewife 
the lofty rugged cliffs and heard the heavy
noise the dashing sea and the clouds
 the cawing seabird that hovered around
the rocks and he sullenly inquired as one
that fears the name the island to which
they had betrayed him
when they told him it was the bass he affected
for a time a wild and fearful perplexity
saying alas what shall become me 
have i been set free from the pleasant heights
 stirling but to be immured on these doleful
rocks then he suddenly seemed to
recollect himself saying u but sir patrick
warburton the constable is a true and loyal
knight i will tell him in what manner this
misfortune has come upon us steer therefore
to the landingplace i will crave his aid
the mariners well knew that there was
eminent hazard to all who dared to approach
that prisonisle when there was any person 
dignity incarcerated there and again would
fain have refused the order saying that
 the pabwife
north berwick was so hard by that he needed
not to go to the bass but only to steer
straight to that port he however drew
his sword and wounded one them in the
arm for daring disobedience to his commands
after the peril they had caused him to pass
and the jeopardy into which they had brought
him so the men became afraid and thinking
he was not in his right mind ceased to
reason with him but submitted themselves to
do whatsoever he desired accordingly he
having ordered them to make for the landingplace
they lowered their sails and plied their
oars with great vigour and when the boat
was brought under the wall gramme made a
sad memorial to the guard what he had
suffered from his contumacious and unskilful
crew entreating the soldier to inform the cons

stable sir patrick warburton who he was
whence he had come and whither he was
going and to crave his hospitality until some
other bark could be obtained to take him to
the spaewife 
frail for farther than he had come he would
not go save in stress need with mariners
so unpractised as he had found those to be
who had brought him thither
sir patrick warburton on hearing this
plausible tale much commiserated the misadventure
 the petitioner and came himself
to the port and very courteously invited
gramme to land telling him however that
from his orders he must necessity hold him
prisoner till he received instructions from the
king
 i know replied gramme that you
cannot do otherwise and i am content to abide
with you it is indeed a thing not to bethought
that you sir patrick warburton
would let me go free knowing as doubtless
you do that i was so lately imprisoned on a
charge treason for as yet you cannot
have heard my pardon
sir patrick was much won by this seeming
frankness gramme and assured him that
 the spaewife
though he must hold him as a prisoner yet
should he be as free as himself and that he
would do all things in his power to make him
pleasant pastime till an answer came to the
report the incident his arrival
am i then the only prisoner on the rock
that you purpose to entertain me with such
freedom said gramme
no replied sir patrick it is not so 
the lord walter stuart is here
the lord walter stuart exclaimed
gramme as if in great amaze is he not yet
at liberty i am grieved to hear that for you
know sir patrick we are near kin and
buthe need not be told by what accident i
am here for it is not fit we should hold any
communion together it would be an ill
return for the king's grace to me were i to
hold any intercourse with one that stands so
justly under the cloud his royal displeasure


you speak sir robert gramme replied
the spaewife 
sir patrick as a gentleman and a true
knight who has received a great boon from
his majesty but there can be no harm in
visiting your kinsman in my presence in
sooth he has late begun to take his condition
much to heart and to fret impatiently at
his fortune
nay sir patrick it must not be so i
will not offer myself to the company the
lord walter said gramme but you may
tell him that i am on the rock and it will be
cheering news i well know when he hears i
have been pardoned
thus with welldissembled policy as they
were ascending from the landingplace to the
castle did gramme gain upon the confidence
 the constable who was an aged knight 
unspotted honour and who executed his harsh
office in so mild a manner as to snake captivity
appear beneath his power almost as gracious
as hospitality
 the spaewife
chap xiii
when sir patrick warburton had conducted
gramme into his own chamber in the castle
and ordered a repast to be set before him he
then went and told the lord walter by
what accident his kinsman had been thrown
on the island on coming back to gramme
they fell into discourse concerning the events
 the timethe constable informing his
wily guest many things which though he
knew well he yet affected not to know esse
dally in what related to the disgrace and disasters
that had fallen on the proud house 
albany
beshrew me sir robert gramme said
sir patrick it is not kind nor courteous
 you to be so near your kinsman
and not visit him i shall offend no orthe
spaewife 

der in allowing you to see him for though
my prisoner i am not commanded to enforce
upon him any unusual restraint poor gentleman
 since he heard the rigorous arrest
 his father and brother he has begun to
droop apace i have told him how perforce
you have been driven hitherindeed
 replied gramme you would
not thereby add to his comfort for knowing
the peril treason in which i so lately stood
myself he must have marvelled at learning i
was here 
not at all not at all said sir patrick
at first he seemed a little surprised and
was thoughtful but he soon brightened and
begged that i would let you come to him
it grieves me sir patrick warburton
said the treacherous and wary gramme that
he should have made a request so indiscreet
what can he have to say to me that may
not be transmitted by you it would only
multiply the dangers into which he has fallen 
 the spaewife
were we to hold any communion together
how does he bear with his prison though
to be incarcerated is great adversity to one 
such accustomed bodily activity yet is he
withal fortunate compared with the close
durance that his father suffers at carlaverock
under sir ralph maxwell whose insolence
to all that come within the ward his
keys you doubtless must have often heard 
as for edmonstone who had charge those
that were with me in stirling i vow to god
he has not the ruth a highland shore
he kept us apart in cells as if we had been
savage beasts not christian men and made
our dungeons echo with threats that he durst
not have breathed to his own fancy in the
free daylight
aye sir robert gramme replied the
governor we are all in our trusts too
prone to prove our power but surely it becomes
not the honour knighthood to exasperate
the griefs the defenceless for
the spaewife 
my pant i think the least my duty as constable
 the bass is the safe custody the
unfortunate men committed to my care i
feel myself bound to employ all charities
wherewith anguish may be alleviated and
privation solaced to soften and sweeten the
hardships their lot truly it is to me sir
robert matter affliction that you will not
visit your gallant kinsman but if you will
hot go to his chamber with me you cannot
restrain me from bringing him hither it is a
grace that i cannot deny myself nay though
it may at this time move your displeasure i
am sure hereafter i shall stand the higher
fort in your good opinion
with these words sir patrick warburton
clapped his hands thrice and an officer 
the guard coming into the room he said
go to the lord walter stuart and entreat
for me the honour his presence nay
sir robert it must not be that you will go
away i pray you be seated again

 the sbabwiee
on the appearance the officer gramme
had risen seemingly with the intention retiring
but the earnest manner in which the
old knight addressed him laying at the same
time his hand upon his arm and pressing
him with the familiarity good fellowship
into his chair obligated him to remain
during the time this hospitable contest
the officer with three men the guard proceeded
to the chamber where the lord waller
was confined and airing delivered the courteous
message from the constable they returned
bringing him with them and entered the
room just at the moment when his kinsman had
resumed his seat and before sir patrick had
again taken his chair at the the board
hearing the clank arms approaching
the door which was presently thrown open
gramme looked round and beheld the officer
with a link in his hand ushering the prisoner
who came behind him from a long dark gallery
towering in the port and pride a
the paewife 
princely maohoedhe thee soldiers following
in the obscurity his shadow their sans
gleaming dimly in die light and their fierce
visages scowling more fiercely half lighted
half hid tes the troubled flame the link
filmed in the currents die wind
sir patrick haliburtam in homage to his
highborn prisoner rose from his seat and
grace also rose but there was an eagerness
in his manner that betrayed the animation 
some feeling far different from the respectfulness
 the aged constable
the officer on entering the room stepped
aside as the noble prisoner came forward and
the three soldiers filled the door
the lord walter stuart was then in the
prime youthful vigour his stature was
majestical and his complexion tinged with
the dark blood his royal race was so
brightened with the ruddy hue health and
hardy pastimes that he was justly accounted
one the comeliest knights in all scot
 the sfaewife
land his eyes were bold and bright and a
pleasant arrogance in his smile that bespoke
admiration and homage suited well with his
proud demeanour and manly beauty
bang a prisoner lie had neither dirk nor
sword nor baton but he wore his breastplate
 brass inlaid with many a curious device 
silver representing thistles and fleursdelis
lions and griffins and other honourable augmentations
and pageantries arms and chivalry
his surcoat was green genoese
velvet lined with yellow silk and he wore a
costly ruff many folds adorned with oversea
embroidery round his neck and on his head
a black gascon cap looped up over the right
temple by a golden clasp fastened to a rich
knot garnets and other glittering stones
through which an eagle's feather was stuck
as it were with a careless brave r 
as he stepped towards the table he glanced
aside significantly to gramme who apparently
with a cold indifference returned
she spasm 
the salutation and he stretched out his hand
frankly to the constable and passing round
the board took a seat at his right hand
i shall not know warburton said he
how to repay you for all these civilities
but i did not expect from what you had
told me that i should be permitted to approach
so penitent a proselyte as my kind
cousin there
the taunt in this speech was deprived 
all offence by the look with which it was explained
to gramme who replied
it cannot be lord walter that you
imagine i was not sorely grieved to hear
when freed from confinement myself you were
still a prisoner in this place but the accident
which obliged me to take refuge here was so
extraordinary that under all circumstances
you cannot my lord but acknowledge i
should have acted most unwisely both in re
sped to your condition and my own had i in
any degree been forward to seek your com
 she aewxre
pony sir patrick there will attest that i
gave tp ha goad and sufficient reasons why
i ought not to visit you and if any ill henceforth
arise twa our being brought in this
manner together i must be acquitted all
blame
nobody will impute to sir robert gramme
any motive beyond what he professes replied
the prisoner with a smile that his kinsman
understood an followed and
the echoes that dwell in the abbeycrags and
in the valley and the cliffs denied sulk
spaewife 
lely responded to the sound then a dreadful
voice made proclamation some terrible
event but the tenour thereof she could not
hear nor was there any response
the bell tolled again and again there was
silence and a second stroke fell more heavily
than the first and the dreadful voice again
made proclamation
again the bell tolled and then there was a
rushing sound as parting waters in the
midst which sibilla heard the deathaxe
fall a third time but when the voice the
executioner began again to make proclamation
a shriek so wild so howling and so full
 sorrow arose from the multitude that she
felt as if the very earth shuddered at the
sound and swinging powerless from her hold
sank to the floor in a swoon

the body the lord walter after his execution
had been carried to the abbey 
to abide the king's pleasure
and when the sentence the law had been
fulfilled on the other illfated princes the
earl athos came to his majesty to confer
with him concerning them
w their lives replied the king have
satisfied justice see therefore i pray you
that their remains are interred as befits their
rank it is not however meet that persons
who die attainted in their blood and dignities
should be allowed the pageantries heraldry
let them have honourable but private burial
in that replied the earl your majesty
wisely anticipates the opinion your
council and with permission being myself
the spaewife 
the nearest their kin i will attend a chief
mourner
the king abruptly raised his left hand
from the table at which he was sitting as if he
had been startled by the proposal but suddenly
subduing the surprise the moment
he replied
no my good uncle that were too much
as you are now presumptive heir to the crown 
for the life the lord james not only as a
partner in his father and his brother's treasons
but for his own rebellion in lennox
stands doubly forfeited for them you cannot
grieve for they have suffered justly
albeit pity sued earnestly for them especially
for poor old lennox it becomes not therefore
the state in any its members to seem
to mourn for them princes in their dignity
should have no respect to kin but sofar
you may shew sufficient sympathy for
our illfated cousins by bearing yourself
my command to the abbot cambusken
 tee spaewife
teeth to the that with his brethren he
perform the obsequies tonight as if he knew
only the rank and nothing the offence
 the deceased 
the earl had been so overtaken by the
quickness the king's amaze at his suggestion
that he stood somewhat rebuked while
his majesty was speaking in so much that
the king thinking his command to the abbot
 cambuskenneth was deemed not enough to
ensure a becoming pageant added
the world my lord can expect no
more from me i would have them interred
as christian men noble birth not remembering
they are executed traitors but i
cannot consent that their funeral should bear
the ostentation which belongs to im attainted
princes
i beseech your majesty said the earl
to permit some other messenger to bear
your orders to the abbot for as in your
wisdom your majesty had discerned that z
the spaewife ot
i
should not appear in the ceremony i hope
it tay stand with your pleasure to spare me
also from that duty
the king mused for the space a minute
and then replied
i lay my command upon you in order to
shew the abbot how much i shall expect 
his houses but even now you would have
undertaken to be chief mourners
he earl bowed and saying it shall be
as your majesty desires retired and went
forthwith to the abbey whither the bodies
had in the meantime been carried and according
as the king had desired and expected
the abbot ordered a wide grave to be prepared
in front the altar the abbeychurch
in which at midnight with many
chants and holy requiems the interment was
performed
at the conclusion the solemnity the
earl athos who had remained a spectator
left the church to return to the abbeygate
 the spaewife
where his horse and servants were in attendance
in passing over the tombs and graves
which lay in his way he stopped unconsciously
and looked up to the calm and cloudlees
moon that in her loneliness seemed as it
were the visible and embodied beauty tranquillity
and silence but almost in the same
instant a cold and skinny hand took firmly
hold his and on hastily looking round
he beheld the charnelhouse visage the
spaewife at his shoulder
what think you now my lord athos 
said anniple did na i tell you that after
five burials ye would be a crowned king and
this night there has been four them p when
king james is dead ye'll wear the crown but
i wish you meikle gude o for ye have na
pay me yet for that grand spacing
the earl on seeing who it was that had
seized his hand so familiarly said
why anniple you do not reckon well 
the five funerals have all been performed
the spaewife 
the regent robert's long ago and the four
we have this night seen
ha exclaimed the spaewife do ye
keep count 
the earl shuddered from head to foot at
the searching glance with which she thus penetrated
the secret abysses his spirit in a
moment however he recovered his selfpossession
and the fantastical creature began to
chatter her teeth and to chuckle with expectation
holding out her hand saying buta
gift a grace and a grant my lord one
two and three
there take that and begone replied the
earl giving her a piece money
this is an alios but no y
but said athos and he looked apprehensively
around you must tell me seriously
who is to succeed king james 
anniple started back at the question and
raised her hand flutteringly for a moment as
if to admonish him suddenly however re
 the spaewife
collecting herself she again held out her
hand saying have na i told you long
ago and syne that ye're to be a crowned
king and yet ye grudge to pay me for the
tidings though ye have had this night four
beheaded men in their bloody windingsheets
testifying that as sure as death is it's a thing
that shall be
thou art an importunate beggar replied
the earl struggling to overcome the
impression which her language had produced
 and i am surprised that you get admission
at such a time night to this place
it's a the house i have lord athos
since the wicked bishop o dunblane part his
foul servitor rive down the bonny bower that
i bigger inysep between his kirkyard and the
wimpling burn o it was a blithe and a winsome
place the waters afore the door ran
unking and dancing and swirling and
whirling like blithe barnes at their chaffing
my douce baudrons lay on my lap singing
the paewjlf 

cuttycrumb frae dawn to dark poor thing 
it had but that ae sang to pleasure me and 
true tyke was like a brother the deify
dame will surely some day make kail o the
monk's carcass that ruggit the roofs and
rafters frae my bower and felt wi a rung
my kind lessen for biting his leg at the
herring for nobody thrives that does ill
to anniple dunblane so pay your debt
my lord and be an honest man or
 what will you do 
hi maybe space a your fortune
the earl flung his purse into her bosom
and hurried from the churchyard

while those terrible tragedies were acting at
stirling the duchess albany was removed
as a prisoner from her pleasant inland palace
at falkland to the strong seawarded fortalice
 pantaloon for it was thought by all men
that her high mindedness would not patiently
suffer such an entire dilapidation her house
but would prompt her to stir up the friends
 her lord and her father to attempt some enterprise
 rescue or intimidation the apprehension
however the machinations and
treasons in which they had been engaged lay
heavy on her heart and instead feeling
the stern instigation revenge her majestic
spirit was weighed down with the persuasion
 their guilt and amidst its fears and mourning
did homage to justice still she was not
the spaewife 
bereft all hope but trusting to the ties 
kindred she soothed herself with the notion
that whatever might be the issue the trials
the king out respect for his own blood
would surely never suffer execution to follow
sustained by this fond flattery she preserved
her equanimity and even when the morning
 the lord walter's trial came she rose with
a serene countenance and only remained a
little longer than she was wont at her orisons
towards the evening however she became
restless and moved to and fro in her chamber
sometimes halting suddenly at others
pacing the floor with wild gestures and perturbed
steps and teddy glenjuckie the
only one her gentlewomen who had been
permitted to accompany her albeit a loquacious
humour was so touched with dread
when she beheld these outward symptoms 
the inward anguish that she sat apart ruminating
in silence
at her accustomed hour the duchess re
 the spaewife
tired to her couch but not to rest she wondered
that no news came from stirling and
sometimes her wishes made her interpret this
lack tidings into an auspicious omen in
this state the solemn hours the night passed
away but sleep came not to her tearful eyelids
at the grey dawn she was seen slowly
pacing the battlements casting many a wistful
look towards the west and ever and anon
breathing the low sigh sadness as she saw
afar off the brightening summit the mountain
at the foot which stood the towers 
falkland that home which had been whitened
by the innocency her children and which
with them she was destined never to behold
again
all day she was by fits touched as it were
with frenzy still in the midst pf those fearful
pangs the fortitude her spirit never
departed and when the tear was shed and
the shock over she appeared as august and
serene as if neither the alarms a daughter
the spaewife 
a wife nor a mother had any dominion within
her bosom and she sat at the window 
her chamber in the western tower and beheld
the sun set and the evening close and
the stars lighted up and the moon arise calmly
awaiting the consummation her fate but
still no messenger came and still the hope
that wrestled with her and would fly away
she continued to detain with a fond and endearing
struggle at last soon after midnight
the sound a buglehorn was heard at
the gate it made her start from her seat
with the intent rushing to the warder's
tower to hear who at that time sought admission
but ere she had half way passed
across the floor she checked her precipitation
and returning sedately to her seat desired
her gentlewoman to order candles to
be brought for till that occurrence she
had all the evening remained without any
other light than the moonbeams through the
casement
 the spaewife
scarcely had the menial in attendance
placed the lights on the table when the captain
 the castle entered and said that a
herald had arrived from stirling and demanded
admission the captain though an
austere old shorter faultered as he delivered
the message and avoided her eyes 
give him admittance i have longed
for his coming exclaimed the duchess rising
hastily let him come in let him
come inwhatever his tidings or his office
may be
the captain turned quickly round and
hastened out the room her gentlewoman
who had observed his emotion retired
to a corner and sat down but the duchess
continued standing
after a brief interval the captain returned
with the herald who trembled exceedingly
as he approached towards her with a letter in
his hand she saw the paper and snatched
it eagerly from him but instanter the fortithe
spaewlfe 
tide her spirit recovered its firmness and
without breaking the seal she walked deliberately
to the candle
the herald who had knelt down to present
the letter at the moment when she took
it from him continued on the floor and
seemed wrapt with amazement when he beheld
her open it and peruse it without trepidation

it is all over now said the duchess
when she had read the fatal intelligence
they have all suffered the sentence the
law a slight flutter moved her kerchief as
she said these words but she laid the letter
on the table and turning to the herald who
had risen from his kneeling she added with
a struggling voice if they deserved to die
their doom was just sir have you any
other business here
the herald was unable to make any reply
but bowed as one that is before the hallowed
shrine some glorious martyr and retired
vol i n
s the spaewife
followed by the captain who seemed in haste
to quit the room but before leaving it he
turned round and for a moment looked at
her grace with scarcely less than religious
reverence and then hurried away
the duchess till they were gone moved
not from the spot where she was standing
near the table but when the door was shut
and none present but her gentlewoman she
raised her hands distractedly and with the
wildest note desolate misery cried god
help me and rushed into an inner room
the spaewife 
chap xxvii
it eatne to pass some time after the dolorous
events whereof recital has been made
that the king summoned the states the
realm to parliament at perth and thither
repaired sir robert gramme the fiercest adherent
 the faction the house albany
he grudged the frustration his design for
the deliverance the lord walter from
the bass isle as if it had been to himself an
insolent taunt or a galling injury and his
dread the king's justice was as a spur
to his revenge in so much that he pondered
by night and by day in what manner to
ratify a resentment that blood only could
quench yet though thus borne onward to
crime by the incitements destiny he was
nevertheless deterred from immediate vengethe
spaewife
once by considerations interest for even
in his wildest and worst passions this remorseless
conspirator ever had respect to his estate
it is true that the trials and execution 
the princes smote him with amazement but it
soon passed away and like the violent flame
that bursts forth after the brief damping 
oil cast upon the fire the fiend which possessed
him raged fiercer than ever
at perth he met with many the baronage
malcontent with the strict enforcement
 the royal authority which hampered them
in their feuds and forays and their other
hasty administrations redress in their own
specialities and finding them in this mood
he began afar off to work upon their distempered
minds
this method rule he was wont to
say which king james has learnt from our
old enemies the englishmay not in itself
i am free to acknowledge be wrong nay i
doubt not it accords passing well with the
the spaewife 
humour those for whom it was contrived
for with them charters and statutes have the
authority rights and justice but it suits
neither our usages nor the temperament 
scottish blood the english at any time
will rather seek another's help than serve
themselves and hence it is that they so
tamely leave their wrongs to the adjudications
 judges and juries but it is the nature
 every free and trueborn scot to do
his own business and accordingly from the
oldest times the monarchy our kings have
never had leave to meddle with the jurisdictions
 the chiefs and barons in verity i
should be glad to know how a travelling man
 law going from town to town with a 
under his arm like a pedlar can see into the
deservings illdoers so well as the lord
that lives among them and knows their habit
and is familiar with their repute by
such jurisprudence i grant that the act 
wrong may be well enough sifted but is it
 the spaewife
justice that the doer thereof should only be
punished for that particular act however bad
his forgone conduct may hare been for
my part i think the king's prerogative
should be upheld in all things but i do
not discern why it is that he has been so illadvised
as to treat his nobles as if they were
all alike and take from us the sword even
in our own defences when he may go to war
with the english or any other crown shall
we say to him he should not and are notour
chiefs and barons with respect to one
another as free to act as kings who are but
barons with a greater vassalage however
not to speak that which may be wrongfully
repeated to our prejudice who can tell
what will ensue by this new way taking
subsidies i do not say that king james
hath any ill intent in enriching his treasury
by taxes but if a king have money enough
to keep orders independent the service
 his vassals what man any degree can
the paewif 
then bra freedom or call aught his own
whether the thing be life limb or land 
by subtle discourses this bearing he so
beguiled them to his will that in the 
they appointed him to remonstrate with the
king against the inroads that were daily made
on their ancient privileges
 i shall not shrink in the task said he
but then you must be prepared to back my
endeavour for i doubt not the king will
 brook the representation and we all know
if he call it treason it is but another word
for death now i am not a man that will
be worried like a rabbit i will stand to
danger whatever it may be and i care not
what life may perish in defending my own
it is therefore needful to be prepared for
the worst and i should remind you that the
carl athos who has been always heart
and hand with the king in this newfangled
governance can never be a fit person to
 the spaewife
name for the regency should our adventure
come to that extremity
thus all thing were duly concerted for
executing at the opening parliament
what had been in this manner determined 
but when the king appeared on the throne
gramme transported with a sudden sting 
ire and malevolence forgot the policy he was
pledged to follow and rushing upon his majesty
cried aloud
i arrest you sir in the name the three
estates the realm here assembled for as
your people have sworn to obey you so are
you constrained by an equal oath to govern
them according to their laws and customs
and in saying this still grasping the king's
arm he turned round and said to the barons
and prelates there present is it not thus
as i say but even those his own faction
were so struck with consternation at his
rashness and so awed by the serenity which
the king preserved that they had not heart
the spabwife 
to give him any demonstration encouragement

take him to prison said his majesty
calmly and he was thereupon seized by the
arms and carriedaway bitterly upbraiding
the dastards for whom he had adventured so
daringly the business the session then
proceeded as if no such bold treason had
been attempted and when it was ended his
majesty having retired to his closet sent for
the earl athos to confer with him concerning
the outrage
i can discover said his majesty when
the earl was come before him that the austerity
 our impartial administration has
galled many among you else this audacious
sir robert gramme would not have ventured
to lay hands on the king in parliament
now as the all government should be
to cherish goodwill among the subjects
there must be some lack policy if not 
justice in the rigour our proceedings there

 the paewife
fore let us speedily redress the grievance i
will pardon gramme for by the bravery 
his attempt he matched himself as it were
only with me and since he was none seconded
i shall not let it be searched whether or
no he had any abettors
it may perhaps be as your majesty says 
but an outrage so flagrant is beyond pardon
if however the mercifulness your own
gracious nature plead for him surely it will
be enough to let him have his life the very
least that can be meted to him is banishment
and the forfeiture his estates
to so bold and bad a man as i have
heard even you my lord describe sir robert
gramme such a punishment would only be asa
license and warrant to work mischief 
it may be replied the earl that i have
spoken him in heat for he has ever been the
most turbulent the albany faction but
however that may have been it is not to bethought
even though your majesty be conthe
paewife 
tent to pardon the insulting treason done to
yourself that the states will overlook the
breach their own privileges
the king remained for several minutes
ruminating and silent and then said 
this affair troubles me i cannot altogether
pardon gramme without giving offence
to many the nobility and yet he is a man
 such a nature or i mistake the indications
 character that any measure punishment
however small will become with him a motive
for vengeance i would either deal with him
gently or not spare him at all
if replied the earl such be your
majesty's sentiment and you are not moved
in the business by any consideration your
own but only as the matter may effect the
public weal let the lesser punishment be tried
for whatever impression it may make on
gramme himself your royal clemency cannot
fail to prove most salutary upon others as
i doubt not there are abettors his treason

 the spaewite
who at this moment tremble for themselves
they will be glad to find their heads safe by
the leniency shown to him were he entirely
pardoned they would suspect it was done
but to gain time till their whole plot was
found out
there is something like reason in what
you say my lord and i will remit the matter
into your hands and yet i know not
how it is but i am not satisfied in compromising
any point policy with such a daring
offender as sir robert gramme and so saying
his majesty retired to his chamber and
the earl coming away through the cloister
met bishop wardle to whom he rehearsed
what had passed between him and the king
knowing that his majesty would probably 
his own accord tell him
i do almost lament saicpthe bishop
that your counsel in this case has prevailed
 and yet i would not have the traitor pardoned
for i know him well i know him by
the spaewife sett
a confession which he once made to me while
he was yet a mere youth scarcely bearded
confession did i call it a bravery rather
 crimes the subtile adder has not more
skill in finding venom to supply the malice 
her bite than that dreadful man in discovering
fit means and instruments for his atrocious
purposes
the earl made no answer to this but
seemed so thoughtful that the religious prelate
recollecting his consanguinity to gramme
endeavoured to soften the harsh opinion which
he had thus indignantly delivered
you are mistaken my lord bishop
said the earl i am not troubled by what
you have told me but i dread to think that
a spirit so implacable should be set at large
goaded with the sense punishment
it is nfctoo late to have him brought to
trial and condemned said the bishop
the earl gave a short shudder revolt as
sq the spaewife
it were at this but in a moment be replied
sedately
though i know gramme to be the
most daring and dangerous man at this time
within the realm scotland yet it cannot
stand with the king's honour to change
in his purpose towards him banishment and
the forfeiture his goods is the sentence that
will be executed
in advising that said bishop wardle
you have incurred a fearful responsibility
to this the earl made no answer and
the bishop discerning that what he had said
caused displeasure parted from him next
day when the states again assembled in parliament
sentence was recorded against gramme
as the earl athos had suggested but instead
 going into banishment he was no
sooner set free custody than he retired into
the wildest highlands and gave himself upto
wrath and revenge
the spaewife 
chap xxviii
one evening soon after the daring adventure
 the traitor gramme as the king was sitting
alone in his closet pondering his royal trusts
and the ordure that his name might have with
posterity he called sir william chrichton the
chancellor before him a man richly endowed
with wisdom grave temperate and yet withal
 an urbane disposition and said to him
there is a mission charity sir william
chrichton in which i would fain have
the help your good offices the forlorn
estate that noble lady the duchess 
albany is a thing that lies very sore upon
me whatever were the faults and offences
 her father her husband and her sons
verily she has had cause for great sorrow
and though justice might not mitigate the
 the spaewife
misfortunes that she hath borne yet pity
will constrain us to lighten to the utmost the
grief wherein she sits so disconsolate i pray
you therefore sir william go to her and
not only set her free from pantaloon but undertake
from me to restore to her whatever
she may desire the lands and heritage 
her family i give all to your wisdom and
discretion to act and to do for me as you
would wish to see done by one who would
earn without the abatement any present
duty the guerdon an honourable renown
hereafter
sir william chrichton did not make any
immediate response to this command but remained
thoughtful for some time in so much
that the king added 
lam grieved sir william that you take
time to consider this compassionate matter
you do not think in wishing to soften the rigorous
adversity that afflicts the duchess i
thereby manifest aught which the invidious
the spaewife 
world might in its malice or envy impute tome
as an acknowledgment haying done
wrong w
no replied the chancellor u far be
from me the thought that your majesty can
be swayed in any good or just or kind intent
by the awe those who look invidiously even
on the virtues princes but after the terrible
task justice which your majesty has achieved
it is meet to be considered whether the
time for remission and indulgence be yet
come the duchess albany is a lady
famed for an august spirit and a masculine
understanding fit it is said for the rule and
sovereignty a kingdom what has befallen
her family cannot but have struck sharply and
sorely into her heart and a necessity it
would seem she must bear against your majesty
an ireful and implacable mind for it is
the very nature ill fortune to stir up those
evil qualities in ourselves which but for adversity
might have slept unknown like the
 the spaewife
foul toad that lurks under the flower and is not
angered till the mower's scythe hath wounded
his back moreover your majesty would do
well to call to mind that her outlawed son the
lord james still lives and threatens what
he might do were his mother reinstated even
in no more than the earldom her father is a
thing that requires the wisdom all the
council to consider for what may be given
to her wilt be given to him and in him the
enemy has been but disarmed his animosities
burn as fiercely as ever and it were
well to weigh the consequence restoring to
him any portion his arms even though it
were no more than his dirk
i have thought all that sir william 
but we shall have done little for the peace 
the realm if we cannot venture to pity and
relieve the sufferings a poor widow truly
sir william it stands not with my honour if
after such sacrifices we may not do as we list in
those humanities which all men must approve
the spaewife t
no the safety the state shall be maintained
without respect to what may be done to lighten
the condition the duchess albany
i do therefore again say that you will do mea
kind service by undertaking this mission
sir william seeing the king so bent and
having noted withal the greatness his motives
in whatsoever he was minded to do
made no farther controversy but retired
and went forthwith to pantaloon and when
he was come thither he was conducted to
the chamber the duchess who was much
moved when she beheld him but without
expressing any sentiment the surprise wherewith
she was agitated she waved her hand
and pointing to a chair invited him to be
seated
after the lapse a short time in which
sir william remained as if he had expected
that she would inquire the object his visit
he began to speak the joyfulness with which
he had received the king's commands to asses
the spaewife
sure her grace the good will that his majesty
bore towards her and that he had already
delivered his orders to the constable to allow
her to quit the castle
and whither shall i go wjio will venture
to shelter one who is the daughter the
widow and the mother traitors alas
sir william chrichton you have brought meno
boon
but i am empowered to restore to you
all the lands lennox that pertained to the
earl your father
my father oh what have you done to
that poor infirm old man 
i am farther authorised to say that all the
dignities and titles honour which you have
derived from the duke your husband shall
be continued to you as heretofore
what the titles i the style as duchess
 albany as duke murdoch's wife n
every thing to the utmost pretext 
heraldry
the spaewife 
the duchess as he said this smiled but
with so much sadness in her look that the
chancellor was rebuked
dignities and titles sir william exclaimed
the duchess to the utmost pretext
 heraldry verily the king is royally munificent
he will give me the titles i had
with the duke wife was one them will
he restore that mother i was that too sir
william chrichton where is my princely
walter and my warm freehearted alexander 
 alas p cried the chancellor that i
should have so marred the king's kindness
the king's kindness cried the duchess
with a withering look oh who could
utter such a word to me my old greyheaded
father my husband my sonswhere are
they all the king's kindness oh sir
william chrichton when first i but tried to
call that kindness by the name justice the
mingled feelings the daughter wife and
mother revolted at the endeavour
i
 the spaewife
for some time the chancellor stood appalled
and pierced to the heart but when the
vehemence her grief had somewhat abated
he again protested his sorrow for having so
unwittingly touched her wounds and then
he began to speak the business on which
he had come soliciting to know what answer
he should bear to the king
tell him that when you offered me the
lands lennox i wept for my father when
you promised me the restoration the dignities
that belonged to me as a wife i asked
for my husband and when you told me 
his kindness kindness oh where are all
my children kindness i herod in his jealousy
slew but peevish infante mine were
princely men when the angry heavens
punished guilty egypt only the firstborn
were slain and daughters and mothers there
had fathers and husbands left to share their
sorrow but all are taken from me i think
sir william chrichton that i could have willthe
spaewife 
ingle parted with one to have redeemed the
others but oh to take them all with one
stroke to fell all my flourishing grove the
merciless thunderbolt is satisfied with a single
tree but surely i am made some insensate
element that i survive such desolation
and hear kindness niobe that lost but her
children wept herself to stone o murdoch
murdoch had i been that true wife which i
was once accounted i should have gone with
thee to prison no chiding for those fond
errors which have proved the ruin our gallant
boys would then have escaped my lips
but i would have taken thy head upon my
lap and soothed thee to sleep and shed no
tear neither for son nor father till that was
done methinks it would have been a far
easier endurance than what i now suffer to
have listened to the knelling their fetal
bell and to have gone with them to the scaffold
and seen the dreadful preparations for
then as the first axe lightened in the air
v
 the spaewife
surely sweet death would have closed my
eyes and i should never have heard it fall
sir william chrichton who had for sometime
struggled to suppress the anguish 
sympathy which he felt for her measureless
sorrow could no longer withstand these woeful
lamenting but hastily quitting the room
left the castle without completing the task 
his mission

postscript
there was a certain lysander whose name has
been preserved in one the proverbial sayings
 the greeks because he lived in continual fear
 seeing his own ghost how often have i seen
mine while arranging these volumes for publication
and carrying them through the press 
twenty years have elapsed since the intention
 composing them was conceived and the composition
commenced in what manner and in what
mood the reader will presently be made acquainted
the vicissitudes which in the course 
those years have befallen every country in europe
are known to every one and the changes
which during such an interval must have occurred
in a private family there are few who
may not from their own sad experience readily
apprehend
circumstances which when they were touched
vol i b
upon in these volumes were present importance
and excited a lively interest belong now
to the history the past they who were then
the great performers upon the theatre public
life have fretted their hour and disappeared
from the stage many who were living and flourishing
when their names were here sportively or
severely introduced are gone to their account
the domestic circle which the introduction describes
has in the ordinary course things been
broken up some its members are widely separated
from others and some have been laid to
rest the reader may well believe that certain
passages which were written with most joyousness
 heart have been rendered purely painful
to the writer by time and change and that some
 his sweetest thoughts come to him in chewing
the cud like wormwood and gall but it is a
wholesome bitterness
he has neither expunged nor altered anything
on any these accounts it would be
weakness to do this on the score his own remembrances
and in the case allusions to public
affairs and to public men it would be folly the
xi
almanac the current year will be an old one
as soon as next year begins
it is the writer's determination to remain unknown
 and they who may suppose that
by certain signs here set in sundry place
they have discovered him will deceive themselves
a welsh triad says that the three inconceivable
traits a person by which he shall be known
are the glance his eye the pronunciation 
his speech and the mode his selfmotion in
briefer english his look his voice and his gait
there are no such characteristics by which an
author can be identified he must be a desperate
mannerist who can be detected by his style
and a poor proficient in his art if he cannot at anytime
so vary it as to put the critic upon a false
scent indeed every dayes experience shews that
they who assume credit to themselves and demand
it from others for their discrimination in
such things are continually and ridiculously mistaken

on that side the author is safe he has a sure
reliance upon the honour as well as the discreet

tion the very few to whom he is naturally or
necessarily known and if the various authors
to whom the will be ascribed by report
should derive any gratification from the perusal
he requests them in return that they will
favour his purpose by allowing such reports
to pass uncontradicted

there had been a heavy thunderstorm in the
afternoon and though the thermometer had
fallen from to still the atmosphere was
charged if that mysterious power by which
the nerves convey sensation and make their impulses
obeyed be as experiments seem to indicate
identical with the galvanic fluid and if
the galvanic and electric fluids be the same as
philosophers have more than surmised and if
the lungs according to a happy hypothesis
elaborate for us from the light heaven this
pabulum the brain and material essence or
essential matter genius it may be that the
ethereal fire which i had inhaled so largely during
the day produced the bright conception or
at least impregnated and quickened the latent
seed the punch reader had no share in it
i had spoken as it were abstractedly and the
look which accompanied the words was rather
cogitative than regardant the bhow begum
laid down her snuffbox and replied entering
into the feeling as well as echoing the words
it ought to be written in a certainly it
ought 
they may talk as they will the dead languages
our auxiliary verbs give us a power
which the ancients with all their varieties mood
and inflections tense never could attain it
must be written in a said i encouraged by
her manner the mood was the same the tense
was the same but the gradation meaning was
marked in a way which a greek or latin grammarian
might have envied as well as admired
pshaw nonsense stuff said my wife's
eldest sister who was sitting at the right hand
 the bhow begum i say write it in a 
indeed my wife's youngest sister was sitting
diagonally opposite to the last speaker she lifted
up her eyes and smiled it was a smile which
expressed the same opinion as the late vituperative
tones there was as much incredulity in
it but more wonder and less vehemence
my wife w r as at my left hand making a cap for
her youngest daughter and with her 
workbox before her i turned towards
her and repeated the words it must be
written in a but i smiled while i was
speaking and was conscious that sort meaning
in my eyes which calls out contradiction for
the pleasure sporting with it
write it in a she replied i am
sure you wont and she looked at me with a
frown poets have written much upon their
ladies frowns but i do not remember that they
have ever described the thing with much accuracy
when my wife frowns two perpendicular
wrinkles each three quarters an inch in length
are formed in the forehead the base each
resting upon the top the nose and equidistant
from each other the poets have also attributed
dreadful effects to the frown those whom they
love i cannot say that i ever experienced anything
very formidable in my wife's at present
she knew her eyes would give the lie to it if they
looked at me steadily for a moment so they
wheeled to the left about quick off at a tangent
in a direction to the bhow begum and then she
smiled she could not prevent the smile but
she tried to make it scornful
my wife's nephew was sitting diagonally with
her and opposite his mother on the left hand 
the bhow begum oh he exclaimed it
ought to be written in a it will be a glorious
 write it uncle i beseech you my
wife's nephew is a sensible lad he reads my
writings likes my stories admires my singing
and thinks as i do in politics a youth parts
and considerable promise
he will write it said the bhow begum
taking up her snuffbox and accompanying the
words with a nod satisfaction and encouragement
 he will never be so foolish said my

foolish enough for any thing

something concerning the philosophy dreams
and the author's experience in aerial horsemanship

if a dream should come in now to make you afeared
with a windmill on his head and bells at his beard
would you straight wear your spectacles here at your toes
and your boots on your brows and your spurs on your nose 
ben jonson
the wise ancients held that dreams are from
jove virgil hath told us from what gate 
the infernal regions they go out but at which 
the five entrances the town manful they
get in john bunyan hath not explained some
have conceited that unbodied spirits have access
to us during sleep and impress upon the
passive faculty by divine permission presentiments
 those things whereof it is fitting that we
should be thus dimly forewarned this opinion
is held by baxter and to this also doth bishop
newton incline the old atomists supposed that
the likenesses or spectres corporeal things
exuviae scilicet rerum vel effluvia as they are
called by various when he takes advantage 
them to explain the fata morgana the atomists
i say supposed that these spectral forms which
are constantly emitted from all bodies
omne genus quoniam passim simulacra feruntur
assail the soul when she ought to be at rest according
to which theory all the lathered faces that
are created every morning in the lookingglass
and all the smiling ones that my lord simper
and mr small wit contemplate there with so much
satisfaction during the day must at this moment
be floating up and down the world others again
opine as if in contradiction to those who pretend
life to be a dream that dreams are realities and
that sleep sets the soul free like a bird from a
cage john henderson saw the spirit a slumbering
cat pass from her in pursuit a visionary
lucretius
mouse i know not whether he would have admitted
the fact as an argument for materialism 
and the soul hans engelbrecht not only went
to hell but brought back from it a stench which
proved to all the bystanders that it had been
there faugh 
whether then my spirit that night found its
way out at the nose for i sleep with my mouth
shut and actually sallied out seeking adventures
 or whether the spectrum the horse
floated into my chamber or some benevolent
genius or daemon assumed the wellknown and
welcome form or whether the dream were
merely a dream

time by day and by night have i ridden him 
high and low far and wide round the earth and
about it and over it and under it i know all
his earthpaces and his skypaces i have tried
him at a walk at an amble at a trot at a canter

i have proved him in the manege with single
turns and the manege with double turns his
bounds his curvets his pirouettes and his pistes
his crusade and his balotade his gallopgalliard
and his capriole i have been on him when he has
glided through the sky with wings outstretched
and motionless like a kite or a summer cloud 
i have bestrode him when he went up like a bittern

round and upward upward upward circling
and rising still and again when he has gone full

so ladies said i the stone which the

my eldest daughter had finished her latin lessons

was sitting at my desk pen in hand and in mouth
at the same time a substitute for biting the nails

silver chain

whitaker manchester to write whole quartos

that pockets are coeval with clothing and as
erudite men have maintained that language and
even letters are divine origin there might with
like reason be a conclusion drawn from the twentyfirst

and strong thread well waxed i do not so
greatly commend the humour dr ingenious
whose coat was lined with pockets all sizes
wherein in his latter years when science had become
to him as a plaything he carried about
various materials for chemical experiments 
among the rest so many compositions for fulminating
powders in glass tubes separated only by
a cork in the middle the tube that if any
person had unhappily given him a blow with a
stick he might have blown up himself and the
doctor too for myself four coat pockets the
ordinary dimensions content me in these a sufficiency
 conveniences may be carried and that
sufficiency methodically arranged for mark
me gentle or ungentle reader there is nothing
like method in pockets as well as in
composition and what orderly and methodical
man would have his pockethandkerchief and
his pocketbook and the key his door if
he be a batchelor living in chambers and
his knife and his loose pence and halfpence
and the letters which peradventure he might
just have received or peradventure he may
intend to drop in the postoffice twopenny or
general as he passes by and his snuff if he be
accustomed so to regale his olfactory conduits or
his tobaccobox if he prefer the despicable to the
pulverized weed or his box lozenges if he
should be troubled with a tickling cough and
the sugarplumbs and the gingerbread nuts which
he may be carrying home to his own children or
to any other small men and women upon whose
hearts he may have a design who i say would

all who hold daylight and fresh air essential to

abominate that bag the bhow begum notwithstanding
the beauty the silver chain upon
the black velvet and perceiving at this time
that the clasp its silver setting was broken so
that the mouth the bag was gaping pitiably
like a sick or defunct oyster i congratulated her
as she came in upon this farther proof the commodiousness
 the invention for here in the
country there is no workman who can mend that
clasp and the bag must therefore either be laid
aside or used in that deplorable state
when the bhow begum had seated herself i
told her how my proffered dedication had been
thrice rejected with scorn and repeating the offer
i looked for a more gracious reply but as if
scorn had been the influenza the female mind
that morning she answered no indeed she
would not have it after it had been refused by
every body else's nay nay said i it is
as much in your character to accept as it was in
their's to refuse while i was speaking she took
a pinch snuff the nasal titillation cooperated
with my speech for when any one the senses is
pleased the rest are not likely to continue out

dedicated to me because i shall delight in the

moods printed a sheet and a half muddy rhapsodies

the price a perfect upon a perfect subject
ought to be a perfect sum in a perfect coin 
that is to say one guinea now as dr daniel

was a perfect horse and as i humbly hope their

perfect therefore it shall be as far as kalo

in the turn the letters it is possible to exceed

printer who had a love for his art and having
a taste that way myself we discussed the
merits a new font one day when i happened
to call in upon him i objected to the angular
inclination a capital italic a which stood upon
its pins as if it were starting aghast from the next
letter on the left and was about to tumble upon
that to the right in which case down would go
the rest the word like a row soldiers which
children make with cards my printer was
too deeply enamoured with the beauties his
font to have either ear or eye for its defects 
and hastily waiving that point he called my attention
to a capital r in the same line which cocked
up its tail just as if it had been nicked that cock
 the tail had fascinated him look sir
said he while his eyes glistened with all the ardour
 an amateur look at that turn that's
sweet sir and drawing off the hand with the
forefinger which he had indicated it he described
in the air the turn that had delighted
him in a sort heroic flourish his head with a
diminished axis like the inner stile a telegraph
following the movement i have never
seen that r since without remembering him

in such mystery that no one ever taught it to
another every one who has practised it having
been obliged either surreptitiously to obtain the
secret or to invent a method for himself it
shall be in the old english letter not only because
that alphabet hath in its curves and angles
its fretting and redundant lines a sort picturesque
similitude with gothic architecture but
also because in its breadth and beauty it will display
the colour the ink to most advantage
for the dedication shall not be printed in black
after the ordinary fashion nor in white like the
sermon upon the excise laws nor in red after
the mode mr dibdin's half titles but in the
colour that imperial encaustic ink which by
the laws the roman empire it was death for
any but the roman emperor himself to use
we britons live in a free country wherein every
man may use what coloured ink seemeth good to
him and put as much gall in it as he pleases or
any other ingredient whatsoever moreover this

quoted as one example more the vanity 
human wishes for in order to get a seraph's
quill it would be necessary according to mrs
glasse's excellent item in her directions for roasting
a hare to begin by catching a seraph a
quill from a seraph's wing is i confess above my
ambition but one from a peacock's tail was
within my reach and be it known unto all people
nations and languages that with a peacock's
quill this hath been penned literally
truly and bonafinely speaking and this is to
write as the learned old pasquin says pavodenouement
which in latin minted for the nonce
may be rendered pavonice and in english peacomically
or peacockishly whichever the reader
may like best that such a pen has verily and
indeed been used upon this occasion i affirm i
affirm it upon the word a true man and here
is a captain his majesty's navy at my elbow
who himself made the pen and who if evidence
were required to the fact would attest it by as
round an oath as ever rolled over a right english
tongue nor will the time easily escape his remembrance
the bells being at this moment ringing
june to celebrate the king's birthday
and the public notification that peace has
been concluded with france
i have oftentimes had the happiness seeing
due commendation bestowed by gentle critics
unknown admirers and partial friends upon my
pen which has been married to all amiable epithets
 classical fine powerful tender touching
pathetic strong fanciful daring elegant sublime
beautiful i have read these epithets with
that proper satisfaction which when thus applied
they could not fail to impart and sometimes qualified
the pride which they inspired by looking at
the faithful old tool the muses beside me
worn to the stump in their service the one 
mended up to the quick in that spirit oeconomy
which becomes a son the lapland family and

second april old style nine minutes
and three seconds after three in the afternoon 
on which day marriage came in and mercury
was with the moon and the aspects were
d a week earlier it would have been a
most glorious trine the sun and jupiter 
circumstances which were all duly noted in the
blank leaf the family bible
daniel the father was one a race men who
unhappily are now almost extinct he lived upon
an estate six and twenty acres which his fathers
had possessed before him all doves and daniels
in uninterrupted succession from time immemorial
farther than registers or title deeds could
ascend the little church called chapel le dale
stands about a bow shot from the family house
there they had all been carried to the font
there they had each led his bride to the altar 
and thither they had each in his turn been borne
upon the shoulders their friends and neighbours
earth to earth they had been consigned
there for so many generations that half the
soil the churchyard consisted their remains
a hermit who might wish his grave to be as
quiet as his cell could imagine no fitter resting
place on three sides there was an irregular low
stone wall rather to mark the limits the sacred
ground than to inclose it on the fourth it was
d 
bounded by the brook whose waters proceed by
a subterraneous channel from weathercock cave
two or three alders and rowan trees hung over
the brook and shed their leaves and seeds into
the stream some bushy hazels grew at intervals
along the lines the wall and a few ash
trees as the winds had sown them to the east
and west some fields adjoined it in that state 
half cultivation which gives a human character to
solitude to the south on the other side the
brook the common with its limestone rocks peering
every where above ground extended to the
foot ingleborough a craggy hill feathered
with birch sheltered it from the north
the turf was as soft and fine as that the
adjoining hills it was seldom broken so scanty
was the population to which it was appropriated 
scarcely a thistle or a nettle deformed it and the
few tombstones which had been placed there
were now themselves half buried the sheep
came over the wall when they listed and sometimes
took shelter in the porch from the storm
their voices and the cry the kite wheeling
above were the only sounds which were heard
there except when the single bell which hung
in its niche over the entrance tinkled for service
on the sabbath day or with a slower tongue
gave notice that one the children the soil
was returning to the earth from which he sprung
the house the doves was to the east the
church under the same hill and with the same
brook in front and the intervening fields belonged
to the family it was a low house having
before it a little garden that size and character
which shewed that the inhabitants could
afford to bestow a thought upon something more
than mere bodily wants you entered between
two yew trees dipt to the fashion two pawns
there were hollyhocks and sunflowers displaying
themselves above the wall roses and sweet peas
under the windows and the everlasting pea climbing
the porch over the door was a stone with

the a was in the saxon character the rest
 the garden lay behind the house partly on
the slope the hill it had a hedge 
a few appletrees potherbs in
abundance onions cabbages turnips and carrots
 potatoes had hardly yet found their way
into these remote parts and in a sheltered spot
under the crag open to the south were six beehives
which made the family perfectly independent
 west india produce tea was in those
days as little known as potatoes and for all other
things honey supplied the place sugar
the house consisted seven rooms the dairy
and cellar included which were both upon the
ground floor as you entered the kitchen there
was on the right one those open chimneys
which afford more comfort in a winter's evening
than the finest register stove in front the
chimney stood a wooden beehive chair and on
each side was a long oak seat with a back to it
the seats serving as chests in which the oaten
bread was kept they were the darkest
brown and well polished by constant use on
the back each were the same initials as those
over the door with the date the great
cloak
table and the chest in the best kitchen which
held the houselinen bore the same date the
chimney was well hung with bacon the rack
which covered half the ceiling bore equal marks
 plenty mutton hams were suspended from
other parts the ceiling and there was an
odour cheese from the adjoining dairy which
the turf fire tho perpetual as that the magi
or the vestal virgins did not overpower a
few pewter dishes were ranged above the trenchers
opposite the door on a conspicuous shelf
the other treasures the family were in an open
triangular cupboard fixed in one the corners
 the best kitchen half way from the floor and
touching the ceiling they consisted a silver
saucepan a silver goblet and four apostle spoons
here also king charles's golden rules were
pasted against the wall and a large print 
daniel in the lion's den the lions were bedaubed
with yellow and the prophet was bedaubed
with blue with a red patch upon each 
his cheeks if he had been like his picture he
might have frightened the lions but happily
there were no judges in the family and it had
been bought for its name's sake the other print
which ornamented the room had been purchased
from a like feeling though the cause was not so
immediately apparent it represented a ship in
full sail with joseph and the virgin mary and
the infant on board and a dove flying behind as
if to fill the sails with the motion its wings
six black chairs were ranged along the wall
where they were seldom disturbed from their
array they had been purchased by daniel the
grandfather upon his marriage and were the most
costly purchase that had ever been made in the
family for the goblet was a legacy the backs
were higher than the head the tallest man
when seated the seats flat and shallow set in a
round frame unaccommodating in their material
more unaccommodating in shape the backs also
were wood rising straight up and ornamented
with balls and lozenges and embossments and
the legs and cross bars were adorned in the same
taste over the chimney were two peacocks feathers
some the dry silky pods the honesty
flower and one those large sinuous shells
so finely thus described by landor 
 pearly hue

in the sun's palace porch where when unyoked
his chariot wheel stands midway in the wave

that the science is not confined to the visage
alone have extended it to handwritings also and
hence it has become fashionable in this age 
collectors to collect the autographs remarkable
persons but now that mr rapier has arisen
the reformer illegible hands he and his
rival mr corsairs teach all their pupils to write
alike the countenance however has fairer play
in our days than it had in old times for the long
heads the sixteenth century were made by the
nurses not by nature elongating the nose
flattening the temples and raising the forehead
are no longer performed by manual force and the
face undergoes now no other artificial modelling
than such as may be impressed upon it by the
aid the lookingglass so far physiognomy
becomes less difficult the data upon which it has
to proceed not having been falsified ab initio 
but there arises a question in what state ought
they to be examined dr gall is for shaving the
head and overhauling it as a turk does a circassian
upon sale that he may discover upon the
outside the skull the organs fighting murder
cunning and thieving near neighbours in
his kappa cerebri comparing colours 
music sexual instinct philosophical judgement
c c all which with all other qualities
have their latitudes and longitudes in the brain
and are conspicuous upon the outward skull
according to the degree in which they influence
the character the individual
it must be admitted that if this learned german's
theory craniology be well founded the
gods have devised a much surer safer and more
convenient means for discovering the real characters
 the lords and ladies the creation than
what momus proposed when he advised that a
window should be placed in the breast for if
his advice had been followed and there had actually
been a window in the sternum it is i
think beyond all doubt that a windowshutter
would soon have been found indispensably necessary
in cold climates more especially in england
where pulmonary complaints are so frequent
 and secondly the wind would not be
more injurious to the lungs in high latitudes
than the sun would be to the liver in torrid regions
 indeed every where during summer it
would be impossible to exist without a green curtain
or venetian blinds to the window and after
all take what precautions we might the world
would be ten times more bilious than it is another
great physical inconvenience would also have
arisen for if men could peep into their insides at
any time and see the motions and the fermentations
which are continually going on and the
rise and progress every malady distinctly
marked in the changes it produced so many nervous
diseases would be brought on by frequent
inspection and so many derangements from attempting
to regulate the machine that the only
way to prevent it from making a full stop would
be to put a lock upon the shutter and deliver
the key to the physician
but upon dr gall's theory how many and
what obvious advantages result nor are they
merely confined to the purposes speculative
physiognomy the uses his theory as applied
to practice offer to us hopes scarcely less delightful
than those which seemed to dawn upon mankind
with the discovery the gasses and with
the commencement the french revolution
and in these later days with the progress the
bible society in courts justice for instance
how beautifully would this new science supply
any little deficiency evidence upon trial 
if a man were arraigned for murder and the
case were doubtful but he were found to have
a decided organ for the crime it would be 
little matter whether he had committed the specific
fact in the indictment or not for hanging
if not applicable as punishment would be proper
for prevention think also in state trials what
infinite advantages an attorney general might
derive from the opinion a regius professor 
craniology even these are but partial benefits
our generals ministers and diplomatists would
then unerringly be chosen by the outside the
head though a criterion might still be wanted to
ascertain when it was too thick and when too
thin but the greatest advantages are those
which this new system would afford to education 
for by the joint efforts dr gall and mr edgeworth
we should be able to breed up men according
to any pattern which parents or guardians might
think proper to bespeak the doctor would
design the mould and mr edgeworth by his skill
in mechanics devise with characteristic ingenuity
the best means making and applying it as
soon as the child was born the professional cap
medical military theological commercial or
legal would be put on and thus he would be
perfectly prepared for mr edgeworth's admirable
system professional education i will
pursue this subject no farther than just to hint
that the materials the mould may operate
sympathetically and therefore that for a lawyer
in rus the cap should be made brass for a
divine lead for a politician basemetal fora
soldier steel and for a sailor heart 
english oak
dr gall would doubtless require the naked
head to be submitted to him for judgement
contrariwise i opine and all the ladies will
agree with me in this opinion that the head
ought neither to be stript nor even examined
in undress but that it should be taken with all
its accompaniments when the owner has made
the best it the accompaniments being not
unfrequently more indicative than the features
themselves long ago the question whether a
man is most like himself drest or undress was
propounded to the british apollo and it was
answered by the oracle that a man god almighty's
making is most like himself when uncrest
 but a man a tailor's periwigmaker's
and sempstress's making when drest the oracle
answered rightly for no man can select his own
eyes nose or mouth but his wigan his whiskers
are his own chusing and to use an illustrious
instance how much character is there in that
awful wig which alway in its box accompanies
dr parr upon his visits ceremony that it maybe
put on in the hall with all its feathery honours
thick upon it not a curl deranged a hair flattened
or a particle powder wasted on the way 
but if we would form a judgement the interior
 that portentous head which is thus formidably
enumerated how could it be done so well as
by beholding the doctor among his books and there
seeing the food upon which his terrific intellect
is fed there we should see the accents quantities
dialects digammas and other such small
gear as in these days constitute the complete
armour a perfect scholar and by thus discovering
what goes into the head we might form a
fair estimate what was likely to come out it
this is a truth which with many others equal
importance will be beautifully elucidated in this
nonpareil history for daniel dove the father
had a collection books they were not so numerous
as those his contemporary harley
famous for his library and infamous for the
peace utrecht but he was perfectly conversant
with all their contents which is more than
could be said the earl oxford
reader whether thou art man woman or
child thou art doubtless acquainted with the
doctrine association as inculcated by the great
mr locke and his disciples but never hast
thou seen that doctrine so richly and so entirely
exemplified as in this great history the association
 ideas being in oriental phrase the silken
thread upon which its pearls are strung and
never wilt thou see it so clearly and delightfully
illustrated not even if the ingenious mr john
jones should one day give to the world the whole
twelve volumes in which he has proved the authenticity
 the gospel history by bringing
the narratives the four evangelists to the test

happily for daniel he lived before the age
 magazines reviews encyclopaedia elegant
extracts and literary newspapers so that he
gathered the fruit knowledge for himself instead
 receiving it from the dirty fingers a
retail vender his books were few in number
but they were all weighty either in matter or in
size they consisted the morte d arthur in the
fine blackletter edition copland plutarch's
morals and pliny's natural history two goodly
folios full as an egg meat and both translated
by that old worthy philemon who for the service
which he rendered to his contemporaries and to
his countrymen deserves to be called the best 
the hollands without disparaging either the lord
or the doctor that appellation the whole
works joshua sylvester whose name let me
tell thee reader in passing was accented upon the
first syllable by his contemporaries not as now
upon the second jean petit s history the
netherlands translated and continued by edward
grierson another worthy the philemon
order sir kenelm digby's discourses stowe's
chronicle joshuabarnes'slife edward iii 
ripley revived by irenaeus philalethes an
englishman styling himself citizen the
world with its mysterious frontispiece representing
the domus nature to which nil detest
nisi clams the pilgrim's progress two volumes
 ozell's translation rabelais latimer's
sermons and the last volume fox's martyrs
vol i e
which latter had been brought him by his
wife the pilgrim's progress was a godmother's
present to his son the odd volumes rabelais
he had picked up at kendal at a sale in a lot
with ripley revived and plutarch's morals the
others he had inherited
daniel had looked into all these books read
most them and believed all that he read except
rabelais which he could not tell what to
make lie was not however one those persons
who complacently suppose every thing to be
nonsense which they do not perfectly comprehend
or flatter themselves that they do his
simple heart judged books by what they ought
to be little knowing what they are it never
occurred to him that any thing would be printed
which was not worth printing any thing which
did not convey either reasonable delight or useful
instruction and he was no more disposed to
doubt the truth what he read than to question
the veracity his neighbour or any one
who had no interest in deceiving him a 
carried with it to him authority in its very aspect
the morte arthur therefore he received for
authentic history just as he did the painful chronicle
 honest john stowe and the cartesian
labours joshua the selfsatisfied there was
nothing in it indeed which stirred his english
blood like the battles cressy and poictiers and
najara yet on the whole he preferred it to
barnes story believed in sir tor sir tristan
sir lancelot and sir lamarck as entirely as in
sir john chances the capital de suche and
the black prince and liked them better
latimer and du bartas he used sometimes to
read aloud on sundays and if the departed
take cognizance what passes on earth and poets
derive any satisfaction from that posthumous
applause which is generally the only reward 
those who deserve it sylvester might have found
some compensation for the undeserved neglect
into which his works had sunk by the full and
devout delight which his rattling rhymes and
quaint collocations afforded to this reader the
silvertongued sylvester however was reserved
for a sabbath as a weekday author
daniel preferred pliny for the same reason that
bread and cheese or a rasher hung mutton
contented his palate better than a syllabub he
frequently regretted that so knowing a writer
had never seen or heard weathercock and
dorcas caves the ebbing and flowing spring at
giggleswick malian cove and cordage scar
that he might have described them among the
wonders the world onrne ignotum pro magnifico
is a maxim which will not in all cases hold
good there are things which we do not undervalue
because we are familiar with them but
which are admired the more the more thoroughly
they are known and understood it is thus with
the grand objects nature and the finest works
 art with whatsoever is truly great and excel 
lent daniel was not deficient in imagination 
but no description places which he had never
seen however exaggerated as such things always
are impressed him so strongly as these objects
in his own neighbourhood which he had known
from childhood three or four times in his life
it had happened that strangers with a curiosity
as uncommon in that age as it is general in this
came from afar to visit these wonders the west
riding and daniel accompanied them with a
delight such as he never experienced on any
other occasion
but the author in whom he delighted most
was plutarch whose works he was lucky
enough to possess the worthier half if the other
had perished plutarch would not have been a
popular writer but he would have held a higher
place in the estimation the judicious daniel
could have posed a candidate for university
honors and perhaps the examiner too with some
 the odd learning which he had stored up in
his memory from these great repositories ancient
knowledge refusing all reward for such
services the strangers to whom he officiated as a
guide though they perceived that he was an extraordinary
person were little aware how much
information he had acquired and how strange
a kind his talk with them did not go beyond
the subjects which the scenes they came to visit
naturally suggested and they wondered more at
the questions he asked than at any thing which
he advanced himself for his disposition was
naturally shy and that which had been bashfulness
in youth assumed the appearance reserve
as he advanced in life for having none to communicate
with upon his favorite studies he lived
in an intellectual world his own a mental solitude
as complete as that alexander selkirk or
robinson crusoe even to the curate his conversation
if he had touched upon his books
would have been heathen greek and to speak
the truth plainly without knowing a letter 
that language he knew more about the greeks
than ninetenths the clergy at that time including
all the dissenters rind than ninetenths
 the schoolmasters also
our good daniel had none that confidence
which so usually and so unpleasantly characterizes
selftaught men in fact he was by no
means aware the extent his acquirements
all that he knew in this kind having been acquired
for amusement not for use he had
never attempted to teach himself any thing
these books had lain in his way in boyhood or
fallen in it afterwards and the perusal them
intently as it was followed was always accounted
by him to be nothing more than recreation
none his daily business had ever been neglected
for it he cultivated his fields and his garden
repaired his walls looked to the stable
tended his cows and salved his sheep as diligently
and as contentedly as if he had possessed
neither capacity nor inclination for any higher
employments yet daniel was one those men
who if disposition and aptitude were not overruled
by circumstances would have grown pale
with study instead being bronzed and hardened
by sun and wind and rain there were
in him undeveloped talents which might have
raised him to distinction as an antiquary a virtuoso
 the royal society a poet or a theologian
to which ever course the bias in his ball 
fortune had inclined but he had not a particle
 envy in his composition he thought indeed
that if he had had grammar learning in hisyouth
like the curate he would have made more use 
it but there was nothing either the sourness
or bitterness call it which you please repining
in this natural reflection
never indeed was any man more contented
with doing his duty in that state life to which
it had pleased god to call him and well he
might be so for no man ever passed through the
world with less to disquiet or to sour him bred
up in habits which secured the continuance 
that humble but sure independance to which he
was born he had never known what it was to be
anxious for the future at the age twentyfive
he had brought home a wife the daughter 
a little landholder like himself with fifteen pounds
for her portion and the truelove his youth
proved to him a faithful helpmate in those years
when the dream life is over and we live in its
realities if at any time there had been some
alloy in his happiness it was when there appeared
reason to suppose that in him his family would
be extinct for though no man knows what parental
feelings are till he has experienced them
and daniel therefore knew not the whole value 
that which he had never enjoyed the desire 
progeny is natural to the heart man and though
daniel had neither large estates nor an illustrious
name to transmit it was an unwelcome
thought that the little portion the earth which
had belonged to his fathers time out mind
should pass into the possession some stranger
who would tread on their graves and his own
without any regard to the dust that lay beneath
that uneasy apprehension was removed after he
had been married fifteen years when to the great
joy both parents because they had long ceased
to entertain any hope such an event their
wishes were fulfilled in the birth a son this
their only child was healthy apt and docile to all
appearance as happily disposed in mind and body
as a father's heart could wish if they had fine
weather for winning their hay or shearing their
corn they thanked god for it if the season
proved unfavourable the labour was only a little
the more and the crop a little the worse their
stations secured them from want and they had
no wish beyond it what more had daniel to
desire 
the following passage in the divine du bartas
he used to read with peculiar satisfaction applying
it to himself
o thrice thrice happy he who shuns the cares
 city troubles and stateaffairs 
and serving ceres tills with his own team

that the world from babel was scattered into
divers tongues we need not other proof says a
grave and good author than as diogenes proved
that there is motion by walking so we may
see the confusion languages by our confused
speaking once all the earth was one tongue
one speech and one consent for they all spake
in the holy tongue wherein the world was created
in the beginning but pro peccant dissensions
humane as saith st austin for the sin men
disagreeing not only different dispositions but
also different languages came into the world
they came to babel with a disagreeing agreement 
and they came away punished with a speechless
speech they disagree among themselves while
every one strives for dominion they agree
against god in their nagnavad ian liguda
we will make ourselves a rendezvous for idolatry
but they come away speaking to each other but
not understood each other and s speak to
no more purpose than if they spake not at all
this punishment theirs at babel is like adam's
corruption hereditary to us for we never come
under the rod at the grammar school but we
smart for our ancestor's rebellion at babel

guy the schoolmaster ingletoii he never
consumed birch enough in his vocation to have
made a besom and his ferule was never applied
unless when some moral offence called for a chastisement
that would be felt there is a closer connection
between goodnature and good sense than
is commonly supposed a sour illtempered pedagogue
would have driven daniel through the
briars and brambles the grammar and foundered
him in its sloughs guy led him gently
along the greensward he felt that childhood
should not be made altogether a season painful
acquisition and that the fruits the sacrifices
then made are uncertain as to the account to
which they may be turned and are also liable to
the contingencies life at least if not otherwise

precepts which warmth imagination inspired

the memory his pupil with such horrific terms
as prothesis aphaeresis even thesis syncope
paragon and apocope never questioned him
concerning apposition vocation syllepsis prolepsis
zeugma synthesis antipodes and synecdoche
 never attempted to deter him as lily
says boys are above all things to be deterred from
those faults which lily also says seem almost
natural to the english the heinous faults 
lotacism lambdacism which alcibiades affected
ischnotesism trauli'sm and plates but
having grounded him well in the nouns and
verbs and made him understand the concords he
then followed in part the excellent advice lily
thus given in his address to the reader
when these concords be well known unto
them an easy and pleasant pain if the foregrounds
be well and thoroughly beaten in let
them not continue in learning the rules orderly
as they lie in their syntax but rather learn some
pretty wherein is contained not only the
eloquence the tongue but also a good plain
lesson honesty and godliness and thereof
take some little sentence as it lieth and learn to
make the same first out english into latin
not seeing the or construing it thereupon
and if there fall any necessary rule the syntax
to be known then to learn it as the occasion
 the sentence giveth cause that day which sentence
once made well and as nigh as may be
with the words the then to take the 
and construe it and so shall he be less troubled
with the parsing it and earliest carry his lesson
in mind
guy followed this advice in part and in part
he deviated from it upon lily's own authority
as judging that the most sufficient way which he
saw to be the readiest mean while therefore he
exercised his pupil in writing latin pursuant to
this plan he carried him on faster in construing
and promoted the boy's progress by gratifying
his desire getting forward when he had
done with sorcery erasmus was taken up for
some erasmus's colloquies were in those days
used as a school and the most attractive
one that could be put into a boy's hands after he
had got through this the aid an english version
was laid aside and here guy departed from the
ordinary course not upon any notion that he
could improve upon it but merely because he
happened to possess an old composed for
the use schools which was easy enough to suit
young daniel's progress in the language and
might therefore save the cost purchasing
justin or phaedrus or cornelius nepos or eutropics
to one or others which he would otherwise
have been introduced

i am sometimes inclined to think that pigs are
brought up upon a wiser system than boys at a
grammar school the pig is allowed to feed
upon any kind offal however coarse on which
he can thrive till the time approaches when pig
is to commence pork or take a degree as bacon 
and then he is fed daintily now it has sometimes
appeared to me that in like manner boys
might acquire their first knowledge latin from
authors very inferior to those which are now used
in all schools provided the matter was unexceptionable
and the latinity good and that they
should not be introduced to the standard works
 antiquity till they are an age in some degree
to appreciate what they read
understand me reader as speaking doubtfully
and that too upon a matter little moment
 for the scholar will return in riper years to
those authors which are worthy being studied
and as for the blockhead it signifies nothing
whether the which he consumes by thumbing
it in the middle and dogearing it at the corners
be worthy or not a better use yet if
the dead have any cognizance posthumous
fame one would think it must abate somewhat
 the pleasure with which virgil and ovid regard
their earthly immortality when they see to
what base purposes their productions are applied
that their verses should be administered to boys
in regular doses as lessons or impositions and
some dim conception their meaning whipt into
the tail when it has failed to penetrate the head
cannot be just the sort homage to their genius
which they anticipated or desired
not from any reasonings or refinements this
kind but from the mere accident possessing
the guy put into his pupil's hands the dialogues
 johannes raisins textor jean
tixier seigneur de ravish in the nivernois
who thus latinized his name is a person whose
works according to ballet's severe censure were
buried in the dust a few petty colleges and
unfrequented shops more than a century ago
he was however in his day a person no mean
station in the world letters having been rector
 the university paris at the commencement
 the th century and few indeed are the
writers whose books have been so much used 
for perhaps no other author ever contribute so
largely to the manufacture exercises whether
in prose or verse and sermons also textor
may be considered as the first compiler the
gradus ad parnassus and that collection 
apothegms was originally formed by him which
comrade demosthenes enlarged and rearranged 
which the jesuits adopted after expurgating it 
and which during many generations served as
one the standard commonplace books for commonplace
divines in this country as well as on
the continent
but though textor was continually working in
classical literature with a patience and perseverance
which nothing but the delight he experienced
in such occupations could have sustained
he was without a particle classical taste his
taste was that the age wherein he flourished
and these his dialogues are moralities in latin
verse the designs and thoughts which would
have accorded with their language had they been
written either in old french or old english appear
when presented in latinity which is always
that a scholar and largely interwoven with
scraps from familiar classics as strange as harlequin
and pantaloon would do in heroic costume
earth opens the first these curious compositions
with a bitter complaint for the misfortunes
which it is her lot to witness age seas overhears
the lamentation and enquires the cause 
and after a dialogue in which the author makes
the most liberal use his own commonplaces it
appears that the perishable nature all sublunary
things is the cause this mourning aetas
endeavours to persuade terra that her grief is
altogether unreasonable by such brief and cogent
observations as fata jubcnt fata volant ita
diis platinum earth asks the name her philosophic
consoler but upon discovering it calls
her false virago t and meretrix and abuses her
as being the very author all the evils that
distress her however meas succeeds in talking
terra into better humour advises her to exhort
man that he should not set his heart upon perishable
things and takes her leave as homo enters
after a recognition between mother and son
terra proceeds to warn homo against all the
ordinary pursuits this world to convince
him the vanity glory she calls up in succession
the ghosts hector achilles alexander
and samson who tell their tales and admonish
him that valor and renown afford no protection
against death to exemplify the vanity 
beauty helen lais thisbe and lucretia are
summoned relate in like manner their respective
fortunes and remind him that palms et umbra
sums virgil preaches to him upon the emptiness
 literary fame xerxes tells him that
there is no avail in power nero that there is
none in tyranny sardanapalus that there is none
in voluptuousness but the application which
homo makes all this is the very reverse to
what his mother intended he infers that seeing
he must die at last live how he will the best
thing he can do is to make a merry life it so
away he goes to dance and revel and enjoy himself
and terra concludes with the mournful
observation that men will still pursue their bane
unmindful their latter 
another these moralities begins with three
worldlings ires mundane ringing changes
upon the pleasures profligacy in textor's
peculiar manner each in regular succession saying
something to the same purport in different
words as thus
primus mandamus
si breve tempus habit
secundus mandamus
si vita caduca recent 
tertius mandamus
si cadit hora

secundus mandamus

tertius mandamus

upon which an unpleasant personage who has
just appeared to interrupt their trialogue observes

si breve tempus habit si vita caduca recedes
si cadit hora dies abeunt merit omne venit mors
quidnam lethiferce mortis meminisse nocebit f
it is mors herself who asks the question the
three worldlings however behave as resolutely as
don juan in the old drama they tell death that
they are young and rich and active and vigorous
and set all admonition at defiance death or
rather mrs death for mors being feminine
is called scena and meretrix and virago takes
all this patiently and letting them go off in a
dance calls up human nature who has been
asleep meantime and asks her how she can sleep
in peace while her sons are leading a life dissipation
and debauchery nature very coolly
replies by demanding why they should not and
death answers because they must go to the infernal
regions for so doing upon this nature
who appears to be liberally inclined asks if it is
credible that any should be obliged to go there 
and death to convince her calls up a soul from
bale to give an account his own sufferings a
dreadful account this donatus gives and when
nature shocked at what she hears enquires if he
is the only one who is tormented in arcus damnatus
assures her that hardly one in a thousand
goes to heaven but that his fellow sufferers are in
number numberless and he specifies among them
kings and popes and senators and severe schoolmasters
a class men whom textor seems to
have held in great and proper abhorrence as if
like poor thomas tusser he had suffered under
their inhuman discipline
horrified at this nature asks advice mors
arid mors advises her to send a son thunder
round the world who should reprove the nations
for their sins and sow the seeds virtue by his
preaching peregrine goes upon this mission
and returns to give an account it nothing
can be worse than the report as for the kings
 the earth it would be dangerous he says to
say what they were doing the popes suffered
the ship peter to go wherever the winds carried
it senators were won by intercession or
corrupted by gold doctors spread their nets in
the temples for prey and lawyers were dumb
unless their tongues were loosened by money
had he seen the italians italy was full dissentions
ripe for war and defiled by its own infamous
vice the spaniards they were
suckled by pride the english 
gens tacitus pratgnans arcana ardea tenants
edit tartars mihi creditor esse generis
in short the missionary concludes that he has
found every where an abundant crop vices
and that all his endeavours to produce amendment
have been like ploughing the sea shore
again afflicted nature asks advice mors and
mors recommends that she should call up justice
and send her abroad with her scourge to
repress the wicked but justice is found to be
so fast asleep that no calling can awaken her
mors then advises her to summon veritas alas 
unhappy veritas enters complaining pains
from head to foot and in all the intermediate
parts within and without she is dying and entreats
that nature will call some one to confess
her but who shall be applied to kings 
they will not come nobles veritas is a hateful
personage to them bishops or mitred abbots
 they have no regard for truth some
saint from the desert nature knows not whereto
find one poor veritas therefore dies unhouseled
disappointed unsealed and forthwith
three demons enter rejoicing that human
nature is left with none to help her and that
they are kings this world they call in their
ministers caro and voluptas and vitium and
send them to do their work among mankind
these successful missionaries return and relate
how well they have sped every where and the
demons being by this time hungry after washing
in due form and many ceremonious compliments
among themselves sit down to a repast

there are several other dialogues in a similar
strain fiction the rudest and perhaps oldest
specimen this style is to be found in pierce
ploughman the most polished in caldron the
most popular in john bunyan's holy war and
above all in his pilgrim's progress it appears
from the dialogues that they were not composed
for the use youth alone as a school but
were represented at college and poor as they are
in point composition the oddity their combinations
and the wholesome honesty their
satire were well adapted to strike young imaginations
and make an impression there which better
and wiser works might have failed to leave
a schoolmaster who had been regularly bred
would have regarded such a with scorn and
discerning at once its obvious faults would have
been incapable perceiving any thing which
might compensate for them but guy was not
educated well enough to despise a writer like old
textor what he knew himself he had picked
up where and how he could in bye ways and
corners the was neither in any respect
above his comprehension nor below his taste 
and joseph wanton never rolled off the hexameter
 virgil or homer ore rotunda with more
delight when expatiating with all the feelings 
a scholar and a poet upon their beauties to such
pupils as hadley and russell and bowles than
guy paraphrased these rude but striking allegories
to his delighted daniel

an objection answered
is this then your wonder 
nay then you shall understand
more my skill ben jonson
this account textor's dialogues says a
critical reader might have done very well for
the retrospective review or one the magazines
or disraeli's curiosities literature but
no one would have looked for it here where it is
completely out place
my good sir there is quite enough left untouched
in textor to form a very amusing paper
for the journal which you have mentioned and
the editor may thank you for the hint but you
are mistaken in thinking that what has been said
 those dialogues is out place here may i
ask what you expected in these volumes
what the title authorized me to look for
do you know sir what mutton broth means
at a city breakfast on the lord mayor's day
mutton broth being the appointed breakfast for
that festival it means according to established
usage by liberal interpretation mutton broth
and every thing else that can be wished for at a
breakfast so sir you have here not only what
the title seems to specify but every thing else that
can be wished for in a in treating the
doctor it treats de omnibus rebus et quibusdam
alias it is the doctor see and that c
like one littleton's implies every thing that
can be deduced from the words preceding
but i maintain that the little which has been
said comical old textor for it is little compared
to what his dialogues contain strictly
relates to the main thread this most orderly
and well compacted work you will remember
that i am now replying to the question proposed
in the third chapter p i who was the doctor 
and as he who should undertake to edit the
works chaucer or spenser or shakespear
would not be qualified for the task unless he had
made himself conversant with the writings 
those earlier authors from whose storehouses as
far as they drew from books their minds were
fed so it behoved me as far as my information
and poor ability extend to explain in what manner
so rare a character as dr dove's was formed
quo semel est imbuta recent you know the
rest the quotation sir and perhaps you may
have tasted water out a beery glass which it
is not one or two risings that can purify
y ou have seen yew trees cut into the forms 
pyramids chesskings and peacocks nothing
can be more unlike their proper growth and yet
no tree except the yew could take the artificial
figures so well the garden passes into the
possession some new owner who has no taste
for such ornaments the yews are left to grow at
their own will they lose the preposterous shape
which had been forced upon them without recovering
that their natural growth and what
was formal becomes grotesque a word which
may be understood as expressing the incongruous
combination formality with extravagance or
wildness
the intellectual education which young daniel
received at home was as much out the ordinary
course as the in which he studied at school
robinson crusoe had not yet reached ingleton
sandford and merton had not been written nor
that history pecks and elapsed and the robin's
nest which is the prettiest fiction that ever
was composed for children and for which its excellent
authoress will one day rank high among women
 genius when time shall have set its seal upon
desert the only within his reach all
those which now come into the hands youth
was the pilgrim's progress and this he read at
first without a suspicion its allegorical import
what he did not understand was as little remembered
as the sounds the wind or the motions
 the passing clouds but the imagery and the
incidents took possession his memory and his
heart after a while textor became an interpreter
 the immortal tinker and the boy acquired
as much the meaning by glimpses as
was desirable enough to render some the personages
more awful by spiritualizing them while
the tale itself remained as a reality oh what

what sir exclaims a lady who is bluer
than ever one her naked and woadstained ancestors
appeared at a public festival in full dye
what sir do you tell us that children are not to
be made to understand what they are taught
and she casts her eyes complacently toward an
assortment those books which so many writers
male and female some the infidel some the
semifidel and some the superfidel schools
have composed for the laudable purpose enabling
children to understand every thing what
sir she repeats are we to make our children
learn things by rote like parrots and fill their
heads with words to which they cannot attach any
signification 
yes madam in very many cases
i should like sir to be instructed why 
she says this in a tone and with an expression
both eyes and lips which plainly show in direct
opposition to the words that the lady thinks herself
much fitter to instruct than to be instructed
it is not her fault she is a good woman and
naturally a sensible one but she has been trained
up in the way women should not go she has
been carried from lecture to lecture like a student
who is being crammed at a scotch university
she has attended lectures on chemistry
lectures on poetry lectures on phrenology lectures
on mnemonics she has read the latest and
most applauded essays on taste she has studied
the newest and most approved treatises practical
and theoretical upon education she has paid
sufficient attention to metaphysics to know as
much as a professed philosopher about matter
and spirit she is a proficient in political economy
and can discourse upon the new science population
poor lady it would require large
draughts lethe to clear out all this undigested
and undigestible trash and fit her for
becoming what she might have been upon
this point however it may be practicable to set
her right
you are a mother madam and a good one
in caressing your infants you may perhaps think
it unphilosophical to use what i should call the
proper and natural language the nursery but
doubtless you talk to them you give some
utterance to your feelings and whether that
utterance be in legitimate and wise words or in
good extemporaneous nonsense it is alike to the
child the conventional words convey no more
meaning to him than the mere sound but he
understands from either all that is meant all that
you wish him to understand all that is to be
understood he knows that it is an expression
 your love and tenderness and that he is the
object it
so too it continues after he is advanced from
infancy into childhood when children are beginning
to speak they do not and cannot affix
any meaning to half the words which they hear 
yet they learn their mother tongue what i say
is do not attempt to force their intellectual
growth do not feed them with meat till they
have teeth to masticate it
there is a great deal which they ought to
learn can learn and must learn before they can or
ought to understand it how many questions
must you have heard from them which you have
felt to be best answered when they were with
most dexterity put aside let me tell you a
story which the jesuit manuel de verger used
to tell himself when he was a little boy he
asked a dominican friar what was the meaning
 the seventh commandment for he said he
could not tell what committing adultery was
the friar not knowing how to answer cast a perplexed
look round the room and thinking he
had found a safe reply pointed to a kettle on the
fire and said the commandment meant that he
must never put his hand in the pot while it was
boiling the very next day a loud scream
alarmed the family and behold there was little
manuel running about the room holding up his
scalded finger and exclaiming oh dear oh dear
i've committed adultery i've committed adultery
i've committed adultery

use and abuse stories in reasoning with a
word in behalf chimneysweepers and in
reproof the earl lauderdale
my particular inclination moves me in controversy especially
to approve his choice that said fortis mallet quam
formosa dr jackson
i ended that last chapter with a story and
though i say it who should not say it it is a
good story well applied what use a story
may be even in the most serious debates may be
seen from the circulation old joes in parliament
which are as current there as their sterling
namesakes used to be in the city some threescore
years ago a jest though it should be as stale as
last weeks newspaper and as flat as lord flounder's
face is sure to be received with laughter by
the collective wisdom the nation nay it is
sometimes thrown out like a tub to the whale or
like a trail carrion to draw off hounds from
the scent
the bill which should have put an to the
inhuman practice employing children to sweep
chimneys was thrown out on the third reading
in the house lords having passed the commons
without a dissentient voice by a speech
from lord lauderdale the force which consisted
in literally a joe miller jest he related
that an irishman used to sweep his chimney by
letting a rope down which was fastened round
the legs a goose and then pulling the goose
after it a neighbour to whom he recommended
this as a convenient mode objected to it upon the
score cruelty to the goose upon which he
replied that a couple ducks might do as well
now if the bill before the house had been to
enact that men should no longer sweep chimneys
but that boys should be used instead the story
would have been applicable it was no otherwise
applicable than as it related to chimneysweeping
 but it was a joke and that sufficed
the lords laughed his lordship had the satisfaction
 throwing out the bill and the home
negro trade has continued from that time now
seven years till this day and still continues
his lordship had his jest and it is speaking
within compass to say that in the course those
seven years two thousand children have been
sacrificed in consequence
the worst actions lord lauderdale's worst
ancestor admit a better defence before god
and man
had his lordship perused the evidence which
had been laid before the house commons
when the bill was brought in upon which evidence
the bill was founded was he aware 
the shocking barbarities connected with the trade
and inseparable from it did he know that
children inevitably lacerate themselves in learning
this dreadful occupation that they are frequently
crippled by it frequently lose their
lives in it by suffocation or by slow fire that it
induces a peculiar and dreadful disease that
they who survive the accumulated hardships a
childhood during which they are exposed to
every kind misery and destitute every kind
 comfort have at the age seventeen or
eighteen to seek their living how they can in
some other employment for it is only by children
that this can be carried on did his lordship
know that girls as well as boys are thus
abused that their sufferings begin at the age 
six sometimes a year earlier finally that they
are sold to this worst and most inhuman all
slaveries and sometimes stolen for the purpose 
being sold to it 
i bear no illwill towards lord lauderdale
either personally or politically far from it his
manly and honorable conduct on the queen's
trial when there was such an utter destitution 
honor in many quarters where it was believed to
exist and so fearful a want manliness where
it ought to have been found entitles him to the
respect and gratitude every true briton but i
will tell his lordship that rather than have spoken
as he did against an act which would have lessened
the sum wickedness and suffering in this
country rather than have treated a question 
pure humanity with contempt and ridicule rather
than have employed my tongue for such a purpose
and with such success i would but
no i will not tell him how i had concluded i
will not tell him what i had added in the sincerity
 a free tongue and an honest heart i
leave the sentence imperfect rather than that any
irritation which the strength my language
might excite should lessen the salutary effects 
selfcondemnation 
james montgomery these remarks are too
late for a place in thy chimney sweepers friend 
but insert them i pray thee in thy newspaper at
the request one who admires and loves thee asa
poet honors and respects thee as a man and
reaches out in spirit at this moment a long arm to
shake hands with thee in cordial good will
my compliments to you mr bowing your
little poem in montgomery's benevolent album is
in a strain true poetry and right feeling
none but a man genius could have struck off
such stanzas upon such a theme but when
you wrote upon humanity at home the useful
reflection might have occurred that patriotism
has no business abroad whatever cause there
may be to wish for amendment in the government
and institutions other countries keep
aloof from all revolutionary schemes for amending
them lest you should experience a far more
painful disappointment in their success than in
their failure no spirit prophecy is required
for telling you that this must be the result lay
not up that cause remorse for yourself and
time will ripen in you what is crude confirm
what is right and gently rectify all that is erroneous
 it will abate your political hopes and
enlarge your religious faith and stablish both
upon a sure foundation my good wishes and
sincere respects to you mr bowing

there's no want meat sir 
portly and curious viands are prepared
to please all kinds appetites massinger
a fastidious taste is like a squeamish appetite 
the one has its origin in some disease mind as
the other has in some ailment the stomach
your true lover literature is never fastidious
i do not mean the helluo liberum the swinish
feeder who thinks that every name which is
to be found in a titlepage or on a tombstone
ought to be rescued from oblivion nor
those first cousins the moth who labour
under a bulimy for blackletter and believe
every thing to be excellent which was written
in the reign elizabeth i mean the man 
robust and healthy intellect who gathers the
harvest literature into his barns threshes the
straw winnows the grain grinds it at his own
mill bakes it in his own oven and then eats the
true bread knowledge if he bake his loaf
upon a cabbage leaf and eat onions with his
oread and cheese let who will find fault with him
for his taste not i 
the doves father as well as son were blest
with a hearty intellectual appetite and a strong
digestion but the son had the more catholic
taste he would have relished caviare would
have ventured upon laver undeterred by its appearance
and would have liked it
what an excellent thing did god bestow on man
when he did give him a good stomach 
he would have eaten sausages for breakfast at
norwich sally runs at bath sweet butter in
cumberland orange marmalade at edinburgh
fenton haddocks at aberdeen and drunk punch
with beef steaks to oblige the french if they
insisted upon obliging him with a dejeuner a
anglaise
a good digestion turneth all to healths
beaumont and fletcher f herbert
he would have eaten squabpye in devonshire
and the pye which is squabble than squab
in cornwall sheep's head with the hair on in
scotland and potatoes roasted on the hearth in
ireland frogs with the french pickled herrings
with the dutch sourtrout with the germans
maccaroni with the italians aniseed with
the spaniards garlic with any body horseflesh
with the tartars assflesh with the persians 
dogs with the north western american indians
curry with the asiatic east indians birds nests
with the chinese mutton roasted with honey
with the turks pismire cakes on the orinoco
and turtle and venison with the lord mayor and
the turtle and venison he would have preferred
to all the other dishes because his taste though
catholic was not indiscriminating he would
have tried all tasted all thriven upon all and
lived contentedly and cheerfully upon either but
he would have liked best that which was best
and his intellectual appetite had the same happy
catholicism
he would not have said with euphues if i
be in crete i can lie if in greece i can shift 
if in italy i can court it but he might have
said with him i can carouse with alexander 
abstain with romulus eat with the epicure 
fast with the stoic sleep with endymion watch
with lysippus
the reader will not have forgotten i trust
but if he should i now remind him it that in
the brief inventory daniel's library there appeared
some odd volumes that full 
pantagruelism the inestimable life the great
gargantua the elder daniel could make nothing
 this and the younger who was
about ten years old when he began to read it
less than he could the pilgrim's progress
but he made out something
young daniel was free from all the isms in
lily and from rhotacism to boot he was clear
too schism and all the worse isms which have
arisen from it having by the blessing providence
been bred up not in any denomination
ending in astor indian or arian or arian but as a
dutiful and contented son the church england
in humour however he was by nature a
pantagruelist and indeed in his mature years
he always declared that one the reasons which
had led him to reject the old humoral pathology
was that it did not include pantagruelism which
he insisted depended neither upon heat or cold
moisture or dryness nor upon any combination
 those qualities but was itself a peculiar and
elementary humour a truth he said which
he was feelingly and experimentally convinced
and lauded the gods therefore
mr wordsworth in that poem which mr
jeffrey has said won't do mr jeffrey is always
lucky in his predictions whether as a politician
or a critic bear witness wellington bear witness
wordsworth and southey bear witness
elia and lord byron mr wordsworth in
that poem which
the high and tender muses shall accept
with gracious smile deliberately pleased
and listening time reward with sacred praise 
mr wordsworth in that noble poem observes
oh many are the poets that are sown
by nature 
among the emblems daniel heinous look
at his head reader if thou hast a collection 
portraits to refer to and thou wilt marvel how so
queer a conceit should have entered it for seldom
has there been a face more gnarled and knotted
with crabbed cogitation than that this man
who was one the last the giants among
his emblems i say is one which represents cupid
sowing a field and little heads springing out 
the ground on all sides some up to the neck
others to the shoulders and some with the arms
out if the crop were examined i agree with
mr wordsworth that poets would be found
there as thick as darnel in the corn and grave
counsellors would not be wanting whose advice
would be that they should be weeded out
the pantagruelists are scarcer greece produced
three great tragic poets and only one
aristophanes the french had but one rabelais
when the seven pleiades shone in their
poetical hemisphere we have seen a succession
 great tragedians from betterton to the present
time and in all that time there has been but one
grimaldi in whom the pantagruelism pantomime
has found its perfect representative
and yet the reader must not hastily conclude
i 
that i think pantagruelism a better thing than
poetry because it is rarer that were imputing
to me the common error estimating things by
their rarity rather than their worth an error
more vulgar than any which sir thomas brown
has refuted but i do hold this that all the
greatest poets have had a spice pantagruelism
in their composition which i verily believe was
essential to their greatness what the world lost
in losing the marries homer we know not
we only know that homer had there proved himself
a pantagruelist shakespear was a pants
 so was cervantes and till the world
shall have produced two other men in whom
that humour has been wanting equal to these i
hold my point established
some one objects milton i thank him for the
exception it is just such an exception as proves
the rule for look only at milton's limbo and
you will see what a glorious pantagruelist he
might have been if the puritans had not spoilt
him for pantagruelism

if william dove had been installed in office
with cap and bells and bauble he would have
been a professor pantagruelism and might
have figured in flogel's history such professors
with tell eulenspiegel piano ariosto
and peter the lion and in douce's illustrations
 shakespear with muckle john trees
panelling and robin rush the humour lay
latent till the boy his nephew hit the spring by
reading to him some those chapters in rabelais
which in their literal grotesqueness were level to
the capacity both these readings led to a

piece practical pantagruelism for which william
would have been whipt if he had worn a
fool's coat
one unlucky day dan was reading to him
that chapter wherein young gargantua relates
the course experiments which he had made
with a velvet mask a leaf vervain his mother's
glove a lappet worked with gold thread a bunch
 nettles and other things more or less unfit for
the purpose to which they were applied to
those who are acquainted with the history 
grandmother's royal family i need not explain
what that purpose was nor must i to those who
are not for reasons that require no explanation
farther than to say it was the same purpose for
which that wild enigma the semicomposition 
the sphinx's ghost was designed that enigma
 all enigmas the wildest
on which was written pfjyjuapwx
william had frequently interrupted him with
bursts laughter but when they came to that
crowning experiment in which gargantua thought
he had found the beau ideal what he was
seeking william clapt his hands and with an
expression glee in his countenance worthy 
eulenspiegel himself exclaimed thou shalttry
the goose dan thou shalt try the goose 
so with william's assistance the goose was
tried they began with due prudence according
to rule by catching a goose in this matter a
couple ducks lord lauderdale knows would
not have answered as well the boy then having
gone through the ceremony which the devotees 
baal are said to have performed at the foot his
image as the highest act devotion an act 
superreverence it was and for which the jews
are said to have called him in mockery baalzebul
instead beelzebub cried out that he was
ready he was at that moment in the third 
those eight attitudes which form a ritfath my
readers who are versed in the fashionable poets 
the day this day i mean their fashion not being
insured for tomorrow such readers i say
know that a rose is called a gaul and a nightingale
a bulbul and that this is one way dressing
up english poetry in turkish costume but
if they desire to learn a little more what mahometan
customs are they may consult d'ohs
son's tableau the ottoman empire and there
they may not only find the eight attitudes described
but see them represented the third
attitude or rukeou as it is denominated i shall
only say that the ancients represented one 
their deities in it and that it is the very attitude
in which as in praesenti committed that notorious
act for which he is celebrated in scholastic
and immortal rhyme and for which poor syntax
bore the blame verbum sit sat sapient during
the reign liberty and equality a frenchman
was guillotined for exemplifying it under
marat's monument in the place du carousal
the bird was brought but young daniel had
not the strength young gargantua the goose
being prevented by william from drawing back
prest forward they were by the side the brook
and the boy by this violent and unexpected movement
was as the french would say in the politest
and most delicate all languages culture or in
sailors english capsized into the water the
misfortune did not there for falling with his
forehead against a stone he received a cut upon
the brow which left a scar as long as he lived
it was not necessary to prohibit a repetition 
what william called the aperient both had
been sufficiently frightened and william never
felt more pain mind than on this occasion
when the father with a shake the head a look
 displeasure and a low voice told him he ought
to have known better than to have put the lad
upon such pranks 
the mishap however was not without its use
for in after life when daniel felt an inclination
to do any thing which might better be left undone
the recollection that he had tried the goose
served as a salutary memento and saved him
perhaps sometimes from worse consequences
chapter xix p i
a conversation with miss graveairs
opera suscepto inserviendum fuit so jacobus bacillus
pleaseth for himself in his translation lucian's dialogues
and so do i i must and will perform my task
burton
it does not signify miss graveairs you may
flirt your fan and overcloud that white forehead
with a frown but i assure you the last chapter
could not be dispensed with the doctor used
to relate the story himself to his friends and
often alluded to it as the most wholesome lesson
he had ever received my dear miss graveairs
let not those intelligent eyes shoot forth in anger
arrows which ought to be reserved for other execution
you ought not to be displeased ought
not must not can not shall not 
but you ought not to write such things mr
author really you ought not what can be
more unpleasant than to be reading aloud and
come unexpectedly upon something so strange
that you know not whether to proceed or make a
full stop nor where to look nor what to do it
is too bad you sir let me tell you and if
i come to any thing more the kind i must
discard the it is provoking enough to
meet with so much that one does not understand 
but to meet with any thing that one ought not to
understand is worse sir it is not to be forgiven 
and i tell you again that if i meet with any thing
more the same kind i must discard the 
nay dear miss graveairs 
i must mr author positively i must
nay dear miss graveairs banish tristan
shandy banish smollett banish fielding banish
richardson but for the doctor sweet doctor
dove kind doctor dove true doctor dove
banish not him banish doctor dove and banish
all the world come come good sense is
getting the better preciseness that stitch in
the forehead will not long keep the brows in their
constrained position and the incipient smile
which already brings out that dimple is the
natural and proper feeling
well you are a strange man 
call me a rare one and i shall be satisfied o
rare ben jonson you know was epitaph enough
for one our greatest men
but seriously why should you put any tiling
in your which if not actually exceptionable
exposes it at least to that sort censure which
is most injurious 
that question dear madam is so sensibly
proposed that i will answer it with all serious
sincerity there is nothing exceptionable in
these volumes certes as euphues lily has
said c i think there be more speeches here which
for gravity will mislike the foolish than unseemly
terms which for vanity may offend the wise
there is nothing in them that i might not have
read to queen elizabeth if it had been my fortune
to have lived in her golden days nothing
that can by possibility taint the imagination or
strengthen one evil propensity or weaken one
virtuous principle but they are not composed
like a forgotten novel dr towers's to be read
aloud in dissenting families instead a moral
essay or a sermon nor like mr ketfs emily to
complete the education young ladies by supplying
them with an abstract universal knowledge
neither have they any pretensions to be
placed on the same shelf with celebes but the
 is a moral its tendency is good and
the morality is both the wholesome and pleasant
because it is not administered as physic
but given as food i don't like morality in
doses
but why my good mr author why lay
yourself open to censure 
miss graveairs nothing excellent was ever
produced by any author who had the fear 
censure before his eyes he who would please
posterity must please himself by chusing his own
course there are only two classes writers
who dare do this the best and the worst for
this is one the many cases in which extremes
meet the mediocre in every grade aim at
pleasing the public and conform themselves to
the fashion their age whatever it may be
my doctor like the matthew henderson 
burns was a queer man and in that respect i his
friend and biographer humbly resemble him
the resemblance may be natural or i may have
caught it this i pretend not to decide but soit
is perhaps it might have been well if i had
resolved upon a farther designation chapters
and distributed them into masculine and feminine
 or into the threefold arrangement virile
feminine and puerile considering the as a
family breakfast where there should be meat for
men muffins for women and milk for children
or i might have adopted the device the hortensia
society and marked my chapters as they
very usefully have done the bible pointing out
what should be read by all persons for edification
and what may be passed over by the many
as instructive or intelligible only to the learned
here however the is
an orchard bearing several trees
and fruits several taste
ladies and gentlemen my gentle readers one
 our liveliest and most popular old dramatists
middleton and rowley's spanish gipsey
knew so well the capricious humour an audience
that he made his prologue say
he'd rather dress upon a triumphday
my lord mayor's feast and make them sauces too
sauce for each several mouth j nay further go
he'd rather build up those invincible pies
and castle custards that affright all eyes
nay eat them all and their artillery
than dress for such a curious company
one single dish
but i gentle readers have set before you a table
liberally spread it is not expected or desired
that every dish should suit the palate all the
guests but every guest will find something that
he likes you madam may prefer those boiled
chicken with stewed celery or a little that
fricandeau the lady opposite will send her
plate for some pigeon pye the doctor has an
eye upon the venison and so i see has the captain
sir i have not forgotten that this is one
 your fast days i am glad therefore that the
turbot proves so good and that dish has been
prepared for you sir john there is garlic in
the fricassee the hungarian wine has a bitterness
which every body may not like the ladies
will probably prefer malmsey the captain
sticks to his port and the doctor to his madeira
sir john i shall be happy to take sauterne
with you there is a splendid trifle for the
young folks which some the elders also will
not despise and i only wish my garden could
have furnished a better dessert but considering
our climate it is not amiss is not this entertainment
better than if i had set you all down to
a round beef and turnips 
if any thing be set to a wrong taste
tis not the meat there but the mouth's displaced 
remove but that sick palate all is well
like such a dinner i would have my books
something for every body's taste and all good 
its kind
it ought also to resemble the personage 
whom it treats and
if ony whiggish whining sot
to blame the doctor dare man 
may cool and sorrow be his lot
for the doctor was a rare man f
some whiggish sots i dare say will blame him
and whiggish sots they will be who do

william had heard so much about experiments
that it is not surprising he should have been for
making some himself it was well indeed for
his family that the speculative mind which lay
covered rather than concealed under the elder
daniel's ruminating manners and quiet contented
course life was not quickened by his acquaintance
with the schoolmaster into an experimental
and dangerous activity instead being satisfied
with theoretical dreams for guy had found a
 in that little collection which might have
produced more serious consequences to the father
than the imitation gargantua had done to the
son
this was the exposition irenaeus
philalethes upon sir george ripley's heretics
works daniel had formerly set as little
value upon it as upon rabelais he knew indeed
what its purport was thus much he had
gathered from it but although it professed to contain
 the plainest and most excellent discoveries
 the most hidden secrets the ancient philosophers
that were ever yet published it was to
him as unintelligible as the mysteries pants
he could make nothing the work
that was to ascend in bus and ubi from the
moon up to the sun though the expositor had
expounded that this was in nubibus nor the
lake which was to be boiled with the ashes 
hermes's tree night and day without ceasing
till the heavenly nature should ascend and the
earthly descend nor the crow's bill the white
vol i k
dove the sparkling cherubim and the soul 
the green lion but he took those cautions
simply and honestly as cautions which were in
fact the lures whereby so many infatuated persons
had been drawn on to their own undoing
the author had said that his work was not written
for the information the illiterate and illiterate
daniel knew himself to be our writings 
says the dark expositor u shall prove as a curious
edged knife to some they shall carve out dainties
and to others it shall serve only to cut their
fingers yet we are not to be blamed for we
do seriously profess to any that shall attempt the
work that he attempts the highest piece philosophy
that is in nature and though we write
in english yet our matter will be as hard as
greek to some who will think they understand
us well when they misconstrue our meaning most
perversely for is it imaginable that they who are
fools in nature should be wise in our books
which are testimonies unto nature and again
make sure thy true matter which is no small
thing to know and though we have named it
yet we have done it so cunningly that thou
mayest sooner stumble at our books than at any
thou ever didst read in thy life be not deceived
either with receipt or discourse for we verily
do not intend to deceive you but if you will be
deceived be deceived our way which is an
easy way and in which no man may err our
broad way our linear way we have vowed never
to reveal it but in metaphor i being moved
with pity will hint it to you take that which
is not yet perfect nor yet wholly imperfect butin
a way to perfection and out it make what
is most noble and most perfect this you may
conceive to be an easier receipt than to take that
which is already perfect and extract out it what
is imperfect and make it perfect and after out 
that perfection to draw a plusquam perfection 
and yet this is true and we have wrought it but
this last discovery which i hinted in few words is
it which no man ever did so plainly lay open 
nor may any make it more plain upon pain an
anathema
all this was heathen greek to daniel except
the admonition which it contained but guy
had meddled with this perilous pseudoscience
and used to talk with him concerning its theory
which daniel soon comprehended and which like
many other theories wanted nothing but a foundation
to rest upon that every thing had its
own seed as well as its own form seemed a reasonable
position and that the ferment virtue
which is the wonder the world and by which
water becomes herbs trees and plants fruits
flesh blood stones minerals and every thing
works only in kind was it not then absurd to
allow that the fermenting and multiplicative
power existed in almost all other things and yet
deny it to gold the most perfect all sublunary
things the secret lay in extracting from gold
its hidden seed
ben jonson has with his wonted ability presented
the theory this delusive art his knavish
alchemist asks an unbeliever
why what have you observed sir in our art
seems so impossible 
surly but your whole work no more t
that you should hatch gold in a furnace sir
as they do eggs in egypt
subtle sir do you
believe that eggs are hatch'd so 
surly if i should 
subtle why i think that the greater miracle
no egg but differs from a chicken more
than metals in themselves
surly that cannot be
the egg's ordained by nature to that 
and is a chicken in potentia
subtle the same we say lead and other metals
which would be gold if they had time
mammon and that
our art doth further
subtle aye for twere absurd
to think that nature in the earth bred gold
perfect in the instant something went before
there must be remote matter
surly ay what is that 
subtle marry we say
mammon ay now it heats j stand father 
pound him to dust
subtle it is the one part
a humid exhalation which we call
materia liquida or the unctuous water 
on the other part a certain crass and viscous
portion earth both which incorporate
do make the elementary matter gold 
which is not yet propria materia t
but common to all metals and all stones 
for where it is forsaken that moisture
and hath more dryness it becomes a stone 
where it retains more the humid fatness
it turns to sulphur or to quicksilver
who are the parents all other metals
nor can this remote matter suddenly
progress so from extreme unto extreme
as to grow gold and leap o'er all the means
nature doth first beget the imperfect then
proceeds she to the perfect that airy
and oily water mercury is engendered 
sulphur the fat and earthy part j the one
which is the last supplying the place male
the other the female in all metals
some so believe hermaphrodite
that both do act and suffer but these too
make the rest ductile malleable extensive
and even in gold they are for we do find
seeds them by our fire and gold in them 
and can produce the species each metal
more perfect thence than nature doth in earth
i have no cause to say here with sheik mohammed
ali hazin that taste for poetical and
elegant composition has turned the reins my
inkdropping pen away from the road which lay
before it for this passage learned ben lay
directly in the way and no where reader couldst
thou find the theory the alchemists more ably
epitomized
 father said the boy daniel one day after
listening to a conversation upon this subject i
should like to learn to make gold
and what wouldst thou do daniel if thou
couldst make it was the reply
why i would build a great house and fill
it with books and have as much money as the
king and be as great a man as the squire 
mayhap daniel in that case thou wouldst
care for books as little as the squire and have as
little time for them as the king learning is
better than house or land as for money enough
is enough no man can enjoy more and the
less he can be contented with the wiser and better
he is likely to be what daniel does our good
poet tell us in the great versebook 
nature's with little pleased enough's a feast 
a sober life but a small charge requires 
but man the author his own unrest
the more he hath the more he still desires
no boy thou canst never be as rich as the king
nor as great as the squire but thou mayest be a
philosopher and that is being as happy as either
a great deal happier said guy the squire
is as far from being the happiest man in the
neighbourhood as he is from being the wisest or
the best and the king god bless him has
care enough upon his head to bring on early grey
hairs
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
but what does a philosopher do rejoined
the boy the squire hunts and shoots and
smokes and drinks punch and goes to justicemeetings
and the king goes to fight for us
against the french and governs the parliament
and makes laws but i cannot tell what a philosopher's
business is do they do any thing
else besides making almanac and gold 
yes said william they read the stars
and what do they read there 
what neither thou nor i can understand
daniel replied the father however nearly it
may concern us 
chapter xxi p i
a doubt concerning the uses philosophy
el comienzo de salut
es el saber
distinguish y concern
qual es virtue
proverbial del marques de santillana
that grave reply produced a short pause it
was broken by the boy who said returning to
the subject i have been thinking father that
it is not a good thing to be a philosopher
u and what my son has led thee to that
thought 
what i have read at the the dictionary
father there was one philosopher
that was pounded in a mortar
k 
that daniel said the father could neither
have been the philosopher's fault nor his choice
but it was because he was a philosopher
my lad said guy that he bore it so bravely
and said beat on you can only bruise the shell
 anaxarchus if he had not been a philosopher
they might have pounded him just the
same but they would never have put him in the
dictionary epictetus in like manner bore the
torments which his wicked master inflicted upon
him without a groan only saying take care or
you will break my leg and when the leg was
broken he looked the wretch in the face and said
i told you you would break it 
but said the youngster there was one
philosopher who chose to live in a tub and
another who that he might never again see anything
to withdraw his mind from meditation put
out his eyes by looking upon a bright brass basin
such as i cured my warts in
he might have been a wise man said william
dove but not wondrous wise for if he had he
would not have used the basin to put his eyes
out he would have jumped into a quickset
hedge and scratched them out like the man our
town because when he saw his eyes were out
he might then have jumped into another hedge
and scratched them in again the man our
town was the greatest philosopher the two
and there was one continued the boy who
had better have blinded himself at once for he
did nothing else but cry at every thing he saw
was not this being very foolish 
i am sure says william it was not being
merry and wise
there was another who said that hunger was
his daily food
he must have kept such a table as duke
humphrey quoth william i should not have
liked to dine with him
then there was crates said the persevering
boy he had a good estate and sold it and
threw the money into the sea saying away ye
paltry cares i will drown you that you may
not drown me 
i should like to know quoth william what
the overseers said to that chap when he applied
to the parish for support
they sent him off to bedlam i suppose
said the mother it was the fit place for him
poor creature
and when aristippus set out upon a journey
he bade his servants throw away all their money
that they might travel the better why they
roust have begged their way and it cannot be
right to beg if people are not brought to it by
misfortune and there were some who thought
there was no god i am sure they were fools
for the bible says so
well daniel said guy thou hast studied
the the dictionary to some purpose 
and the bible too master guy said dinah
her countenance brightening with joy at
her son's concluding remark
it's the best part the said the boy
replying to his schoolmaster there are more
entertaining and surprizing things there than i
ever read in any other place except in my father's
 about pantagruel

the elder daniel had listened to this dialogue
in his usual quiet way smiling sometimes at his
brother william's observations he now stroked
his forehead and looking mildly but seriously at
the boy addressed him thus
my son many things appear strange or silly
in themselves if they are presented to us simply
without any notice when and where they were
done and upon what occasion if any strangers
for example had seen thee washing thy hands in
an empty basin without knowing the philosophy
 the matter they would have taken thee for an
innocent and thy master and me for little better 
or they might have supposed some conjuring was
going on the things which the old philosophers
said and did would appear i dare say as
wise to us as they did to the people their own
times if we knew why and in what circumstances
they were done and said
daniel there are two sorts men in all ranks
and ways life the wise and the foolish and
there are a great many degrees between them
that some foolish people have called themselves
philosophers and some wicked ones and some
who were out their wits is just as certain as
that persons all these descriptions are to be
found among all conditions men
philosophy daniel is two kinds that
which relates to conduct and that which relates
to knowledge the first teaches us to value all
things at their real worth to be contented with
little modest in prosperity patient in trouble
equalminded at all times it teaches us our
duty to our neighbour and ourselves it is that
wisdom which king solomon speaks in our
rhymebook reach me the volume then
turning to the passage in his favourite du bartas
he read these lines 
she's god's own mirror j she's a light whose glance
springs from the lightening his countenance
she's mildest heaven's most sacred influence 
never decays her beauties excellence
aye like herself and she doth always trace
not only the same path but the same pace
without her honor health and wealth would prove
three poisons to me wisdom from above
is the only moderate spring and guide
organ and honor all gifts beside
but let us look in the bible aye this is the
place
for in her is an understanding spirit holy
one only manifold subtil lively clear undefiled
plain not subject to hurt loving the thing that
is good quick which cannot be letted ready todo
good 
kind to man steadfast sure free from care
having all power overseeing all things and
going through all understanding pure and most
subtil spirits
for wisdom is more moving than any motion 
she passeth and goeth through all things by
reason her pureness
for she is the breath the power god
and a pure influence flowing from the glory 
the almighty therefore can no defiled thing fall
into her
for she is the brightness the everlasting
light the unspotted mirror the power god
and the image his goodness
and being but one she can do all things and
remaining in herself she maketh all things new 
and in all ages entering into holy souls she
maketh them friends god and prophets
for god loveth none but him that dwelleth
with wisdom
for she is more beautiful than the sun and
above all the order stars being compared
with the light she is found before it
for after this cometh night but vice shall
not prevail against wisdom
he read this with a solemnity that gave weight
to every word then closing the after a
short pause he proceeded in a lower tone
the philosophers whom you have read in
the dictionary possessed this wisdom only in
part because they were heathens and therefore
could see no farther than the light mere reason
sufficed to shew the way the fear the lord
is the beginning wisdom and they had not
that to begin with so the thoughts which ought
to have made them humble produced pride and
so far their wisdom proved but folly the humblest
christian who learns his duty and performs
it as well as he can is wiser than they he does
nothing to be seen men and that was their
motive for most their actions
now for the philosophy which relates to
knowledge knowledge is a brave thing i am a
plain ignorant untaught man and know my
ignorance but it is a brave thing when we look
around us in this wonderful world to understand
something what we see to know something
 the earth on which we move the air which we
breathe and the elements whereof we are made 
to comprehend the motions the moon and
stars and measure the distances between them
and compute times and seasons to observe the
laws which sustain the universe by keeping all
things in their courses to search into the mysteries
 nature and discover the hidden virtue
 plants and stones and read the signs and
tokens which are shown us and make out the
meaning hidden things and apply all this to
the benefit our fellow creatures
wisdom and knowledge daniel make the
difference between man and man and that between
man and beast is hardly greater
these things do not always go together
there may be wisdom without knowledge and
there may be knowledge without wisdom a
man without knowledge if he walk humbly with
his god and live in charity with his neighbours
may be wise unto salvation a man without
wisdom may not find his knowledge avail him
quite so well but it is he who possesses both
that is the true philosopher the more he
knows the more he is desirous knowing and
yet the farther he advances in knowledge the
better he understands how little he can attain
and the more deeply he feels that god alone can
satisfy the infinite desires an immortal soul
to understand this is the height and perfection
 philosophy
then opening the bible which lay before him
he read these verses from the proverbs
my son if thou wilt receive my words
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom
and apply thine heart to understanding 
yea if thou cries after knowledge and lifted
up thy voice for understanding 
if thou meekest after her as silver and searchest
for her as for hid treasures 
then shalt thou understand the fear the
lord and find the knowledge god
for the lord giveth wisdom out his
mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous
he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly
he keeper the paths judgement and
preserved the way his saints
then shalt thou understand righteousness
and judgement and equity yea every good path
when wisdom entered into thine heart and
knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul 
discretion shall preserve thee understanding
shall keep thee
to deliver thee from the way the evil
daniel my son after a pause he pursued
thou art a diligent good lad god hath given
thee a tender and a dutiful heart keep it so and
it will be a wise one for thou hast the beginning
 wisdom i wish thee to pursue knowledge
because in pursuing it happiness will be found by
the way if i have said any thing now which is
above thy years it will come to mind in aftertime
when i am gone perhaps but when thou
mayest profit by it god bless thee my child 
he stretched out his right hand at these words
and laid it gently upon the boy's head what
he said was not forgotten and throughout life
the son never thought that blessing without
feeling that it had taken effect

were it not for that happy facility with which
the mind in such cases commonly satisfies itself
my readers would find it not more easy to place
themselves in imagination at ingleton a hundred
years ago than at thebes or athens so strange
must it appear to them that a family should have
existed in humble but easy circumstances among
whose articles consumption neither tea nor
sugar had a place who never raised potatoes in
their garden nor saw them at their table and
who never wore a cotton garment any kind
equally unlike any thing to which my contemporaries
have been accustomed must it be for
them to hear an englishman whose talk was
 philosophy moral or speculative not politics 
who read books in folio and had never seen a
newspaper nor ever heard a magazine review
or literary journal any kind not less
strange must it seem to them who if they please
may travel by steam at the rate thirty miles an
hour upon the liverpool and manchester railway
or at ten miles an hour by stage upon any the
more frequented roads to consider the little
intercourse which in those days was carried on
between one part the kingdom and another
during young daniel's boyhood and for many
years after he had reached the age manhood
the whole carriage the northern counties and
indeed all the remoter parts was performed by
packhorses the very name which would long
since have been as obsolete as their use if it had
not been preserved by the sign or appellation 
some those inns at which they were accustomed
to put up rarely indeed were the roads about
ingleton marked by any other wheels than those
 its indigenous carts
that little town however obtained considerable
celebrity in those days as being the home and
headquarters rowland dixonthe gesticulator
maximus or puppetshowmastergeneral the
north a person not less eminent in his line than
power whom the spectator has immortalized
my readers must not form their notion rowland
dixon's company from the ambulatory puppet
shows which late years have added new
sights and sounds to the spectacles and cries 
london far be it from me to depreciate those
peripatetic street exhibitions which you may have
before your window at a call and by which the
hearts so many children are continually delighted
 nay i confess that few things in that
great city carry so much comfort to the cockles
 my own as the wellknown voice punch
the same which in my schoolboy days
i listened to
as wordsworth says the cuckoo
and i can listen to it yet
and listen till i do beget
that golden time again
it is a voice that seems to be as much in accord
with the noise towns and the riotry fairs
as the note the cuckoo with the joyousness
 spring fields and the fresh verdure the
vernal woods
but rowland dixon's company puppets
would be pitifully disparaged if their size uses or
importance were to be estimated by the street
performances the present day
the dramatis personae these modern exhibitions
never i believe comprehends more than
four characters and these four are generally the
same to wit punch judy as she who used to be
called joan is now denominated the devil and
the doctor or sometimes the constable in the
doctor's stead there is therefore as little variety
in the action as in the personages and
their dimensions are such that the whole company
and the theatre in which they are exhibited
are carried along the streets at quick time and
with a light step by the two persons who manage
the concern
but the rowlandian devonian or ingletonian
puppets were large as life and required for their
removal a caravan in the use to which that word is
now appropriated a vehicle such magnitude
and questionable shape that if don quixote had
encountered its like upon the highway he would
have regarded it as the most formidable adventure
which had ever been presented to his valour
and they went as far beyond our streetpuppets
in the sphere their subjects as they exceeded
them in size for in that sphere quicquid agent
homines was included and a great deal more
in no country and in no stage society has
the drama ever existed in a ruder state than that
in which this company presented it the rolls
 bartholomew fair were hardly so far below
the legitimate drama as they were above that 
rowland dixon for the rolls were written compositions
 much ribaldry might be and no doubt
was interpolated as opportunity allowed or invited
 but the main dialogue was prepared hereon
the contrary there was no other preparation
vol i l
than that frequent practice the stock pieces
were founded upon popular stories or ballads such
as fair rosamond jane shore and bateman who
hanged himself for love with scriptural subjects
for easter and whitsunweek such as the creation
the deluge susanna and the elders and
nebuchadnezzar or the fall pride these
had been handed down from the time the old
mysteries and miracleplays having in the progress
 time and change descended from the
monks and clergy to become the property such
managers as power and rowland dixon in
what manner they were represented when thus
fallen fallen fallen fallen
fallen from their high estate
may be imagined from a playbill queen anne's
reign in which one them is thus advertised 
at crawley's booth over against the crown
tavern in smithfield during the time bartholomew
fair will be presented a little opera
called the old creation the world yet newly
revived with the addition noah's flood also
several fountains playing water during the time
 the play the last scene does present noah
and his family coming out the ark with all
the beasts two and two and all the fowls the
air seen in a prospect sitting upon trees likewise
over the ark is seen the sun rising in a most
glorious manner moreover a multitude angels
will be seen in a double rank which presents
a double prospect one for the sun the other fora
palace where will be seen six angels ringing
 bells likewise machines descend from above

i have not found it any where stated at what
time these irreverent representations were discontinued
in england nor whether which is not
unlikely they were put an to by the interference
 the magistrates the autos sacramental
which form the most characteristic department
 the spanish drama were prohibited
at madrid in at the instance the conte
de tea then archbishop toledo chiefly
because the profaneness the actors and the
indecency the places in which they were represented
 it seems therefore that if they had been
performed by clerks and within consecrated predirects
he would not have objected to them the
religious dramas though they are not less extraordinary
and far more reprehensible because in
many instances nothing can be more pernicious
than their direct tendency were not included in
the same prohibition the same marks external
reverence not being required for saints and images
as for the great object romish idolatry these
probably will long continue to delight the spanish
people but facts the same kind may be
met with nearer home so recently as the year
 the sacrifice isaac was represented on the
stage at paris samson was the subject the ballet
the unshorn son manual delighted the

punch indeed bore a part and that part is well
described in the verses entitled pupae gesticulated

in one particular only this description is unlike
the punch the ingleton company he was not
an homuncio but a full grown personage who
had succeeded with little alteration either attributes
or appearance to the vice the old mysteries
and served like the clown our own early
stage and the gracious the spaniards to scatter
mirth over the serious part the performance
or turn it into ridicule the wife was an appendage
 later times when it was not thought
good for punch to be alone and when as these
performances had fallen into lower hands the
quarrels between such a pair afforded a standing
subject equally adapted to the capacity the
interlocutor and his audience
a tragic part was assigned to punch in one 
rowland dixon's pieces and that one the
most popular being the celebrated tragedy 
jane shore the beadle in this piece after proclaiming
in obvious and opprobrious rhyme the
offence which had drawn upon mistress shore
this public punishment prohibited all persons
from relieving her on pain death and turned
her out according to the common story to die 
hunger in the streets the only person who
ventured to disobey this prohibition was punch
the baker and the reader may judge the dialogue
 these pieces by this baker's words when
he stole behind her and nudging her furtively
while he spake offered her a loaf saying tacit
jenny tak it t for which act so little consonant
with his general character punch died a
martyr to humanity by the hangman's hands
dr dove used to say he doubted whether
garrick and mrs gibber could have affected him
more in middle life than he had been moved by
punch the baker and this wooden jane shore in his
boyhood for rude as were these performances
and nothing could possibly be ruder the effect
on infant minds was prodigious from the accompanying
sense wonder an emotion which all
others is at that time life the most delightful
here was miracle in any quantity to be seen for
twopence and be believed in for nothing no
matter how confined the theatre how coarse and
inartificial the scenery or how miserable the properties
 the mind supplied all that was wanting
mr guy said young daniel to the schoolmaster
after one these performances i wish
rowland dixon could perform one our latin
dialogues
aye daniel replied the schoolmaster entering
into the boy's feelings it would be a grand
thing to have the three fatal sisters introduced
and to have them send for death and then for
death to summon the pope and regulate him 
and invite the emperor and the king to dance 
and disarm the soldier and pass sentence upon
the judge and stop the lawyer's tongue 
and feel the physician's pulse and make the
cook come to be killed and send the poet
to the shades and give the drunkard his last
draught and then to have rhadamanthus
come in and try them all methinks daniel that
would beat jane shore and fair rosamond all
to nothing and would be as good as a sermon
to boot
i believe it would indeed said the boy
and then to see mors and natura and have
donatus called up and the three lacedaemon
at supper upon the sirloin a king and
the roasted doctor divinity and the cruel
schoolmaster's rump would not it be nice
mr guy 
the pity is daniel replied guy that
rowland dixon is no latimer any more than
those who go to see his performances
but could not you put it into english for
him mr guy 
i am afraid daniel rowland dixon would
not thank me for my pains besides i could
never make it sound half so noble in english as
in those grand latin verses which fill the mouth
and the ears and the mind aye and the heart
and soul too no boy schools are the proper
places for representing such pieces and if i had
but latimer enough we would have them ourselves
but there are not many houses my good
daniel in which learning is held in such esteem
as it is at thy father's if there were i should
have more latin scholars and what is far
more consequence the world would be wiser and
better than it is

it was not often that rowland dixon exhibited
at ingleton he took his regular circuits to the
fairs in all the surrounding country far and wide 
but in the intervals his vocation he who when
abroad was the servant the public became his
own master at home his puppets were laid up in

a performer a very different kind used in
those days to visit ingleton in his rounds where
his arrival was always expected by some the
community with great anxiety this was a
certain dr green who having been regularly
educated for the profession medicine and regularly
graduated in it chose to practice as an
itinerant and take the field with a merry andrew
for his aiddecamp he was a respectable
and wealthy family in the neighbourhood 
doncaster which neighbourhood on their account
he never approached in his professional circuits
though for himself he was far from being ashamed
 the character that he had assumed the
course which he had taken had been deliberately
chosen with the twofold object gratifying his
own humour and making a fortune and in the
remoter as well as in the immediate purpose he
succeeded to his heart's content
it is not often that so much worldly prudence
is found connected with so much eccentricity

he is indeed a fortunate man who if he must have
a hobbyhorse which is the same as saying if he
will have one keeps it not merely for pleasure
but for use breaks it in well has it entirely under
command and gets as much work out it
as he could have done out a common roadster
dr green did this he had not taken to this
strange course because he was impatient the
restraints society but because he fancied that
his constitution both body and mind required
an erratic life and that within certain
bounds which he prescribed for himself he might
indulge in it both to his own advantage and
that the community that part the community
at least among whom it would be his lotto
labour our laws had provided itinerant
courts justice for the people our church
had formerly provided itinerant preachers and
after the reformation when the mendicant orders
were abolished by whom this service used to be
performed such preachers have never failed to
appear during the prevalence any religious
influenza dr green thought that itinerant physicians
were wanted and that if practitioners regularly
educated and well qualified would condescend
to such a course the poor ignorant people
would no longer be cheated by travelling quacks
and sometimes poisoned by them 
one the most reprehensible arts to which the
reformers resorted in their hatred popery was
that adapting vulgar verses to church tunes
and thus associating with ludicrous images or
with something worse melodies which had formerly
been held sacred it is related whitefield
that he making a better use the same
device fitted hymns to certain popular airs because
he said there was no reason why the
devil should keep all the good tunes to himself
green acted upon a similar principle when he
took the field as a physician errant with his
man kemp like another sancho for his squire
but the doctor was no quixote and his merry
andrew had all sanctions shrewdness without
any alloy his simpleness
in those times medical knowledge among the
lower practitioners was at the lowest point except
in large towns the people usually trusted to
domestic medicine which some lady bountiful
administered from her family receipt or to
a village distress whose prescriptions were as
likely sometimes to be dangerously active as at
others to be ridiculous and inert but while they
held to their garden physic it was seldom that any
injury was done either by exhibiting wrong medicines
or violent ones

without any that after he had shewed them the
way they by their labour and industry which
renders every thing more acceptable might find
out the rest it was an opinion often expressed
by a physician great and deserved celebrity
that in course time specifics would be discovered
for every malady to which the human frame
is liable he never supposed though few men
have ever been more sanguine in their hopes and
expectations that life was thus to be indefinitely
prolonged and that it would be man's own fault
or his own choice if he did not live for ever but
he thought that when we should thus have been
taught to subdue those diseases which cut our life
short we should like the patriarchs live out the

it is indeed reasonable to suppose that others

the highest reputation throughout the sphere

whenever he came there he used to send for the

always glad if he could find an opportunity also 
conversing with the elder daniel as the flossofer

to him more curious things relating to his
own art but william kept out the presence 
strangers and had happily no ailments to make
him seek the doctor's advice his occasional indispositions
were but slight and he treated them in
his own way that way was sometimes merely
superstitious sometimes it was whimsical and
sometimes rough if his charms failed when he
tried them upon himself it was not for want 
faith when at any time it happened that one
 his eyes was bloodshot he went forthwith in
search some urchin whose mother either for laziness
or in the belief that it was wholesome tohave
it in that state allowed his ragged head to serve
as a free warren for certain small deer one

him as if he loved him put it into his eye when
according to william's account the insect fed upon
what it found cleared the eye and disappearing
he knew not where or how never was seen more
his remedy for the cholic was a pebble posset 
white pebbles were preferred and these what
was deemed a reasonable quantity was taken in
some sort milk porridge upon the same
theory he sometimes swallowed a pebble large
enough as he said to clear all before it and for
that purpose they have been administered 
larger calibre than any bolus that ever came from
the hands the most merciless apothecary as
large indeed sometimes as a common sized walnut
does the reader hesitate at believing this an
ignorant man living in a remote part the
country well might william dove be excused

in his primitive physic quicksilver to betaken
ounce by ounce to the amount one two
or three pounds till the desired effect was produced

having read in dr gerhard the admirable
effects the swallowing a gold bullet upon
his father in a case which baxter supposed to
be like his own got a gold bullet between
twenty and thirty shillings weight and swallowed
it having taken it says he i knew not how
to be delivered it again i took clusters and
purges for about three weeks but nothing stirred
it and a gentleman having done the like the
bullet never came from him till he died and it
was cut out but at last my neighbours set a day
apart to fast and pray for me and i was freed
from my danger in the beginning that day f

chapter xxvi p i
daniel at doncaster j the reason why he was
destined for the medical profession rather
than holy orderly and some remarks upon
sermons
je ne veux dissimuler y amy lecteur queue riaye lien prdveu
et me tiens pour tenement advert que ne puis eviter la reprehension
d'aucuns et les calumnies de plusieurs ausquels best
esprit ddsplaira du tout christopher de harcourt
fotjeteen years have elapsed since the scene
took place which is related in the twentysecond
chapter and daniel the younger at the time to
which this present chapter refers was residing at
doncaster with peter hopkins who practised the
medical art in all its branches he had lived
with him eight years first as a pupil latterly in
the capacity an assistant and afterwards as an
adopted successor
how this connection between daniel and peter
hopkins was brought about and the circumstances
which prepared the way for it would
have appeared in some the nonexistent fourteen
volumes if it had pleased fate that they
should have been written
some my readers and especially those who
pride themselves upon their knowledge the
world or their success in it will think it strange
perhaps that the elder daniel when he resolved
to make a scholar his son did not determine
upon breeding him either to the church or the
law in either which professions the way was
easier and more inviting now though this will
not appear strange to those other readers who
have perceived that the father had no knowledge
 the world and could have none it is nevertheless
proper to enter into some explanation
upon that point
if george herbert's temple or his remains
or his life by old izaak walton had all or
any them happened to be among those few
but precious books which daniel prized so highly
and used so well it is likely that the wish his
heart would have been to train up his son for a
priest to the temple but so it was that none
 his reading was a kind to give his thoughts
that direction and he had not conceived any
exalted opinion the clergy from the specimens
which had fallen in his way a contempt which
was but too general had been brought upon the
order by the ignorance or the poverty a great
proportion its members the person who
served the humble church which daniel dutifully
attended was almost as poor as a capuchins and
quite as ignorant this poor man had obtained
in evil hour from some easy or careless bishop a
licence to preach it was reprehensible enough
to have ordained one who was destitute every
qualification that the office requires the fault
was still greater in promoting him from the desk
to the pulpit
a very great scholar is quoted by dr
echard as saying that such preaching as is
usual is a hindrance salvation rather than the
means to it this was said when the fashion
 conceited preaching which is satirized in frey
gerundio had extended to england and though
that fashion has so long been obsolete that many
persons will be surprized to hear it had ever
existed among us it may still reasonably be questioned
whether sermons such as they commonly
are do not quench more devotion than they
kindle
my lord put not the aside in displeasure
 i address myself to whatever bishop maybe
reading it unblessed i will not call myself
for i am a true and orthodox churchman
and have the interests the church zealously at
heart because i believe and know them to be
essentially and inseparably connected with those
 the commonwealth but i have been an
attentive observer and as such request a hearing
receive my remarks as coming from one whose
principles are in entire accord with your lordship's
whose wishes have the same scope and
purport and who while he offers his honest
opinion submits it with proper humility to your
judgement
the founders the english church did not
intend that the sermon should invariably form a
part the sunday services it became so in
condescension to the puritans whom it has
long been the fashion to speak with respect instead
 holding them up to the contempt and
infamy and abhorrence which they have so richly
merited they have been extolled by their descendants
and successors as models patriotism
and piety and the success with which this delusion
has been practised is one the most remarkable
examples what may be effected by
dint effrontery and persevering falsehood
that sentence i am certain will not be disapproved
at fulham or lambeth dr southey
or dr phillpots might have written it
the general standard the clergy has undoubtedly
been very much raised since the days
when they were not allowed to preach without a
licence for that purpose from the ordinary
nevertheless it is certain that many persons who
are in other and more material respects well or
even excellently qualified for the ministerial functions
may be wanting in the qualifications for a
preacher a man may possess great learning
sound principles and good sense and yet be
without the talent arranging and expressing
his thoughts well in a written discourse he may
want the power fixing the attention or reaching
the hearts his hearers and in that case the
discourse as some old writer has said in serious
jest which was designed for edification turns to
edification the evil was less in addison's days
when he who distrusted his own abilities availed
himself the compositions some approved
divine and was not disparaged in the opinion 
his congregation by taking a printed volume into
the pulpit this is no longer practised but instead
 this which secured wholesome instruction
to the people sermons are manufactured for
sale and sold in manuscript or printed in a
cursive type imitating manuscript the articles
which are prepared for such a market are for the
most part copied from obscure books with more
or less alteration language and generally for
the worse and so far as they are drawn from
such sources they are not likely to contain anything
exceptionable on the score doctrine but
the best authors will not be resorted to for fear
 discovery and therefore when these are used
the congregation lose as much in point instruction
as he who uses them ought to lose in
selfesteem
but it is more ins curious when a more scrupulous
man composes his own discourses if he be
deficient either in judgement or learning he is
then more likely to entangle plain texts than to
unravel knotty ones rash positions are sometimes
advanced by such preachers unsound arguments
are adduced by them in support 
momentous doctrines and though these things
neither offend the ignorant and careless nor injure
the wellminded and wellinformed they carry
poison with them when they enter a diseased ear
it cannot be doubted that such sermons act as
corroborative for infidelity
nor when they contain nothing that is actually
erroneous but are merely improving are they
in that case altogether harmless they are not
harmless if they are felt to be tedious they are
not harmless if they terrify the understanding 
a chill that begins there may extend to the vital
regions bishop taylor the great jeremy says
 devotional books that they are in a large degree
the occasion so great devotion as prevails
among the generality nominal christians being
he says represented naked in the conclusions
 spiritual life without or art or learning 
and made apt for persons who can do nothing but
believe and love not for them that can consider
and love this applies more forcibly to bad
sermons than to commonplace books devotion
the may be laid aside if it offend the reader's
judgement but the sermon is a positive infliction
upon the helpless hearer
the same bishop and his name ought to carry
with it authority among the wise and the good
has delivered an opinion upon this subject in
his admirable apology for authorized and set
forms liturgy indeed he says if i may
freely declare my opinion i think it were not
amiss if the liberty making sermons were
something more restrained than it is and that
such persons only were intrusted with the liberty
for whom the church herself may safely be responsive
that is men learned and pious and that
the other part the vulgus clerk should instruct
the people out the fountains the church and
the public stock till by so long exercise and disvol
i n
cipline in the schools the prophets they may
also be intrusted to minister their own unto
the people this i am sure was the practice 
the primitive church
i am convinced said dr johnson that i
ought to be at divine service more frequently
than i am but the provocations given by ignorant
and affected preachers too often disturb the mental
calm which otherwise would succeed to prayer
i am apt to whisper to myself on such occasions
how can this illiterate fellow dream fixing
attention after we have been listening to the
sublimest truths conveyed in the most chaste
and exalted language throughout a liturgy which
must be regarded as the genuine offspring 
piety impregnated by wisdom take notice
however he adds though i make this confession
respecting myself i do not mean to recommend
the fastidiousness that sometimes leads me
to exchange congregational for solitary worship
the saintly herbert says
judge not the preacher for he is thy judge 
if thou dislike him thou conceives him not
god calleth preaching folly do not grudge
to pick out treasures from an earthen pot
the worst speak something good if all want sense
god takes a text and preached patience
he that gets patience and the blessing which
preachers conclude with hath not lost his pains
this sort patience was all that daniel could
have derived from the discourses the poor
curate and it was a lesson which his meek
and benign temper stood in no need nature
had endowed him with this virtue and this
sunday's discipline exercised without strengthening
it while he was in the phrase the religious
public sitting under the preacher he
obeyed to a certain extent george herbert precept
that is he obeyed it as he did other laws
with the existence which he was unacquainted 
let vain or busy thoughts have there no part 
bring not thy plough thy plots thy pleasure thither
pleasure made no part his speculations at anytime
plots he had none for the plough
it was what he never followed in fancy patiently
as he plodded after the furrow in his own vocation
and then for worldly thoughts they were
not likely in that place to enter a mind which
never at any time entertained them but to that
sort thought if thought it may be called
which cometh as it listen and which when the
mind is at ease and the body in health is the
forerunner and usher sleep he certainly gave
way the curate's voice past over his ear like
the sound the brook with which it blended and
it conveyed to him as little meaning and less feel
ing during the sermon therefore he retired
into himself with as much or as little edification
as a quaker finds at a silent meeting
it happened also that the few clergy within
the very narrow circle in which daniel moved
some were in no good repute for their conduct
and none displayed either that zeal in the discharge
 their pastoral functions or that earnestness
and ability in performing the service 
the church which are necessary for commanding
the respect and securing the affections the
parishioners the clerical profession had never
presented itself to him in its best which is really 
its true light and for that cause he would never
have thought it for the boy even if the means
 putting him forward in this path had been
easier and more obvious than they were and
for the dissenting ministry daniel liked not the
name a nonconformist the puritans had
left behind them an ill savour in his part the
country as they had done every where else and
the extravagances the primitive quakers
which during his childhood were fresh in remembrance
had not yet been forgotten
it was well remembered in those parts that the
vicar kirkby lonsdale through the malignity
 some his puritanical parishioners had been
taken out his bed from his wife who was then
big with child and hurried away to lancaster
jail where he was imprisoned three years for no
other offence than that fidelity to his church
and his king and that the man who was a
chief instigator this persecution and had enriched
himself by the spoil his neighbour's
goods though he flourished for a while bought
a field and built a fine house came to poverty at
last and died in prison having for some time
received his daily food there from the table one
 this very vicar's sons it was well remembered
also that in a parish the adjoining countypalatine
the puritanical party had set fire in the
night to the rector's barns stable and parsonage
and that he and his wife and children had only
as it were by miracle escaped from the flames
william dove had also among his traditional
stores some stories a stranger kind concerning
the quakers these parts the north having
been a great scene their vagaries in their early
days he used to relate how one them went
into the church at brough during the reign 
the puritans with a white sheet about his body
and a rope about his neck to prophesy before
the people and their whig priest as he called
him that the surplice which was then prohibited
should again come into use and that the gallows
should have its due and how when their ringleader
george fox was put in prison at carlisle
the wife justice benson would eat no meat
unless she partook it with him at the bars his
dungeon declaring she was moved to do this
wherefore it was supposed he had bewitched her
and not without reason for when this old george
went as he often did into the church to disturb
the people and they thrust him out and fell
upon him and beat him sparing neither sticks
nor stones if they came to hand he was presently
for all that they had done to him as sound and
as fresh as if nothing had touched him and
when they tried to kill him they could not take
away his life i and how this old george rode a
great black horse upon which he was seen in the
course the same hour at two places threescore
miles distant from each other and how some
 the women who followed this old george used
to strip off all their clothes and in that plight go
into the church at service time on the sunday to
bear testimony against the pomps and vanities 
the world and to be sure said william they
must have been witched or they never would
have done this lord deliver us said dinah
to be sure they must to be sure they must
lord bless us all said shaggy

among the people who were converted to the
christian faith during the sixth century were two
tribes or nations called the lazy and the mani
methinks it had been better if they had been
left unconverted for they have multiplied prodigiously
among us so that between the lazy
christians and the zany ones christianity has
grievously suffered
it was one the zany tribe whom guy once
heard explaining to his congregation what was
meant by urim and thummim and in technical
phrase improving the text urim and thummim
he said were two precious stones or rather
stones above all price the hebrew names 
which have been interpreted to signify light and
perfection or doctrine and judgement which
luther prefers in his bible and in which some
 the northern versions have followed him or
the shining and the perfect or manifestation
and truth the words in the original being capable
 any or all these significations they
were set in the high priest's breastplate judgement
and when he consulted them upon any
special occasion to discover the will god they
displayed an extraordinary brilliancy if the matter
which was referred to this trial were pleasing
to the lord jehovah but they gave no lustre if
it were disapproved my brethren said the
preacher this is what learned expositors jewish
and christian tell me concerning these two precious
stones the stones themselves are lost
but my christian brethren we need them not
for we have a surer means consulting and discovering
the will god and still it is by urim
and thummim if we alter only a single letter in
one those mysterious words take your bible
my brethren use him and thumb him use him
and thumb him well and you will discover the
will god as surely as ever the high priest did
by the stones in his breast plate 
what daniel saw the lazy and what he
heard the mani prevented him from ever forming
a wish to educate his son for a north country
cure which would have been all the preferment
that lay within his view and yet if any person
to whose judgement he deferred had reminded
him that bishop latimer had risen from as humble
an origin it might have awakened in him a
feeling ambition for the boy not inconsistent
with his own philosophy
but no suggestions could ever have induced
daniel to chuse for him the profession the
law the very name lawyer was to him a
word evil acceptation montaigne has a pleasant
story a little boy who when his mother
had lost a lawsuit which he had always heard her
speak as a perpetual cause trouble ran up
 to him in great glee to tell him the loss as a
matter for congratulation and joy the poor child
thought it was like losing a cough or any other
bodily ailment daniel entertained the same
sort opinion concerning all legal proceedings
he knew that laws were necessary evils but he
thought they were much greater evils than there
was any necessity that they should be and believing
this to be occasioned by those who were
engaged in the trade administering them he
looked upon lawyers as the greatest pests in the
country
because their being merely avarice
winds up their wits to such a nimble strain
as helps to blind the judge not give him eyes
he had once been in the courts at lancaster
having been called upon as witness in a civil
suit and the manner in which lie was cross examined
there by one those young spruce
lord brooke
lawyers whom donne has so happily characterized
as being
all impudence and tongue
had confirmed him in this prejudice what he
saw the proceedings that day induced him to
agree with beaumont and fletcher that
justice was a cheesemonger a mere cheesemonger
weighed nothing to the world hut mites and maggots
and a main stink law like a horsecourser
her rules and precepts hung with gauds and ribbands
and pampered up to cozen him that bought her
when she herself was hackney lame and founder'd
his was too simple and sincere an understanding
to admire in any other sense than that 
wondering at them
men that large profession that can speak
to every cause and things mere contraries
till they are hoarse again yet all be law 
that with most quick agility can turn
and rereturn can make knots and undo them
give forked counsel take provoking gold
on either hand and put it up these men
he knew would thrive f
but far was he from wishing that a son his
should thrive by such a perversion his intelwoman
pleased f ben jonson
actual powers and such a corruption his moral
nature
on the other hand he felt a degree respect
amounting almost to reverence for the healing
art which is connected with so many mysteries
 art and nature and therefore when an opportunity
offered placing his son with a respectable
practitioner who he had every reason
for believing would behave toward him with careful
and prudent kindness his entire approbation
was given to the youth's own choice

combien de changeless depuis que suis au monde

pasquin
peter hopkins was a person who might have
suffered death by the laws solon if that code
had been established in this country for though
he lived in the reigns george i and george ii
he was neither whig nor tory hanoverian nor
jacobite when he drank the king's health with
any his neighbours he never troubled himself
with considering which king was intended nor to
which side the water their good wishes were
directed under george or charles he would
have been the same quiet subject never busying
himself with a thought about political matters
and having no other wish concerning them than
that they might remain as they were so far he
was a hanoverian and no farther there was
something the same temper in his religion he
was a sincere christian and had he been born to
attendance at the mass or the meeting house
would have been equally sincere in his attachment
to either those extremes for his whole
mind was in his profession he was learned in
its history fond its theories and skilful in
its practice in which he trusted little to theory
and much to experience
both he and his wife were at this time well
stricken in years they had no children and no
near kindred on either side and being both kindhearted
people the liking which they soon entertained
toward daniel for his docility his simplicity
 heart his obliging temper his original
cast mind and his never failing goodhumour
ripened into a settled affection
hopkins lived next door to the mansion house
which edifice was begun a few years after daniel
went to live with him there is a view the
mansion house in dr miller's history doncaster
and in that print the dwelling in question
is included it had undergone no other alteration
at the time this view was taken than that 
having had its casements replaced by sash windows
an improvement which had been made by
our doctor when the frame work the casements
had become incapable repair the gilt
pestle and mortar also had been removed from its
place above the door internally the change had
been greater for the same business not being
continued there after the doctor's decease the
shop had been converted into a sitting room and
the very odour medicine had passed away
but i will not allow myself to dwell upon this
melancholy subject the world is full mutations
and there is hardly any that does not bring
with it some regret at the time and alas more
in the retrospect i have lived to see the american
colonies separated from great britain the
kingdom poland extinguished the republic 
venice destroyed its territory seized by one
usurper delivered over in exchange to another
and the transfer sanctioned and confirmed by all
the powers europe in congress assembled 
i have seen heaven knows how many little principalities
and states proud their independance
and happy in the privileges connected with it
swallowed up by the austrian or the prussian
eagle or thrown to the belgic lion as his share
in the division the spoils i have seen constitutions
spring up like mushrooms and kicked
down as easily i have seen the rise and fall 
napoleon
i have seen cedars fall
and in their room a mushroom grove 
i have seen comets threatening all
vanish themselves 
wherefore then should i lament over what time
and mutability have done to a private dwellinghouse
in doncaster 
it was an old house which when it was built
had been one the best in doncaster and even
after the great improvements which have changed
the appearance the town had an air antiquated
respectability about it had it been near
the church it would have been taken for the
harrington
vicarage standing where it did its physiognomy
was such that you might have guessed it was the
doctor's house even if the pestle and mortar had
not been there as his insignia there were eight
windows and two doors in front it consisted 
two stories and was oddly built the middle part
having something in the scotch manner the form
 a gable towards the street behind this
was a single chimney tall and shaped like a j
pillar in windy nights the doctor was so often
consulted by mrs dove concerning the stability
 that chimney that he accounted it the plague
 his life but it was one those evils which
could not be removed without bringing on a worse
the alternative being whether there should be a
toll chimney or a smoky house and after the
mansion house was erected there was one wind
which in spite the chimney's elevation drove
the smoke down so inconvenient is it sometimes
to be fixed near a great neighbour
this unfortunate chimney being in the middle
 the house served for four apartments the
doctor's study and his bedchamber on the upper
floor the kitchen and the best parlour on the
lower that parlour yes reader that very parlour
wherein as thou canst not have forgotten
mrs dove was making tea for the doctor on that
ever memorable afternoon with which our history
begins

in our method narration nothing has been inartificially
anticipated that there have been no
premature disclosures no precipitation no hurry
or impatience on my part and that on the other
hand there has been no unnecessary delay but
that we have regularly and naturally come to this
development the author who undertakes a

well and wisely will never be accused speaking

my good readers will remember that as
was duly noticed in our first chapter p i the
clock st george's had just struck five when
mrs dove was pouring out the seventh cup 
tea for her husband and when our history opens
i have some observations to make concerning
both the tea and the tea service which will clear
the doctor from any imputation intemperance
in his use that most pleasant salutiferous and
domestication beverage but it would disturb
the method my narration were they to be introduced
in this place here i have something
to relate about the clock some forty or fifty
years ago a butcher being one the churchwardens
 the year and fancying himself in that
capacity invested with full power to alter and improve
any thing in or about the church thought
proper to change the position the clock and
accordingly had it removed to the highest part 
philemon
the tower immediately under the battlements
much beautiful gothic work was cut away to
make room for the three dials which he placed
on three sides this fine tower and when he
was asked what had induced him thus doubly to
disfigure the edifice by misplacing the dials and
destroying so much the ornamental part the
great and greasy pillow answered that by fixing
the dials so high he could now stand at his own
shop door and see what it was o'clock that
convenience this arrant churchwarden had the
satisfaction enjoying for several years there
being no authority that could call him to account
for the insolent mischief he had done but
archdeacon markham to his praise be it spoken
at the the last century prevailed on the
then churchwardens to remove two the dials
and restore the architectural ornaments which
had been defaced
this was the clock which with few intervals
measured out by hours the life daniel dove
from the seventeenth year his age when he
first set up his rest within its sound
perhaps all the works man sundials and
churchclocks are those which have conveyed
most feeling to the human heart the clock more
than the sundial because it speaks to the ear as
well as to the eye and by night as well as by day
our forefathers understood this and therefore
they not only gave a tongue to time but provided
that he should speak often to us and remind
us that the hours are passing their
quarterboys and their chimes were designed for
this moral purpose as much as the memento
which is so commonly seen upon an old clockface
and so seldom upon a new one i never
hear chimes that they do not remind me those
which were formerly the first sounds i heard in
the morning which used to quicken my step on
my way to school and which announced my release
from it when the same tune methought had
always a merrier import when i remember
their tones life seems to me like a dream and a
train recollections arises which if it were allowed
to have its course would in tears

the bells st george's doncaster i say
were not christened because they were protestant
bells for distinction's sake however we will
name them as the bells stand in the dirge that
unfortunate cat whom johnny green threw into
the well
but it will be better to exhibit their relative
weights in figures so that they may be seen

i cannot but admit that these appellations are
not so stately in appearance as those the peal
which the bishop chains recently baptized
and called a happy and holy family in the
edifying discourse that he delivered upon the
occasion the first these was called marie to
which or to whom the duke and duchess 
mandeville so the newspapers give this name
stood sponsors it is you marie said the bishop
who will have the honor to announce the festivals
and proclaim the glory the lord you appear
among us under the most happy auspices presented
by those respectable and illustrious hands
to which the practices piety have been so long
familiar and you anne he pursued addressing
the second bell an object worthy the
zeal and piety our first magistrate the prefect
and her who so nobly shares his solicitude
you shall be charged with the same
employment your voice shall be joined to marie's
upon important occasions ah what touching
lessons will you not give in imitation her
whose name you bear and whom we reverence
as the purest virgins you also deodate will
take part in this concert you whom an angel a
newborn infant has conjointly with me consecrated
to the lord speak deodate and let
us hear your marvellous accents this angel
and godmother in whose name the third bell
was given was mademoiselle deodate basset
then in the second month her age daughter
 viscount basset and you stephanie
crowned with glory continued the orator in
learned allusion to the greek word ravoe you
are not less worthy to mingle your accents with
the melody your sisters and you lastly seraphina
and pudentiemie you will raise your voices
in this touching concert happy all you in having
been presented to the benedictions the
church by these noble and generous souls so
praiseworthy for the liveliness their faith and
the holiness their example and then the
bishop concluded by calling upon the congregation
to join with him in prayer that the almighty
would be pleased to preserve from all accidents
this happy and holy family the bells 
we have no such sermons from our bishops 
the whole ceremony must have been as useful to
the bells as it was edifying to the people
were i called upon to act as sponsor upon such
an occasion i would name my bell peter bell in
honour mr wordsworth there has been a
bull so called and a bull it was great merit
but if it were the great bell then it should be
called andrew in honour dr bell and that
bell should call the children to school
there are i believe only two bells in england
which are known by their christian names and
they are both called tom but great tom 
oxford which happens to be much the smaller 
the two was christened in the feminine gender
being called mary in the spirit catholic and
courtly adulation at the commencement the
bloody queen's reign gresham the vicechancel
lor performed the ceremony and his exclamation
when it first summoned him to mass has been recorded
 o delicate and sweet harmony o
beautiful mary how musically she sounds 
how strangely she pleaseth my ear f
in spite this christening the object dr
gresham's admiration is as decidedly a tombell
as the puss in boots who appeared at a
masquerade theodore hook remembers when
and where was a tom cat often as the said
tombell has been mentioned there is but one
other anecdote recorded him it occurred on
thursday the thirteenth day march and
was thus described in a letter written two hours
after the event an odd thing happened today
about half past four tom suddenly went mad 
he began striking as fast as he could about twenty
times every body went out doubting whether
there was an earthquake or whether the dean
was dead or the college on fire however nothing
was the matter but that tom was taken ill
in his bowels in other words something had
happened to the works but it was not any
serious consequence for he has struck six as well
as ever and bids fair to toll tonight as well
as he did before the attack
this was written by a youth great natural
endowments rare acquirements playful temper
and affectionate heart if his days had been prolonged
his happy industry his inoffensive wit his
sound judgement and his moral worth favoured
as they were by all favourable circumstances must
have raised him to distinction and the name 
barre roberts which is now known only in the
little circle his own and his father's friends
would have had its place with those who have
deserved well their kind and reflected honor
upon their country
but i return to a subject which would have
interested him in his antiquarian pursuits for
he loved to wander among the ruins time
we will return therefore to that ceremony 
christening church bells which with other practices
 the holy roman catholic and apostolic
church has been revived in france
bells say those theologians in issimi who
have gravely written upon this grave matter
bells say they are not actually baptized with
that baptism which is administered for the remission
 sins but they are said to be christened
because the same ceremonies which are observed
in christening children are also observed in consecrating
them such as the washing the anointing
and the imposing a name all which however
may more strictly be said to represent the signs
and symbols baptism than they may be called
baptism itself
nothing can be more candid bells are not
baptized for the remission sins because the original
sin a bell would be a flaw in the metal
or a defect in the tone neither which the priest
undertakes to remove there was however a previous
ceremony blessing the furnace when the
bells were cast within the precincts a monastery
as they most frequently were in former times and
this may have been intended for the prevention 
such defects the brethren stood round the furnace
ranged in processional order sang the th
psalm and then after certain prayers blessed the
molten metal and called upon the lord to infuse
into it his grace and overshadow it with his power
for the honor the saint to whom the bell was
to be dedicated and whose name it was to bear
when the time christening came the officiating
priest and his assistant named every bell
five times as a sort prelude for some unexplained
reason which may perhaps be as significant
and mystical as the other parts the ceremony
he then blessed the water in two vessels
which were prepared for the service dipping a
clean linen cloth in one these vessels he washed
the bell within and without the bell being suspended
over a vessel wider in circumference than
the bell's mouth in order that no drop the
water employed in this washing might fall to the
ground for the water was holy certain psalms
were said or sung they were the th and the
four last in the psalter during this part the
ceremony and while the officiating priest prepared
the water in the second vessel this he
did by sprinkling salt in it and putting holy oil
upon it either with his thumb or with a stick 
if the thumb were used it was to be cleaned
immediately by rubbing it well with salt over the
same water then he dipt another clean clotho

in this oiled and salted water and again washed
the bell within and without after the service
the cloths were burnt lest they should be profaned
by other uses the bell was then authentically
named then it was anointed with chrism
in the form a cross four times on the broadest
part the outside thrice on the smaller part
and four times on the inside those parts being
anointed with most care against which the clapper
was to strike after this the name was again
given myrrh and frankincense were then
brought the bell was incensed while part a
psalm was recited and the bell was authentically
named a third time after which the priest carefully
wiped the chrism from the bell with tow
and the tow was immediately burnt in the censer
next the priest struck each bell thrice with its
clapper and named it again at every stroke 
every one the assistants in like manner struck
it and named it once the bells were then carefully
covered each with a cloth and immediately
hoisted that they might not be contaminated by
any irreverent touch the priest concluded by
explaining to the congregation if he thought
proper the reason for this ceremony christening
the bells which was that they might act as
preservatives against thunder and lightning and
hail and wind and storms every kind and
moreover that they might drive away evil spirits
to these and their other virtues the bishop 
chains alluded in his late truly gallican and
roman catholic discourse the bells said he
placed like sentinels on the towers watch over
us and turn away from us the temptations the
enemy our salvation as well as storms and
tempests they speak and pray for us in our
troubles they inform heaven the necessities
 the earth
now were this edifying part the roman
catholic ritual to be reintroduced in the british
dominions as it very possibly may be now that
lord peter has appeared in his robes before the
king and been introduced by his title the opportunity
would no doubt be taken by the bishop
or jesuit who might direct the proceedings 
complimenting the friends their cause by naming
the first holy and happy family after them
and to commemorate the extraordinary union 
sentiment which that cause has brought about between
persons not otherwise remarkable for any
similitude feelings or opinions they might unite
two or more names in one bell as is frequently
done in the human subject and thus with a peculiar
felicity compliment shew who and who
upon this great and memorable occasion have
putted together in such a case the names selected
for a peal eight tunable bells might run thus

bell lord king per se 
alone par excellence as the thickest and thinnest
friend the cause and moreover because
none but himself can be his parallel 
and last in order because the base note accords
best with him and because for the decorum and
dignity with which he has at all times treated the
bishops the clergy and the subject religion
he must be allowed to bear the bell not from his
compeers alone but from all his contemporaries

there are more mysteries in a peal bells
than were touched upon by the bishop chains
in his sermon there are plain bobtriples
bobmajors bobmajors reversed double bobmajors
and grandsirebobcators and there is a
bobmaximus who bob was and whether he
were bob major or major bob that is whether
major were his name or his rank and if his rank
to what service he belonged are questions which
inexorable oblivion will not answer however earnestly
adjured and there is no witch ensor
who will call up bob from the grave to answer
them himself but there are facts in the history
 bellringing which oblivion has not yet made
her own and one them is that the greatest
performance ever completed by one person in the
world was that mr samuel thornton at the
new theatre public house in the city norwich
on saturday evening july when
he struck all these intricate short peals the first
four upon a set eight musical hand bells the
last on a peal ten
but a performance upon handbells when compared
to bellringing is even less than a review in
comparison with a battle strength arm as
well as skill is required for managing a bell rope
samuel thornton's peal plain bobtriples was
nobly brought round in two minutes and three
quarters and his grandsirebobcators were as
nobly finished in five minutes and fourteen seconds
the reader shall now see what real bellringing
is
the year was remarkable for the performance
 great exploits in this manly and
english art for to england the art is said to be
peculiar the cheerful garrisons the continent
being played by keys in that year and in the
month august the westmorland youths rang
a complete peal grandsire triples in st
mary's church kendal being the whole number
 changes on seven bells the peal was divided
into ten parts or courses each the bobs
were called by the sixth a lead single was made
in the middle the peal and another at the conclusion
which brought the bells home distinct
leads and exact divisions were observed throughout
the whole and the performance was completed
in three hours and twenty minutes a
like performance took place in the same month at
kidderminster in three hours and fourteen minutes
stephen hill composed and called the
peal it was conducted through with one single
which was brought to the th change viz
 this was allowed by those who were
conversant in the art to exceed any peal ever yet
rung in this kingdom by that method
paulo majora calamus the society cambridge
youths that same year rang in the church
 st mary the great a true and complete peal
 bob maximus in five hours and five minutes
this consisted changes and for regularity
 striking and harmony throughout the
peal was allowed by competent judges to be a
very masterly performance in point time the
striking was to such a nicety that in each thousand
changes the time did not vary one sixteenth
 a minute and the compass the last thousand
was exactly equal to the first
eight birmingham youths some them were
under twenty years age attempted a greater
exploit they ventured upon a complete peal 
 bob major they failed indeed magnus
tamen amis for after they had rang upwards
 eight hours and a half they found themselves
so much fatigued that they desired the caller
would take the first opportunity to bring the
bells home this he soon did by omitting a bob
and so brought them round thus making a peal
 changes in eight hours and fortyfive
minutes the longest which was ever rung in that
part the country or perhaps any where else
in that same year died mr patrick the celebrated
composer churchbellmusic and senior
 the society cumberland youths an hibernian
sort distinction for one in middle or
later life he is the same person whose name was
well known in the scientific world as a maker 
barometers and he it was who composed the
whole peal seaman's triples changes
which his obituary says had till then been
deemed impracticable and for the discovery 
which he received a premium offered for
that purpose by the norwich amateurs the art
his productions real double and treble bob
royal being a standing monument his unparalleled
and superlative merits this mr patrick
was interred on the afternoon sunday june
 in the churchyard st leonard shoreditch
the corpse was followed to the grave by all the
ringing societies in london and its environs each
sounding hand bells with muffled clappers the
church bells at the same time ringing a dead peal 
q o'iy afifyieirov ratyov harping ooflaoio
james ogden was interred with honours the
same kind at ashton under line in the year 
this present writing his remains were
borne to the grave by the ringers st michael's
tower in that town with whom he had rung
the tenor bell for more than fifty years and with
whom he performed the unprecedented feat 
ringing five thousand on that bell which weighed
 cwt in his sixty seventh year after the
funeral his old companions rang a dead peal
for him changes that being the number
 the months his life such in england are
the funeral honors the beartso
it would take years to ring the changes
upon twelve bells at the rate two strokes to a
second the changes upon fourteen could not be
rung through at the same rate in less than 
years and upon four and twenty they would require
more than billions years
great then are the mysteries bellringing 
and this may be said in its praise that all
devices which men have sought out for obtaining
distinction by making a noise in the world it is
the most harmless

what said those bells to him that happy day 
for that bells can convey articulate sounds to
those who have the gift interpreting their
language whittington lord mayor london
town knew by fortunate experience
so did a certain father confessor in the netherlands
whom a buxom widow consulted upon the
perilous question whether she should marry a second
husband or continue in widowed blessedness
the prudent priest deemed it too delicate a point
for him to decide so he directed her to attend to
the bells her church when next they chimed
they were but three in number and bring him
word what she thought they said and he exhorted
her to pray in the mean time earnestly for
grace to understand them rightly and in the
sense that might be most for her welfare here and
hereafter as he on his part would pray for her
sheltered with mouth and ears the first time that
the bells struck up and the more she listened
the more plainly they said tempt been man
tempt been man take a spouse take a
spouse r aye daughter said the confessor
when she returned to him with her report if
the bells have said so so say i and not i alone
but the apostle also and the spirit who through
that apostle hath told us when it is best for us to
marry reader thou mayest thank the leonine
poet gummarus van cran for this good story
what said the bells doncaster to our dear

to take it and it wid be necessary therefore to
say something the opportunities instruction
which he enjoyed under hopkins and the
state society in doncaster at that time and
preliminary to as preparatory for all this some
account is to be given doncaster itself

thus ronald came saw and was gone unseen
unknown who can tell what a day may
bring forth what a moment may annihilate
ere the sun complete its diurnal course what
clouds events pass and repass o'er the surface
 time's dial surely man differs little from
the atoms which sport in the sunbeam and well
may his life be compared to the vigour that
passeth away to the shadow which pocket
the eye to the dream that scarlet by night
he is born and grows up like the grass and
like the grass he withers before it is noon or
sus before the scythe in all its pride and 
h

head his cistern was broken and he sought not
the fountain from whence he might draw living
waters to revive his soul he was laden with
grief and the darkness age came like the
mist the desert in vain did edith struggle
against her own sorrow in attempts to mitigate
the grief her wretched father in vain his
two faithful adhts sought in their own way
to turn his mindicm the gloomy object on which
it dwelt in a sort pahichstruck stupor one
is not and all seem to have departed


and where was reginald that he was not
with the mourners to mingle his tears with
theirs and by his presence to cheer and support
them in the hour sorrow alas edith could
not answer for although he had been written
to on the first alarm norman's illness no answer
had been received and many weeks had
passed since she had heard from him thus
the fever anxiety was now added to the endurance
 anguish and the tears that fell for
her brother were rendered doubly bitter by the
neglect her lover yet still not even to herself
would she acknowledge that she distrusted
him it was impossible that reginald coidd be
false and that single word was the sheetanchor
 her soul to that she clung with fearful tenacity
and worlds could not have wrested it from
a
 destiny
her true it was equally impossible to account
for reginald's conduct but ihat she felt assured
would one day be fully explained she would not
she said she could not an instant doubt it but
unconsciously the poison distrust was creeping
slowly and silently into her heart and corroding
her very lifespring to add to her suffering
glenroy having surmounted the first shock 
his son's death now became impatient for reginald's
return and as if eager to turn his thoughts
to another channel he talked unceasingly him
and all that was tobe donner and by him for
reginald was now the heir not only his
honours but his whole estates as all were
entitled the natural impatience his temper
was ideo aggravated by his personal infirmities 
gout and indolence and high living and mental
affliction combined had all done the work
and more than the work time for time alone
would not have made him the old and broken
down man he now was to add to hxs disquiet
he had no proper object for his irritation to work
upon at that particular time for benbowie was
at all times too passive to serve his purpose and
destiny 
mrs macauley had gone for a few days to pay a
manage visit to a tiieee mr maoauley's who
had lately matted and settled in dbe neighbourhood
at least a dozen times array he would btk
edith if dire was no news reginald yet and
then he would ring the bell and order the servants
to go to the ferry or to die tatian and see
if there were any signs him and he would
call the housekeeper to know if sir reginald's
rooms were ready yet for that he expected him
home that day then as he dozed and nodded
in his armchair he wouldsuddenly start up
will was not reginald to have been home
before now and what's keeping him then and
where's molly macauley that she's not in the
way from die first hour her departure
that had been the constant demand or worst
 all he would turn to edith with a dreamy
bewildered look and say aye aye if s irell
you're to be married to reginald very well
it will be all his own but videre is he when
are you to make out the marriage you'll surely
be married soon now my dear will you not
at lengtho agitation unspeakableditfa
 destiny
received a letter in the wellknown handwriting
 her lover it bore a foreign postmark and
the black seal denoted that the intelligence 
norman's dead had reached him edith's hand
trembled and the teardrops swelled in her eyes
 he knows all she thought and yet he
comes not to us he can calmly write perhaps
it is to tell us that he is not coming ah
how cold seems written condolence at such a
time and she remained for some moments passive
under the mute agony apprehension
at length sheidpened the letter and her
doubts were dispelled it was brief and agitated
 spirit he had only just learnt the sad tidings
 norman's death and the expressions his
grief were frantic and fill selfupbraiding that
he had not set off on the first accounts his
cousin's illness he said he never could forgive
himself for having been absent at such a time 
but he was just setting off for britain and would
be at glenroy almost as soon as his letter a
sentence had been begin and if you still love
me as i but his pen had been drawn through
bestir 
it and he abruptly added stiny
the hand on which he himself had placed the
ring betrothment he started and suddenly
dropping it walked with hurried steps to the 
 the room then as quickly returning he
clasped edith in his arms and tenderly kissed
her cheek but while he did so tears burst from
his eyes the hearts both were too full
for utterance a spell seemed upon their lips
and they remained in deep and silent emotion
yet an unconcerned spectator would have remarked
that sir reginald's embarrassment was
equal to his emotion and that something more
than sorrow struggled in his bosom and choaked
his utterance but edith was too much under
the influence powerful feeling herself to be a
nice observer what was passing in the mind
 another her tears continued to flow from
the mingled tide grief and joy which swelled
her heart
a long pause ensued at length sir reginald
as if by a violent effort spoke
 i have been delayed by illness said he
the tone and accent though beautifully modulated
were languid and mournful and they sounddestiny

ed so strange that edith could scarcely have
recognised in them the gay familiar tones which
still dwelt in fond memory's ear still it was
reginald that spoke and these few simple words
at once dispelled all the vague doubts which had
arisen from his unaccountable delay
you have been ill she exclaimed and
i did not know it and you have hastened to us
even before you are recovered 
 but it is too late said he bitterly
no no dear reginald do not say so we
still need your sympathy her voice faultered
and iain her tears fell a sigh almost a groan 
broke from sir reginald's heart he rose and
traversed the apartment then resumed his seat
and leaning his head on a table tears forced their
way through the fingers which shaded his brow
but again he roused himself and strove to speak
calmly and firmly while he enquired how
is glenroy
you will find him changed much changed
replied edith striving to subdue her emotion
also but the sight you will i am sure do
him good ah reginald you are now his only
 destiny
hope she stopped for her firmness was forsaking
her
and you edith and you gasped he ashe
again buried his sice in his hands and his
whole frame shook with emotion what am i
to you
edith was silent reginald heavily raised his
head but his enquiring gaze met only the deep
blush and the downcast eye love revealed
though not avowed then in a tone forced
composure he said 
 edith should you have known me again 
am not i changed he added attempting to
smile whue he grew very pale
 we are all changed said she sadly for
we have all known affliction since we parted
but you have been ill in health and you concealed
it from me while i ah reginald had
you bill guessed what
 i have been ill interrupted he hurriedly 
 but that is past at least the worst but you
say glenray is much altered had i not better
go to him the sooner the meeting is over the
better
destiny 
 perhaps so said edith if you feel able
for it but you are fatigued shad you not better
rest and
no nothing i wish it over said he impatiently
 i will do any thing every thing
for you both he added with emotion
 i am sure you will said edith with simple
earnestness and if you wish to comfort us
you will yourself be comforted now go dear
reginald she extended her hand he took it
pressed it in his with a sigh then slowly quitted
the apartment
 destiny
chapter iii
edith remained motionless and bewildered
 her heart sank she knew not why her
tears flowed she could not tell for what reginald
was returned ought she not to be happy
but was it her own her longloved her loving
reginald she had beheld oh surely he was
changed others nought think him improved
but no change could improve that image so
deeply impressed upon her heart edith loved
too profoundly to admire
a long time elapsed ere she heard her father's
slow and shuffling step crossing the hall to the
drawing room which he entered leaning on or
rather clinging to reginald as if afraid he would
again desert him the traces agitation were
still visible in his face for his grief for the loss
 his son had been all awakened at sight his
destiny 
nephew that son's once inseparable playfellow
and companion now come to fill his place and
succeed to all that should have been his but
the first burst sorrow was over and he again
talked in his usual rambling desultory way 
the worldly objects to which his soul still cleaved
his estates his rents his woods his cattle his
improvements every thing in short which
could still minister to his pride
 glenroy has lost none his hospitality since
i left him said reginald addressing edith ashe
passed supporting her father to his seat
 and i daresay you can guess how unavailing
remonstrance is at those times
 he has only been making up for my romish
sion then replied she as i forgot to ask
whether you had dined perhaps she added
with a slight blush that is because i had never
before had occasion to treat you as a stranger
 treat him as a stranger exclaimed glenroy
angrily i'll have no strangers here i
never desire to see the face a stranger within
my door remember that edith and to treat
 destiny
reins as a stranger my own nephewthe
mm that you're to 
o papa interrupted edidi hastily i beg
your pardon but you have quite misunderstood
me i did not mean i
 no matter whether i've misunderstood you
or not cried glenroy i say once for all
j reginald's not to be treated as a stranger
in this house she's to do as he pleases remember
that reginald you're to do exactly as you
please i'm getting old now reginald and
i've lost him that 
here grief for a moment got ae better his
anger and he groaned in tire bitterness his
heart
 my cousin does herself injustice said reginald
trying to soothe the weak and irritated
feelings the old man she received me with
more kindness than i deserved and he sighed
as be said it
how could that be cried glenroy impatiently
 and to treat you as a stranger too 
and what would become me if it was not for
you reginald and her too remember
destiny 
binald you're just as much master here as if
as ever my own poor boy was here another
momentary gush sorrow checked him but
quickly mastering it he called ring the bell
benbowie she's grown as deaf s a post ring
it againeve it another tug what the plague
are these lazy dogs about 
then when the summons was answered by
the butler and deputy bearing tea and coffee
 it wasn't that i rung for but you all make one
errand answer for two if there should be a dozen
 you there boyd remember i desire you
and all you to treat sir reginald with the
greatest respect and to obey him the same as
myself you bear me and desire mrs pattison
to give us a supper like a dinner and that
quickly now don't you interfere reginald
as his nephew was about to remonstrate i'm
master here and i'll do as i please and it is my
pleasure that you should be well treated and do
as you please remember that edit and
boyd let all the servants have as much drink as
they choose tonight to drink sir reginald's

 destiny
health and welcome home where's that idiot
molly macaulay that she's not in the way
 i have missed my kindhearted goodnae
tured old friend said sir reginald i hope
she is not far off
but before edith had time to answer glenroy
with the rambling garrulity an infirm
mind had started another subject you would
see reginald that my tenants had got the principal
premiums from the highland society this
year mclaren that's he that has the farm
 kildrunnach you know up glendochart the
same land mtaggart had a lease before your
tune he got no fewer than three premiumsone
was for the draining the dhu moss you
remember the dhu moss reginald up beyond
the roebuck park many a time you've shot
a roebuck there and the very last time norman
was out he shot three with his own hand
he had become the very best shot in the countries
he had but there was not his latch
for any thing nothing nothing here another
tide fond recollection for a moment
stopped the current poor glenlby's words 
destiny 
but he quickly rallied and resumed you
would observe the plantation on the skirridale
hill as you came along reginald that s all
new and i'll venture to say you never saw a
finer plantation and by the by reginald
there's been some thinning the wood since
you were here and i must cut some more 
they're too thick too thick a great deal i'll
give you a good portion with edith out the
thinning the glenhaussen wood and you
shall mark the trees yourself reginald we'll
ride up tomorrow and look at them if you'll
put me in mind benbowie ring the bell do
you hear boyd you'll send one the men
directly to the stables to desire mnab to have
my horse ready for me to ride tomorrow i'll
let him know at what hour and he's to go
directly and stay do you hear boyd she's
to bring the black mare for sir reginald the
black mare repeated he as the servant left
the room that was norman's and the handsomest
creature i ever saw mnab tells me
lord allonby would give any money for her
but i'll not jpkrt with her for what's money to
vol ii b
 destiny
me now that he's gone but it's yours now
refined you shall have anything that belonged
to him you shall you shall reginald aye
lord auonby wanted to have her so mnab
told me thais he you know that courted
edith when 
oh papa p exclaimed edith in a deprecating
tone and blushing deeply as reginald
turned upon her a look surprise which fixed
into a piercing gaze most earnest scrutiny
it's no secret fm sure cried glenroy
angrily and if it was i'll have no secrets here
for the conceited puppy thought he might have
her for the asking i believe but upon my
honour reginald i would rather you had her
than any man living i would upon my soul 
what's lord auonby or any lord amongst
them to me the king can make a lord any
day but i defy him to make the chief glenroy
 and that's what you'll be reginald when
tm gone and you're more to me than all the
lords in the creation now that i've no son my
own grasping his nephew's hand in strong
emotion and edith shall retours as soon
destiny 
as we can get every thing settled and in the
mean time we'll take a ride tomorrow and seethe
trees marked and edith is there no word
 that molly macauley yet 
in this sort bald disjointed chat the evening
wore heavily away without the lovers having
an opportunity conversing for an instant
apart for glenroy would not suffer reginald to
stir from his side and seemed even loath to lose
sight him when they separated for the night
 destiny
chapter iv
hitherto edith had felt chilled and disappointed
reginald it was true had been so
engrossed by her father that it had not been in
his power to devote himself to her but he had
not even looked as if he wished it his air had
been sad and abstracted and only once had she
seen his eye kindle with its wonted fire and
that was at the mention lord allonby as her
lover the report had gone abroad though
without foundation that he was an accepted one
and it might have reached reginald and hence
all the mystery he had been piqued angry
jealous and her father's words had merely conveyed
the impression that she had rejected him asa
suitor but could reginald then have believed
her capable even in thought breaking her
plighted faith and renouncing herrst her only
destiny 
love and would he have yielded her up to a rival
without a word yes generous and highminded
as he was he would have disdained to remonstrate
but o show he must have despised her and
edith's cheek burned even at the thought then
the strange expressions in his letter his unaccountable
delay in returning his agitation at
 meetinglus abstracted and gloomy airwere
all these to be referred to the same source yes
partly to that and partly to the mournful circumstances
under which they had met the loss
 norman the infirmities her fitter both
in mind and body must have shocked one who
had so much cause to love him as reginald had
and thus edith strove to soothe her wounded
feelings and bar her breast against the admission
 doubts worse than death but all these
reflections did not enable her to meet her lover
with that easy artless confidence manner
which had formerly rendered their intercourse so
delightful when they met at the breakfasttable
there was mutual embarrassment reginald
seemed less sad indeed than on the preceding
evening but still there was none that
 destiny
gaiety and playfulness manner which had
been so often wont to call up the smiles on her
cheek his manners were all elegance and
suavity but they lacked the affectionate warmth
 former days and though his countenance was
more than ever expressive the fire and sensibility
 his mind still no bright or tender glance
repeated the ofttold tale fond happy youthful
affection the kind sweet smile old
the conversation or rather talk was carried
on by glenroy in the same strain mingled
pride vanity lamentation and tautology there
was all the detail the premiums and the dhu
moss and the account the new plantations
greatly enlarged and the anticipation the
thinning with the purpose for which they were
to be applied and then came the black mare
and lord allonby and at the mention his
name reginald who had been sunk in a reverie
suddenly started and again cast on edith
a look which seemed as if it would have pierced
into her soul and again the blood mounted to
her temples at the suspicion it implied
i hope edith you will be our party to
destiny 
glenhaussen said he gaily what a charming
morning this is 
 i have been little in the practice riding
for some time replied she and am become
such a timid horsewoman that i fear i should
only be an encumbrance
 where is it we're going reginald cried
glenroy o aye to look at the glenhaufr
sen woods but what would take her there 
riding's not the thing for a lady lord allonby
thaf s he thaf wants the black mare thaf i
was talking about he courted edith too that
belonged to my norman as if i would part
with it to any man breathing but yourself reginald
 and thaf s not parting with it neither
for i hope you and i will never part reginald
you shall be as much master here as i am and
when you're married to edit h what have
you dropped reginald edith will you mind
what you're about and not set the table in a
swim and and why is that idiot molly
macauley not here to make the tea dislike 
and we were speaking about ridings what
 destiny
was it for i don't know what i am about 
not that if s your fault reginald but edith you
really have not ben yourself since that puppy
lord allonby put nonsense in your head
poor edith was aghast at this accusation
accustomed as she was to the capricious garrulity
 her ther's temper but the set was
glenroy by one the inexplicable contradictions
 nature even while indulging his spleen
in chiding and censuring his daughter sought
at the same time to give her consequence in the
eyes his nephew by perpetually adverting to
the noble and wealthy suitor who had courted
her alliance reginald seemed to feel for her
consio for taldng her hand he said with a
look almost fond entreaty come now edith
don't refuse my first request do go with us 
 i will said edith softly if you really
wish it
 can you doubt it replied reginald in the
same tone
but glenroy seemed so bent on monopolizing
his nephew's company and conversation as to
destiny 
grudge even a portion it to his daughter for
he said peevishly if s not a woman's business
we're going about we're going to look at the
glenhaussen woods are we not slegmaid
then what can she know about the thinning 
woodshhe knows enough when she knows she's
to have them or her tocher and not a bad me
either reginald mcintosh tells me seven diott
sand pounds worth will never be missedsand
as many more as you like but i'll be hanged
if i would have given a single stick to that
lord yours edith what cared i for him and
what was he to me a bit lowland lord that
has hardly a hill in ail the highlands now but
edith dear do as you like and you shall have
the first thousand the cuttings to buy your
wedding trumpery and you'll get that fool molly
macauley to help you what the plague's come
over the creature 
reginald said nothing but his countenance was
overcast and when edith rose from the breakfast
table he neither repeated his request nor reminded
her her promise but as she was leaving the
b
 bfistiny
room she heard him say with quickness there
can be no hurry as to marking the trees glenroy 
and if but here glenroy with his
usual impatience contradiction broke in no
hurry but i tell you there is a hurry reginald
and if it had not been for norman's death which
i shall never get the better here a passionate
burst grief concluded the sentence
and edith only learnt how the discussion had
ended when n hour afterwards she saw her
fitter and lover ride off without her
that reginald was piqued and jealous she
thought was now certain for how could she otherwise
account for such capricious inequalities
from the moment his arrival her mind had
been in too great a tremor to admit her marking
accurately the sudden changes his manner 
if she had she would have drawn a very different
inference edith's feelings were all too pure
and devoted to allow her enjoying any womanish
triumph at this supposed discovery on the contrary
her gentle guileless heart was pained at the
thought that she was the cause uneasiness to
destiny 
reginald a few words from her lips she was
sure would instantly remove it and she therefore
resolved to take the first opportunity coming
to an explanation with him and undeceiving
him as to her fancied predilection for another
 destiny
chapter v
but it seemed as if reginald avoided all opportunities
 being alone with her when he
retiuned from his ride he withdrew to his own
apartment on the plea having letters to write 
and when he appeared at dinner his air was still
more melancholy and abstracted than it had yet
been two or three chance visitors who had
arrived rendered the conversation rather more
general and by their county news diverted
glenroy's attention from being quite so exclusively
directed to his nephew though every subject
that was started still bore some reference
to him to the dhu moss the planting skirri
dale hill the thinning the glenhaussen woods
the highland society the black mare norman
and lord allonby
stint s
edith flattered herself when she left the diningroom
that reginald would boon follow her she
knew he disliked sitting long at table and the
party was not one to be upon any ceremony with 
her father had a habit remaining long after
dinner and as he became drowsy and confused it
would be an easy matter for reginald to make
his escape from him but she waited in vain 
reginald came not but soon she caught a
glimpse him from the window as he dolly
crossed the lawn and disappeared in the woods
that skirted it on one side edith could not
restrain her tears at this new proof reginald's
estrangement from her oh cruel that he is 
thought she thus to torture himself and me 
could he act thus if he loved pie as i love him 
no no surely he would seek an explanation
and this mystery and yet it is i who maybe
unjust this snored mystery may be nothing
more than grief and selfreproach and he is
unwilling to give me pain by communicating his
feelings ah did he but know how sweet it
would be to me to share in his every sorrow he
would not thus withhold them from me 
 pestiny
thus did edith mournfully commune with
herself till the evening was far advanced when
she was roused by the sound an arrival and
in a few minutes mrs macauley's jocund tones
saluted her ear and presently she entered all
bustle calling so he's come where is he 
let me see him then suddenly stopping but
bless my heart my dear she exclaimed as she
surveyed edith with a look surprise what
is the matter with you is not your papa welland
your true love come home and what make
you look as if you had been crying then 
oh macky how can you ask said edith
mournfully considering 
 well my dear i know what you mean and
it's very true and i consider every thing and
you know very well yourself what a sore heart
it gave me when it happened but you have sense
to know my dear there's a time for every thing
and this is not the time for you to be crying for
them that's gone when you ought rather to be
rejoicing at them that's come back deed i
think so p
i am sure your return will rejoice us all
destiny 
macky said edith affectionately papa has
missed you rery much
 deed and i thought he would do that for
he has always been so kind to me and i thought
sometimes when i was away oh thinks i to
myself i wonder what glenroy will do for somebody
to be angry with for benbowie's grown
so deaf poor creature it's not worth his while to
be angry at him and you're so gentle that it
would not do for him to be angry with you but
i'm sure he has a good right to be angry at me
considering how kind he has always been to me
tien uttering an exclamation joy as sir reginald
entered the room she flew towards him
and precipitated herself round his neck uttering
expressions joy and delight which were returned
on his part with all the hearty warmth and
ardour his more refined welcome
 and now said she releasing him from her
embrace and holding him at arm's length let
me look at you swell i declare you are ten
times handsomer than ever you were and you
hold yourself up so well you might pass for a
 destiny
prince and i would know that smile yours
among a thousand o i hope my eyes will
serve me to take your picture some day deed
i qsomot help looking at you for yon are like
and yet you are not like what you was you have
mot just the bonny bloom on your cheek that you
had when you went away what do you think
miss edith dear 
 now what for should you wish for any thing
 destiny
belonging to me said mrs macauley nth
a strong mark interrogation from which there
was no escape
don't be afraid said reginald evading the
question i would not rob you it even if i
would it sits so well upon you you make such
a good use it
now as sure as any thing you are flattering
me sir reginald but i want to know what use
you could have for what you please to call my
philosophy though deed to tell the truth i
do not know very well what philosophy is but
if you mean my contentment i'm sure you connot
want that when you have every thing to
make you so contented and happy you yourself
so handsome and with such a grand fortune
and a beautiful place and an old family and a
title and your own true love there that 
 true exclaimed reginald abruptly
what a charming evening this ishave you
not been out edith 
no replied she in a tone forced composure
 but i should like to take a stroll now
destiny 
then i hope you will allow me to attend
you said reginald colouring and evidently
embarrassed
 certainly said edith in the same tone
and rising to prepare for her walk
 but my dears have you had tea and coffee 
cried mrs macauley
i beg your pardon said edith i had
forgot and she rang the bell
 i own myself too much a frenchman to
dispense with my coffee said sir reginald
seemingly relieved by the delay while edith left
the room for her shawl
 i really think that sweet creature's looking
very ill said mrs macauley ip a low voice to
sir reginald after dismissing boyd and his
satellite i thought the sight you would
have brought back the roses to her cheeks and the
smiles to her pretty mouth but i think she looks
almost as pale and mournful as she did before you
came and that's very extraordinary is it not
 she certainly is much banged said sir
reginald th a sigh 
 destiny
aye well but for all that i'll wager you
have not seen the like her among all the fine
french and foreign ladies you have seen tell
me truly have you 
edith certainly was very pretty replied
sir reginald in a tone that betrayed emotion
well my dear but don't you be frightened
for all that and she'll soon be as pretty as ever
she was for she has a very good constitution
although maybe she does not look so stout as
some your great big fat people and you
know it is natural for her to be looking not so
well considering what distress she has suffered 
and then you know she was so anxious about
you and so wearying for you to come home 
in spite lord allonby said sir reginald
with a forced laugh
 o so you have heard about that already 
but it would not be from miss edith herself for
she does not like the way glenroy speaks about
that at all
sir reginald remained silent for a few moments
as if struggling with his emotion then
destiny 
sipping his coffee he said with affected carelessness
 ladies seldom dislike having their conquests
known and my cousin has no cause to be
ashamed hers
 deed i think not for lord allonby is a
very fine handsome man though he has no clan 
he has a very good fortune too they tell me
though it is but in the low country which makes
glenroy look down upon him so much many a
one would not be so particular in these things ashe
is not that it was for that he refused him for
miss malcolm but you know she was as good as
married to you

deep emotion it woidd be difficult to laugh

wish to deceive you 
 i am sure you have not said edith with
tenderness tone and manner but dear
reginald are you not deceiving yourself and
she blushed to crimson as though she thought
she had said too much
reginald made no reply but shaded his ace
with the drawing he still held in his hand after
a pause raising his head he said in a voice that
vainly struggled at composure i will not
attempt to misunderstand you edith you
would tell me that you he stopped as
if suffocating with emotion

would tell you how much you have wronged
yourself and me if you ever supposed i for an
instant coidd forget ah reginald do you think
i should have continued to wear this ring if i had
ceased to love you she would have added
but the words died on her lips and she bent her
 destiny
head to hide the blush which glowed even to
her brow
reginald took the hand she had half extended
to him and pressed it in silence to his lips but
some minutes elapsed ere he spoke then in a
deep and faltering voice he said i believe
you edith my doubts are now ended say
when will you become mine 
edith started for the accents in which this
fond interrogatory was put were any thing but
those hope and joy she looked on her lover
and his face even his lips were pale and his
features were contracted as if in agony
what is this exclaimed she wildly you
are ill reginald oh tell me why do i see you
thus r
i am ill edith said he faintly attempting
to smile but do not be alarmed it is a mere
spasm to which i am occasionally liable but it
is past for the present let us think no more 
it and assuming an air gaiety he sought
to quiet edith's fears and remove her suspicions
if she had any as to the nature his emotion
edith was course strenuous for medical
destiny 
vice but reginald assured her it was merely
the effects the malaria he had had when at
rome and consequently a disorder not understood
by the physicians this country but
time and your good management will perhaps
enable me to get the better it he added with
difficulty suppressing a sigh if you are not
afraid to undertake the cure
 you had the malaria then and concealed
it from me said edith reproachfully ah
reginald if you had known what your silence
cost me but it was your tenderness for me made
you conceal it from me and you were ill while
i was unjustly blaming you perhaps 
no no cried reginald in agitation i
ought but oh edith had i flown to you at
the first it might not then have been too late 
i should not have been the wretch i am 
dear reginald do not reproach yourself so 
bitterly you could not foresee how fatally our
dear norman's illness was to terminate
fatally indeed reechoed reginald as he
leant his head on the table and buried his face
in his hands
 destiny
 had you been here you could have done
nothing for my poor brother said edith he
would not even have known you and you see
you are not too late to be a comfort to us
reginald looked up and spoke more calmly
as he said you were always gentle and forgiving
edith but you know not the depth 
my selfreproach he added with renewed agitations
 edith you see me broken in spirits
oppressed with remorse the victim a hostess
malady gasped he striking his bosom yet
if i can but make you happy i can bear it all 
edith a brighter happier destiny might be
yours but if you will unite yourself with me 
let it be quickly let there be no idle delay 
there has been too much already
a painful surmise now darted into edith's
mind she had heard the baleful effects the
pestilential fever at rome in even affecting the
mind the sufferer long after the cause had
apparently ceased and trembling at the dread
suspicion she knew not how to reply
speak edith he cried impatiently do
you repent 
 destiny 
edith cast her streaming eyes upon him with
a look tenderness and affection while she
slowly and distinctly uttered never 
 enough cried reginald as he pressed
his quivering lip to her hand then after a short
pause he said with calmness and now edith
i again entreat that there may be no trifling
delays on your part on mine every thing shall
be done to accelerate matters for that purpose
i must now leave you for a time i must go to
dunshiera there must be much for me to do
there and the more that i have now to prepare
it for its sature mistress his voice now fel
tered a little and he stopped but soon went on
 i have too long neglected it but i must now
live there for a part the year if i can i am
aware the opposition this will meet with from
glenroy but much as i owe him and desirous
as i am by every means in my power to discharge
my debt gratitude still i cannot devote
myself wholly to him
 it would be too much to expect said
edith with a sigh and yet my poor ther 
how shall i leave him in his present state 
 destiny
mind and still worse how will he bear your
absence you who are now every thing to
him
yes cried reginald again relapsing into
agitation my father's mistaken tenderness forme
has placed me in a cruel situation i have
incurred a load gratitude to glenroy which
crushes me to the earth his house hitherto has
been my home but edith i cannot i will
not continue to drag out a useless existence
here
glenroy's voice was at that moment heard loudly
calling reginald and presently he came
slowly shuffling into the room talking to himself
as he was wont to do at sight reginald and
edith he exclaimed what's the meaning 
this edith you taking up your cousin's time
this way i have been wanting you reginald
about something more importance than anything
she can have to say to you here's a letter
from m'gillivray that's he that has the farm
 invercardnish the sheepfern you know
that mcintosh had and made such a hand 
and 
destiny 
i beg your pardon glenroy interrupted
reginald hurriedly but i can scarcely attend
to that business at present i i find i must
go to dunshiera
go to dunshiera repeated glenroy in
astonishment what would take you to dunsheba
in such a hurry 
 i ought to have been there long ere now
glenroy said reginald i know i am much
wanted and more especially now he added
with a forced gaiety that edith has just consented
to be mine as soon as the arrangements
can be made for her reception there
consented to be a fiddlestick cried glenroy
angrily is that you edith that's putting
such nonsense in your cousin's head but edith
had made her escape as her father entered to be
spared the scene she feared would ensue arrangements
for her reception what reception
and what arrangements can she want haven't
you this house to live in and as much room as
would hold a dozen you and are not you just
as much master here as i am reginald and
what would take you to a house your own
 destiny
then consent reception arrangement 
what the plague there's no hurry in your
marrying reginald you must wait till we get
the woods thinned at all events and and
whatever you want from your own house you can
send for it here and bring your servants and
your horses and all here and and but you
must not leave me reginald grasping his
nephew's hand in his
 only for a few days said reginald
only for a few days repeated glenroy 
and what am i to do without you for a single
day fll tell you what reginald if you'll wait
till this confounded gout's out my toe fll go
with you myself if you must go and we can
tfdte edith and molly macauley with us if you
lee and i'll stay with you as long as you please 
i will upon my honour
reginald certainly showed no symptoms 
delight at this proposal though he strove to utter
some general expressions about happiness gratitude
pleasure and so forth
 but my house and establishment cannot be
in order to receive guests only consider my
it
it
destiny 
dear uncle that i have scarcely been there for
more than a day at a time since i left it a mere
child
and whafs to have put it out order then
when there's been nobody living in it come
now reginald don't be obstinate stay where
you are and do exactly as you like you are completely
your own master here reginald as muck
as if you were in your own house but i can't
part with you now that my own poor lad's gone
so stay where you are and you shall have everything
you can desire you shall have his black
mare reginald that that lord what do you
call him had the impudence to think i would
sell to him
reginald saw it was in vain to attempt to use
argument with glenroy he therefore conceded
so far as to give up his intention setting off
the following morning and even allowed him to
remain in the belief that he never should leave
him for a single day course the poor chief
became ten times more tiresome and exacting
than ever under this accession gratified affection
 and though reginald submitted with the
 destiny
v best grace he could it was obvious lie was writhing
under the weariness and torment being
the engrossing object a blind despotic doating
attachment although politely attentive to
edith in as far as he was permitted to attend to
any thing but glenroy and his neverfailing
themes nothing particular occurred to call forth
any marked demonstrations the nature his
feelings towards her edith sometimes thought
he looked sadder tian any thing she had ever
seen but that she imputed to the poignancy 
his feelings regarding norman though she
loved him the more for this proof his sensibility
she trusted that time and her tenderness
together vould gradually diminish his sorrow
and selfreproach

chapter vil
do you remember your courting days benbowie
 said mrs maeauley one day to the
worthy laird as he sat with a see solemn
stupidity chewing his quid
surely surely cried benbowie starting at
the question as some faint reminiscences a
rejected suit wandered through his brain
because i don't know how it is benbowie 
maybe the fashion's changed in that too like
every thing else and that it's not genteel for
people to look as happy as they used to do but
as sure as death if i was miss edith i would
not be pleased to see my sweetheart look so dull
as he does sometimes she has not the canty face
my good mr maeauley had when we were going
to be married the laugh and the joke were never
out his mouth and i daresay you yourself
 destiny
benbowie was merrier when you were thinking
 matrimony than you are now 
true true it's a serious matter it is upon
my conscience
o now benbowie that's not what i mean
atau
benbowie's eyes grew rounder but he made
no attempt to come to an understanding
what is there serious continued mrs macauley
 in two handsome rich accomplished
sensible wellborn wellprincipled young creatures
going to be married i declare i think
they ought both to be ready to jump out their
skins for joy
on my conscience it's very true so they
hight responded benbowie and it will cost
nothing her money will not go out the
family
o who cares for the money benbowie 
that's not the thing at all it's true love i was
thinking and that's a far better thing i'm
sure my mr macauley and i were as poor as two
church mice when we were married and for all
that we were as merry as two fireside crickets
destiny 
oh how i wish i saw sir reginald look upon
his own true love with that heartsome smile that
he had before he left her 
 he's a fine young mans said benbowie 
he is she is she is a very fine young man
mrs macauley and he has a very fine property 
on my conscience he has
well well benbowie but i don't think
you understand me i would rather see his
smiles than his gold just now raising her voice
as though the obtuseness lay in the physical not
the intellectual part her auditor but benbowie
only looked still more bewildered
oh benbowie i wish i could make you
understand what it is i mean and then i could
know whether it is my own fancy or whether
it is the real truth that for you know it would
not do for me to give a whish that either to
glenroy or miss edith for fear distressing
them and there is nobody else i would like to
say it to but i would give all i have to be quite
sure that sir reginald is as happy as he ought
to be 
vol ii d
 dbsitiinr
 ribs own estate is now quite free said benbote
trying to look wise and he is next heir
 entail to glenroy
 o the stupid body p thought mrs macauley
how shall i ever get him to understand the difference
between lore and land but maybe
after all i am just putting nonsense in ins head
and that it is just as miss edith thinkshtoiow
for him thaf s gone thaf makes her own tfcte love
look so mournful sometimes how do i know
what is in his heart and then when he ladies
miss edith looking at him how he brightens
up and smiles and jokes in his own way as he
used to do but then again i do not like to
hear young people sigh it is not natural whatever
they may say lovers sighing for i know
my good mr macauley sighed none for as happy
as we were 
such were the pros and eons with which mrs
macauley strove to solve the mystery sir
reginald's dejection but the result all her
speculations only amounted to this that sir reginald
and mr macauley had been quite differs

destiny 
went lovers but it was not mrs macauley's nature
to stop there having made nothing benbowie
she next began to wonder whether 
observed any thing one day that she
found herself alone with him she began to sound
her way seating herself beside her chief ashe
sat in his easychair she wiped her spectacles
put them carefully on her nose and began
to ply her needle while she said well glenroy
are not we all very happy at having got sir
reginald back again 
 what earthly difference can his coming or
going make to you molly macauley yoiire
not going to be married to him was the peevish
reply
 deed i amnot but surely glenroy i maybe
very happy though i am not going to be married

 i know no business you have to think anything
about happiness if you had my gout in
you you would not be so happy i can tell you
deed and i believe that's true glenroy 
but though i am very sorry that you have it
 resting
yet ought i not to be thankful too that i hare it
not
 well dhi't torment me with your thanks
and your this and your that where's reginald

 vm sure i cannot tell glenroy i hope he
may be taking a little walk with his own true love
and that it will do him good for as i was now
saying i do not think him quite just that's to
say i think but maybe i'm wrong that he's
a little doff just now
 doff what doyoumean by doff wish
if you will chatter you would learn to speak
intelligibly what do you mean by doff 
just dull glenroy as if he was not 
 was not what demanded the chief still
more angrily
was not deed i don't know how to express
myself to please you glenroy but i think he
is not just so just in such good spirits as i have
seen him
 good spirits repeated glenroy bursting
forth in all his majesty good spirits pon
my soul you're the most unfeeling hegh good
destiny 
spirits too and yon mrs macauley that pretend
to but i never knew one you women that
were better than another there's not one 
you knows what feeling is you think nothing
but your own idle amusements where's that
girl gadding to now and keeping reginald
from megood spirits good spirits in this
house after what i've lost if you must have good
spirits mrs macauley you must go somewhere
else for them for there's to be no good spirits
here good spirits i really believe you molly
maeaidey have just as much feeling as one 
your own needles stamping his stick upon the
floor
well well glenroy do not be so angry
for you know very well how bad my own spirits
were at the proper time and but you know
there is a time for every thing glenroy now
that it is past i want every body to be happy
looking to miss edith's marriages
f
one whose thoughts are afar off he either did
not observe or took o notice pf her entrance 
but stepping upto him she accosted him so
sir reginald you are here all by yourself when
i figged you gallantry your own true love
 k you are in search edith you will fitted
her i believe in the drawingroom with some
visitors said sir reginald coldly and without
looking up
mrs macauley stood irresolute for a few seconds
then looking him full in the fieee she
destiny 
bait in a strong tone interrogation oh
my dear i hope you are not angry t
i not angry replied sir reginald forcing
 smile only a little bored
 o well if that be all that's nothing to signify
 maybe you'll be so good as tell me what
it is that bores you for i hope it is not me
with the same interrogatory accent
sir reginald made no reply but by a slight
gesture impatience well i cannot think
what i could say that did not please you my
dear i only said i thought you would have
been taken up with your own true love and i'm
sure that could not anger you
 surely mrs macauley said reginald
speaking very quickly and impatiently you
bave lived long enough to know what every
child knows that the best things become stale
and tiresome by constant repetition
 my dear exclaimed mrs macauley in
an accent which testified she did not in the least
comprehend the drift this observation
 you and every body else i believe said sb
reginald in the same impatient manner f are
 destiny
aware the engagement between edidi and
me the delay in fulfilling it is now on her
part added he with increased agitation in
the meantime it is unpleasant to me and mns
be painful to her to have it made the perpetual
theme conversation and for ever alluded to
in the broadest manner not only before strangers
but before the very grooms and footmen
 and so thaf s the story is it exclaimed
mrs macauley in astonishment well how
could i ever have geteed that when my good
mr macauley liked so well to be joked about
his marriage and to have every body coming
and rubbing shoulders with him but i'm glad
to think that when you was looking so dull it
was only because you was not pleas and now
that i know what it is that angers you i will
never let on any thing about miss edith and
you and maybe if s genteeler no t here
a furious peal from glenrojr's bell recalled mrs
macauley to a sense her duty oh and i
forgot there's glenroy sitting in his dressingroom
waiting for you all this time and here's
that worthy man mr mdow coming as the
desnky 
door opened and the head mr mdow protruded
itself quickly followed by his whole person
sir reginald scarcely able to conceal how
much he was annoyed was hastily passing him
with a slight bow and a sort murmured apology
but he might as easily have attempted to
escape from the arms a mantrap after having
touched the vital spring
 how do you do sir reginald with a violent
shake the hand i rejoice to see you
back again better late than never hoch ho 
but i can't say you've brout any italian beef
upon you i doubt you've been rather ailing
but i've no doubt the air the highlands and
the sight a certain four lady will set you all to
rights again sir reginald vat his lip and
made no reply mr m'dow went on i'm
afraid you must think i've been rather deficient
in my duty in not having waited upon you
before now but the fact is i've suffered a great
deal from the toothache this summer and at last
i was obliged to get my tooth taken out a
most dreadful thing it is the pulling a tooth
and mine was an uncommon strong one pon
d

iaf'worif i tbdtqiit at first my hewitt vrt bft

kidtouth a little say mr bain and allowed
jtet to put in my finger to feel your tooth 
 na na says the justice i'll no do stat
a'll bite me hach hach hach ho ev
sr reginald's features relaxed for a moment
lirto a smile at the overwhelming vulgar jocularity
 mr mdow while he made another
attempt to extricate himself from his grasp but
in vain
 excuse my detaining you for one moment
destiny qfi
sir reginald said he grasping him still more
firmly but i think it proper to let you know
that i shall have occasion to be absent again very
shortly for a few days if s upon a most agrees
able occasion to be sure no less thanamarriage
t's to take place in our family my ni
miss alex mfee that's the eldest daughter
 my sister mrs dr mfee sis ou the point
 marriage with a very fine young man just eft
up in business in london mr andrew pollock 
it's been a long attachment like some others that
know sir reginald hach hach ho i but the
means were wanting however now they think
they'll be able to do and so the marriage is fixed
to take place this day se'ennight and nothing will
satisfy them but that must perform the ceremhiy
but then on the other hand i consider my old
engagement to you as paramount to every thing
else the same nature so i wish to ascertain
that the one may not interfere with the other
for that would really place me in a most awkward
dilemma
reginald's face had gradually been crimoniiig
during mr mdows speeds and with mighty
 destiny
bend the head lie merely said i beg sir i
may not stand in the way any your engagements
then quickly extricating himself from
him he left the room
 aye ezdaimed mr mdow in a tone 
amazement i don't know very well what to
make that i suspect the baronet's not oyer
and above well pleased at my not having waited
upon him sooner i'm sure i'm at a loss how to
act for it will be a dreadful disappointment to
ley poor thing if i should fail her and yet
i would be ve loath to disoblige sir reginald
and my excellent patron glenroy to say nothing
 the disappointment to myself
oh mr jmdow said mrs macauley
 that's not the thing at all things are not just
come to that yet but whafs made sir reginald
not just so well pleased is that he does not like
to be joked about his marriage she says if s not
genteel
 oh thaf s it is it cried mr mdow in a
tone surprise aye aye i had no notion 
that giving any offence and yet i don't think
i said any thing that could be taken amiss for
destiny 
i'm sure the allusions that i made were the
most delicate nature but there's a fashion in
these things if s one that i don't think i'll ever
be tempted to follow though there's no saying
for as my worthy mother says there's nothing
so catching as fashion and as i live much in
fashionable society now perhaps i may just grow
neeborlike and become a fashionable myself 
hach hach ho 
oke quite wrong it's
mere fashionable apathy nothing else i've
always kept free from it myself for i can't say
i admire it but it's creeping in there are some
young ladies in this country that i could mention
 destiny
that i've known give themselves great ahrg 
apathy
by the by mr mdow have you seen the
young lady dross pretty miss lucy malcolm
since her marriage said mrs macauley quite
unaware mr mdow's susceptibility on that
score
o yes returned he with an air contemptuous
indifference she has got well married
which was more than i thought she would
for she was very high set and rather gave herself
airs above herself at one time but as become
to spend the day with my worthy friend
glenroy and it's getting near dinnertime i suspect
i must be going to clean myself a little
before dinner and away he stalked to the
chamber which from frequent occupation had
now become in a manner his own property
glenroy's gout confined him to his own apartment
for the rest the day but sir reginald
took his place and did the honours with so much
grace and spirit and exerted himself so effectually
that it must have been a more accurate
destiny 
observer than any that were present who cous
have discerned the force he was putting upon
himself
 destiny
chapter viiione
 the many acts penance the chief
thought fit to impose upon his family was that
 reang the newspapers to them every coming
during a long protracted breakfast
and labour dire it was and weary woe
for quick ears to keep pace with his tedious utterance
and intermingled comments although he
rarely condescended to read the fashionable intelligence
so called one morning he chanced to
stumble on the following paragraph we
have to congratulate the noble youth britain
on the arrival the beautiful and fascinating
baroness waldegrave at her mansion st james's
square after an absence several years on the
continent her ladyship is accompanied by her
mother the lady elizabeth malcolm here
destiny 
glenroy made a full stop as if he had come suddenly
upon some unlookedfor and unwelcome
object then muttered ay thais my pretty
lady and that other that's the whatdoyoucall
her the bit whiteiced lassie that she had herewith
her the creature you never could bear
reginald reginald's head was at that moment
resting on his hand which shaded his ce but
he had the air being too deeply engaged by a
letter which lay open before him to hear himself
titus called upon at least he made no answer
you mean florinda papa said edith 
 o how i should like to see her again 
 i never desire to see the ce her cried
glenroy an upsetting spoilt brat what was
it you used to call her reginald the skimmilk
cheese wasn't it
but reginald still looked upon his letter and
was silent
 is that a cess letter that you've got reginald
 i've got one too and so has benbowie 
if s from mcintosh is it not 
i i beg your pardon said reginald
loddng up and speaking very fast yes i sups
destiny
pose i believe i think yes i mean mcintosh
is the name
cc aye i thought so it will just be the same as
my own and i'm not at all satisfied as to the collecting
 the cess i think there's grelut mismanagement
 and i
cc o you have not read the whole paragraph
papa cried edith glancing at the paper whisk
glenroy had laid down it adds the yiffmg
baroness is said to be the venus apellesrefaltr
zed and combines with the beauty and dueacy
 tiie english air the softness and grace loll
italian with the gaiety and brilliancy the
french we may therefore anticipate the eht
which will attend so rare and perfect a comlnil
litte
destiny 
but reginald was too much engrossed with
his subject to hear the question edith took
iidtbntage the first pause to say how came
you never to mention her to us reginald
 mention an old tobacco pipe i cried glenrey
angrily what was there to mention 
ducis reginald had more sense than to trouble
his head about such an insignificant creature
jllil thata spoilt troublesome monkeys that there
was no living in a house with
 o but glenroy you must not speak that
way her now that you hear she has turned out
so wells said mrs macauley always charitable
in her judgements and credulous in her belief
 and i daresay sir reginald will give her a very
good character now i'll wager any thing they
would make it all up am i not right sir regis

 lady waldegrave was much admired said
reginald in a cold constrained manner
 what a cautious answer and how unlike
you reginald said edith with a smile but
donuexpect to get off so easily i must have a
holland particular description her fnrinile
 destiny
 i always loved florinda i scarcely
tliiiik she met with justice from you
 perhaps not replied sir reginald in the
same abrupt laconic manner
 well then you will make it up now by
giving us a ithfulepresentation her or as
dear macky says by giving a good character 
her
 what the plague does it signify whether
her character's good or bad cried glenroy in
mie lus transports the character the man
that's to be collector our cess is more consequence
i think than the character an idle
dancing county like that a creature that your
brother here sir reginald comeback pony
soul this is insuperable you women with your
chatter you've driven him away from the table 
i really wish you would learn to hold your
tongues when you see we're engaged in business
 reginald aye there he's off and he's
away out without his hat you women really
are shem 
and glenroy was obliged to break off for
want words to express his indignation
destiny 
 well then as sure as death glenroy responded
mrs macauley i think we behave
ourselves very well and speak very little considering
i'm sure i could speak a great deal
more than i do if it was not for fear angering
you and i'm sure miss edith speaks less than
any body but wasn't it natural for her to be
rather inquisitive about the little creature she
used to be so fond deed i think it was
for how was she to think that sir reginald and
she had not made it up the spiteful thing that
she must be for i know it would note hisfiuilt
he is so goodnatured and generous and forgiving
to his enemies
but benbowie having found some knotty point
in his cess letter was now applying to'his chief
to solve it for him and thus glenroy's wrath
was for the moment appeased and his attention
excited and the abuses the cess seemed to
aebrd them what is called subjectmatter for
some hours to come when reginald joined
edith in the drawingroom he looked ill and
dejected and in answer to her timid and gentle
enquiries he admitted that he bad had a slight
 destiny
spasmodic attack during breakfast but that it
was nearly over for the present
 i flattered myself said he they had left
me as i have been less subject to them late 
but one is commonly the prelude to others now
don't be alarmed he added with a faint smile
 although you see me what you ladies would
call somewhat nervous occasionally in time i
trust i shall get the better it and he sighed
as he said it
 i fear your feelings are too acute for your
peace reginald said edith mournfully as
she gently laid her hand on his arm reginald
looked on that hand for a moment with a strange
contraction brow and something like a recoil 
then suddenly changing he took it in his and
said in a voice that tered with emotion 
 when once this hand is fairly mine i shall
be better much calmer i am sure i shall
you know it will ere long be yours ssdd
edith and her colour deepened while she added
with simple earnestness and in the meantime
you cannot doubt that my best affections that
my heart itself is wholly solely yours
destiny 
 o that i were worthy it edith said hein
a melancholy accent and yet he added
with notion if you could but read mine
you would there see that its first desire is for
your happiness
 yes i am sure i feel it is said edith 
 but the way to make me happy is to be happy
yourself
 well then let us now settle something
edith said he rapidly i shall go to dimsheba
soon but since it is your desire i shall
make no alteration upon it the credit the
improvements shall be yours glenroy expects
his lawyers in a few days who will arrange all
matters business and then and then edith
added he with a strong gasp you will surely

chapter ix
although glenroy's gout was mach on the
deduce it still confined him to his couch for the
greater part the day during which either his beu
or his voice was to be heard resounding indicative
 the restlessness and impatience its master
the following morning as the fieonily sat at
breakfast a peal was heard from the bell which
surpassed all the peals that had yet been rung
followed by another and another in such quid
succession that only a flash lightning could
possibly have had time to answer the summons
 i think i hear glenroy's bell said benbowie
holding up his ear and looking wise
 deed benbowie we may all hear that at
the deafest side our heads said mrs macauley
 as sure as death he'll ring down the
house
destiny 
 something more than common has surely
disturbed him said edith rising when at that
moment the chiefs valet entered to say that
glenroy wished to see sir reginald immediately
 something about a new lease or an old
bridge or some such parish matter said reginald
carelessly and he rose and was sauntering
out the room humming an air to himself
 then looking back as he saw benbowie
groping in the direction his plate he called
may i beg edith that you will not allow
benbowie to mistake my cup for his own 
edith sat patiently i waiting reginald's return
for a considerable time but still he came not
and all was silent
 oh this is really not fair in glenroy to
keep sir reginald from his breakfast said
mrs macauley
 is sir reginald not coming back to his
tea enquired benbowie with a face solicitude
for it was one his peculiarities to casta
sheep's eye at other people's viands even
when surrounded by a profusion untouched
vol uk e
 destiny
dainties so baulked in his deanike betook
himself and his newspapers t his own content
mrs macauley was too tnisy and active to
indulge long over the pleasures the table and
she likewise trotted away weary wondering
what was keeping sir reginald
at length reginald returned but his features
still bore the marks recent agitation and
although he had a perfect composure manner
either real or affected yet his hand trembled ashe
raised the cup to his lips
 i have had another those foolish spasoos
said he occasioned i think by the heat 
gienroys room though he would fain persuade
me it is flying gout and we have consequently
had a long and interesting discussion on gout
and malaria he tells me my father had it in
his constitution which i never knew but i
beg pardon edith you are waiting for me o
by the by glenroy has had a letter from
from lady elizabeth a letter offering to pay
him ar visit here which has course digitated
ind annoyed him
 an offer a visit from lady elizabeth 
destiny 
exclaimed edith that is indeed very strange
after so long a reparation don't yoa think so 
 rather replied reginald
 how does papa take it 
 i can scarcely tell he seems both for and
against it he is you may believe very 
to receive the visit and yet still more
unwilling to define it he begged me to mention
it to you and talk it over
 what can have prompted such an offer at
this time said edith still rapt in amazement
reginald was silent
 does she assign no reason for so strange a
proceeding enquired edith reginald hesitated
for a moment then with a deepening
colour replied sympathy is the motive assigned
shewiies to condole personally with
your father and you in your affliction and be
sighed deeply
 ah how very kind said edith much
more so than i should have expected rfirovnilady
elizabeth either fire my own becoueotionqf
her or from any thing i have ever heard o jir
perhaps lie is nujehchangean iflt is sop
loo destiny
papa and she may yet live happily together
and then you know she added with a rising
colour he could better spare you when 
o impossible they are so totally different
and lady elizabeth is such an invalid so coninstantly
complaining their habits are so dissimilar
 so in short their ever living together
is out the question she only proposes remaining
for a week or two
 at least there can be no harm in trying the
experiment for a week or two that will soon
pass away whether pleasantly or not but does
she say nothing florinda won't she come
too
 i suppose i believe course here
fido to his dog as he placed a saucer on the
floor with some milk and water and bent down
as if deeply interested in the common action
 fido's lapping his breakfast
 oh how delighted i am exclaimed eklith
her eyes sparkling with animation i cannot
tell you reginald how much i have longed to
see her again my recollection her is so vivid 
i am sure i sbsjl love her she was such an
iffitiky 
eiiing creature and you remember how often
i used to make up your little quarrels together 
i am resolved to make you both good friends forevermore

reginald made no immediate reply for he was
still occupied with his dog at length he said
in a cold constrained manner but without raising
his head excuse me edith but we
view this matter quite differently i have already
advised glenroy to decline the visit
 ah reginald how could you be so unkind
 exclaimed edith in a tone reproach
 because i thought it my duty he replied
almost sternly
 but you may have mistaken it dear reginald
said edith gently reginald was silent
and will papa then not receive them enquired
she with a sigh
 i cannot tell he was much perplexed and
asked my advice which i gave him although it
was not pleasant for me to be the umpire in such
a matter
 tell me reginald is it your dislike to

destiny
florida thitt makes you so averse to feteiirki
the visit 
sir reginald did hot immediately reply when
he did he said very coldly i never said 
disliked her
 no but i suspect you do said eds
looking at him with a soft smile and i long
to reconcile you
 you had better not try said reginald
sternly then added in a voice repressed emotion
 this visit can be productive no pleasure
 they are so different they are both so
unlimited to this place
but for a short time it matters little said
edith
even for a short time i am sure the visit
will annoy yctur father they will bring such a
suite along with them lady elizabeth has her
travelling physician and and there is a french
lady a friend 
but there is plenty romi and we are accustomed
to receive every body how unkind
then it would be to refuse such hear connexions 
destiny 
ii come dear reginald do persuade papa
to accept the visit
thali might be the test ofimy obedience but
aq its my we said he bitterly while he
ftpoke glenroy's bell had been sounding a larum
ibid npwlit servant entered in all haste to say
cnroy wished to know what was detaining
miss malcdm and to desire she would bring
the letter immediately
o by the by exclaimed sir reginald
in some confusion i had almost forgot glens
charged me to show you the letter and to
request you to answer itajod he drew
fciih a letter and laid it before edith she
took it from its envelope and at the first glance
exclaimed florinda waldegrave i thought
the leer had been from lady elizabeth
 tis much the same thing is it not said
reginald whether i write a letter or you
do it for me the letter is virtually lady
elizabeth's
 what a pretty elegant little hand she
writes exclaimed edith as stout farther
comment she began to read as follows 
 jjestily

my dear sir 
atinamma's request and in accordance with
my own feelings i beg leave to express lo yu
the deep sympathy we feel on the moanifiil
event which has taken place in your family the
early recollection your kindness to me and the
tender affection i always cherished for you and
my dear brother and sister for such i ever considered
diem remain indelibly impressed upon
my heart and i wish nothing more earnest
than to be allowed an opportunity proving to
you how sincerely i participate in your affliction
mamma is equally desirous convincing yon
that however circumstances may have unfortunately
separated her for so long a period from
you she has ever retained a lively interest in
your welfare and that all dearest to you
should it not therefore be deemed an intrusion
on your grief we shall have much pleasure in
being allowed to join your domestic circle and
pass a week or two with you quietly at glenroy
when it will be our most earnest study to
endeavour to mitigate your sorrow by every
isthnr 
means in our power mamma unites with min
every heartfelt wish for your health and returning
happiness and with kindest love to
my dear sister edith i have the honour to be
my dear sir
 your very sincere and obliged servant
and daughter
florida waldegrave
 pes mamma entreats you will not put yourself
to the slightest inconvenience on her account
for although somewhat delicate she is
not at all particular as to her accommodation 
and as for me you may put me in the turret
with which you used to threaten me when i was
a naughty troublesome little girl
 it is a very kind letter said edith with a
agh as she finished it and yet she
stopped
here another message from glenroy admitted
 no farther delay and edith was hastening to
satisfy his impatience when reginald stopped
 here
e 
 iissry
 dc not allow rthyaing i have said te prejudice
you against lady waldegrave said he
iii station i ought not to have given an
opinion i do not let me thbik i have injured
hier in your estimation edith
no no cried edith hastily as a perfect
volley bellringing caused her to fly
are you to be all day writing that letter
edith is it not done yet were the queries
that greeted her on her entrance
i beg your pardon papa but i have not
had time
not had time you've had time to write
least a dozen letters sites really intolerable 
what's the use you women learning to write
at all you should all keep to your needles and
thread like that idiot molly macauley and not
torment people with your trash letters this
way have you not written the one i desired
you yet 
 it is not five minutes papa since reginald
showed me the one you had received from lady
waldegrave
 that's not the letter i am speaking about 
destiny 
it's the one i desired you to write in answer to
that
 i understand you papa but i really have
not had time since
 i tell you the letter might have been halfway
to london by this time
 my dear papa you know the post does not
leave this till the evening
 that's nothing to the purpose your business
was to write the letter when i desired
you
i will write it directly papa if you will be
so good as tell me what i am to say
 how often am i to tell you what to say i
told you already or at least i told reginald
which is the same thing
 reginald said you did not seem inclined to
receive the visit
 how can i be inclined to receive a visit
lying in my bed here ifs a most senseless and
unfeeling proposal
 atiy what good will all ike sjndpatby
in the world do to me it will not bring back
him that i've lost
a pause some minutes ensued
you may be quite well before lady ehza
beth comes papa said edith bstiky im
 how can i tell yoa what i wish can't
you ask reginald and he'll tell you what i
wish
 reginald and i don't quite agree about it
papa
 reginald and you don't agree and do you
really pretend to disagree with the man you're
to be married to and before you're married to
him i i never heard such a tiling in my life
as people not agreeing before they were married
 not agree with the man that's to come after
me
 reginald and i are very good friends papa
and we shall be quite agreed when we know
your wishes on this subject but he is opinion
that it would be better to decline the visit and
i 
he's quite right much better what the
plague brings them here now after staying
away so long they'd better have staid altogether
the mother not particular there's
not a more troublesome particular woman in the
kingdom than she is 
 then i shall write and say the state your
 bestir
health presents you receiving their kindly meant
visit at this time or something to that purpose
papa said edith and she was leaving the
room

mrs macaulay's astonishment on being
made acquainted with this revolution or rather
restoration was excessive
 well glenroy cried die as she repair
to his sittingroom brimful the subject i's
sure we may well say wonders will never cease 
as sure as death i could hardly believe miss
edith when she told me to think your lady
coming back to you her own accord after
staying so long away from you all the wonderful
things fve met with and i have met with
a good many in my day this is the most extraordinary

i see nothing in the least extraordinary in
the matter said glenroy with dignified composure

o that must be because you are so wise
destiny 
glenroy for i have heard that very wise people
are never surprised at any thing which i think
very extraordinary considering what curious
creatures we are and what wonderful things we
meet with both by day and by night it was
but just the night before last i had such a curious
dream but i'm not going to tell it to you
glenroy as she saw a volley ready to burst
forth though i must always think it very
uncommon that i should have dreamed such a
dream at the very time your lady was coming
back to you tm sure i hope she will behave
herself now
behave herself repeated glenroy wrathfully
 i wish mrs macauley you would learn
to behave yourself and not give your tongue
such a license
well what did i say was wrong there
glenroy for deed i do not think she behaved
so discreetly as she might have done to you
but now that she has seen her fault to be sure we
should not speak about what's past and i daresay
she will make you a good and an obedient
and a wellbehaved wife in all times to come 
 destiny
for mice she somewhere i doiibt if she'll be for
gang away again deed i wondered at her
leaving yon when she dii
 and what right had you to wonder anything
about it mrs macaulay and wher was
the wonder her going to look after her daughter's
fortune at the time she did she acted tike
a sensible prudent woman and now that j
has secured that and got the girl properly educated
the first thing she does is to show her
respect for me by bringing her back to me but
i daresay one reasoiki et hec leaving this wm
that the child might not be corrupted by you
you would have been a fit person to have educated
a peeress to be sure you've made a fire
hand edith to be sure
o fie glenroy cried mrs macauley
kindling a tittle at these aspersions i wonder
to hear you deed i don't think it sets you
to speak in that disparaging way your own
daughter and her so sweet and pretty and genteel
and so much admired and i wonder you
should set up the other one considering what
a tittle spoilt impudent monkey she was and
destiny is
deed i don't beuereshe's much better yet for
you see sir reginald has never said a good
word her and i really think he cannot bear
the name her
 you're an old goose molly macauley and
don't know what you are speaking about i
asked reginald if he had any fault to find with
her and he said none in the world and he said
as much as that they had been upon a good
enough footing when they met and i know it
was only his fear their disturbing me that
made him unwilling to admit them here for he
thinks more me than any you i know that
and he's everything to me now so take you
care mrs macaxdey that you behave yourself
properly
 o glenroy as if ever i could behave myself
improperly to anybody especially to your
lady and your stepdaughter i'm sure i shall
put my best foot foremost to please them and
i just thinking what little marks ot my request
i can contrive for them that will be something
out the common after much deliberations
she at last decided upon what she deemed a meet

mid iprnriate offence for glenroys ladyvin
ike form a visiting cardscase with a view 
 the castle on one side and on the others
full length representation the chief in the
highland dress while lady waldegrave wad to
be made happy with a gown laboured in
coloured silks with what the artist called a rat
king pattern heather and thistles her own
contriving benbowie who had only one mode
 testifying emotions either grief or jogr
ordered a new waistcoat for half moumii whioi
even mrs macauley declared was ugly enough
 to isean a bairn
edith waited impatiently for reginald's return
but instead himself she received a note
by the gamekeeper who had attended him to
say that he had been prevailed upon to take a
night's quarters and spend a day or two with
his old friend dross at lochdhu and that ashe
was now so eu on his way to dunshiera he
would probably visit it before his return he
therefore desired his servant and horses might
join him the following morning and begged
edidi would write him a line to say how glen
ixestikt 
roy was c ah this was quite natural and
yet with felt a little mortified that reginald
should voluntarily absent himself from her even
for a few days it might be chiefly on her account
indeed as it was probably a mere excuse to gi
to dunshiera with a view to prepare it for her
reception and she was angry with herself for
the momentary chagrin she had given way to
she wrote him a few lines in reply and told him
what answer had been returned to lady wade
grave's letter by her father's desire then added
a hope that he would not be long absent and a
request that he would do nothing to dunshiera
on her account
there was course a violent storm from
glenroy when he heard his nephew's departs
ture but upon the whole he bore it better than
could have been expected the act was there
was always some one subject that reigned paramount
in his mind and fegaii to weary expected and
preparation not even steam itself would have
kept pace with his impatieiicehow much less
the tardy movements even the fleetest post
horses and the best paid postboys when they
depend upon the movements fine ladies ihe
did not indeed pretend to say that he anticipated
any pleasure from the arrival his guests
on the contrary he loudly declared that tkre
ought to be an act parliament to prevent
women from travelling and that he only wished
his visitors would come that they might go away
again
i really wish this visit was over he would
exclaim twenty times a day whycan'tttkey
come and have done with it do they think i'm
going to sit lip this wdy day after day wtiqg
for them haven't had time to edith wm
do you call time i know i have had time to
repent that ever i listened to such a manlike
proposal what his it they mean tof do tafier
they come here are they to take up with bowie
and molly macauley for i can tell them
destiny 
they're mueli mistaken if they think pm to gallant
them about they're coming to your marriage
are they but they'll surely have the
discretion to write before they come
edith assured him they would as she had
required lady waldegrave to let her know
when they might expect them
 and what's the reason reginald's not come
back what am i to do if he does not come intime
to receive them i really wish edith you
would write and ask what's keeping him and tell
him that he must come directly it's a pretty
situation i'm landed in with two strange women
coming that i know nothing about what do
i know about your lady waldegrave she's
nothing to me and and my own boy gone 
at length a sudden and alarming attack 
gout in the stomach put a stop to glenroy's
garrulous debating all was confusion and dismay
 expresses were sent off for medical assistmade
and edith wrote a hurried line to i
reginald informing him her father's situation
skua had heard from him from dunshiera whose
liesaid he had found so much to do that i
 destiny
time his return was uncertain but the intelligence
 his uncle's danger she was sure would
bring him instantly to glenroy and so it preyed
for he lost not a moment in answering the
summons but before either he or the doctor
arrived the disorder had taken a favourable turn
the gout had resumed its station in the feet
unis the danger was past for the time and glenroy
was himself again and every thing and everybody
resumed their former station and occupation
reginald alone seemed restless and uneasy
 abrupt in his answers and unequal in his
spirits but whenever he caught edith's eye he
instantly rallied recovered his selfpossession
and began to talk to her ef dunshiera all he
was doing and had to do for her comfort and
accommodation and would then urge the necessity
there was for returning there having numerous
workpeople waiting his orders but as the
mention pf such a purpose always threw glenroy
into an absolute paroxysm and made him
gout all over he at length agreed to remain
where he was until his uncle's health should
tye more firmly reestablished
destiny 
 you surely do not think receiving lady
elizabeth now said he to edith one day when
she was expressing her expectation a letter
from lady waldegrave
no i scarcely expect them now said she
 as i wrote to florinda when papa was taken
ill but if they had set out course she could
not have received my letter however i must
hear from her soon as she will at all events write
to apprize me the day their arrival if they
are really coming
 if they should come said reginald in a
tone affected composure i shall take advantage
 your having such good company to return
to dunshiera for a few days glenroy will probably
be quite well by that time and i am anxious
to forward the operations
surely reginald you will not think 
leaving us at such a time v said edith how
very unkind i may almost say rude it would
seem to lady elizabeth and florinda
that is a very secondary consideration
replied he seems signifies little to me in comparison
 should i ought to return to dunvol
ii r
 destiny
sheba at that time lie added endeavouring to
retain the same artificial tone nay more
edith why might not you accompany me
why he continued with more visible agitation
 may we not make out our marriage
quietly at least if not privately now before
these people come 
surely you are not serious reginald cried
edith in amazement
perfectly so returned he quickly
i can scarcely believe you said she what
can your motive be for so strange a proposal 
in the first place said he i feel that i
have been long enough exhibited as your lover
in the next we should avoid the intolerable
eclat which always attends on these things and
lastly he added with a sort mocking air
since your father is going to be reunited to
his lady love tis to be supposed he will be too
happy to be dependent upon other society and
consequently he could more easily spare us 
what have i said to offend you edith he
continued quickly as she remained silent and
the tears swelled in her eyes
destiny 
much said she with emotion and yet
i am sure you did not mean to hurt me reginald
she added tenderly
 if you are hurt the fault must be your own
not mine said reginald coldly
edith's tears fell but she made no reply
reginald proceeded in the manner one who
had worked himself up to be angry since
my return two months ago i have never ceased
importuning you to fulfil your engagement i
have repeatedly besought you to become mine
publicly or privately i cared not which but
there has always been some frivolous pretext or
another for delay yes even the colour your
gown has been made the excuse he cried with
rising vehemence as if such weak superstitious
fancies could have swayed you had you
really truly loved
unkind unjust that you are said edith
choked with her tears
no the unkindness the injustice is yours
cried he still more passionately heaven is
witness that i would have fulfilled our contract
long before now you must do me the justice
i
 destiny
to own that the moment i was assured your
affection for me was unchanged i would have
made you mine you need not blame me then
if your behaviour leads me at least to doubt the
reality that affection
edith was too much overcome to reply she
was accustomed to the querulous faultfinding
 her father and from that and other evils she
had been wont to find a refuge in the tenderness
 reginald but this burst displeasure was
too much for her and she wept in meek and
sent anguish while he paced the room with the
air one who would rather be still more exasperated
than mollified 
at that moment benbowie entered the room
and was making up to sir reginald with an
open letter and beginning something about commissioners
 supply when hastily brushing past
him with an air reckless hauteur he quitted
the apartment at the same time the dressing
bell sounded and edith retired to her chamber
to compose herself as she best could for meeting
her angry and unreasonable lover at dinner
destiny 
chapter xi
sir reginald did not make his appearance
in the drawingroom and it was not till the party
were all seated that he entered the diningroom
and then his looks and manner still betokened a
mind ill at ease he was silent and absent inattentive
to the company and almost rude to
poor mrs macauley when she attempted to coax
him into a better humour by her simple and somewhat
illtimed allusions
edith felt unequal to bear a part in the conversation
it was all she could do to retain the
tears that rose in her eyes as she now and then
encountered sir reginald's glance which if it
did not speak positive displeasure at least evinced
a sort impatient dissatisfaction the dessert
had been just placed on the table when boyd
entered with a ce importance and announced
 destiny
that two travelling carriages had just entered
the avenue and while he yet spoke the sound
 approaching horses and wheels confirmed the
fact in another second they swept round and
drew up
can this be lady elizabeth exclaimed
edith rising from the table in some agitation
while sir reginald shading his face with one
hand poured out several successive bumpers 
champagne and drank them off unnoticed in the
general confusion that prevailed
deed and it can be nobody else cried mrs
macauley who had hastened to the window
 there's the two ladies in a barouche and a
well loaded one too and a gentleman no he's
only a servant behind and there's two very
smartlooking ladies maids i'm thinking in the
other carriage and oh what a sight imperials
and trunks and boxes if s a mercy glenroy does
not see them but i declare i don't think if s
lady elizabeth after all or else she's grown
younger and handsomer than ever she was
sir reginald will you go and receive lady
elizabeth cried edith i then struck with the
destiny 
change in his countenance she exclaimed but
you are ill 
 no no nothing he cried starting up
his pale cheek and downcast eye suddenly flashing
and sparkling with false fire while the
sweetest and most melodious voices was now
heard in the hall as if speaking to her dog and
presently lady waldegrave was announced
edith flew to the door to receive her but she
started in surprise at the beauty the surpassing
beauty and brilliancy the figure that met her
view and gracefully opened her arms to receive
her embrace
for some moments edith's emotion rendered
her unconscious every thing but that her once
fondlyloved florinda was restored to her but
at the same time the remembrance her lost
brother mingled with the tide feeling and
rendered her unable to articulate the common
expressions welcome
 you are very kind dear edith said lady
waldegrave as she raised her head and shook
back the beautiful ringlets which shaded her
face i scarcely deserve to be so well receives
destiny
vet considering how i have broken in upon
your family party i am afraid i have disturbed
you
 o do not think apologies at such a
time said edith again tenderly embracing her
and gazing with looks fond admiration through
her tears dearest florinda how welcome
you are to glenroy 
 i assure you i cannot be more welcome
than i am delighted to return replied lady
waldegrave within earnestness manner which
left no doubt her sincerity
edith did not immediately answer for her
attention wai attracted to sir reginald who
was standing with his back to them talking and
laughing strangely loud with the other lady
when lady waldegrave called to her 
 madame latour allow me to present you to
miss malcolm then observing edith's look
 surprise she exclaimed ah did i forget
to mention madame latour to you she was
my governess and is now my friend she is a
very charming accomplished person and excels
in speaking broken english
destiny 
madame latour thus called upon saluted
edith with all the ease and grace her country
while sir reginald for the first time recognizing
lady waldegrave made a slight constrained
bow and then turned abruptly away edith was
shocked at the rudeness such a reception
lady waldegrave blushed and said in a low
voice but sufficiently loud for him to overhear 
 i scarcely expected to find sir reginald
malcolm at glenroy
such avowed marks hostility at the very
outset and from persons such high breeding
and refinement struck edith with surprise and
consternation she knew not what to reply and
in some confusion said i we expected to
see lady elizabeth and i hope nothing has
occurred

 o mamma will be here said lady landgrave
 but her carriage is heavier than mine
and i flatter myself added she with sweetness
 my impatience was also greater than even hers
to reach glenroy and its loved ones gently
pressing edith's hand as she spoke but i ab
really shocked at having deranged your little
f
 destiny
party as mrs macauley and benbowie re
fliaixied in all the awkwardness suspense not
lowing whether to sit or stand
 i daresay your ladyship will not remember
me said mrs macauley on coming forward
my dear mrs macauley said lady landgrave
affectionately embracing her how can
you suppose i ever could forget you indeed
 i never do forget those i love she said with
much earnestness and you used to be so
kind to me when i was a little naughty mischievous
creature 
deed then my lady and you was that
replied the simple macky but i'm sure one
need only look at you to see that you are not
that now 
lady waldegrave laughed and there was melody
even in her laugh aid benbowie i
hope i see you well extending the tip her
finger to him but where is glenroy looking
round as she missed him for the first time
edith explained that he was confined to his own
apartment with a fit the gout
how sorry i am said lady waldegrave
destiny 
in a tone beautifully modulated to pity then ina
moment changing it to one delight she
exclaimed come dear fido as sir reginald's
dog entered the room and flew to her
with demonstrations joy
how kindly fido welcomes me said she
as she fondled it he has not forgot me dear
fido she repeated as she continued to load it
with caresses unmindful the jealousy testified
by her own favourite
sir reginald made no reply but with a
heightened colour called the dog to himself and
striking it sternly bade it be quiet edith was
still more confounded by reginald's behaviour 
that he who was so uniformly polite and wellbred
should behave with rudeness to any woman
but more especially to one so lovely and fascinating
was quite incomprehensible his dog too
 which he had hitherto evinced a care and
tenderness that seemed almost ridiculous to lift
his hand against it for no other reason as it seemed
than because it had caressed lady landgrave
surely this was carrying antipathy to
its utmost bounds rousing herself from these
 destiny
reflections however she said i need scarcely
ask if you have dined i can only apologize for
the uncomfortable meal i fear you will iow
have
were i to answer you myself i should say
i had dined replied lady waldegrave as
i really don't mind dinner so much as many
people do and we had some not very bad mutton
chops at the last stage only they did taste a little
 seats and whisky she added laughing but
if you ask madame latour she will tell you she
has not dined since she left london
get dinner immediately for lady for
madame latour cried sir reginald hastily to
a servant who happened to be in the room then
colouring at his own impetuosity he turned to
edith and said i beg pardon miss malcolm
for presuming to anticipate your orders it is
time glenroy should resume his place since i am
already usurping his authority
o no said edith gently papa would be
pleased to see you performing the duties his
proxy by showing hospitality which you know
destiny 
is all we poor highlanders have to show to those
kind friends who have come so far to see us
i think i might be prevailed upon to eat
some these alpine strawberries said lady
waldegrave as she seated herself at table a
slight bend the head was the only reply sir
reginald vouchsafed as he helped the strawberries
without once looking towards his beautiful
guest
glenroy's bell had been sounding vehemently
at intervals for some time and a message now
came desiring to see sir reginald or miss malcolm
directly
sir reginald instantly started up as if glad 
the summons and merely saying to edith i
will save you the trouble hastily quitted the
room
 howextremement saar ragenall est change
exclaimed madame latour addressing ferment
ce ne que sombre de luimeme how he is
pale et nome what you call painseeve miss
maulcomb you most be sensible an extraordinaire
changement saar ragenall 
edith's attention had been so engrossed by
t
 
 destiny
florinda that she had little to bestow upon
madame latour but thus called upon she considered
her more attentively and the impression
made was not a pleasing kind madame latour
though rather past her prime was still a
showy handsome brunette with quick black
eyes good white teeth a well got up complexion
and an air the most thorough selfpossession
 sir reginald has not been very well late
said edith casting down her eyes to avoid the
piercing stare which accompanied the interrogation

ah i am much unquiet for him resumed
madame with a shake the head he was si
joli si charmant vat you call pleasant lady
waldegrave n'etes vous pas frappe struck with
de change 
i have scarcely yet had time to observe sir
reginald's looks replied lady waldegrave
carelessly but i thought you and he seemed
very merry together
o we talk nous rions laaffe for one moment
mais done il est si maigrevat you call
sm 
destiny 
meanwhile a repast from the debris the dinner
had been quickly got up at the other 
the room and no sooner was it arranged than
madame latour started up with great alacrity
and repaired to it lady waldegrave declined
partaking it saying she preferred dining on
the dessert benbowie whose appetite was 
a most hospitable nature instinctively stalked
away and took his place by her as if intending
to do the honours the banquet which
indeed he did if devouring every thing within
his reach was deemed an exemplary mark 
hospitality
 cette grosse est excellente excellentesaid
madame latour after she had helped herself to
the back and breast a moorfowl leaving the
legs and pinions for benbowie who like panting
time toiled after her in vain she flew
like a butterfly or bee from dish to dish extracting
the very heart and soul from each as she
skimmed along while at the same time she kept
calling for every species sauce and condiment
that ever had been heard which she contrived
to mix with the most admirable dexterity
 destiny
 madame latour est une peu gourmande
said lady waldegrave addressing edith but
otherwise she is the best creature in the world
 perfectly good hearted and so devoted to me
i am sure you will like her
edith could not violate sincerity so far as to
say she thought she should for she already felt
what she rarely did a strong prepossession against
this best creature in the world so she changed
the subject by making a sort apology for
reginald's protracted absence but papa is so
fond him she said that he finds it very
difficult to get away from him then with an
air hesitation she added sir reginald and
you met abroad i believe 
yes we met occasionally replied her ladyship
slightly colouring what very pretty
china this is dresden i am sure examining
her plate with great attention after all there
is nothing so pretty as flowers upon china
edith assented and then timidly added madame
latour seems much struck with the change
in reginald's appearance 
 he does look rather e said lady walden

grave as she drew another plate towards her
 what a charming group these carnations are
perfect 
 the loss my dear brother said edith
with emotion has affected reginald very deeply

 ah true replied lady waldegrave putting
on a very soft melancholy look
 that and the remains malaria which he
had at rome will account to you for the present
depressed state his spirits
oh perfectly said lady waldegravei
biting her lip as if to repress a smile which lurked
round her beautiful mouth and shone in her large
blue eyes
madame latour's devotion meanwhile had
been dedicated exclusively to her dinner and
having done due honour to it she was now on
her way to the dessert when lady waldegrave
rose saying pray dear edith let us go to
the drawingroom the smell two dinners is
rather too much for those who have not partaken
 either putting her arm within edith's she
thengracefullysaunteredoutof the room stopping
 destiny 
occasionally to remark upon some the pictures
which she did in the style one who was perfect
mistress the theory painting they were
soon followed by the rest the party with the
exception sir reginald
an air languid discontent was now insensibly
stealing over lady waldegrave in spite 
madame latour's efforts to amuse by her broken
english when again the sound wheels was
heard presently a heavyladen travelling coach
drew up from the windows which dogs heads
were seen protruding in all directions
 there comes mamma and her tiresome dogs 
exclaimed lady waldegrave in a tone chagrin
at that moment the hall resounded with the
sharp shrill treble three lapdogs which was
quickly accompanied by a deep running bass
from the various dogs the household and then
caught up by the imprisoned yells the more
remote inmates the kennel in notes by distance
made more sweet
ah i am happy to see reginald has gone
to receive lady elizabeth said edith as his
voice was heard in the hall giving orders to the
destiny 
servants and then flying down the steps he presented
his arm to lady elizabeth as she alighted
and appeared to welcome her with the semblance
 the greatest cordiality
how differently he met lady waldegrave 
thought edith then hastened forward to receive
her stepmother
 destiny
chapter xii
r
lady elizabeth was now a thin weak cross
oldlooking woman dressed in the extreme 
youthfulness with an unnatural profusion 
flaxen ringlets dangling round withered hollow
rouged cheeks she but just touched edith's
hand and laid her face to hers then passed onto
her daughter and putting her arms round her
kissed her with a sort hysterical emphasis
then in a peevish querulous tone exclaimed
you may thank heaven child you see me
safe and tolerably well what a frightful road
for me to travel how could you leave me my
jove i have been excessively alarmed those
dreadful precipices and that shocking water 
quite charming mamma said lady landgrave
 it seemed as if scott's beautiful description
 the trosachs had started into life and
destiny 
in a low tone bnt with perfect modulation 
voice and manner she repeated some those
glowing lines
nonsense my dear exclaimed lady elizabeth
 it is a frightful a dangerous road and it
was very improper you my love to leave my
carriage so far behind
 i beg pardon mamma but it did not appear
to me there was the slightest danger said her
daughter
my dear love don't say so cried her ladyship
impatiently i never in my life travelled
so dangerous a road if i had had the slightest
recollection it i never should have attempted
it even to gratify you my sweetest those tremendous
rocks on one hand and the lake on the
other shocking i had forgot it entirely else
i certainly never should have dreamt such a
thing as coming here
don't you feel fatigued mamma enquired
lady waldegrave
certainly my love excessively fatigued
and my nerves shaken beyond expression and
those dear dogs bijou was really quite ill i'm
 destiny
surprised glenroy can suffer such a road it
ought not to be permitted if i had been travelling
in the dark or if my horses had taken
frightor a thousand things might have happened

 don't you think mamma midst be much
fatigued dr price said lady waldegrave
turning to a sicklylooking elderly man in a
black wig green stout white trowsers pale
hands and a ring
 unquestionably replied the doctor in a
slow hesitating manner her ladyship has been
much agitated and consequently must be considerably
exhausted if her ladyship is to dine
now i would recommend half an hour's repose
after dinner either upon a couch or easy chair
whichever she gives the preference to or if there
is to be any delay in the preparing her ladyship's
repast then i would advise the rest to betaken
previous to partaking it
edith took the hint and ringing the bell
ordered a third dinner to be prepared as soon as
possible for her very considerate guests then
having procured some refreshments in the meandestiny

time she offered to conduct lady elizabeth to
her apartment with a languid air she accepted
edith's aim but as she was leaving the room
turned round and called 
florinda my darling you must come too 
and dr price you will give rosalie her directions
about the drops and do see that the dogs
get their dinners for they are almost famished
poor loves do florinda love come with me
i assure you i have been excessively alarmed it
is all your doing my dear that road was really
quite frightful i shall never forget my alarm
here lady waldegrave swept her fingers over
a harp which stood near and thus contrived to
evade the proposal
lady elizabeth after another ineffectual attempt
to attract her daughter's attention suffered
edith to lead her from the room but it was
with difficulty she managed to shuffle along in
shoes evidently much too small for her feet
 lady waldegrave is a charming creature
is she not said she stopping in the middle
 the hall and leaning her whole weight on
edith
 destiny
 oh beautiful exclaimed edith i could
not have imagined any thing so fiiuldess and at
the same time so captivating
ah very true her manners are very good
j have bestowed great pains upon her she is
perhaps if any thing but it is scarcely perceptible
 a single degree too much embonpoint at
least she may be unless she is upon her guard
i was a perfect whippingpost at her age and
even now i don't think i am larger than she is
it is a great matter to preserve the figure nothing
makes people look so soon old as allowing
themselves to grow fat and get out shape molinda's
figure to be sure is perfection rather
if any thing too tall perhaps she is taller than
i am otherwise as monsieur perpignan said
we might very well pass for twins pretty
thought was it not 
edith could scarcely restrain a smile as she
looked at the old wrinkled scarecrow who sought
to assimilate herself with her young and blooming
daughter 
her ladyship went on she has been prodigiously
admired and reciercae wherever we went
destiny 
but i don't intend that she should marry yet for
in fact lady waldegrave has nothing to gain ky
marriage duke myself she may lose but she can
scarcely better herself it is very well for desjules
sans dots to be eager about a settlement but
with my daughter's rank beauty fashion and
fortune what is she to look for and if she
were to marry now she would have a daughter
at her heels while she herself was quite a young
woman i married a great deal too soon and
you see the consequence i may be a grandmother
in the very prime life shocking and
foolish 
they had now reached the door her ladyship's
apartment and upon entering the dressing
room the floor was covered with imperials wells
trunks boxes sacs de nuit and packages every
description which her maid and footman were
busily employed in putting to rights
do rosalie contrive to get my things
unpacked and arranged as quickly as possible
cried lady elizabeth impatiently and looking
round the room pray ask the housekeeper tolet
me have a chaise longue i rather prefer it to a
vol ii g
 destiny
sofa and bring up my dogbaskets and cushions 
let me have a larger table and have that commode
carried away i shall not have room to turn about
here then addressing her footman and
rousseau look to my guitar and have it brought
here with my music books and portefeuille i
brought my guitar and rossini's last opera as i
thought it would amuse glenroy to have a little
good music but i am sorry to hear from sir
reginald that he is so unwell i shall make a
point dr price seeing him he is the best
creature in the world dresses so well he is so
skilful and gentlemanly and is never out the
way i have the most perfect confidence in him
it is very importunate for him poor man that he
has such wretched health himself had it been
otherwise indeed he must have been devoted to
the public and i should not have had the good
fortune to attach him to my establishment and
i am in hopes change scene and travelling
may do him good how very tedious you are
rosalie do get my things ready that i may
begin to dress
i beg pardon said edith but i think
destiny 
dr price recommended yom taking a little rest
before dinner and as we are quite a fbunily
party i hope you won add to your fatigue by
dressing
 o dr price does not at all understand that
sort thing replied her ladyship he is
excellent in his way but i shall put on a black
gown today rosalie florida and i agreed
to wear black at first as a sort proper ci
aliment you know glancing at edith's deep
mourning otherwise i never do wear black
it is so unpleasant and puts such shoeing
thoughts in one's head but we won't talk
 it it makes me quite ill to think such
things then as rosalie announced that her
ladyship's toilette was ready she gently pressed
the tip edith's fingers and said now my
dear i shall join you in half an hour and
edith gladly availed herself the hint to withdraw
wearied and sickened at the frivolity
heartlessness and egotism already so filly developed
in her stepmother's conversation edith
bitterly repented having been accessory to bringing
her to the house
 destiny
n
est un peu passe ma belle madame sighed
affectedly ainsi je vais sonner pour ma
 destiny
femme de chambre and to edith's great relief
madame latour retired to her toilette
apropos dress said lady waldegrave
 i hope you admire cameos edith because i
have brought you some and i shall be sorry if
you don't happen to like them i am very impatient
to show them to you so i shall send for
them now and in spite edith's remonstrances
she rang the bell for her maid and ina
few minutes the box was brought and an exquisite
set cameos the most perfect design
and execution were presented to edith whose
native good taste enabled her at once to appreciate
the beauty and value the gift
 how my heart overflows with affection and
kind wishes said lady waldegrave i now
feel so forcibly the truth that beautiful sentiment
 madame de steel's ii y a en nous un
superflu dame qu'il est doux de consacrer a ce
qui est beau quand ce qui est bien est accomplish
that i can flatter myself with having accomplished
the good added she with a smile le
beau is so much more to my taste than k bien
if to give pleasure is to do good you have
destiny isd
succeeded in one instance said edith as she
continued admiring the various beauties motte
classic gems but i am afraid there is too much
 le beau here to admit much le mm
lady waldegrave was silent for a few minutes
then with a sigh said whether i shall evei
do good is doubtful but it is certain that i hove
already been the cause much mischief i cannot
tell you how much i lament the unfortunate
misunderstanding that took place between lad
elizabeth and glenroy it grieves me more thank
i can express to think that i should have beeii
the cause the unintentional one indeed bf thefts
separation
 do not distress yourself on that account
dear florinda said edith tenderly for ili
deed lady elizabeth and papa seefii so different
i do not think they ever could davis lived
happily together
 you are very kind and considerate to sac
so replied lady waldegrave pressing her
hand but we cannot tell what habit might

have done i must therefore always look upon
g
y destiny

itfhelf as ike cause dus i fear irreparable
you blame yourself unjustly said edith
earnestly young as i was at die time from
dirliat i remember i should suppose you had
wittily been one many causes disagreement
 perhaps so but still i feel as a guilty thing
di how glad i should be if i could see them
fairly reconciled p
to tell you the truth i have often esse
daddy late felt the same wish said edith
fji at slight degree confusion lout now i
ii fe i do not think it will be practicable
ijiiy are so different
 thktyou'must be a better judge than i
replied lady waldegrave as my impression
 glenroy is probably very imperfect i only
remember him a very tall finelooking man with
a loud voice and an authoritative manner 
hch i was a little afraid but perhaps circumstances
may have softened these
eighth shook her head papa is very kindhearted
and affectionate said she but he likes
destiny 
to have his own way and lady elizabeth has
 course been so long independent control

ah true interrupted lady waldegrave
 mamma is not easily managed and she is excessively
fond what is called a gay life and
therefore i fear we must be satisfied with a
mere temporary reconciliation without attempting
a more solid union it is unfortunate for
when i marry mamma would be more respectable
living with her husband than she will be
by herself and when you marry which 
course you will also do now don't blush edith
love i am not going to talk lovers i shall 
find out in good time whether you have any
affaires du cobwy so pray don't make me your
confidante tis the office in the world i have
the greatest dread 
edith laughed and promised and the conversation
was ended by the entrance sir reginald
and dr price looking like two people
whom chance not choice had thrown together
sir reginald drew near as if about to address
lady waldegrave then stopped and turned to
the table where the cameos were and taking
 destiny
up one the bracelets commended die beauty
 it
they are indeed perfect said edith each
cameo is a picture in itself and i should have
thought myself rich with any one them but
lady waldegrave insists upon my accepting
the whole set
sir reginald said nothing but hastily put
down the bracelet and joining dr price at one
 the windows immediately began to talk politics
with him edith coloured with shame at
this proof o her later's rudeness and dislike to
lady waldegrave and yet she thought
 how is it possible to hate any thing so beautiful
and captivating what can be the cause 
this coldness which he seems to feel for everything
connected with a creature so lovely and
engaging 
how did you like my picture edith enquired
lady waldegrave should you have
known me by it 
edith looked at her with die air one who
is at a loss to comprehend the meaning a
question
your picture relied she i never saw
destiny 
any picture you except the little daub done
by mrs macauley which bad as it is has always
hung iq my dressingroom you don't mean
that
no the picture i sent you from florence
whom did i send it by as if trying to recollect
i certainly did send it how provoking that i
should not be able to tell by whom there were
a number english there but perhaps sir
reginald malcolm might if he chose assist my
memory
sir reginald took no notice but continued
talking with much energy with dr price on
the affairs europe edith called to him 
 sir reginald sir reginald i wish you outcome
and assist lady waldegrave and me in our
attempts to recover a picture she gave in charge
to some one at florence for me but which i
have never received
 even if i guessed at die offender said sit
reginald in a low voice lady waldegrave
surely would not have the cruelty to have his
name exposed to the indignation which his conduct
merits
 destiny
reginald was behind edith who did not see
his ice as he spoke but he was opposite to lady
waldegrave who blushed deeply while something
like a smile was upon her up
 is it morinda or i whose indignation you
think would be so excessive asked edith
 both he replied as he turned quickly and
rejoined dr price
 it must be from mere carelessness that it
has not been delivered said lady waldegrave
 but if it does not appear soon you or i must
draw up an advertisement for it edith seriously
it must be recovered as a lock my
hair accompanied it and it is not every one i
should choose to be in possession such things
valueless as they may be to the retainer
sir reginald and dr price were busily engaged
looking at an atlas and the two friends
continued to converse together till lady elizabeth
made her appearance dressed like fifteen
for a first ball
my dear florinda she exclaimed what
do i see not yet dressed how very uncomfortable
it makes me to see any body in a morndestiny

ing gown in the evening it is so very trying
an angel could not stand such a test i do
assure you my dear you look very ill
 thank you inamma said lady landgrave
coolly and taking up a footstool cover
with mrs macauley's needle still sticking in it
she began to work with an air unconcern
 too ridiculous cried lady elizabeth with
a shrug her little bare shoulders you only
want a brass thimble to make you quite complete
lady waldegrave why should you
wish to look like a dowdy my love then ina
whisper to edith she is a beautiful creature
to be sure what a profile i what a throat 
what hands madame d dumont used to say she
should have known her to be my daughter anywhere
from the hands alone hands and feet
you know are the great criterions birth
heavens how she was admired at paris i she
is a little spoilt perhaps by the sensation she
caused
here her ladyship's dinner was announced
and as edith rose to attend her lady landgrave
exclaimed poor dear edith i this is really
 destiny
too much to do the honours three dinners in
one day how yoii must hate us all cannot
good mrs macauley relieve you fixm this duty 
i am sure mamma will excuse you
 mrs macauley and benbowie are always
with papa in the evening said edith bat
at any rate sir reginald and i would wish to
welcome lady elizabeth to glenroy ourselves
and as you did not partake the first dinner
perhaps you will join our party
no dinner my dear child cried lady
elizabeth what do i hear how very foolish
how could madame latour suffer such a thing 
no wonder pott look palesuite abattm come
my love you shall dine with me my dinner
you know is a mere makebelieve sir reginald
you will take charge lady waldegrave
putting her own arm within edith's sir reginald
hastily recoiled at the proposal then quickly
recovering himself was advancing when lady
waldegmve said with an air coldness ike
case me mamma i have already dined and i
prefer remaining here
but my dear love you will be alone 
destiny 
some one must stay with you not you pressing
edith's arm i have much to say to you
perhaps dr price but the doctor looked very
glum at the proposal and luckily at that moment
madame latour appeared which settled the
point and the party proceeded to the diningroom
leaving the two friends together i
wish particularly to talk to you my dear said
her ladyship in a low voice to edith as she
walked mincingly along there are many
things very interesting to both us i have on
my mind at present by the by my dear your
hair is not dressed quite drlamode it becomes
you very well but still it is too simple for the
present style the simple is now quite exploded
 and indeed i'm not sure that i like simplicity
though it does well enough now and
then by way df a little variety florida for
instance may simple now and then for a whim
but she may do any thing she chooses you have
heard these pretty lines somebody made upon
her
tender or free in smiles or sadness drest
the reigning humour ever suits her best

 destiny
then as she seated herself at table she repeated
 tender and free e sir reginald
do you remember who it was made these
lines upon my daughter 
 i beg pardon said sir reginald but i
believe the lines are to be found in parthenope
delos
 excuse me sir reginald replied the lady
with an air displeasure but the lines were
made upon lady waldegrave as any one may
perceive at once and as mr benton very well
remarked to me die irre a perfect picture 
her mr benton repeats verses better thai
any body i know this soup is very goodrit
is very good sending away her plate after
taking two spoonfuls i know you don't recommend
salmon to me dr price but that looks
so particularly well i will just taste it then
having taken a little it it was also sent off
pray send me a pat dr price ah chicken
pat very well seasoned though putting
down the knife and fork after the first mouthful
 yes i will try ihefricandeaui and so on with
game tarts jellies and dessert in a manner
destiny 
enough to have raised the ghost lycurgus or
dr gregory no sooner had she finished than
quickly rising she again linked herself to edith
 now let us go to the library or the saloon
or any where to be quiet as i wish to have
a little teteastute with you my dear i have
so much to say to you and apropos do you
know i think sir reginald malcolm excessively
disagreeable how very rude to contradict me
about these lines i know he is your cousin 
but nobody minds cousins to tell you the
truth i never did like him as a boy you iqowy
he was shocking he had very nearly killed my
daughter as you may remember f he had beat
her in the most frightful manner in hct had
almost actually strangled her i certainly never
would have forgiven it and i did not approve
 florinda's having admitted him to her acquaintance
it began when she was absent fropi
me with her aunt lady escort at naples else
i never would have permitted it
lady waldegrave and sir reginald do not
appear to be very good friends yet said within
some embarrassment
 destiny
why no i am not sure she certainly was
admired and he if rather handsome don't you
think so but horinda though the sweetest
creature in the world is a little capricious that
between ourselves though and i blame madame
latour entirely for whatever faults my daughter
may have i don't quite like madame latour 
she affects a style dress which is absurd and
wears her petticoats so very short to show her
foot which by the by sis not well shaped
such display is very bad taste and quite defeats
the object glancing at herself in a mirror with
great complacency to tell you a secret my
dear but this is quite in confidence i half
suspect her a design upon sir reginald it
is rather ridiculous to be sure for madame latour
is by no means a young looking woman in
act that is one great advantage we blondes have
over brunettes in general we retain a youthful
appearance much longer however it is certain
he paid her great attention at florence and was
much more in my house than i thought either
proper or agreeable
reginald an admirer madame latour 
destiny 
edith could not believe her ears and yet with
what vivacity he had met her how she sickened
at the thought how degrading to sir reginald
to herself to harbour it for a single moment 
while these thoughts passed through her mind
lady elizabeth went on
 madame latour is a good emily and so
was her husband to be sure she is older than
sir reginald but that is nothinga few year
one way or other makes little difference and he
certainly did admire her and paid her great
attention but however it may have been merely
pour passer le temps
could reginald her own betrothed have condescended
to flirt pour passer le temps with a
madame latour oh how edith's pure and
devoted heart rose at the suggestion 
 
 your ladyship must excuse me my spirits
instit lare
not equal to danomg said edidi and it
eyes filled with tears as she though hug uf
the boasted sympathy i was led to expect in our
sorrow i
 deed and i think it would not be decent
to be dancing said mm macauley in a low
voice to madame latour considering the mis
fortunes the emily and glenroy himself laid
up in hk bed honest man 
 reginald saw that edith was hurt quitting
madame latour he hastily advanced to
wardsrher and taking her hand drew it within
his arm while he led her to an open windows
you are ill fatigued i fear dear edith
said he in a tone compassion at that moment
lady waldegrave rose and called to hers
 excuse me miss malcolm but i must wish
you good night she was then retiring attended
by her friend when lady elizabeth folding her
in her arms kissed her forehead good nighty
my sweetest you do look abattue but a 
in the evening is too trying fu have seen morinda to her apartmeiiuui
we shall hare a lite soft music before supper
sir reginald opened the door for the iadiefer
to withdraw and as lady waldegrare passed
he made her a profound bow which she noticed
with a dight and constrained bend the head
madame latour whispered a few words to him
in italian then laughed gaily and the door was
dosed quelle grdoe dans son salut vat you
cah bow said she addressing lady wade
grave then turning to edith ah meess mal
comb votre iriie t charmant i il a fait tourner
la tete fi toutes les femmes d'ltalie
 reginald is not my brother said edith
with a blush
 saar reginaal n'est pas votre fre your

astonishment 
destiny 
chapter xiv
when lady waldegrave appeared at breakfast
the following morning she looked still more
beautiful than she had done the preceding evening
madame latour was as usual by her side
but lady elizabeth never was visible in the
morning dr price was also there as silent and
sicklylooking as usual edith had planned a
little excursion by land and water to show some
 the beauties glenroy to her guests and she
intended that reginald should take the management
 but her surprise and disappointment were
great when she learnt that he had set off early
in the morning to shoot here was a fresh act
 incivility and unkindness and edith vainly
tried to falter out some excuse for him to lady
waldegrave who heard her in silence while an
 destiny
air languid dissection gradually stole over
her lovely features
 ah le pauvre saar reginaal exclaimed
madame latour in a tone deep commiseration

weli that's right you mr m'dow just
t teo the truth and not to think shame about
it what for should not people tell when they
ai going to be married t and marriage such an
honourable state as sure as any thing pm
ile glad you're going to be settled at last
ienbowie are not you happy that mr m'dows
going to be married 
 surely surely said benbowie has she
amy money r
 y as to that said mr mdow with an
air great dignity and conscious elevation 
abel i have never made fortune my principal
object i consider it beneath a man honour
and integrity to lay himself out for money at
thejsame time i would not quarrel with it if it
came in my way and upon this occasion the
lady's fortune is shootable indeed i may say
pretty handsome
edith tried to utter some complimentary words
on the occasion but found it very difficult to
xncernrr 
combine compliments with fiincentjr luckily
mrs macauley covered all deficiencies 
if it not a secretes
 why if it is it will not be long one returned
mr mdow still very consequential
 indeed i strongly suspect the report had reach
ed the country before myself or i doubt if even
my good friend mrs macauley with all her wit
and shrewdness would have taken me up fm
deeply it's amazing how a report that kind
spreads it was for that reason i wished to lose
no time in communicating the event myself u
my excellent friend and patron for i only
returned home last night but before this timai

said his wife and i don't know all what and i
wa to promise to marry him to you in my kirlr
whenever his papa came home then you anal
he cast out about something or another and i

be just as well to let her come here at once and
have it over and then she can go when she likely
you know but if i'm laid up again she may

i think edith the best thing will be for you

norman and the black pony
aware that lady elizabeth would ndt understand
much less minister to a mind diseased
her own being nearly in the same states edith eras
 destiny
desirous if possible to prevent a meeting rich
tike was sure could produce nothing but irritation
on both sides she therefore sought to turn his
mind from the subject altogether or at least to
prevail upon him to postpone the interview till
near the time their departure but with all the
obstinacy and perverseness imbecility glen
roys wishes strengthened and his impatience
increased under opposition even in the mildest
form and edith was obliged to yield the point
and depart on her embassy
on craving anaudience she was admitted to
lady elizabeth's drenngroom where she found
her ladyship in her robe de chambre holcbi d
levieasdr price rousseau and rosame and lee
another julius caesar dictating to all at once
dr price finds me pretty well thismom
ing said she squeezing the tip edith's fingers
on her entrance and i have just been
giving him directions as to the sort draught
i should like to have tory tis great con
sequence to have these sort things suited to
toe's taste and constitution by the by perv
haps glenroy would like to have one ofdr
destiny 
price's draughts they are really very pleasant
something like lemonade but not quite that
neither dr price you will be so good as mix
up a draught exactly the same as mine and
take it to glenroy with my love i am sure
he will be pleased with this little mark attention
from me 
edith trembled at the very thoughts such
an embassy and almost fancied she beheld the
chief's crutch uplifted to smite dr price and
his potion to the ground in great trepidation
she therefore entreated that the kind intention
might be at least postponed and then delivered
the message with which she had been chained
though in rather softer terms than she had received
it
having come expressly as was supposed for
the purpose seeing her husband it was naturally
to be concluded that her ladyship's mind
would be quite prepared for the interview instead
 which she fell into a childish flutter at
the first mention it
on others and she therefore gave her ladyship
credit for the reality her tremors she begged
she would take her own time was sure her papa
would wish to do what was most agreeable to
her and so on till the return dr price
the doctor was a stupid inoffensive man
who for two hundred ayear a luxurious home
and his travelling expenses was contented to
trot between his own room and lady elizabeth's
about twenty times aday to compound little
harmless draughts and powders for her and to
have his advice constantly asked and never
taken
the result the consultation however way
destiny 
that her ladyship heroically resolved to go through
as she termed it with the part she had to perform
dr price was again dismissed and edidi
desired to wait until she should be dressed
rosalie was then summoned and lady eliaae
beth in spite her tremors betaking herself to
the labours the toilet was soon so completely
engrossed by them that the dreaded interview
seemed almost forgotten
 i always disliked black said sbe addressing
edith there's something so sombre about it
one never looks dressed otherwise i'm not snr
that it is actually unbecoming to me it sett
off a fair skin but then it obliges one to use k
soupfon more rouge than i like apropos mf
dear one comfort is that black sat shoes are
the most becoming things possible far tike feh
all men think so these are ma by melf
note and i think are perfects added lie while
her maic with great exertion was freing diem
on and fit rae admirably florin had got
my foot a model it was taken for the gat
very at florence in fact princess pauline was
quite jealous it my large gold earrings

and bracelets rosalie and what shall i put
on ney head a cap looks so particularly dowdy
in black my purple bat and feathers purple
my dear you know is a sort mourning
there i think that looks very well the feathers
the least in the world more to the left side
and a ringlet or two pulled a little more dow
now contemplating herself from head to foot
in the mirror and jerking her head and should
ders my gloves and shawl rosalie tjbw
comes the true test taste turning to edith 
 in feet nobody that has not been abroad ch
put on a shawl and at length equipped like
one the eugarites in les modes de paris
ber ladyship set forth leaning on edith then
suddenly stopping she exclaimed but i must
have my dogs and i am sure glenroy will be
delighted with them bijou is smh a love 
here edith was obliged to interpose and
aware her father's abhorrence lapdogs with
much difficulty succeeded in prevailing on her
ladyship to dispense with their attendance for
the present
destiny 
on arriving at the door the study there was
another demur
rdlanviuefi symptoms
 it already which is very alarming he
if a etmanxaag young man not actually handsome
but extremely distinffu in his appearance
tad manners he is a great fitraurite mine
attd quite le chert des dames he is so very feasible
and attentive quite enable but he beer
tully is delicate and i know my poor brother
is at times wretched about him an only son
ckmoeive how dreadful if he were to lose him f 
here glenroy burst out and why should
he not lose an only son as well as his neighbours
i know what it is to have lost an only son
my norman was taken from me whether i would
or not and and he could not go on
 ah true said his lady in a tone conn
moderation that was very sad but we wont
talk these things glenroy they are too mundi
for us you must not allow yourself to get hipped
 you ought to come to town for a little
in the season we are to have pasta next winresting

ter and i have already secured an excellent box
her medea is quite perfect i am sure you
would be enchanted with it her despair at
the loss her children was absolutely too much
i assure you i was quite overcome
edith saw a storm ready to burst fnrthy eod
hastily interposed
 you have got a more pleasant sight to show
papa in lady waldegrave i am sure london
contains nothing more beautiful
 very true very true said her ladyship
with a nod approbation florinda is petrie
de frames and she will cause a prodigious sensation
in the world in fact wherever ae has
appeared you can form no idea the admira
lion she has excited she has course already
had many splendid offers at least what would
have been splendid for any one else but flor
linda is too young to marry yet early marriages
are foolish things you know glenroy
a sort growl was here ejaculated by glenroy
 and late ones worse he muttered to
himself
the weather is so fine i hope you will soon

interrupted glenroy impatiently i take very
little pleasure now even in my own piper though
he's the best in the country and has carried off
the highland society's prize three times at the
competition and he was his foster brotiiertoo
here glenroy's voice faltered and allowed his
lady to strike in
ah well we wont say any more about that

aflnd time best creature in the world as a courier
sos yo quite a treasure a greeks and speaks

 climate i assure you i was quite uneasy
about bka when he first joined us at paris for
yea know an only son one is always anxious
about and bis poor jgeuher quite doats upon him 
indeed he is deserving it for he is a most
npedor young maui and i have a real regard for

he is distractedly in lote with my daughter and
j think she is attached to him but i don't wish
her to marry yet she earn at any time form a
brilliant alliance in hctf with florida's rank
beauty fortune talents she may unquestionably
be considered the first match in the kingdom
 the first match in the kingdom exclaimed
glenroy in a transport rage what makes
her the first match in the kingdom a woman 
a poor insignificant woman to be the first match
in the kingdom the first match in the kingdom
is the man who will come after me and that
man's reginald malcolm and if my son had
destint 
been alive he would have been the first match
in the kingdom a woman to be the first match
in the kingdom and glenroy actually swelled
out with passion
to this burst his lady gave a little weak angry 
affected laugh then said f dt
 sift rjgijrajid returned from sboouigd
m entering the diningroom before diniij
found only madame latour mrs maeanly
price and two or three chace gutsof jgio
zipte who kept apart with benbowie iady
elizabeth was commonly the last to appear ajid
jth was sitting with lady waldegravesho
l chose to remain in her own apartment o the
j plea continued indisposition
i wonder what all you young people axe
made nowadays said mrs macaiiley looking
with eyes affectionate compassion on sir
reginald who certainly had nothing the fee
d joyous air the sportsman but looked lai
guide and dispirited you are all so tender npw
so different from what young people were in my
day when we were so stout and hearty there's
destiny 
lady waldegrave been shut up in her room the
whole this fine sunny day not well there's
you 
i hope there is nothing stammered
sir reginald to madame latour
 ah oxdi said madame latour with a deep
sigh and a shake her head ladi landgrave
est un pen malade depicts ce matin c'est sa
sensibility extreme f ah si elle avoit la tranquillity
de mademoiselle malcomb votre soeur
and madame latour heaved another sigh
reginald was silent for a few moments lis if
mastering his agitation then said in a earn tone
 i trust lady waldegrave's indisposition is not
 a serious nature probably it is occasioned
by the uncommon heat which has been almost
too much for me miss malcolm is not my sister
he added in a less firm voice
 ah que je suis bete how i do meestak 
assortment elle ne vous ressemble nullement
elle est si calme si tranquille what you call
enseepede n'est ce pas 
reginald coloured and was silent but mrs
macauley had caught at the word insipid as shines
destiny
low eclipsed with edith and she exclaimed in
pid you're not surely meanings to tail miss
edith indpid or i'm thinking you don't know
the meaning the irord madame insipid you
know means wersh and wersh means insipid 
and i can tell you she's any thing but wersh
though she's so sweet and gentle
 ah pardon madame macalioi si if i do
speak mademoiselle malcomb vat hal not
proper c'est une personne tres aimable miss
malcomb et quoique sa beaut ne soit pas a
fblouissante si parfaite que celia de ladi walden
die est tik bien rat you call pretty
well
 pretty well repeated mrs aiibcauley kindling
up at this fresh insult pretty well did
i ever hear the like that then softening
down as quickly as she blazed up but though
pm thinking you're no just so ignorant our
language as you would make us trow yet i see
you cannot express yourself properly or you
never would speak in such a way miss edith
and so i should not be angry with you pretty
well i cannot think enough it pretty well
assist 
means just well enough and to cal gledjxrfs
daughter just wdl enough 
madame latour either did not or affected
not to understand mrs macauley better lilian
mrs macauley understood her but seeing her
displeased pretended to conciliate her 
 pardonnez moi chere madame macklin assortment
vous not understand if you think me
capable to say de tings meess malcomb pour
irons offenser c'est une personne de beaucoup
de meiite dans son genre elle n'a pas les graces
ni rdat de ladi waldegrare ni son air dislingua
ni sa sensibility extreme
i don't very well know what you're saying
madameaidmrsmacaukyrather impatiently
 for i'm no great french scholar but i can
tell you though miss edith does not give herself
any grand airs she's as ladylike in her quiet
genteel way as any lady in the land and though
die may not be so showy and catchinglike for
au that hers is the face nobody could ever
weary o if s so good and so sweet and so sensible
and so loving too fve rien thought how
she answered to a verse one our sooth
 destiny
songs m let you hear it and see if if s not
like miss edith and she repeated slowly
and distinctly the most beautiful perhaps all
burns's beautiful verses 
 as in the boflom o the stream
time moonbeam dwells at dewy even
so trembling pare was tender love
within the breast o bonny jean
 ah quel amour transi said madame
latour with a shudder as she turned to sir
reginald at that moment lady elizabeth
and edith entered and the conversation course
dropt
all traces the matrimonial fracas had entirely
disappeared from lady elizabeth's aspect
for the variety her frivolous pursuits seldom
allowed her mind to dwell long on one subject
satisfied that she had amply fulfilled her duty by
the visit condolence to her husband she was
now decked out in pink and silver and smiles
and short petticoats and white shoes
 florida has not been quite well this morning
dr price and i think she is rather out 
spirits tis dull for her you know to be in the
destiny 
country hxmefver she has promised to joke ns
in ike eyemt otherwise i must make a point
 her seeing you dr price iwishleonklliav
lead her picture as i found her just nowsin my
life i never beheld any thing so perfect she
was sitting at a table her cheek resting on her
hand you know her attitude her hair falling
over her shoulders 

 tender or free in smiles or sadness drest 
the reigning humour ever suits her best 
deed then i think begging yourlady
ship's pardon the fewer humours people have so
much the better observed mrs macauley
 ii n'y a rien de plus ennuyeux que les personnes
qui n'ont qu'un seul ton n'est il pas
vrai said madame latour
sir reginald looked as if he understood the
innuendo and he answered in french the
human mind has often been compared to amti
sical instrument perhaps most minds may be
capable giving a variety tones but it is not
every one who has the power calling them
forth
 ah oui mais le jeu ne vaut pas la diandelle
 destiny
to what you call draw out cette espece de parsoon
 les gens resents ressemblent a raoit
ayes a cet instrument de votre pays le bagpeep
wldch it take such a force to sound f and lier
glance was directed to edith who sat sear
reading
 the analogy is not just rested reginald
gravely there are minds like the organ
 great power and melody when skilfully called
forth but it is not every hand that can touch
the right chords or every ear that can appreciate
their excellence and he sighed as he
said it
 ah oui c'est vat i do say ii fact de la
sympathie dans le gout sans sympathie pane
ne pent etre d'aceord et sans harmonise le xmt
ne vaut rien
sir reginald turned abruptly from madame
latour to edith and as if he felt that he owed
her some reparation for the innuendos that had
so evidently been levelled against her he devoted
himself to her until they ware summoned
to dinner
on leaving the diningroom edith was auih
tsoedikkdi by lady elizabeth who again ipro
destint 
printed her to her own particular use as an
auditor
 you will go to florinda madame latour
and with my we tell her i desire to see her in
the drawingroom by and by you my dear
to edith will accompany me to my dressing
room where we shall be quiet as i must hare
a little talk with you i hare much to say and
i shall not hare much time as course we
cannot remain long here and by the by i
have never properly introduced you to my darlings
i am obliged to keep them in my dressingroom
for fear your large dogs and that was
one the things i wanted to say to yon yon
really must have those creatures shut up you
must know i got amor and amoretta finom cardinal
cacciapiatti an uncommonly fascinating
finelooking person he paid me great attention
when i was at rome i dare say you find
this room rather warm but i am obliged to have
a large fire os account my dogs they feel
the cold this climate dreadfully dr price
was opinion that amorettas last attack was
decidedly rheumatic unluckily her dogbasket
has a widow and i teak ae em air had
ile destiny
streamed in upon her so i was obliged to have
it closed up which makes it dull and i dealt
fhiiiik she has ever liked it since if it were not
for my eider downqmlt i don't know imnkti
should have kept them alive that cardinal
really was a delightful person he thought my
pronunciation the language quite peiet
when you go you must make a point getting
introduced to him i think glenroy warlike
him so flowed on the babbling stream
 her ladyship's eloquence and even edith's
patience great as it was was nearly exhausted
before it could be brought to a cessation or
she could prevail on her to return to the anm
ingropm on entering the apartment ediai
beheld lady waldegrave and madame latour
seated on a sopha and sir reginald leaning
over the back it a blush was on florindas
cheek but traces deep emotion were visible
on reginald's features as he bent his head towards
her and spoke in a low voice madame
latour was or affected to be engrossed by fido
whom she was fondling with true french vivacity
a strange indefinable something she could
not tell wjmlt struck edith at the sight vthis
destiny 
odious madame latour thought she it way
however a mere sudden sensation unattended
by any train reflections for as lady elizabeth
adtaoeed reginald hastily broke off finom lady
watdegrare and turning abruptly round joined
te reflijl the gentlemen who were standing a
sotee distance
how charmingly you look my love 
lady elisabeth quitting her hold 
edith for a moment to embrace her daughter
 aod what a very pretty dress f that is madame
delacour i am sure how i wish i had seen
it and i should have ordered one the same show
extremely becoming eth an air chagrin
then in a peevish tone but you ought to'have
more flowers in your hair my dear child only
look at the size my head which you know is
far from being mtrep
 you forget i have had a headach this morning
mammas said lady waldegrave evidently
annoyed consequently my head is itt able to
bear much
absurd my dear p in a peevish voice whoever
heard a headach or any thing else being
vol ii k
 destiny
an excuse for being ill dressed if yon choose
to say it is your fancy to dress so and so i dan
understand that and it may pass but i do assure
pott it is very bad taste to make any thing that
sort a matter necessity you must expect to
be pitied if you do and when once a person
comes to be pitied there is an her consequence
for ever
then pray mamma suffer me to hide my
diminished head quietly in this comer said
lady waldegrave trying to laugh away her
mother's absurdity
 ah vous et moi miladi said madame latour
with an air mock humility devons nous
contenter de porter des fleurs sur la tete mais
quant a ladi waldegrave les fleurs naissent sous
ses pas et apropos saar reginaal est ce que
voice fleur favorite croit dans cette triste cobtree
vat you call forget mcvnot but sir
reginald was by this time deeply absorbed in a
 and made no answer voyons done ce
qui vous occupe cried madame latour playfolly
drawing the from before him de
la peesie and she ran over the knew as if
destiny 
ghiig to read them aloud then handing the 
to lady waldegrare lizez doncehere miladi
votre voix charmante embellish meme ces verses
lady waldegrave took the without answering
glanced her eye over the page and
as she closed it exclaimed ah there wan
love
the play was count basil the lines which 
had drawn forth the remark were those touching
and beautiful ones uttered as he gazes on victoria
for the last time 
to be so near thee and for ever parted 
for ever lost what art thou now to me 
shall the departed gaze on thee again 
shall i glide past thee in the midnight hoar
whilst thou perceives it not and thinkat perhaps
ti but the mournful breeze that passes by 
sir reginald's eyes had been fixed on florida
intently as she read then suddenly starting
he said in a hurried manner edith won't
you give us some music 
 do you remember edith you promised to
sing me one your scotch songs said lady 
waldegrave gaily pray let me have one 
your oldest old ballads and an't lose tones
fi destiny
she added in a whisper while mamma is busy
talking to that very civil attentive gentleman
who looks as if he would listen for half a century

 edith arose and as she turned toward the
piano abe saw and was stick with the ezpresaon
 reginald's countenance his eyes were fixed
on the spot where lady waldegrave and madame
latour were seated while ie passed him unnoticed
 unheeded a strange pang shot through
her heart her eyes filled with tears she could
not define the nature her feelings she would
have shrunk from the attempt even had it been
in her power as she would have done from the
point a dagger she began to busy herself in
turning over the music as if seeking for something
though she knew not what till her agitation
subsided and having selected that most
beautiful all scottish airs gilders she began
to sing a verse the old ballad she possessed
from nature a melodious voice a fine ear and
an intuitive refinement taste gifts which if
they did not constitute her a firstrate musician
rendered her at least a very touching and delightdestiny

fill one but on the present occasion edith's
powers seemed all to have foiled her her voice
was weak and tremulous her ear was unconscious
 sound and all her perceptions were a mixed
and painful nature aware her failure she
rose from the instrument arid faltering out ah
excuse begged some one else f ould take her
place lady waldegrave attempted some faint

reginald to the harp
poor edith's failure was only rendered more
conspicuous by florinda's display she was in
implant voice and with perfect selfpossessions
played and sang several beautiful italian and
french airs in the manner a perfectly well
taught and highlyfinished musician lady waldrave
was much too well bred to practise any 
the little commonplace paltry airs coquetry 
at the same time it might be discovered by a
discerning eye that admiration was the aim and

more simple and unstudied titian her varied

 symptoms impatience were now visible in
the countenance lady elizabeth and rousseau
and the guitar were summoned which seemed the
signal for her daughter to retire from the fidid
with an exclamation at the heat the room and
the beauty the night she rose and passed into
the small drawingroom a few minutes elapsed
without any one following
 ladi waldegrave a laisse ses gants said
madame latour looking to isr reginald as she
field them up reginald extended his hand to
take them then turned hastily away and addressed
some remark to the person next him
 i will take florinda her gloves tend edith
with an elasticity spirit she did not stop to
analyze and could not easily have accounted for 
and without noticing madame latour's look 
displeasure she seized the gloves and followed
lady waldegrave the glow excitement
which had so lately lighted up her beautiful face
had fled and the same expression languid disdestiny

satisfaction was visible which edith had formerly
observed
i fear you have fatigued yourself by singing
too much said edith and she proceeded to
praise her musical powers with all the ardour 
generous and sincere admiration lady landgrave
appeared but little gratified with the commendations
for she received them slightly and
her thoughts seemed wandering while edith
spoke
i fear you are unwell dear florinda said
edith at a loss to account for the coldness and
abstraction one who but a few minutes before
had been all animation and brilliancy
oh no not ill replied lady waldegrave
in the accent one who felt rather annoyed
than soothed by the enquiry
then surely you can have nothing to vex
or disquiet you said edith softly ah florida
if you have would that you thought me
worthy to share your confidence 
you would be shocked were i to tell you the
cause my vapeurs said lady waldegrave
with affected solemnity how shall i own to you
s destiny
tkftt i am a ktde whimsical and a little the
very least grain in the world capricious
edith felt hurt at the taunting manner in which
die was treated and remained silent
 i see you are shocked edith love at such
jbiaacknowlement most people would as soon
confess that they lie and steal as that they
lure in the least degree capricious but for my
part i have none that virtuous abhorrence to
a little caprice it certainly renders the chanter
or at least the manners more piquant 
syr example i am tired singing sentimental
songs au the evening and that you will call being
capricious and i now wish to amuse myself by
talking nonsense but i fear you are too wise to
talk nonsense edith 
not on proper subjects answered edith
gravely but 
 my dear edith for heaven's sake don't
use such an old governess phrase as proper subjects
 but indeed i am not aware we were
upon any important subject in particular were
we edith 
 you had not thought it so else you would

notliave asked the question replied edith coldly
but gently
 ah i am the most forgetful creature in the
worldespecially when there is such a moons
such a lovely moon to gaze upon come let us
enjoy its beams and escape the tinkle man
mass guitar out doors there was an old
fashioned glass door which opened upon a sort
 terrace walk and she stept out edith and
she took two or three turns backwards and forwards
admiring the beauty the night while
morinda occasionally warbled a few notes or
repeated a line or two petrarch then half
pettishly exclaimed ebye you nothing to say
on the charms moonlight edith 
edith roused from the reverie into which she
had ellen replied nothing my own but i
could be eloquent in the words ossian only
i suspect you could not enter into my enthusiasm

f v sunk a description is quite illustrative the
night said florinda carelessly but it is too
cold and abstracted for me and so is the night
itself to speak the truth it wants the charm
 an italian moonlight the rich warm glowing
indescribable charm which there pervades
the atmosphere and fills the heart as some one
madame de steel i believe has well said the

dear dear loved naples p exclaimed she fervently
as at that moment they were joined ley
madame latour and sir reginald
i cannot join in your eulogium on italy
said edith as it is still a sealed to me
but here are those who will i have no doubt
were you reginald as much enamoured 
naples as florinda seems to be

is
 quite he replied in an emphatic tone
and like her do you too look with something
 disdain on the loveliest our highland
nits 
 not with disdain but with moreof admiration
than love
i thought you had loved your own country
reginald said edith pensively
 i have a great respect for it replied he 
 love perhaps is peculiar to italy he added
with a sigh
ah oui cried madame latour admirers

flowers and the melody and the odours italy

edith coloured deeply she tried to laugh
but she could not succeed for a sigh from sir
reginald smote her heart he walked slowly 
away then returned with the air one who is
irresolute whether to go or stay madame latour
now complained a frisson and shivering
hurried into the house florinda reginald and
edith remained some time longer but the two
former showed no inclination to converse and
after some fruitless attempts on edith's part
they all followed madame latour's example and
soon after separated for the night

chapter evil
the next day was sunday day rest to the
poor and the toilwornof weariness to the rich
and the idle ah little do they enter into the
feelings many who look forward to this day
as the day when even the wicked cease from
troubling and the weary are at rest as the day
blessed and hallowed to those on whom rests in
its full force the primeval command six days
shalt thou labour and which makes the sabbath
lovely in the sight
 blessed angels pitying human cares 
as the day when heavenly truths are proclaimed
alike to all from the prince to the beggar from
the man grey hairs standing on the threshold
 the grave to the young who have lately entered
the arena this life there in the house
 god the rich and the poor meet together 
 destiny
 there they are reminded those impressive
truths so humbling to the haughty so elevating
to the lowly that the lord is the maker 
them all and that one day they shall stand before
his judgmenthseat without respect persons
to receive the reward the deeds done in the
body on that day how many a sorrowing
heart can more freely pour forth its grief to that
gracious ear which is ever open to the cry the
afflicted 
 on every sea
which eorvipe's navies plough yes in all lands
from polo to pole or civilized or rude
people there are to whom the sabbath morn
dawns shedding dews into their drooping hearts
the religious observances at glenroy were
entirely a negative character there was neither
music or billiards on sunday such the
family as chose went to church and such as chose
remained at home mrs macauley except when
glenroy prevented her was a regular attender
 church as she said even mr mdow's preaching
was better than none and edith generally
went to the afternoon service which was per
destint 
formed in what mr mdow called english the
morning service being in gale for the benefit
 the aborigines the country on this 
the party having lingered over a late breakfast
were now severally settled at their occur
turns lady elizabeth and dr price were playing
at spilickins lady waldegrave was drawing
 madame latour was sitting by her alternately
stringing small pearls and laughing over
a french play edith was reading milton sir
reginald held a newspaper in his hand such
was the position the party when captain and
mrs malcolm inch orran and their daughter
were announced edith hastened to meet them
with her usual simple kindness manner
heightened by the affection she ever returned
for them and then introduced them to her guests
lady elisabeth eyed them as if she had been
shortsighted and having bowed an acknowledgment
resumed her game florinda's manners
were what is called charming in a superficial
way when she those to show off and she
was all grace ease and suavity madame
latour loved company o any kind and she
fi destiny
dosed her and went on stringing her
pearls there was something in the calmness
and mildness mrs malcolm's manner peculiarly
dignified and unaffected she appeared wholly
forgetful self and strong in the native elegant
simplicity a mind which diffused itself over
her whole bearing and deportment 
 qui etolt de tost temps et de toutes modes
 all the modifications manner which are
to be met with in society perhaps the most
generally pleasing is simplicity even as that
water is the purest which has no taste that air
the freshest which has no odour such was the
impression which mrs malcolm's manner generally
produced on all whose hearts were still alive
to the charms nature as even the most sophist
treated unconsciously feel subdued beneath the
bland influence native goodness since the
loss' her son mrs malcolm's manner had ever
retained a still more pensive chastened cast
than had formerly characterized it and her pale
brow tender and gravely sweet still wore
a look days gone by this was the first
destiny 
time she had seen sir reginald since his return
and for a moment the tide sad recollection
rushed over her heart as she thought such ashe
is might my ronald now have been but
soon the emotion died away beneath the habitual
resignation her soul the cloud passed from
her mild brow and pale cheek as she regained 
her usual serenity
mrs malcolm was neither a bigot nor zealot
but she could not avoid seeing how the day so
sacred in her estimation was disregarded and
degraded by those whom she was now among 
and her eye rested more in sorrow than in anger
dn the frivolous occupations they were engaged
in
 it is so long since i have seen you mrs
malcolm said edith surveying her with looks
 gladness that i scarcely know where to
begin with my enquiries
 it is indeed a long while since we have metj
said mrs malcolm but though i seldom go
from home now yet had i known the arrival
 lady elizabeth malcolm and lady landgrave
i should have taken an earlier opportunity
 destiny
 waiting upon them not this day certainly
for i came for a different purpose i could not
think passing your door without asking you
to accompany us to your church there is no
service in our own today and our good friend
mr stewart is to officiate in the absence 
mr mdow
i shall go with much pleasure said edith j
 and perhaps others in company may also join
the party
certainly said lady waldegrave with
one her most winning looks i shall be too
happy to be allowed to accompany you
going to church cried lady elizabeth
who being tired spilickins here joined the
conversation very proper i approve 
going to church i think it quite right absolutely
necessary for the sake example to the lower
orders the people
if it is proper for the lower orders said
mrs malcolm gently it must be equally so
for the higher
by no means replied lady elizabeth
destiny 
warmly it is quite a different thing it i very
well known that in this country the cotnnum
people do require to go to church it is different
abroad though even there they attend mass very
regularly but then you know that is soon aver
and they have a thousand innocent ways 
themselves and spending the day which the
people here have no idea they have operate
and theatres and dancing and all srts pretty
harmless amusements
 it is many years since i waa on the conti
rents said mrs malcolm in the same gentle
manner and therefore i am perhaps scarcely
entitled to speak the customs that prevail
there now but at that time i confess my feel
kings were hurt at witnessing what appeared tome
the profanation a day associated in my
mind with all that is solent and sacred
 course on going from our own country
we carry our prejudices along with us said sir
reginald and we are scandalized at seeing
our neighbours with happy eues on a day when
we have always been accustomed to measure
 destiny
our piety by the length and solemnity our
own
 ah excellent i excellent exclaimed madame
latour que ce mot solemn me fait
frksonner 
w i mrhy yes i don't think it is a good thing
to be too solemn observed lady elizabeth
with the air a solon it defeats the object
sand and in short i don't think it answers
 i am sorry i should have used a word which
has so many unpleasing ideas attached to it
said mrs malcolm sweetly but in my mind
solemnity is not necessarily associated with gloom
or melancholy there is a solemn stillness in the
air the sabbath which conveys to me ideas
 the most pleasurable kind it seems to combine
au the tamquiluty and repose the night
with the light and gladness the day
 mais pourquoi you formed dans cette contr
toute demonstration de joie enquired madame
latour
 i know nd demonstrations rational joy
that are forbidden replied mrs malcolm the
destiny 
mere excess animal spirits certainly does not
harmonize with the day given for nobler pmw
ponies but there may be and i am sure there is
much quiet heartfelt homefelt happiness on that
day i know no more pleasurable sight than
that our own poor people in their clean dresses
with cheerful though sedate faces assembling
together to hear the glad tidings which tell them
 peace and hope and love
 mais la danse et la musique par exemple
vous les regardez comme des pchs mortels
chfiz nous elles sont les demonstrations de notre
joie de notre reconnaissance de notre amour
de dieu and madame latour raised her eyes
in a pretended ecstasy devotion
where such feelings are truly produced
and bring forth corresponding fruits we should
certainly be cautious how we condemn the
means replied captain malcolm as someone
has well said virtuous action is all the real
worth intelligent being but in this land we
have no reason to expect that music and dancing
should lead to the knowledge god and
 destiny
the practice piety even splendid rites have
been found both useless and pernicious in alluding
the mind away from the doctrines and precepts
 the gospel which are addressed to the
heart and the understanding not the senses
 surely every one must allow nothing can
be more effectual in kindling devotional feeling
than fine music said sir reginald
undoubtedly replied captain malcolm
 fine music is the very luxury devotion but
it js one that is far beyond the reach the mass
 the people where could our poor highlanders
procure fine music 
 you forget die bagpipe and its accompaniment
the whisky bottle said sir reginald sarcastically

 the fiddle and the vin du pays may be
more refined modes enjoyment said captain
malcolm but refinement taste does not
necessarily imply corresponding improvement in
morals i have not indeed lived long enough
in a catholic country to be altogether a fair judge
 the practical effects the romish religion on
destiny 
the morals f the people but one thing i am
very sure that the sincere followers that religion
enjoy much less liberty spiritual and temporal
than we do were we to reckon up the
number holidays saints days fists vigils
penances prayers c c from one year's 
to e other i suspect it would be found that a
much larger portion time is devoted to relies
pious observances amongst catholics than protestants
were we therefore to annul or even
curtail our one day in seven little or nothing
would remain to remind us ofthe tie subsisting
between god and his creatures
 that is very good exclaimed lady elizabeth
 penances are to be sure shocking things
and we protestants ought as mr maloofan
says to oppose them by every means in our
powerand we ought also to set a good example
to the lower orders i shall go to church herself
today with an air dignified virtue and
if you will allow me i will take a seat in your
carriages to captain malcolm whom she had
just discovered to be a very fineeokiiig gentlemanly
man and being a great enthusiast in
 destint
beauty his looks were at ojace a passport to hex
good graces
the offer was course accepted the first
carriage drove off while the other for florida
and edith was getting ready edith had been
hurt at the slighting way in which reginald
had spoken the religious observances their
country for although she herself entered but
little into the true spirit christianity she
nevertheless possessed that reverence for its
institutions and symbols which with many
passes for religion itself
when the carriage drove up sir reginald
was on the hallsteps ready to hand lady landgrave
and edith in madame latour being a
catholic course did not accompany them
 i flattered myself you would have escorted
florinda and me to church reginald said
edith reproachfully
 you forget that i am half a catholic said
he smiling
edith gave an unconscious look affright
from him to madame latour who was standing
also on the steps reginald seemed to read what

destiny 
was passing in her mind and the careless scorn
fill smile he gave in return at once reassured
her while he added that is according to the
notions presbyterians but however if you
are not afraid after what has passed to admit
uh a reprobate within the walls your lanky
i shall join you there edith i shall take the cut
across benvarloch and be there as soon as you
is it possible then to walk to church 
enquired lady waldegrave
 quite possible for highlanders such as
reginald and i answered edith but quite
impossible i should imagine for you horinda
 what a stimulus that word impossible is
said lady waldegrave especially when one
knows it is quite possible as i am resolved to
prove how i love to overcome possible impossibilities
 come if i should fag by the way
some your good highland ferries will i am
sure take pity on me and bring me a pair 
golden patterns or some such aid as will enable
me to climb with perfect ease to the very pinnacle
 your mountain tops and in spite all
remonstrance her ladyship persisted in walking
vol ii l
 destiny
the carriage was therefore dismissed empty
and the party set out
sir reginald as a matter course offered an
arm to each his companions but lady landgrave
coldly declined and he did not repeat the
offer there was something so whimsical and
capricious in florinda's behaviour that edith
could not bithom it she had volunteered even
insisted upon taking a long walk with a person
from whom she yet would not accept the most
common act civility what could be the
meaning such mutual unvarying coldness and
even dislike 
lady waldegrave might have read what was
passing in edith's mind on her artless yet eloquent
countenance but lady waldegrave was
one those who are too much engrossed by self
to pay much attention to the thoughts and feelings
 others aimless when exacting a tribute 
admiration or adulation for a considerable
part the way the road lay through the beautiful
and extensive pleasuregrounds where everchanging
landscapes wild alpine scenery
rocks and woods knolls and dells blue lake and
destiny striding
river alternately mingled with the softer
features culture and ornament 

the pomp groves and garniture fields
presenting a constant succession grand and
lively pictures but soon to the rich picturesque
and ornamented scenery the home domain
succeeded the purple moor with its grey stones
the dreary glen the rugged mountain and the
rude torrent the day was close and warm
and sunless an unvarying grey atmosphere surrounded
them and seemed to shed a browner
horror over the lone valley and the gloomy
mountain there were none those magical
effects light and shade to enliven the dull
bosom the one or irradiate the dark brow 
the other and as has been truly said sunshine
alone fills with beauty the land mountains
and imparts to every feature a grandeur and a
grace which sinks into insipidity the riches and
the beauty the fairest champaign
it seemed as if the gloom nature had communicated
itself to the spirits those who now
traversed the solitary scenes themselves almost
 destiny
as silent lady waldegrave was pensive and
abstracted sir reginald was almost wholly
silent as if absorbed in some strong concentrated
feeling edith was surprised and mortified
at time indifference and even inattention with
which rotunda regarded the sublime scenery
around them as they climbed the steep side
 the mountain they sometimes stopped to recover
breath and on one occasion as they looked
down from the almost dizzy height on which
they stood to the dreary glen below edith
pointing to a wretched and almost imperceptible
hovel with its peatstack and its potatoes patch
said look there florinda that is a human
dwelling and do you know i am so piqued at
the indifference with which you regard our magnificent
benvarloch that i could almost wish
you were a dweller there for a season that you
might learn to look up to it with proper respect
and awe but i daresay the bare idea such a
thing has answered my purpose and made you
tremble already 
 by no means replied lady waldegrave
calmly mournful and isolated as that dwelling
destint 
appears i can conceive circumstances in which
it might be the abode happiness and delight
 under what strange circumstances could
that possibly be florinda enquired edith
smiling at the idea the delicate refined luxurious
fastidious lady waldegrave deeming it
possible to exist in such a place under any circumstances
lady waldegrave smiled too but
it was with something scorn as she answered
in a low voice but sufficiently loud for reginald
who stood a little apart to he love
might transform even that wretched hut into a
bower paradise
 and transform the seats and heather into
amaranths and roses said edith laughing
yes love has wrought greater miracles
than that replied florinda pensively
not true love said edith in a low voice
and blushing as she spoke there can be no
illusion there
it is evident you have never loved returned
lady waldegrave if the love was pure
and fervent and sincere if in short it was love
there would be no illusion in the matter and

edith's feelings were so delicate and her man
 through thee the silence the shaded glen
through thee the horror the lonely mountain
pleased me no less than the resort men
the breeze the summer wood and lucid fountain
f the purple rose white lily the lake
were sweet for thy sweet sake 
for thee the fragrant primrose dropt with dew
was wished when first it blew 
ah how completely was i in all this
myself deceiving oh the different part
that thou wert acting
the traitor in thy heart 
destiny 
news so simple that the impassioned yet sophisticated
style lady waldegrave's sentiments
brought forward too so unneeessarilystruck her
as something strange and she thought to herself
surely she has never loved or she could not
thus proclaim it she stole a glance at reginald
to see whether his feelings accorded with hers
but he had turned abruptly away as she imagined
in scorn
after standing a few minutes in silence lady
waldegrave said i find i must rest before i
can proceed here is a charming banc de gazcn
as she seated herself on one the few green
spots the mountain side covered as it was with
rock and heather afforded
we must not rest long or else we shall be
too late for church said edith
why to own the truth said lady landgrave
languidly i fear i must relinquish the
attempt getting to church i am so eitigued
i feel quite unable to proceed any further taunt
me as you will edith i am at your mersey
 i won't be so cruel as to exult over your
defeat said edith smiling but you must
 destiny
qow me ymb to remind you that i predicted
meat has come to pass without even pretending
to the second sight and now what is to be
done come begin let us hold a council
 war
 i am a bad counsellor said he coldly and
without lifting his eyes from the ground
 then if i am to be commanderinchiei i
think the best thing i can do is to dispatch you
for my pony to take florinda home
 o no no not for the world cried florinda 
 i should die fright were i to attempt to
descend this dreadful mountain on horseback
 but my pony is so safe and surefooted and
besides reginald would lead it down the hill for
you as he has often done for me
 pray don't ask me to do any thing so hazardous
said lady waldegrave pettishly
then we must all sit quietly here till you
are sufficiently rested to return hcmue said
edith at least my head can suggest no brighter
expedient
but it makes me quite wretched to think
that i should be the means keeping you from
church i know you are very desirous bang
there i heard you say so to mrs malcolm 
i should certainly have liked very well to
be at church said edith but the disappointment
is nothing don't think it
 but indeed i must i cannot bear that you
fiiiould lose any pleasure upon my account rather
than detect you i will try if possible to make
it out confute qui covte and she attempted to
rise but edith would not allow it and insists
ed that she should not stir till perfectly recovered
 but how shall i manage with mamma
resumed lady waldegrave she will be o
miserable and so fluttered if i don't appear that
she will make quite a scinde at church
if lady waldegrave will honour me will
her commands said sir reginald in a constrained
tone civility i shall be happy to bethe
bearer them
 o that will do cried edith reginald
will go to church and account for your absence
to lady elizabeth and we can return at our
leisure when you feel disposed to move
 and leave us here in tibds frightful solitude
l
 destiny
by otinelves exclaimed florinda surely
edidi you cannot be serious 
i am indeed said edith laughing unless
the mountains were to upon us i see no
other danger to apprehend i should not mind
being here quite alone
 o shocking exclaimed florinda shuddering
 then what a coward you must think me p
then what is to be done said edith
there is no human being near us to send in
either direction
 i must try to make it out myself then it
seems said florinda with a languid oppressed
air and then she attempted to rise but sunk
back as if quite unable and in a faint voice
indeed i feel it impossible without a long
rest and yet i cannot rest when i think 
the state nervous excitement mamma will be
thrown into when she misses me
there is another proposal i would make
said edith in a hesitating tone but 
but what enquired lady waldegrave
edith still hesitated as she thought the
mutual coldness and even aversion her compass

nions manifested towards each other then ia
a low voice and with a little confusion she said
c
i would offer to go to church myself only i
thought perhaps you would dislike being left
with only reginald
lady waldegrave coloured and a gleam 
pleasure shot from her eyes as she cast them
down dear edith since you are so kind so
very kind said she pressing her hand with animation
then relapsing into her former languid
tone this is no time for ceremony and i
shall not much mind it to be sure if it could
hive been otherwise arranged it would have
been better but i believe that is the only practicable
scheme even the presence an enemy
i should feel a protection in this region horror

an enemy florinda ah for shame
you surely do not consider reginald as such 
asked edith in a low voice
lady waldegrave made no reply
howl wish i sw you friends such friends
added edith blushing turning her cheek to whia
ts btny
per m florida's ear as a outer ought to
be with a brother
the caress which accompanied this avowal was
not returned but edith's own confusion rendered
her unconscious florinda's and hastily
rising she called sir reginald i am going
to walk to church and lady waldegrave trusts
herself to your protection you will see her safe
home
she had expected a remonstrance from her
lover as to her undertaking the walk alone suppositions
however was made but an expression
 deep emotion crossed his features as he
stammered out a few inaudible words aequi
essence a vague undefinable sensation passed
through edith's heart the feeling had neither
name nor substance it was a mere shapeless
shadow that fell upon her imagination and she
hastened to dispel it yet she lingered she
knew not why ere she took her departure perhaps
in the hope that reginald would yet interfere
to prevent her but he did not he followed
her a few steps as if he would have recalled her 
destiny fi
then turned abruptly round and leaning against
a piece projecting rock with his head resting
on his arm remained in deep though silent agitation

 distant
chapter xviii
florinda at length he exclaimed in a
voice emotion but lady waldegrave made
no reply
florinda he repeated in a tone deeper
rotation but still lady waldegrave remained
immovable
florinda he cried still more passionately
will you not hear me answer me 
for a few moments lady waldegrave seemed
as if struggling with her feelings then said
there was a time when i would have answered
when i did answer to that call from you that
time is past
and you now hate despise me cried he
florinda was silent

destiny d
you think me false faithless he exclaimed
with increasing vehemence i know i
know you do
lady waldegrave made no answer and there
was another pause
tell me only tell me that you acquit me
 coldblooded perfidy that you do not think
me the base heartless villain his agitation
choked his utterance
i know not what to think said lady landgrave
haughtily but i feel i degrade myself
in thus allowing you an opportunity uttering
such language nor would i have done so but
that it was necessary ere i leave this i should
see you alone you have refused the explanation
i sought by madame latour with regard
to the picture i committed to your charge you
will not you dare not as a gentleman refuse to
restore it to me when i demand it myself
sir reginald replied by opening his collar
and discovering the picture suspended round his
neck never while i live will i part from it
he cried it is my all happiness 
i will not suffer you to believe me a monster
 perfidy then softening florida ob
my knees i implore you to hear me erringt
guilty as i may be you shall acquit me at lead
 premeditated deception i have acted rashly
wildly madly but not basely 
lady waldegrave's only reply was turning
her head haughtily away 
do you then refuse to hear me asked
reginald in a voice forced composure
to what purpose should i hear you i have
already heard too much i have heard myself
insulted
 insulted oh florinda you whom i adore
worship
and have deceived interrupted lady
waldegrave emphatically
 florinda you must you shall hear me i
cried he firmly seizing both her hands in his
 you shall hear all and then condemn me if you
dsstimr ss
yriiln a thousand times i have attempted to
write to you to lay open my whole heart to you
to throw myself on your pity to implore you
to fly from me to forget me but in vain where
caul i find words to express the agonies my
soul agonies which have made it easier for me
to feign hatred than to assume indifference towards
you he paused as if to regain composure
but in a hurried agitated manner resumed
 i need not tell you that from the first moment
i beheld you at naples i loved you that
you well know from that time i lived but in
your sight i saw only you heard only you 
for weeks i lived in a dream a delirium everything
was forgotten or if remembered remembered
only with indifference or disgust and
yet sat that very time when my whole soul was
yours i confess with shame and misery unspeakable
i confess my faith was plighted to
another bear with me florinda but for a few
short minutes and cru shall hear all it was
done in the weakness and ignorance boyhood
i had mistaken friendship relationship affect
 tfeffnunt
tion for love there was my misfortune nay
evime if you will
no cried florinda while her cheek glowed
with a deeper carnation that was not yotbr
offence had you stopped there bus 
to dare to love you to tell you titan i loved
you eyes i allow that was presumption frenzy
fettered as i was but at least you will do me
die justice to acknowledge that the avowal 
my love was forced from me by circumstances
and that even tien when i poured out the feelings
 my heart before you i did not conceal
from you that an obstacle then stood in the way
 my happiness i could not bear to name it to
you but it was one i scattered myself i should
be able to remove i trusted that time and
absence would have wrought the same change in
her that had taken place in me and that the task
would be an easy one to break the ties we so
prematurely formed it has not proved so she
loves me still still ah do not scorn her affection
florinda it is i am sure such as she is
herself tender and sincere but even laid it
been less so even were it far otherwise from the
dbtuiy q
situation in which i am now placed to retreat
on my part would be infamy by the death 
her brother i am now unhappily heir to the
princely inheritance her ther all that he
has must be mine i owe him much he haa
been a father to me through life to renounce
this reliance would be worse than death to mm
it would be eternal disgrace tome that is the
only price i cannot mil not pay for you i
would have sacrificed myself a thousand times
rather than have met you again as we have now
taaet and then to part for ever 
 and she for whom you make this sacrifice
accepts it she values it perhaps the more fhr
what it costs said florinda idly
no oh no she is ignorant all
so blind yet you think she loves you 
 i am sure she does
lady waldegrave moved her head incredulously
and a slight senile scorn wreathed her
up
 you doubt florinda excluded reginald
anxiously regarding her she was silent
 tell me cried he still more earnestly
b destiny
have you any reason to believe to suspect 
that edith he stopped in extreme perturbation

f loves you as a brother a friend as a companion
a playfellow a cousin in all these rear
tons i do believe you are loved
for a moment whether from vanity or surprise
sir reginald looked almost displeased
but in another instant his eyes sparkled with
renewed fires
u it should be so i he exclaimed eagerly
aid yet and yet from her own lips i had
the avowal timid and sensitive as she is she
gave me the spontaneous assurance her love
ah florinda even she dared to say more than
ever you have said 
unjust ungenerous said lady landgrave
crimsoning as she cast her eyes on the
ground
florinda dearest forgive me but were it
as you suppose you might yet be mine and
again he pressed her hand to his ups and a long
silence ensued each seemed as though they
feared to break the spell which blinded their
destiny sed
hearts and senses to the selfdelusions which
all unregulated minds and selfish spirits so
passionately love to indulge
suddenly a dark shadow fell upon them and
looking up they perceived with what feelings
may be imagined the huge person mr m
dow actually bending over them with outstretched
neck and eyes and mouth open to their
utmost extent amailye hanging by the bridle
on his arm sir reginald's eyes flashed fire
and he cast a glance at the intruder which fora
moment caused even his obtuse nature to
quail and he instinctively retreated a few steps
while he said affecting great delicacy speech
 i hope i have not been guilty any intrusion
 if i hadn't met miss edith who told me
what has happened i would really have taken
this for a courtingscene hoch hoch ho then
losing his bodily fears he advanced and seating
himself almost close to lady waldegrave he
took off his hat pulled his pockethandkerchief
out it and began to wipe his forehead while
amailye cropped the sweet mountain herbage
florinda instantly rose and with her cheeks
 dsstiht
in a glow said i am now sufficiently replied
sr reginald to be able to retom and with a
slight bend the head to mr m'dow she walker
ed away
reginald consciencestricken and rialiniiisn
ed not daring to offer her us aim accompanied
her in silence bnt they had not proceeded
many steps before mr m'dow was thundering
after them and pushing forward said as he
extended one his great elbows amailye
hanging on the other morrow which
will take me to glasgow the same evening and
now i hope you'll allow sir reginald that
this is an extreme case only conceive if any
mischance had come oyer the boat and i in it
what a dreadful situation for the lady what an
awful predicament for a person feeling and
refinement 
to this dread anticipation no answer was returned
and the party proceeded mr mdow
expatiating on the advantages and disadvantages
 steamboats their cheapness and facility their
dangers and disagreeableness till sir reginald
destiny 
impatiently interrupted him by saying this
road sir is ill calculated for so many persons 
i would recommend you to move forward
the road is a little narrow to be sure returned
mr mdow but i can fall back a step
or two and at the same time enjoy the advantages
 the good company i have been so fortunate
as to fall in with besides its rather steep
for my beast who's not just so surefooted as she
has been and so i prefer walking not that tm
just so encumbered as the poor highland postman
who said he could not get on because he
was sair tangled with a horse hoch ho ho 
but the hills only echoed mr m'dow's laugh
as he met with no interruption from either 
his companions sir reginald was chafing in
fiery silence and lady waldegrave's bonnet
concealed her face butstill bent on making
himself agreeable he pushed close up to lady
waldegrave again offering his arm your
ladyship appears much fatigued had you not
better accept additional help a cold and
haughty bow was the only answer vouchsafed
nothing daunted mr mdow went on we
 destiny
haye not here the conveniences that you have in
foreign parts he continued pm told they
carry the ladies over the mountains in sedanchairs
and that puts me in mind what happened
to a countrywoman ours sir reginald when he
first went to edinburgh he had been invited to
a fine party and he thought he would treat himself
with a chair for gentility's sake but lo and
behold the chair wanted the bottom the chairmen
were in a hurry and away they trotted rip
one street and down another the poor gentleman's
body in the chair and his feet racing away
through the dirt quo he an twere for the
honour o the thing troth i wad hae preferred
plain walking hoch hoch ho in this manner
mr mdow went on beguiling as he thought
the weariness the way to his companions
whose silence he attributed solely to fatigue
there was no shaking os the minister as
i
there was a near cut to auchnahashnish through
glenroy grounds he kept in close contact till
within a short distance the castle when with
many regrets aendapologies at not being able to
pay his respects to his worthy patron he made
destiny 
his parting speech well st reginald i
hope you'll soon give me an opportunity doing
as i am going to be done by and no doubt my
lady i shall have the pleasure seeing you
officiating as best maid on the occasion then
mounting his amailye he rode ojbt
intolerable as his presence had been his absence
was scarcely less supportable in the present
state the parties and his departure was
followed by a silence it was not till they had
almost reached the house that reginald was
impelled to break it when in an agitated voice
and manner he said florida i have still
much to say you must hear me you must dome
justice i cannot live under the sense 
your displeasure your contempt he added
as she withdrew her arm from his saying coldly
 excuse me i am too much fatigued to resume
a subject which had perhaps better never have
been revived
 i am sick life he exclaimed passionately
 do not then drive me to desperation 
promise me at least that you will again hear
me
 destiny
perhaps another time not now said
lady waldegrave as they entered the house 
and she hastily quitted him aware that she had
left him in a state mind which would not
allow mm to rest till he was again at her feet

chapter xix
lady elizabeth's natural anxieties might
possibly have been suppressed at the opera but
were not to be restrained at church and after
having for some time disturbed the devotions 
the congregation by her fidgeting and whispering
she at length left the church accompanied
by edith who was obliged to order the carriage
and return home eth her on arriving there
they learnt that the object all this solicitude
had gone to her own apartment much'faitigued
and thither her ladyship repaired while edith
obeyed a summons to her ther she found the
chief seated in his gouty chair wia no very
benign aspect benbowie slumbering beside
him and mrs maeauley fronting them with a
seriouslooking in her hand
this is a pretty way pm treated was his
salutation to edith i've sent at least ten times

this last hour for reginald or you and it seems
it's only now you think it worth while to come 
i don't believe there's one my own hounds
that's neglected in the manner i am where's
your cousin where's reginald i ash where
is he edith who had seen her ther just
before going to church hastened to expel
matters but the explanation was received with
high disdain
you've been all very ill employed in wandering
after preachers and leaving jne here with
no other company than these two creatures
pointing to benbowie and mrs macauley the
one squirting tobacco in my ce all day the
other leaving me with her impertinent trash 
sermons
o now glenroy how can you speak that
way when you know the only sermon i've read
to you today is that beautiful discourse on meekness
by 
 and what the plague have i to do with discourses
on meekness stamping with his crutch
as he spoke
 that s true every true on my conscience
said benbowie roused by the stroke the cratch
meekness rejoined glenroy hake a
pretty like thing to be sure for a highland
chief he would cut a pretty figure with meekness
indeed meekness meekness meanness

 ah glenroy for all that i wish i saw yon
clothed in meekness sighed mramacauley

whom spoke daggers to diis conscience
dinner had been announced some time before
lady elizabeth made her appearance which she
at last did in her morning dress and with visible
marks business and bustle in her department
 excuse me my dear child said she to
edith for coming to dinner en dishabille but
since i saw you i have been so hurried i really
scarcely know what i am about florinda 
who by the by begs that you will excuse
her appearing at dinner as she still feels rather
abauuf from the wretched walk she had but
dr price assures me a little rest is all that is

necessary has had an express from the duchess
 porchester who it seems is come with the
duke to his shootingbox entreating us to goto
her immediately florinda begged i would
show her note to you that you may see how
destiny 
impossible it is to refuses there are no secrets
in it i shall read it aloud

to have you here do oblige me and come
immediately i have a rery particular reason for
wishing you to be here before the th i cannot
express how much you will gratify me by coming
we have a perfect host your adorers here and
now that they are tired shooting grouse ifeftr
they will take to shooting themselves unless you
come to us and then perhaps they will only
shoot one another i know you will come dearest
dear lady waldegrave and oblige your affectionate

and aflame latour and aunear and dear to
you i enclose a billet to sir reginald although
i suppose if report speaks truth i need scarcity
hope he will leave us jtanceent ivy should
not she some too tell miss malcolm thidwia
allfaorts proper ipeecheaimihe occasion 
 ah ha sir reginald thereby hangs a tale
which we must have someday cried lady 
lambeth forgetting in theekhilraticm her
spirits all previous antipathies felt and expressed
 thales just as it should be gracing from him
to edith but i understand nodding her head
 i shall keep your secret though you scarcely
deserve it for having kept it so well yourselves
ha ha ha but in the meantime it is very sad
addressing edith with an air childish delight
quite at variance with her words to be obliged
to leave you so soon when we were all s happy
destiny 
and comfortable but those things are imavoicu
able florinda really never has been in splits
since we came here and my own health suffered
a good deal in short i think we shall all bethe
better a change at the same time i
think i did right in coming here i feel more
comfortable at having seen poor olenroy and i
flatter myself i haye done him a little good i
sandal i could to raise his spirits poor man and
i think i succeeded i and apropos i believe i
most endeavour to see jim again before i go
just to bid him good bye we must hope however
to meet in town by and by i think i
have half persuaded olenroy bring you there
next winter indeed i am sure lie wills but perhaps
yeu wills with us tokinmore why should
notyouinydear you will be muckle better 
alitllegaietyyou are too much moped heres
apropos sir reginald i hope florinda sent you
the note that came entered for you from the
duchess
sir reginald merely bait his head in acknowledgments
as he advanced and offered us arm
to conduct her ladyship to dinner whileshe continued
chattering all the way along
 destiny
they were seated before madame latour
joined them and when she did her spirits seemed
bo less excited than lady elizabeth's at the prospect
 exchanging glenroy for gilmore lead
both were so talkative during dinner that th
silence the rest the company was as muciha
matter necessity as choice lady elizabeth
talked the anticipated pleasures icinmor
 the charming duchess and her brother ibid
warrington who was dying for love florinda
and for whom she thought florinda had a sort pf
a nuance preference and she appealed to six
reginald who sat pale and frowning as if
scarcely able to endure the nonsense she uttered
 tm sure miss edith you may be thankful
you are not a great heiress said the simpleminded
mrs macauley for you may be sure
you will be married for true love and for nothing
else
 o unquestionably cried lady elizabeth 
 my daughter's rank and fortune together with
her beauty and talents render her beyond comparison
the most rechercm person in the world
she win be sadly teazed poor love amongst
destiny 
such a cromrd adorers as the duchess calls
diem sir reginald here rose and rang the bell
violently then when the summons was answered
seemed at a loss what to ask for edith
gazed on him with surprise and fear and again a
strange wild suspicion flashed upon her as she
encountered the malignant smile madame
latour and now let us arrange something
about our journey tomorrow we must start
early by twelve if possible that won't be
too early for me dr price you will arrange
every shinar for me as usual you know and
sir reginald i hope we s j have your company
 or if you would prefer it perhaps holinda
will give you a seat in her carriage don't
you think so madame latour 
but sir reginald had caught edith's eye fixed
upon him with an expression the most intense
anxiety and before madame latour could reply
he made a strong effort at regaining his
composure and with the tone and manner 
suppressed agitation he hastily said i regret
i cannot have that honour i am otherwise engaged
and as be spoke he became very pale
 destiny
 ah engaged cried her ladyship who
when in good humour iras always in high spirits
 that is a rery significant word and we must
find out the meaning it come my dear
taking edith's arm you can perhaps tell me
the nature sir reginald's eiagnent 
what a very pretty blush she whispered as
they were leaving the room madame latour
don't you think edith blushes uncommonly
well 
 mais oui replied madame latour je
vaudois que miss malcomb put donner un peu
de ses belles couleurs au pauvre sir reginaal
il est si pale i u a fair vat you call unapee
 by the by now that you mentioait i think
he does look a lite paler and things and more
grave than he used to do said lady elizabeth 
 but i have observed that some men do look rather
grave when they are going to bemarried
 sir reginaal married exclaimed madame
latour in real or affected astonishment c'est
ne pas possible ii me semble mouranmou
rant de chagrinde desespoir de non
non je ne le crois pas meess maloomb assuredestiny

ment ce n'est pas vrai vous ne le croyez pas 
and madame latour fixed her eyes on edith
who trembling as she was with emotion despised
her too much to betray it
come come cried lady elizabeth we
hare said quite enough on that subject then
putting her arm within edith's and drawing hera
little aside vyes tis as i hinted before she
certainly had a design in that quarter show very
absurd poor woman that she cannot conceal
her disappointment how any one can admire
her eyes and do you observe how frightfully
her head is dressed today and now my dear
come to my dressingroom and let me hear all
about this marriage yours that you have kept
such a profound secret
oa entering the dressingroom such a tumultuous
greeting took place between the dogs
and their mistress that edith was spared the
embarrassment a reply
 we shall be quiet here continued lady 
elizabeth throwing herself into a chaise hnffue
while the dogs continued to bark and cough
out their welcome quiet is absolutely necesse
destiny
say to me in my delicate state health you
will find a seat somewhere my dear easting
her eyes around on the various chairs which
were covered with dresses hats and caps rosale
she called to her maid in the inner apartment
 otez ces bursts et ce manteau et advances
une chaise pour mademoiselle now my dear
never mind her she don't understand a word 
english but apropos ring the bell first i must
ieak to rousseau about putting new strings to
my guitar before we go well and so you were
telling me i forget how it was you and sir
reginald first became acquainted is not that a
knock at the door how tiresome see who it
is my dear oh dr price is that you come
in i must beg you will see the housekeeper
yourself about the refreshments we shall require
in the carriage you know how little i eat but
i find variety absolutely necessary for me in
fajctj my dear the stomach requires to be amused
as well as the mind turning to edith and
that is a secret worth knowing but the secret
was lost on edith who had taken the opportunity
 doctor price's entrance to make her
exit

chapter xx
without a general knowledge human
nature the particular study an individual is
 little use in enabling us to draw accurate
conclusions as to the effect events may produce
on the mind for as some one has truly said
there is nothing so inconsistent as consistency
edith thought she knew her father sufficiently
to be certain he would rejoice at hearing the
approaching departure his lady and she therefore
hastened to his apartment to communicate
the pleasing intelligence but to her utter surprise
it was received with every symptom 
dissatisfaction and displeasure
going away tomorrow he repeated at
least halfadozen times that is the most
extraordinary thing i ever met with in the whole
 destiny
course my life i can scarcely say i have
seen far the mother yet and the other one
the daughter i've never once set eyes upon
and i don't so much as know yet what brought
them here at all what's taking them away in
such a hurry the duchess nonsense what
do i care for the duchess porchester they
did not come here to visit her but to see me 
and if s quite inconceivable to me what's taking
them away i can't make it out there's something
i don't understand in it there's something
not right there's something quite wrong they
must have been ill used since they came to the
house or they would not be leaving it so soon
how has that simpleton molly macauley been
behaving herself that creature really has not
the sense a sparrow to go away too at the
very time your marriage ring the bell i
shall have this cleared up they shall not leave
this house till i know the reason such behaviour
 what's keeping that fellow duncan 
ring again i want him to help me to dress for
i'm coming to the drawingroom i must know
the meaning this so go away now and don't
destiny 
let me hear any your nonsense i shall go
stamping his crutch if i should go on the
crown my head
and edith knowing how vain expostulation
was withdrew trembling at the thoughts another
scene between the chief and his lady and
anticipating an abrupt disclosure her approaching
marriage she next sought florinda 
but she was denied admittance to her on die
plea her ladyship's headach being so bad she
was unable to see any one save madame latour
who was as usual closeted with her she then
repaired to lady elizabeth to acquaint her
with what had passed with her ther and to
try if possible to prevail upon her to gratify
him if he should be very pressing with them to
remain a little longer at glenroy but her
ladyship was busy directing and superintending
the movements her attendants in packing the
variety litter which still lay scattered around
such as dresses jewels music writing and drawing
implements french novels drugs c c
she therefore scarcely listened to her and only
 destiny
answered the invitation she gave in her father's
name for a longer stay by a quick and peremptory
refusal or a slight acquiescence as to meeting
him in the drawingroom vexed and perplexed
poor edith knew not where to turn 
there was no one near to whom she could speak
 the untoward aspect affairs still less to
whom she could imply for advice and assistance
to reginald who had once used to be her confidante
and counsellor she now felt an unaccountable
reluctance to have recourse an invisible
but impassable barrier seemed to have been
raised between them but by whom she could
not tell it was something she felt but could
neither describe nor comprehend such was the
tenor her thoughts as she sat alone in the 
her head resting on her hand and the
tears unconsciously dropping from her eyes when
the door opened and the object her meditations
entered with an air dejection and gloom
he gazed on her for some moments but said
nothing edith could not speak but her tears
fell faster reginald sighed but it was a sigh
that breathed more discontent and displeasure
destiny 
than sympathy or sorrow he remained for
some time as if struggling with his emotion
then in an agitated voice he said edith you
appear to be unhappy 
edith struggled against her feelings and with
a melancholy smile replied only sorrowful
and why sorrowful demanded sir reginald
 after what has passed i did not expect
 i flattered myself i if there is any
causes
sighed and in spite her efforts to
restrain them tears continued to drop from her
eyes
for heaven's sake edith tell me i conjure
you as you value my peace as you value
your own tell me the cause your tears 
your sorrow 
i cannot tell said edith with emotion i
scarcely know myself but strange vague undefined
but very painful feelings take possession
 me
you did not use to be fencifiil or vapourish
said reginald looking earnestly at her
nor am i now said edith more firmly 
vox n
 destiny
bat she stopped and her voice quivered
 we speak a strange language to each other
naw reginald it was not thus we were wont
to talk in former times
 and whose felt is that edith he asked
ahmpdy as he stooped to caress his dog to hide
his confusion
not mine replied she faintly
sir reginald raised his head but his eyes
were still fixed on his dog while he said in a
quick hurried manner yet after what passed
today a few hours ago in your fiithers presence
it seems somewhat strange that i should
find you thus apparently wretched
 ah reginald you did not use to speak thus
hardly to me said edith reproachfully as she
strove to dispel her tears
i did not use to see you look as if you were
going to be sacrificed he replied with increasing
harshness manner
you know it is not so said edith tenderly
and she blushed as she said it
reginald made no reply edith gathered
courage and went on but were i to judge
destiny 
thus you what might i not think what ought
i not to think 
reginald's colour rose and for a few seconds
he seemed as if at a loss how to reply he then
said course i might have expected that
accusation would be answered by recrimination 
had i complained your spirits being too high
you would to a certainty have replied that twas
because mine were so boisterous tis the way
not with all but with a great part your sex
edith
edith's heart swelled at this taunt but she
made an effort to repress her feelings and with
tolerable calmness said if i am the foolish
unreasonable creature you represent me tq be
you cannot wish her voice sidled her but she
added in a faltering accent we had better
part
this was the very point to which her faithless
lover had unconsciously to himself been aiming
to bring her that the odium the quarrel might
rest upon her but though blinded by selfish
passion he was not so lost to every generous
feeling as not to be smote with a sense hi own
injustice and cruelty passion and conscience
 destiny
struggled in his breast and averse to yield
entirely to either he sought to compromise
between them
 edith he said with emotion your happiness
is dear to me as my own if it is to be
attained by my relinquishing my right to your
affections edith is it so speak to me i
implore you and he grasped her hand and
gazed intensely on her face on which deep
blushes and deathly paleness alternately succeeded
each other
 tell me cried reginald with increasing
vehemence what it is you wish what you
would have me do and you shall be gratified
even at the expense my own happiness more
i cannot say and he dropt the hand he held
i have no wish reginald said edith
faintly but to see you such as you were informer
happy days
that can never be interrupted he impatiently
 i have told you i am changed i
have known suffering and anguishd 
can never be as i have been k that is a crime
in your eyes then i am most culpable
jio reginald you wrong me cried edith
destiny 
in tender emotion perhaps i wrong you t
yet strange doubts will arise in spite all t
she stopped in extreme agitation without daw
ring to raise her eyes to reginald who remained
silent and evidently not less embarrassed that
herself the wishedfor yet dreaded eclaircisse
ment seemed now on the point taking place
and he feared alike to aid or impede it edith
alone should be the destroyer her own happiness
she might wrest from him the secret 
his heart she might tear aside the veil in which
he had sought to shroud the image he adored 
she might rush into the sanctuary his inmost
thoughts after he had warned her that there was
a point at which she must stop but never no
never should his lips breathe that name to her
never should his be the hand to rend away her
delusion where then was the injustice he
should be guilty who then could dare to
say he had wronged her such was the sophistry
with which the slave passion strove to silence
s destiny
the mall still roioe conscience while he hung
in agobflsiiig suspense on the word that should
next issue from edith's lips as that wii was
to seal both their dooms but the stroke was yet
averted both were roused from this state 
nrnte but faighwrought feeling by the bustle
which invariably attended glenroy's approach
and presently the chief entered leaning on his
servant and shuffling along with great difficulty
attended by mrs macauley and benbowie in
the agitation her spirits edith felt unable to
stand the scrutiny even such common observers
as these and she was hastily retreating
wln recalled in an authoritative voice by glenroy
who never could bear to see any body leave
the room while he was in it
what's the meaning this cried he in
his loudest key going out the room just
at the moment i'm coming into it is that a
proper behaviour i really think you ought to
be ashamed yourself edith is that the way
you welcome your old father to the use his
feet
o papa said edith taking his hand how
can you doubt

 how can i doubt what am i to doubt
interrupted glenroy peevishly i'm for none

nere see or hear doubts for i despise tikam

will doubt for i hate all doubtful characters so

his stick
 well but glenroy as sure as death i'm
not speaking

 your tongue never lies but i'm for no
speaking at present so hold your tongue and
order the coffee and go and see what s keeping
lady elizabeth and the rest them i'm waiting

d destiny
suffer either my own character or the character
 my houses to be aspersed however i shall
have it all cleared up before this night is oyer
and unless they choose to stay to your manage

 i beg i i entreat glenroy i stammered
reginald violently agitated

stances that it never occurred to her to dissemble
or give it any false glosses to serve a
temporary purpose but she always spoke it with
a sympathy and tenderness which usually dis
turned it its bitterest sting but it was not
from the fiery unregulated mind sir reginald
that any truth however gently told which reproached
his conscience and opposed his wishes
could meet with a submissive reception cautious
and considerate as mrs malcolm had been
in her communications he was stung to the soul
by selfreproach sid gave way to the most
restinir 
vehement expressions anguish and despair
he had been he said the destroyer one
who was dear to him as his own life he called
heaven to witness there was no sacrifice he was
not ready to make for her happiness she had
suffered much for her sake he would suffer all
any thing every thing to see her restored 
he would see her himself she would explain
every thing his happiness was in her hands
he never could know peace until he saw her
well and happy and for the moment he was
sincere but mrs malcolm feared little for the
passionate overflows that grief excessive as
it was which could thus vent itself in outward
manifestations it was the silence poor edith's
overcharged heart which alarmed her but she
strove by mild and gentle words to soothe sir
reginald into composure and at last succeeded
in restoring him to a comparative degree 
calmness
the surgeon soon after arrived but as he possessed
no more than onion penetration and
in the course his practice was little accustomed
to minister to minds diseased he saw nothing
 destiny
more than a mere nervous panic in the case haying
therefore administered an iate and remained
till it took effect he recommended the
patient to be kept perfectly quiet and said he
had no doubt but that he should find all well
when he returned the following day this was
a load off reginald's heart and his buoyant
spirit soon rose in proportion to its previous
depression edith he was sure would soon surmount
the shock she had sustained by his abrupt
disclosure her sentiments would change and
all would yet be well on hearing so favourable
a report lady waldegrave prepared for
setting off to join her mother for although messengers
had been dispatched both to her and
glenroy to acquaint them with the safety 
the party it was not to be supposed she would
rest satisfied with that or that any other assurance
short actually seeing her daughter
would quiet her natural fears
florinda said she would have preferred remaining
where she was but that she knew lady
elizabeth would not proceed without her and
that she could not bear the thought bringing
destiny 
so large a party at such a time to a house where
quiet was enjoined this seemed only what 
was considerate and reasonable and mr and
mrs malcolm forbore to urge the invitation
which their hospitality rather than their inclination
had led them to make they therefore
followed that admirable precept welcome
the coming speed the parting guest and ordered
their horses to be got ready to carry
the travellers forward on their journey
 although it is only a few miles from this
to the ferry said captain malcolm addressing
lady waldegrave yet as the road in some
places borders rather too much on the sublime
i hope you will allow me faute de mieux to
escort you so far that i may consign you into
lady elizabeth's hands past all peril by land
as well as by water i trust
before morinda could reply reginald hastily
interposed and said pardon me captain
malcolm but i undertook the office conducting
lady waldegrave to her friends and
therefore consider myself bound to see her safe
under lady elizabeth's care
 dcstinr
 it was an important trust that was committed
to you i admit but may you not delegate
your authority to another and appoint me your
proxy said captain malcolm who supposed
sir reginald must be doing the greatest violence
to his feelings in quitting edith at such a time
even for a few hours what do you say
lady waldegrave don't you think a staid old
highlander may be as safe an escort as a hotbrained
young lover who 
 i have already said cried reginald with a
heightened colour and in great embarrassment
that i must see lady waldegrave to the ferry
myself the distance is short and i shall find
my own horses there or most likely i shall take
the boat in returning at all events i shall be
back here certainly within a few hours and in
that time he stopt in emotion
 and in that time said captain malcolm
kindly our dear charge will i trust have a
refreshing sleep and that on your return you
will find her perfectly restored i give you
credit sir reginald in thus sacrificing your
own feelings to your sense duty
destiny 
reginald turned hastily away florinda slightly
blushed while she answered that she hoped
sir reginald would not think it necessary
to make any sacrifice on her account and she
pronounced the word with emphasis
at that moment the carriage was announced
and madame latour having composed her spirits
changed her dress repaired her charms and
partaken plentifully some refreshments now
made her appearance mrs malcolm who had
been with edith also entered to receive the
adieus the guests she was struck at first
with hearing sir reginald's intention accompanying
the party so far on their way but
like her husband she gave him credit for his
sense duty thus prevailing over his dearer
interests especially when she read the struggle
 his mind depicted on his countenance nor
did this evince any want common penetration
who can look back upon events in their own
life without acknowledging that there were times
when they could not discern those things ace td
face which viewed retrospectively showed clear
as noonday

chapter xxiv
edith slept but her sleep was short and she
awoke from it slowly and heavily her head
confused her heart oppressed with a dreamy
sense ills too dreadful to be endured a stunning
sense misery occasionally roused to an
guise as long cherished thoughts happiness
struggled with new and agonizing feelings 
misery at leng she put aside the curtain
and gazed around with a bewildered and enquiring
look mrs malcolm who had been sitting
anxiously watching her now approached and
in a tender yet cheerful tone accosted her but
edith at first only replied by a look alarm and
amazement then in a hurried manner asked
 where am i 
with me my love and you have been
asleep
destiny 

then i have dreamt she cried quickly 
then wildly clasping her hands and oh 
what a dream it was i would not tell it to anyone
 no not for worlds 
 try not to think it either said mrs
malcolm soothingly but close your eyes
and pray to god edith love
and yet if it was a dream interrupted
edith why am i here and where is 
and her eyes wandered round the room then
sinking back on her pillow she sighed and said
but it does not signify since you say it was
only a dream
she remained silent for some minutes and
mrs malcolm hoped she had again fallen asleep 
but quickly raising herself in bed she said in a
hurried tone i must get up that dream
haunts me here it is upon my pillow it is in
my head it is upon my heart i must get away
from it
 dearest edith you shall do as you please
said her kind considerate friend but will you
not oblige me by remaining in bed for a little
longer and i will sit by you 
 destiny
but if it were a dream why why do i see
nobody else where are they she demanded
in a tone forced unnatural calmness
those you love best are all safe and well
 love exclaimed she how should you
know no one knows how love she knows
it not himself and her breast heaved with
strong emotion
 yes dear edith there is one who knows
you love him but perhaps you know not how
much he loves you and how wretched he is
about you
about me shrieked edith oh no no
not about me and her whole frame shook
convulsively
 yes dearest even about you and about no
one else but there is some misunderstanding 
do you think me mad cried edith quickly
interrupting her if you do you are much
very much mistaken then shaking her head
mournfully but if you knew what i know if
you had seen what i saw if you felt what i feel
but nobody shall ever know it shall all be
buried with me and there will be an it
destiny 
mrs malcolm saw that her feelings had sustained
some rude shock somehow connected
with reginald and she feared to name him iii
the present excited state her mind she therefore
tried another chord a chord which rightly
touched can never fsdl to vibrate in the feeling
heart
yes my love when it is god's will we shall
all die and be buried and there will indeed
be an our earthly sorrows but i trust
he will spare you to us yet a while for what
would become your father your old repaired
father edith if he should lose you his
only child 
edith's heart heaved high and for a few moments
she struggled violently with her feelings 
at last nature prevailed she burst into a passionate
flood tears and throwing her arms
round her friend's neck wept long in silent
anguish
mrs malcolm made no attempt to check the
genial current feeling for she knew that the
grief which can feel even despair is never so
 destiny
dangerous as that which benumbs the spirits and
bereaves it even the sense feeling and
fragile as is the mould the human heart tis
one which may be bruised but is rarely broken
by the first rude shock it sustains chi the depth
 that agony which some may feel and live oh
the world woe which may lie in the small
compass one solitary heart i who can declare
 all which may be borne and never told 
it was not by confiding the secret her sorrow
that edith felt she could lessen the burden
 it no human voice could speak comfort to
her soul no lilian hand could wipe away her
tears no human thought could fathmmlthe depth
 her anguish no word hers therefore
should ever declare the wrongs she had endured
all she wished was to die and as she laid her
head on her pillow it was with the look one
who desired never to raise it again
although the sense this suffering lay deeper
than she could discern mrs malcolm deemed it
unwise to endeavour too hastily to penetrate toit
and she rather sought gradually to lead edith
to the disclosure it herself a long interval
destiny 
passed during which edith remained wholly
absorbed in the anguish her own spirit
 is there no way in which a fond and faithful
friend can help you dearest edith said her
friend gently
 none answered edith in a voice so sad
and a tone so deep as seemed to bar all attempts
at gaining her confidence
not even by sharing your sorrow my love 
you cannot returned edith in the same
despairing accent
but there is one who may one to whom
you are still dearsone who has suffered much
on your account she stopped for she saw
edith's pale features convulsed with agony
 edith dearest is there nothing i ccm do
for you cried her friend as her own tears fell
on the cold trembling hand she held in hers
 nothing said edith in the deep tone 
hopeless misery as she turned away
 yet dearest together we may thank god
that your senses are restored to you together
we may pray that he will lighten this load 
anguish from your heart together we may ask
 destiny
 him that his peace may cain your troubled
spirit
it cannot be murmured edith in a low
suffocated voice
mrs malcolm was shocked but she said in a
soothing tone strive against such unworthy
such unholy thoughts edith and though you
will not confide your grief to me remember it
is known to him who doubtless for some wise
purpose has appointed this trial whatever it is
believe dear edith only believe that you are
in the hands a tender father an almighty
protector who can turn even our sorrows into
blessings i do not ask you not to weep but i
pray you may not yield to despair
edith made no reply but she stiffened her
hand to be held in those her friend while they
were raised in supplication for her and gradually
her features relaxed into a softer expression
 anguish the convulsive leavings her
breast subsided her tears again flowed freely and
her judicious friend tenderly embracing her
left her for a little as she hoped to the repose
 exhausted nature

chapter xxv
it is a common remark that few things exercise
a more baneful and despotic influence on
the mind and feelings than an irregular or misplaced
attachment and sir reginald formed no
exception to this general rule shrinking from
the contemplation the torture he had inflicted
on the true and tender heart which had so long
and devotedly been his he sought to stifle the
sense her wrongs in the charms lady
waldegrave's society it would have been
agony to his selfish fiery spirit to have waited
and watched the slow progress her recovery
from the wound his own hand had inflicted for
to suffer and be still is perhaps one the
hardest lessons the proud heart man can stoop
to learn he therefore strove by more active
 destiny
exertion to banish the distracting thoughts that
filled his mind and sought a temporary refuge 
from the upbraiding his conscience in the
flattering unction that he was doing his duty's
even while deserting the victim his perfidy
for the author her ruin all this may appe
inconsistent with a nature hitherto represented
as amiable and generous but there is a virtues
and a generosity whose roots are in selfishness
and which when brought to the test will ever
bear its worthless fruits neither can consistency 
dwell in that heart whose only law is impulse
whose only stimulant is selfgratification
the presence madame latour was some
restraint upon the passionate overflow his
feelings much as he longed to lay open his
whole heart to florinda he naturally shrunk 
from displaying it to any other eye than that
f love enough however passed on both
sides to satisfy themselves that they were mutually
beloved and for the present that consciousness
sufficed on reaching their destined
tion they found lady elizabeth in all the fidgetiness
 anxiety and impatience and a foolish
destiny 
scene rf weeping chiding exclaiming caresses
ing ensued it required a strong effort for sir
reginald to tear himself away at the very time
when florinda seemed more his own than ever
she had been when his love for her burst the
barrier that had hitherto suppressed it and without
explanation all had been explained for all
was understood and forgiven fain woiild he
have lingered and fetter still would he have
accompanied her on her way and guarded her
from the host rivals that would soon surround
her but having consigned her to the care 
her mother and ieen both depart under the
guidance the duke's servants he had no
tant though anxious heart he returned to inch
orran
glenroy's impatience all this while knew no
bounds captain malcolm had gone in person
to relieve his anxiety and to inform him without
entering into particulars that as edith had
been so much alarmed there was a necessity for
her remaining quietly where she was for the
present the chief acquiesced when assured

captain malcolm perceived his embarrassment
and dissatisfaction which he imputed to a
different cause and he said his is indeed
hurd work for you sir reginald to be fain
called upon to sacrifice your own wishes to a
siise duty but you may now do it with an
easier mind miss malcolm though very low
it seems is now restored to herself and i trust
wtu soon be to you in the meantime quiet is
still necessary and as you are not likely to promote
that in the present state your feelings
i must therefore be so disinterested as to recommend
your returning to poor glenroy
 i cannon's said reginald impatiently
 it is no very pleasant task i have taken upon
myself to press you to leave my house said his
friend good humoured but i know i need
not apologize to you for such a breach hospitality

 i am sensible your good intentions said
reginald in a qiuck impatient manner bat
you will oblige me by allowing me to judge and
act for myself on this occasion i in short
he stopped as ifat a loss how to proceed tiieii

added but if my remaining here occasions
any inconvenience i shall endeavour to find
accommodation for the night elsewhere
there was no contesting the point any longer
he remained and the night was passed in a state
 gloomy restlessness by him sleepless anguish
by edith griefs differing in kind as in
degree for even amid the reproaches conscience
and the struggles remorse as gratitude
tenderness and pity filed bis heart still
the idol passion had erected maintained its
sway and in his imagination shone forth feir and
beauteous even amid the wreck it had made
but with edith all was dimness and desolation
no star shed its light in her path in her existence
there was no object which even hope could
for an instant lime amid the darkness that
brooded in her heart heaven and earth the present
and the future were alike an undistinguishable
chaos and only one dreary hope was hers 
the hope despair she felt it was impossible
she could long exist under such a weight woe
as had overwhelmed her soon very soon she
should pass away and be at rest but she knew
destiny 
not the capacity the human heart for suffering
shcvknew not those depths profound where
sorrow unseen unsuspected dwells through
many a long life nous ne connoisseur infini
que par la douleur all the faith her
early days the cherished feelings a lifetime
 all the fond gatherings up woman's
love and tenderness which she had deemed
were treasured in her lover's heart had been
rudely cast from him as slighted priceless
things and for an instant her pale cheek glowed
at the indignity but bitter as these feelings
were they were rendered still more so by
the thoughts the disappointment and sorrow
that awaited her father all his proud imaginations
to be thus cast down his hopes laid in
the dust where his own grey head would soon
be brought low by the hands which ought to
have smoothed the pillow his old age and
yet it must be nought remained for her but
to sever the last feeble link those ties which
entwined as they were with every feeling her
heart hung only as a galling yoke on the breast

faced there with the vow eternal constancy
and which like a talisman had ever guarded her
heart against all fears and suspicions his fidelity
even this inanimate object associated as
it was with all the hopes and the joys her life
it was anguish unspeakable to part with her
heart recoiled from the deed and again and
again she relinquished the attempt but then the
thought that reginald might for an instant suppose
she still retained her claim upon his hand
even when convinced that his affections were
given to another that was not to be endured 
she hastily folded and sealed the ring in a small
packet and when mrs malcolm at an early hour
entered her apartment she put it into her hand
and with forced composure requested that she
would convey it to its destination
mrs malcolm was not deceived by this assumed
fortitude she saw it was the result excitement
not resignation it was easy to guess
at the contents the packet and she said i
dstikt 
ijrffl do any thmgtany thing for you my love
that can be for your good but must this be 
 it must replied edith still retaining her
composure
 may there not be some mistake ivrhich a
mutual friend might assist you in clearing up
iiarest edith do not entirely cast away your
own happiness and that others
edith could not speak and she buried her soe

it was a relief to him to give utterance to
us feelings by writing to edith and with his
usual impetuosity he poured them forth in a
strain too agitated and contradictory to meet the
eye any but her to whom it was addressed
while he reviled and denounced himself in the
bitterest terms he at the same time sought to
extenuate and vindicate his conduct and while
he declared that her happiness was a thousand
times more precious to him than his own he
pleaded the overwhelming force his passion
for another as the excuse for his apostacy from
her he returned her the ring she besought
her to keep it at least for the present he could

hastening to her beloved charge but she was
pttnicstmek with the change that had already
taken place on those cherished features edidi
indeed looked a monument living woe the
overwhelming past already told its tale misery
f a heart laid waste and desolate spirits
broken joys o'ercast and eyes that seemed as
though they never more might smile
mrs macauley had seen in her day the effects
 sickness and sorrow but here was something
differing from aught she had ever beheld 
and she gazed with affright on the mournful
indications a breaking heart at length she
said ob my dear and is not this very dreadful
 what has come over you for my darling i
 destiny
never saw any thing in this world look like you
oh what can it be 
 you will soon know said edith in a hard
unnatural tone and in her own mind alluding
to her death
 well the sooner the better my lamb that
we may know what to do for i declare i'm
frightened to look at you you're not like the
same creature you was
 in the mean time you will oblige me by
taking no notice by saying nothing iut me
either to myself or to any body else said
euth speaking slowly and with difficulty
 oh my darling how can i say nodding
when i see you looking like something i
cannot put a name upon for though your fame
is as white as a ghost's it has not the peace and
rest that's in a ghost's face and poor macky
looked wistfully at her
 it will soon have them i hope said edith
with a smile anguish i have been sick
ill but it will soon be over
but how will it be over my dear looking
anxiously in edith's face with a bewildered air
destiny 
then as the meaning flashed upon her she
burst into a violent flood tears oh my
darling she cried when at last she was able to
articulate you don't mean to say you are
going to leave us for a better world and you so
young and so happy in this same evil world 
and i that am so old and poor macky's
feelings again burst forth while the tears
rolled down her cheeks she went on but
i'm waiting my time patiently and ought not
you to do it too and well you may with so
much to make you pleased and contented
 i am contented said edith with a feint
ghastly smile do not then distress yourself
on my account
 not distress myself on your account my
heart's jewel and how can i not distress myself
but what does it signify what becomes 
me though my old heart should breaks what
ses that signify but your poor papa and
your own true love what m become them 
do not gasped edith faintly and waving
her hand
oh my dear would it not do your heart
d destiny
good to hear how miserable he is about yus
miserable that he is shut up in his own xom
and his very door locked too except when he
roes now and then to glenroy and then he
looks deed he looks not very chancy as if he
was hardly himself fm frightened at you both
then with a sudden start joy she exclaimed
 but i think i think i can guess what it is i
have not you cast out my dear is not that
all wil you not gree again aye that you
will or sorrow take me 
it was some minutes before edith could com
maid herself sufficiently to speak at length she
said and her features were almost convulsed ixk
her efforts to appear calm i know your kindness
 i feel it too but if you really love meif
you would serve me in the only way you can doit
you will not torture me by her voice
sank but she made an effort and went on by
mentioning those names do not do not ask
me questions i cannot i will not answer
 my darling and then am i not to know
what it is that's the matter with you cried
destiny 
po mrs macauley her eyes twinkling with
itbnisliment through her tears
 you nor no one else can do me any good
it is impossible i want nothing i wish noting
tut to be undisturbed
 oh my dearest if you did but see yourself
in the glass you would not venture to say
that for not a lit your face but tells another
tale as sure as death it's the face a broken
hejbirt and again a flood tears burst forth
 and will you not tell me who and what it
is that has done it cried she throwing her
arms roimd edith when you know i could
give my own heart thankfully if it could bring
joy to yoilrs and will you not tell me then
how tm to do it
edith disengaged herself from her embrace
and with the paleness death on her face but
with a calm and resolved air said yes look
upon me as one already dead one whom no
human power can restore to happiness she
would have said but her voice failed and her
lips shrunk from pronouncing the rest there
is one way and only one in which you can serve
 destint
me and she laid her hand mrs maeauky
as she spoke comfort my ifethei strive to
reconcile him to
 to what my darling cried mrs macauley
eagerly
to the will god said edith in a low
deep voice and wringing the hand her poor
old friend she entered her dressingroom and
dosed the door
there is a determined character grief which
carries a sacredness and an awe ahmg with it
and which silences all attempts at consolation
such was edith's and such the effect it produced
on the mind poor mrs macauley as
slowly and reluctantly she relinquished the h
 gaining the confidence and removing the
affliction her beloved charge she had too
much innate delicacy to intrude further upon her
privacy she saw the wound was too deep for
her unpractised hand to probe but she still
hoped the one that had dealt the blow might
likewise have the power to staunch the wound
she returned home to seek sir reginald and
prevailed ijon him to see her alone for a few
destiny 
minutes in order to represent to him the situation
 his betrothed but her courage almost
ailed her when she saw the towering the overwhelming
force mingled grief and passion
with which he received her sad and simple annunciation
and his vehement burst sorrow
was as inexplicable to her as edith's settled
despair
oh sir rinald she cried laying her
hand on his arm to detain him if you would
not be affronted at me i would just say what i
think and then you would tell me if i'm wrong
and then we would get every thing put right
again for deed if it is not done soon that
sweet lamb will go her way to a better world
and oh if you have only cast out in a common
way what for cannot you gree again but
somehow i do not know how to say it i think
so much shame evening you to such a thing 
but i've taken it into my head that deed i
never liked that frenchwoman i thought she
had a very curious look with her eye i did not
like it and i thought sometimes there was 
qjbstiny
thing i could not tell what going on and to
think how she used to take upon her to disparage
miss edith before your axe too and
jaw i may just as well tell you at once that i
cannot help thinking it's she that has made all
this mischief between you and your own truelove

sir reginald's only reply was to dash from
him the hand which would have sought to detain
him and rushing from her in agony excited
feeling he sought to stifle the upbraiding his
heart by again pouring it forth with all its incoherencies
and inconsistencies to edith and supplicating
her again to forgive and forget the
past even while his every word proclaimed the
struggle his mind as passion and pity alternately
prevailed he spoke the tortures he
endured by remaining at glenroy where every
object reminded him his lost happiness and
 the baseness submitting to practise a deception
against which his soul recoiled
v edith felt all this as only an aggravation 
her wretchedness worlds now would not have
destiny su
tempted ker to become the wife him she
loved for even in renouncing she still loved
him and there is perhaps no anguish more
acute no struggle more severe than when called
upon to despise and abjure the object out
once our still tender affection yet to the
youthful heart there is a charm in extreme
mental suffering a luxury woe which mistakes
us reject with scorn all that could lessen or
alleviate it were the burden less we might
strive even in our own strength to cast it from
us but when the spirit seems fairly crushed
beneath its overwhelming weight it requires no
effort to support it and paradoxical as it may
appear we passively yield to what we at the same
time feel to be insupportable such is the effect
calamity produces on some minds while others
are stimulated to seek relief from the galling
pressure whose iron has entered their souls 
 alas as if only to fester and corrode them soit
wb with reginaldinaction was intolerable
to him in the feverish excitement his mind
he again wrote to edith but his letter was not
answered he went to inch orran and 
destiny
landed to see her but she resisted his importunities
in a transport mingled passions
which it would not have been easy to analyze
he left the house but instead returning to
glenroy be departed to dunshiera

chapter xxvi
sorrow is a sacred thing but when carried
to excess it is also a selfish thing in the first
excitement feeling edith had felt for others
as well as for herself and the thoughts her
father's disappointment had added bitterness to
her own but now she heard he was ill bedrid
with comparatively little emotion for to
violent sorrow had succeeded a sort heartless
stupefaction and her mind had sink into a state
 melancholy which seemed to render her either
insensible or indifferent to every thing hers
was become 
a grief without a pang void dark and drear
a stifled drowsy unimpassioned grief
which finds no natural outlet or relief
in word or sigh or tear
pride now seemed the only feeling alive in
that heart where once had dwelt all the sweetest
 destiny
softest emotions and pride would sometimes
give an indignant throb and light up her languid
eye and suffuse her pale cheek and she would
struggle to cast off the load with which memory
weighed her spirit down but hers was not a
proud nature and the fiednt effort was only succeeded
by deeper dejection the buoyancy 
life and hope seemed fled yet there is in youth
a tenacity both which rarely if ever relinquishes
its hold either unnoticed and unsuspected
by its possessor the mind even in its
darkest state is still languishing for light still
putting forth new shoots even though it may
not discern the object to which it may yet attach
itself
mrs malcolm knew enough human nature
to be aware this though gentle and unobtrusive
she was judicious and unremitting in her
efforts to call forth the latent energies the soul
and direct them to higher and more permanent
sources happiness but all who have ever
striven to stem or turn the current afflictions
whose channel is in the very depths the heart
well know how laborious and apparently hope

desnsrt 
lefinsis the task whino other fount is open to
receive them
edith was naturally reserved in her usposhkm 
and although in the first anguish her feelings
she had betrayed rather than divulged the
secret her heart to mrs malcolm to no one
eke had she or would she breathe even a tii
 regret she rarely indeed ever alluded to
the subject even to her friend still she felt ft
was soothing to her to be with me who knew
what was passing in her mind even when the
mind itself was closed against all communication
the history her whole life seemed as if all
compressed into that single event and there was
an indolent melancholy pleasure in being with
one who knew that history and silently sympathized
in it but she wished no one else to share
in that knowledgeparticipate in those feelings
she was jealous almost the appearance it
while on the other hand if the happy lighthearted
girls sought to win her to their occupations
and amusements the sight their gaiety
contrasted with her own wretchedness only
served to estrange her from them the more the
vol ii 
 distant
only member the fondly besides mrs malcolm
in whose society she seemed to take the slightest
pleasure was the youngest boy in his beauty
in the sweetness his disposition in his every
look and expression he reminded her her
favourite play fellow the warmhearted generous
ronald she endured his presence when
all others seemed distasteful and mrs malcolm
hoped that when the current her affections
should once more begin to flow her young favourite
might again become an object interest
to her but she knew for she had experienced
that for the afflictions life there exists but one
genuine fountain consolation the assured
belief that all our earthly sorrows and our transitory
sufferings are ordained by unerring wis
dom and infinite love and where this belief
exists the darts anguish however they may
pierce will never fix and rankle in the soul
edith had religious feeling but she had not
religious principle and thus what might have
been the medicine to check and mitigate the
fever her heart had served rather as the aliment
to feed and pamper its sickly sensibilities
resting 
with all this pertinacity suffering however
she refused nothing that was required her 
but her compliances seemed those a body
without a soul all was calm but all was joyless
and hopeless as the slumber the dead it
was from this state rigid melancholy that mrs
malcolm was anxious to recover edith it was
possible the sight her father might produce a
strong impression but in her present state she
feared the effect any violent perturbation 
the spirits and was desirous that she should
remain under her own eye till her mind had
regained somewhat its natural tone
as a gentle mode experiment she one day
proposed to her to accompany her on a visit to
a poor couple who had lately lost a daughter
their only child and from the character the
people she was in hopes a salutary influence
might be imparted even from their lowly shed
edith agreed to the proposal with the same vacant
preoccupied look with which she assented to
every thing that was suggested to her a look
which told more plainly than words could have
done that all scenes whether pin or plea
 destiny
sore were now alike to her their destination
was to a cottage in a wild seduced glen or
rather a hollow the bleak and sterile mountains
which surrounded it edith remembered
it well it was the same she had pointed out
to florinda on their way to church but how
different were her feelings thenrom what they
were now then there was delight in every
breeze joy in every sunbeam life needed no
stimulants to give it a zest all was excitement
the excitement youthful sensation the glow
 a happy heart now all was changed the
sunbeam that had gilded the illusion was fled
and only the dark vapour remained now she
was ready to exclaim with her own mountainbard
 the narrow house is pleasant to me
and the grey stone the dead as she gazed
on the lonely cottage florinda's words recurred
to her with a bitter pang love might
transform even that wretched hut into a bower
 paradise could she love him more than i
did thought she oh no no she might
love him differently but she could not love him
more mrs malcolm marked with satisfaction
destiny 
the glow animation agonized as it was which
crossed her features as the whole scene came
vividly to her mind any thing was better than
the state lifeless melancholy in which she had
so long been sunk just as that pain is salutary
which denotes returning animation
 you look with affright on that dreary dwelling
i perceive said mrs malcolm
 yes said edith aloud as she continued to
gaze with a sad and abstracted air she said
true to dwell there wild be paradise compared
to and she sighed as though her heart was
breaking
 do you believe there is such a thing as
paradise on earth edith said her friend gently
seeking to turn her thoughts from the direction
she perceived they had taken
once i did said edith in the same thrilling
tone anguish
and even in that wretched hut
ay any whereas
and you have discovered the fallacy your
expectations edith was silent
 you are not singular my love said her
ses destiny
friend we all set out in life with the hope df
creating for ourselves a paradise on earth and ally
sooner or later live to mourn the tain the unhallowed
expectation 
 not au said edith bitterly
 au all be assured it is so ordained i and
those who have grasped at happiness hare found
it either a shadow or a shroud so it has eyr
been and so it will ever be
 are not you happy enquired edith with
snore interest than she had for a long while
evinced
resigned contented grateful these i
hope i am answered her friend but happy
i am not according to my ideas felicity
 yet you have every thing while i she
stopped choked with emotion
 but every thing here below is imperfect
and in its nature fraught with anxiety and sorrow
and shall i own my weakness my sinfulness
 even in the midst the many blessings
with which you see me surrounded stillstill
my heart yearns for my longlost boy still a
haunting mystery seems to me to hang over his
destiny 
fate still a they delusive voice whispers to meat
times that perhaps he still lives olives a captive
or a slave i judge then whether i can be
what you would call happy 
 but he was not your a said edith with
agitation
ah edith is there any us whose oi
centres in one firadl perishable creature has
god given us affections and feelings and capacities
 enjoyment to be all lavished exclusively
on one object and that object not himself 
it may be sinful but but i cannot help
it said edith in a despairing accent
 no dearest you cannot help it but god
will help you only be assured he loves you
with a love inconceivably beyond that which any
creature ever has felt or ever can feel for you
mmd your heart will no longer remain closed
against the consolations he offers you ah i
edith it was when the doors were shut that he
who came to succour and to save stood in the
midst his disciples and tis when the heart is
closed against all earthly consolation that divine
love still finds entrance
 destint
edith's only answer was a sigh and mrs
malcolm wisely forbore to press the subject farther
at present they therefore proceeded iii
silence till they reached the lonely hut it is
rarely that any thing what sentimentalists callan
interesting nature is to be met with amid the
coarse avocations humble life yet the elements
 suffering and feeling are the same in
all ranks and the short and simple annals the
poor sometimes contain much christian faith
and moral beauty they were met at the door
 the cottage by a middleaged man with grizzled
hair and a countenance which bore the
impress deep and recent sorrow mrs malcolm
accosted him in kindly accents but a respectful
bow was the only answer he at first seemed
able to return she next enquired for his wife
and making a strong effort as he drew his
hand across his eyes he said and his nice seemed
ready to fail him as he spoke nelly's no
just as she should be my leddy she's no just
herself yet
 you don't mean duncan that her mind has
been unsettled by her loss 
 o no no my leddy god be praised no
 bad as that she aye knew the hand that fts
dealing wi her she never lost sight o that 
his name be praised but step in my leddy
and you'll see hortus she is poor thing p
mrs malcolm and edith entered the lonely
dwelling where sat the childless mother with a
bible on her knees at sight them she hastily
rose and turning away covered her face with
her hands and wept
you'll excuse her my leddy said po to us yet and that i may get
many a good scold from him good and kind ashe
has always been to me i hope you will be
pleased with my letter and all that i have said
which is the truth from my darling
your old and true friend
 m macauley
edith shed tears on reading this homely effusion
the first she had shed for many weeks and
mrs malcolm hailed them with pleasure as the
harbingers renovated feelings which had too
long lain dormant in her heart it required aa
effort to resolve upon returning home to encounter
the heartrending interrogatories which she
was aware must be awaiting her which she felt
it would be death to her father to answer truly
and which she yet knew not how she should
evade it was a trial from which she shrunk
but which she nevertheless now felt it her duty
 destiny
to undergo and mrs malcolm confirmed her in
the resolution
 it is assuredly your duty my dear said mrs
malcolm and when we are convinced that
we have only to commit the event to cum the
motive only is ours the consequences are his 
and his command is that you forsake not your
ther when he is old and greyheaded ah
edith account it a privilege and a blessing to
be the comfort your father's old age 
that i can never be said edith i can
never be otherwise in his eyes than the cause 
sorrow and disappointment she stopped in
emotion
 but even that very sorrow and disappointment
may be the means producing a salutary
influence on your fitter's mind you may bethe
instrument in the hand god to work a
good work not indeed as we would work in
our weakness and ignorance but according to
his wisdom and love for you yourself i have no
fears you are going to your duty and will i
doubt not be enabled to fulfil it go then
destiny 
dearest do what you can and leave it to grot
to do as he wiuj
mrs malcolm had too much sense not to know
that when an exertion is to be made we can doit
more effectually when left to ourselves than
when another is at hand to whom we have been
accustomed to cling for support and assistance 
and that more minds are rendered helpless from
the mistaken and injudicious tenderness friends
than by being left to their own resources and
exertions she therefore wisely forbore to offer
her assistance at this time
edith was now anxious and impatient to begone
even while her heart recoiled the thoughts
 her return the preparation having been
quickly made she took an agitated farewell 
inch orran and its affectionate inmates and ere
the tumult her spirit had subsided she foimd
herself once more within the dear domain 
glenroy but ah how changed to her was
now glenroy yet as its fondly pictured scenes
again met her eye the visions her early days
also rose to view for a brief moment her heart
cast off the burden its woes and as memory
 destiny
gave back in all their brightness the happydays
she had spent amid those very scenes the
past only seemed reality
but quickly the illusion vanished and was
succeeded by bitter recollections and humiliating
thoughts she had lately left that home the
beloved the betrothed reginald and she now
returned to it the slighted forsaken daughter 
glenroy
but even these feelings were suspended when
the carriage drove up to the castle and she beheld
dismay and alarm painted on the countess
dances the servants as they hurried to and iro
what has happened she called faintly to
the housekeeper who was stationed to receive
her
don't be frightened ma'am but glenroy
has had about an hour ago a a a stroke 
the palsy ma'am and has lost
edith waited to hear no more with a wild
exclamation she rushed forward regardless 
the voice the servant who sought to detain her
and in another minute was by the side her
father's couch
destiny 
chapter xxix
there lay glenroy speechless his features
slightly distorted but the expression calm and
apparently tranquil and on one side sat benbowie
with a face dull sorrowful amazement 
and on the other was poor mrs macauley tears
flowing profusely over her face while she stroked
with childish fondness the powerless hand
 her beloved chief
oh my dear this is no a sight for you 
cried she to edith deed it's as much as my
old hard heart can do to stand it but it's god's
will and a punishment for my sins and so i do
not complain and a torrent tears gushed
forth 
glenroy opened his eyes and at sight edith
smiled complacently then cast an enquiring look
around and vainly tried to articulate but his
meaning was sufficiently apparent
 destiny
 it's our own darling miss edith come back
said mrs macauley hastily brushing away her
tears and speaking fondly to him and somebody
else will come too and then please god
you'll be yourself again glenroy and we'll all
be as happy as ever then in a low voice to
edith cheer up my darling and do not let
your papa see your distress but try to put some
heart in him though i'm but a silly creature
myself as the tears again burst forth 
 deed i think benbowie has more sense and
discretion than any us for he's just what lie
always was
why oh why was i not told this sooner
 cried edith in an agony selfreproach
as she bent over her ther's almost lifeless
form
 oh my dear we could not tell you for we
did not know what was to happen ourselves 
oh what creatures we are we know not what
a day may bring forth i little thought yesterday
when i wrote my letter to you what
was coming and when i sent it away this morning
i thought him better and more like himself
destiny 
than he had been for a long time though to be
sure i had a very extraordinary dream
then when did it happen have you sent
for medical assistance cried edith distractedly

oh compose yourself my dear cried the
poor weeping macky yes eyes the doctor
has been sent for and so has but i'm so confused
i hardly know what i'm about did
you ask when it happened when was it benbowie

 it was just fiveandtwenty minutes past
two just replied benbowie
ay and he was just sitting there in his
chair and i was chatting to him and trying to
please him but i suppose i had said something
that had not pleased him for he said in his
own way says he molly macauley you are a
stupid old ignorant and then he stopped so
i waited lite to hear what more was coming
but no more said he so says i well what
else glefroy for you may cal me what you
please i know very well what you mean by it
ifs all that that falls by but not a word
vol ii 
 destiny
well i was winding a clue and so i just went
on and i forgot myself so eur as to be singing
and you know glenroy never could bear my
singing and so when i remembered that i
stopped and begged his pardon but then when
he did not begin to scold me i began to feel
very queer somehow and so i looked at him r
as sure as death there he was just as you see
him now and oh not a word good or bad has
he ever spoken since then a fresh flood 
tears concluded poor molly's narrative
 my dear dear papa what can i do for
you cried edith throwing herself on her
knees by the couch and laying her face close
to his as though she strove to read his wishes
there glenroy uttered some inarticulate sounds
and again rolled his eyes as if in search someone

edith felt the appeal with agony
well thaf s something cried mrs maces
audley joyfully and i know who he's looking
for ay that i do and if he had but his
will i really think he would come all right
deed i would not wonder if all this has hapdestiny

opened just because le has not got his own way
good man that he is but i wager that he'll
get it yet and that i'll gire him an agreeable
surprise before if s long so be as composed as
you can my darling and now that you've seen
your papa if you would please to go and rest
yourself and take something for oh my dear
iamb you look very white and ill
the doctor came and did what he could but
to little purpose glenroy remained much the
same and it was only at sight edith or at
the sound her voice that any difference was
perceptible but then he always revived and
made an effort to express by words or signs a
meaning which she but too well guessed
 well i really think an agreeable surprise
will have a great effect on glenroy said mrs
macauley i'm sure it always does me good 
but i doubt we cannot have it till tomorrow
forenoon at the soonest for ijiat slow creature
benbowie has only sent away his letter half an
hour ago
the letter which was intended to produce
this agreeable surprise was from benbowie to
 destiny
sir reginald and even with its omissions and
blunders was the most correct and intelligible
benbowie had ever penned
 dear sir
 i have the misfortune to acquaint you that
glenroy has this morning had a stroke the
palsy which deprived him and took place at
twentyfive minutes past two pm when sitting
in his own room i think it my duty to acquaint
you with this stroke that you may do what you
think proper no one here being authorized to
act under this stroke for yon with much grief
i am dear sir faithfully yours
each malcolm
it found sir reginald at dunshiera where he
still remained a prey to conflicting passions 
at one moment ready to fly to florinda to claim
her as his own and in so doing ensure their
mutual happiness beyond the power fortune 
at the next yielding to pity for edith and glenroy
 then fired by pride ais he thought how the
world would say he had broken his yom and
resting 
deserted the poor portionless edith fbr her
wealthy titled rival sadi was the state his
mind when the intelligence as he naturally
concluded his uncle's death reached him and
for the moment overwhelmed him with feelings
 the deepest sorrow and remorse having
learned however from the servant that glen
roy still lived he lost no time in setting off late
as was the hour when the express reached him
and having travelled during the night he arrived
by sunrise the following morning anxious
to avoid disturbing the atmily at so early an
hour he gained admittance as quietly as post
bible and finding only one the inferior servants
yet stirring from whom he could obtain
little information he went directly and softly to
the sick chamber
edith had taken some hours rest but had
risen with the light day to resume her station
by her father's side and to relieve the faithful
mrs macauley who had watched there the livelong
night and who now with difficulty consented
to retire to an adjoining apartment to take a little
repose she had dismissed the servants also who
s distant
kad been in attendance and remained acme by
the tick bed a dunk an open shutter showed
a seene widioat in striking contrast with that
which was passive within the dosed contains
there all nature was uwmng into new existence
beneath the glories the rising son 
here life seemed passing away amid touts and
darkness the natural train moomfal but
salutary reflections arose in her mind as she
gazed on the powerless form and pallid features
ci the proud lord all the goodly scene which
smiled in vain around him the spirit wbidi
still lingered in ae bodywhat was what might
be passive there was it still grovelling amid
scenes lowbon cares was it even now
 he emphatically articulated
 reginald t thank heaven edith would
have said bat her utterance filled her a thousand
emotions mingled in her heart at hearing
this oncecherished name so long banished from
her lips from her ear now suddenly operating
as a spell to arouse her euler from death to life 
she shuddered she became dizzy with conflicting
feelings after vainly struggling to master
them she fell senseless on thefloor reginald
called loudly for assistance in his alarm for edith
entirely overlooking glenroy wo continued
gasping and struggling for farther utterance
in an instant mrs macauley was in the room
and all aghast at the spectacle that presented itself
she for the first time in her life stood transfixed
in silent amazement edith the image 
death supported in the arms reginald and
glenroy writhing in all the agonies impotent
irritability
do come here called sir reginald beckoning
to her to assist in bearing edith to a sofa
mem molly stuttered glenroy
destiny 
 oh exclaimed she in rapture what a
joyful sound i she stood for a moment suspended
between the two i declare i do not
know which hand me to turn to i'm so happy
and so sorry and so but oh what a blessing to
think glenroy has got his tongue again oh
what's this has come over her deed it has
been just this agreeable surprise but see she
coming to sir reginald hold up her head on
your arm and there's no fear but what all will
come right yet and oflf trotted the wellmeaning
but mistaken mrs macauley to the other
 the chamber to the side her beloved
chief 
when edith opened her eyes she found herr
self supported by sir reginald and the sight 
the pity and distress depicted on his countenance
instantly recalled her to a sense her situation
the blush wounded pride quickly mantled her
cheeks as she withdrew herself from his support
you feel better now do you not enquired
reginald anxiously edith's heart thrilled as
the tenderness the accent recalled the remembrance
 former days for a few minutes she
r
 destiny
remained silent gradually regaining her 
till at length she was able to say
 the sound papa's voice had a strange effect
upon me and i fear my weakness must have
agitated him pray leave me i am now well
but reginald still wavered
 oh sir reginald will you come here 
called mis macauley while glenroy vainly
strove to repel her officious cares and to recall
his nephew glenroy's energies had been dormant
but not extinguished and the sight 
reginald had awakened them from the lethargy
into which they had sunk oh did not i tell
you cried she all vibrating with joy what
an erect an agreeable surprise would have upon
poor glenroy deed i think it was very clever
in me to have found that out 
destiny 
chapter xxx
there was a new trial for edith and one she
had little anticipated glenroy helpless fatuous
and almost speechless was more despotic
than ever and was never satisfied unless when
reginald and she were before him enoih
could be gathered from his broken and imperfect
expressions to know that the theme uppermost
in his mind was their marriage and thus the
situation both parties was one the most
painful embarrassment but for either them
to leave him was impossible in the critical state
he was then in when the slightest opposition to
his wishes would in all probability have been
attended with the most fatal consequences although
in obedience to her fitthers commands
she gave him much her company when reginald
was present she carefully avoided all occa

 destiny
sons being alone with the latter and when
they met at meals she strove as much as possible
to maintain the unvarying calm politeness
 manner which was merely due towards her
fsuher's guest but dearly was the struggle
maintained and many was the bitter tear shed
in secret when the chords highstrained exertion
were for a moment relaxed
so passed several days during which glenroy
made such progress towards recovery that
he was now able to sit up and even to converse
or rather talk pretty much in his usual
strain only his mind was still weaker his ideas
more confused and his temper more irritable
than ever his idolatry for his heir and his fondness
for edith had also increased so that he
could not endure either them to be out his
sight fortunately he dozed and slept much during
the day when they course were released
from their thraldom otherwise it would scarcely
have been possible for them to have endured
the torture being associated together in glenroy's
company it were endless to detail the
absurdities and inconsistencies a mind in its
destiny 
dotage sir reginald at first bore them with
compassionate forbearance and kindness manner
 but his patience became exhausted and he
now frequently testified his weariness and irritation
in a manner which wounded edith to the
quick
one day when sir reginald and she were sitting
by him listening to or at least hearing old
stories the cutting the woods the black pony
c c a servant entered to say that mr m'dow
and mrs m'dow were in the drawingroom
edith turned pale sir reginald uttered an exclamation
 disgust and glenroy catching the
name repeated m'dow m'dow ay that's
he that's he the the what do you call it 
the that edith you know very well what i
mean the man that marries you the the mir
sister and what for should he not come and
marry you and reginald just now tell mr
im'pow he called to the servant to come
here and bring the the the but edith
heard no more for she hastily rose and quitted

and dien they had each planted at the entrance
a honeysuckle and a wild rose duly were
these tended and fondly were they watched
by her during his long absence and they had
grown and flourished to their utmost luxuriance
 but the sweetness both was past for
the season and they now only hung their long
slender branches in mournful penury while
their seared and yellow leaves lay scattered
around and the gay summer brook now swelled
by autumnal rains into a turbid stream murmured
and gurgled hoarsely along with sad
and filtering steps edith approached the spot
fraughtwiuisonuuiyoverwlielimngrecouectiom
reach bush each stone told its voiceless tale
 perished life beauty turned to dust 
love and hope changed to gall and wormwood
the very silence that surrounded her spoke
more eloquently than words could have done 
the desolation all things she entered the
mossy bower so long her favourite retreat and
 destiny
gave way to the melancholy that oppressed her
amid these scenes it was almost a luxury to
weep it seemed as though these mute witnesses
 her early pleasures were now become the
sympathetic depositaries her maturer sorrows
heedless time she remained sunk in mournful
abstraction till roused by a dog rushing in
and bounding upon her with all the ardour ci
attachment it was a favourite pointer reginald's
which she had petted almost to spoiling
in his absence and the faithful creature never
fooled when at liberty to fly to her and lavish
his caresses on the gentle hand that had so often
fed and fondled him soon after reginald's
voice was heard calling loudly to the dog and
presently he entered with his gun in his hand
in pursuit as it appeared the runaway at
sight edith he stopped and colouring said
 i did not expect i was not aware i then
as if to cover his confusion he brce into expressions
 anger against his dog and advanced
as if to strike him but the animal crouched close
to edith
pray do not hurt poor bran she said
destiny 
stooping over him ta hide the tears which still
hung round her eyes
 he is become a mere useless good for nothing
cur said reginald giving him a shove
with his foot and evidently bent upon keeping
up his illhumour tis provoking to see a good
dog so completely ruined i shall certainly have
him shot
 edith's heart swelled at the harsh unfeeling
maimer in wych reginald spoke but she tried
to be calm while she said i fear tis i who amin
fault more than poor bran my fondness for
him she stopped
 has been his ruin said reginald
there was something in the tone and manner
in which this was uttered that struck edith to
the heart she could not speak but struggling
with her feelings she rose to leave the place
when as if smitten with a sense his unkindness
reginald caught her hand
forgive me he said i did not mean to
pain you but there are times when i know not
what i say what i mean
edith could not speak but she motioned to be
 destiny
gode reginald's agitation seemed little less
than ber own but be still belt her hand and
several times attempted to speak but emotion
choked his utterance at last be said edith
this state things is not to be endured i would
finn speak to you tell you what i have
suffered since no edith you must hear me 
dishonoured as i am in your eyes cold and
estranged as ypu are become tis but justice
you should hear me
 i have nothing to hear said edith faintly
yesyou have to hear me exculpate myself
from the very suspicion coldblooded perfidy
my crime if crime it was was an involuntary
one so was the avowal it i would have
died a thousand deaths rather than have wronged
you edith would to heaven he exclaimed
wildly would i had died rather than have
lived to suffer as i do 
why recur to what has passed to what
cannot be recalled said edith with emotion
 because i would yet recall much what
has passed edith i would yet ask you to forgive
 to forget he topped and paused in
destiny 
extreme agitation then proceeded to suffer
me to expiate by a life devoted to you the
involuntary error into which i have fallen
the pride woman the pride glenroy
for a moment mantled edith's pale cheek with
ft deep glow at this proposal and she remained
silent but it was plain her silence was not that
 doubt or timidity but deeplywounded
feeling reginald's colour also rose if there
is more that you would have me do and that i
eon do speak and it shall be done
 you might have spared me this had you
known me better said edith such professions
must be painful to you to me they are
degrading
 degrading if to forgive is degrading 
 i do forgive with my whole heart said
edith with emotion
and the proof demanded reginald bitterly

that i wish you all happiness said edith
in a faltering accent and unable to restrain her
tears she was again moving away
stay edith cried reginald we must
 destiny
not we shall not part thus till a mockery to
talk happiness to one so wretched as i my
happiness must ever be involved in yours my
stuffing is perhaps still greater than yours
edkh if you will yet concede in me i again repeat
 heaven be my witness t your happiness
shall be the study my future life say then
that
 hear me reginald once for all said edith
in the calmness deepfelt emotion that
my happiness was once in your hands i freely
acknowledge but that time is past never to
return there are feelings which never can be
renewed we never can be to each other what
we have been i never can i never till be
yours
a strange mingled sensation shot through reginald's
veins at this declaration delivered with
a calm solemn earnestness manner which
admitted no appeal with an air pride he
bent his head and said since such is your
irrevocable determination it is better we should
part for i will no longer play the hypocrite
destiny 
i cannot continue to act the part the favoured
hover after being thrice rejected
and my father exclaimed edidi in anguish
 ah reginald what will become 
him if you forsake him 
 i appeal to yourself edith to your own
good sense to your right feeling if after what
has passed it is to be expected that i should
continue to drag out existence here by heaven
i would rather work as a gdleyslave 
but you are all and every thing to him
said edith mournfully
so at least i might have been so i might
be still but you have decreed otherwise said
reginald with a sort haughty humility edith
felt the cruel taunt but she made no reply only
turned away to hide the tears which rose to her
eyes reginald's tone softened and he sighed
as he said edith tis best for both that we
should part at least for the present hearts
once so dear still so dear to each otheredith
we are still too much and yet not enough to each
other if the time should ever come he
stopped for he would fain have added when
 destiny
we may be more bat his lips refused to utter
so else a supposition should the time ever
some edith he added with confusion when
your present sentiments may change edith
could not speak bat she waved her head to repel
such a supposition at least you cannot
prevent me from thinking it posting they may
said reginald
edith's pale cheek glowed while she said 
 no reginald rest assured my sentiments
are unchangeable
 and mine also thought reginald as his
heart throbbed at the bare idea that his love
for rotunda could ever change could ever be
given to another even though that other were
eklith he stood silent for a few minutes then
said hurriedly then let us part i am now
on my way to dunshiera but should glenroy
become worse you have only to send for me
and i shall return to you instantly god bless
you edith 
a tear was in his eye as he held her hand in
his and looked anxiously fondly upon her as
though he waited her parting word edith's
destiny 

breast heaved her lips moved but no sound
passed them she felt her fortitude givuig way
but she made a strong effort and said with the
calmness agony may you be happy 
he wrung her hand in silence and thus
they parted under what different circumstances
again to meet

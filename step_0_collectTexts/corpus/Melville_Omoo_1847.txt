my reception aboard

it was the middle of a bright tropical afternoon that we made good our
escape from the bay the vessel we sought lay with her main-topsail
aback about a league from the land and was the only object that
broke the broad expanse of the ocean

on approaching she turned out to be a small slatternly-looking
craft her hull and spars a dingy black rigging all slack and
bleached nearly white and everything denoting an ill state of
affairs aboard the four boats hanging from her sides proclaimed her
a whaler leaning carelessly over the bulwarks were the sailors
wild haggard-looking fellows in scotch caps and faded blue frocks
some of them with cheeks of a mottled bronze to which sickness soon
changes the rich berry-brown of a seaman's complexion in the tropics

on the quarter-deck was one whom i took for the chief mate he wore a
broad-brimmed panama hat and his spy-glass was levelled as we
advanced

when we came alongside a low cry ran fore and aft the deck and
everybody gazed at us with inquiring eyes and well they might to
say nothing of the savage boat's crew panting with excitement all
gesture and vociferation my own appearance was calculated to excite
curiosity a robe of the native cloth was thrown over my shoulders
my hair and beard were uncut and i betrayed other evidences of my
recent adventure immediately on gaining the deck they beset me on
all sides with questions the half of which i could not answer so
incessantly were they put

as an instance of the curious coincidences which often befall the
sailor i must here mention that two countenances before me were
familiar one was that of an old man-of-war's-man whose acquaintance
i had made in rio de janeiro at which place touched the ship in
which i sailed from home the other was a young man whom four years
previous i had frequently met in a sailor boarding-house in
liverpool i remembered parting with him at prince's dock gates in
the midst of a swarm of police-officers trackmen stevedores
beggars and the like and here we were again years had rolled by
many a league of ocean had been traversed and we were thrown
together under circumstances which almost made me doubt my own
existence

but a few moments passed ere i was sent for into the cabin by the
captain

he was quite a young man pale and slender more like a sickly
counting-house clerk than a bluff sea-captain bidding me be seated
he ordered the steward to hand me a glass of pisco in the state i
was this stimulus almost made me delirious so that of all i then
went on to relate concerning my residence on the island i can
scarcely remember a word after this i was asked whether i desired to
ship of course i said yes that is if he would allow me to enter
for one cruise engaging to discharge me if i so desired at the
next port in this way men are frequently shipped on board whalemen
in the south seas my stipulation was acceded to and the ship's
articles handed me to sign

the mate was now called below and charged to make a well man of me
not let it be borne in mind that the captain felt any great
compassion for me he only desired to have the benefit of my services
as soon as possible

helping me on deck the mate stretched me out on the windlass and
commenced examining my limb and then doctoring it after a fashion
with something from the medicine-chest rolled it up in a piece of an
old sail making so big a bundle that with my feet resting on the
windlass i might have been taken for a sailor with the gout while
this was going on someone removing my tappa cloak slipped on a blue
frock in its place and another actuated by the same desire to make
a civilized mortal of me flourished about my head a great pair lie
imminent jeopardy of both ears and the certain destruction of hair
and beard

the day was now drawing to a close and as the land faded from my
sight i was all alive to the change in my condition but how far
short of our expectations is oftentimes the fulfilment of the most
ardent hopes safe aboard of a ship so long my earnest prayer with
home and friends once more in prospect i nevertheless felt weighed
down by a melancholy that could not be shaken off it was the thought
of never more seeing those who notwithstanding their desire to
retain me a captive had upon the whole treated me so kindly i was
leaving them for ever

so unforeseen and sudden had been my escape so excited had i been
through it all and so great the contrast between the luxurious
repose of the valley and the wild noise and motion of a ship at sea
that at times my recent adventures had all the strangeness of a
dream and i could scarcely believe that the same sun now setting
over a waste of waters had that very morning risen above the
mountains and peered in upon me as i lay on my mat in typee

going below into the forecastle just after dark i was inducted into a
wretched bunk or sleeping-box built over another the rickety
bottoms of both were spread with several pieces of a blanket a
battered tin can was then handed me containing about half a pint of
tea so called by courtesy though whether the juice of such stalks
as one finds floating therein deserves that title is a matter all
shipowners must settle with their consciences a cube of salt beef
on a hard round biscuit by way of platter was also handed up and
without more ado i made a meal the salt flavour of which after the
nebuchadnezzar fare of the valley was positively delicious

while thus engaged an old sailor on a chest just under me was puffing
out volumes of tobacco smoke my supper finished he brushed the stem
of his sooty pipe against the sleeve of his frock and politely waved
it toward me the attention was sailor-like as for the nicety of the
thing no man who has lived in forecastles is at all fastidious and
so after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose i turned over and
tried my best to forget myself but in vain my crib instead of
extending fore and aft as it should have done was placed athwart
ships that is at right angles to the keel and the vessel going
before the wind rolled to such a degree that-every time my heels
went up and my head went down i thought i was on the point of
turning a somerset beside this there were still more annoying
causes of inquietude and every once in a while a splash of water
came down the open scuttle and flung the spray in my face

at last after a sleepless night broken twice by the merciless call
of the watch a peep of daylight struggled into view from above and
someone came below it was my old friend with the pipe

here shipmate said i help me out of this place and let me go
on deck

halloa who's that croaking was the rejoinder as he peered into
the obscurity where i lay ay typee my king of the cannibals is
it you i but i say my lad how's that spar of your'n the mate says
it's in a devil of a way and last night set the steward to
sharpening the handsaw hope he won't have the carving of ye

long before daylight we arrived off the bay of nukuheva and making
short tacks until morning we then ran in and sent a boat ashore with
the natives who had brought me to the ship upon its return we made
sail again and stood off from the land there was a fine breeze and
notwithstanding my bad night's rest the cool fresh air of a
morning at sea was so bracing mat as soon as i breathed it my
spirits rose at once

seated upon the windlass the greater portion of the day and chatting
freely with the men i learned the history of the voyage thus far
and everything respecting the ship and its present condition

these matters i will now throw together in the next chapter



chapter ii

some account of the ship

first and foremost i must give some account of the julia herself or
little jule as the sailors familiarly styled her

she was a small barque of a beautiful model something more than two
hundred tons yankee-built and very old fitted for a privateer out
of a new england port during the war of she had been captured
at sea by a british cruiser and after seeing all sorts of service
was at last employed as a government packet in the australian seas
being condemned however about two years previous she was purchased
at auction by a house in sydney who after some slight repairs
dispatched her on the present voyage

notwithstanding the repairs she was still in a miserable plight the
lower masts were said to be unsound the standing rigging was much
worn and in some places even the bulwarks were quite rotten
still she was tolerably tight and but little more than the ordinary
pumping of a morning served to keep her free

but all this had nothing to do with her sailing at that brave little
jule plump little jule was a witch blow high or blow low she was
always ready for the breeze and when she dashed the waves from her
prow and pranced and pawed the sea you never thought of her
patched sails and blistered hull how the fleet creature would fly
before the wind rolling now and then to be sure but in very
playfulness sailing to windward no gale could bow her over with
spars erect she looked right up into the wind's eye and so she went

but after all little jule was not to be confided in lively enough
and playful she was but on that very account the more to be
distrusted who knew but that like some vivacious old mortal all at
once sinking into a decline she might some dark night spring a
leak and carry us all to the bottom however she played us no such
ugly trick and therefore i wrong little jule in supposing it

she had a free roving commission according to her papers she might go
whither she pleased whaling sealing or anything else sperm
whaling however was what she relied upon though as yet only two
fish had been brought alongside

the day they sailed out of sydney heads the ship's company all told
numbered some thirty-two souls now they mustered about twenty the
rest had deserted even the three junior mates who had headed the
whaleboats were gone and of the four harpooners only one was left
a wild new zealander or mowree as his countrymen are more commonly
called in the pacific but this was not all more than half the
seamen remaining were more or less unwell from a long sojourn in a
dissipated port some of them wholly unfit for duty one or two
dangerously ill and the rest managing to stand their watch though
they could do but little

the captain was a young cockney who a few years before had
emigrated to australia and by some favouritism or other had
procured the command of the vessel though in no wise competent
he was essentially a landsman and though a man of education no more
meant for the sea than a hairdresser hence everybody made fun of
him they called him the cabin boy paper jack and half a dozen
other undignified names in truth the men made no secret of the
derision in which they held him and as for the slender gentleman
himself he knew it all very well and bore himself with becoming
meekness holding as little intercourse with them as possible he
left everything to the chief mate who as the story went had been
given his captain in charge yet despite his apparent unobtrusiveness
the silent captain had more to do with the men than they thought in
short although one of your sheepish-looking fellows he had a sort
of still timid cunning which no one would have suspected and which
for that very reason was all the more active so the bluff mate
who always thought he did what he pleased was occasionally made a
fool of and some obnoxious measures which he carried out in spite
of all growlings were little thought to originate with the dapper
little fellow in nankeen jacket and white canvas pumps but to all
appearance at least the mate had everything his own way indeed
in most things this was actually the case and it was quite plain
that the captain stood in awe of him

so far as courage seamanship and a natural aptitude for keeping
riotous spirits in subjection were concerned no man was better
qualified for his vocation than john jermin he was the very
beau-ideal of the efficient race of short thick-set men his hair
curled in little rings of iron gray all over his round bullet head as
for his countenance it was strongly marked deeply pitted with the
small-pox for the rest there was a fierce little squint out of one
eye the nose had a rakish twist to one side while his large mouth
and great white teeth looked absolutely sharkish when he laughed in
a word no one after getting a fair look at him would ever think of
improving the shape of his nose wanting in symmetry as it was
notwithstanding his pugnacious looks however jermin had a heart as
big as a bullock's that you saw at a glance

such was our mate but he had one failing he abhorred all weak
infusions and cleaved manfully to strong drink at all times he was
more or less under the influence of it taken in moderate quantities
i believe in my soul it did a man like him good brightened his
eyes swept the cobwebs out of his brain and regulated his pulse
but the worst of it was that sometimes he drank too much and a more
obstreperous fellow than jermin in his cups you seldom came across
he was always for having a fight but the very men he flogged loved
him as a brother for he had such an irresistibly good-natured way of
knocking them down that no one could find it in his heart to bear
malice against him so much for stout little jermin

all english whalemen are bound by-law to carry a physician who of
course is rated a gentleman and lives in the cabin with nothing
but his professional duties to attend to but incidentally he drinks
flip and plays cards with the captain there was such a worthy
aboard of the julia but curious to tell he lived in the forecastle
with the men and this was the way it happened

in the early part of the voyage the doctor and the captain lived
together as pleasantly as could be to say nothing of many a can they
drank over the cabin transom both of them had read books and one of
them had travelled so their stories never flagged but once on a
time they got into a dispute about politics and the doctor
moreover getting into a rage drove home an argument with his fist
and left the captain on the floor literally silenced this was
carrying it with a high hand so he was shut up in his state-room for
ten days and left to meditate on bread and water and the
impropriety of flying into a passion smarting under his disgrace he
undertook a short time after his liberation to leave the vessel
clandestinely at one of the islands but was brought back
ignominiously and again shut up being set at large for the second
time he vowed he would not live any longer with the captain and
went forward with his chests among the sailors where he was received
with open arms as a good fellow and an injured man

i must give some further account of him for he figures largely in the
narrative his early history like that of many other heroes was
enveloped in the profoundest obscurity though he threw out hints of
a patrimonial estate a nabob uncle and an unfortunate affair which
sent him a-roving all that was known however was this he had gone
out to sydney as assistant-surgeon of an emigrant ship on his
arrival there he went back into the country and after a few months
wanderings returned to sydney penniless and entered as doctor
aboard of the julia

his personal appearance was remarkable he was over six feet high a
tower of bones with a complexion absolutely colourless fair hair
and a light unscrupulous gray eye twinkling occasionally at the very
devil of mischief among the crew he went by the name of the long
doctor or more frequently still doctor long ghost and from
whatever high estate doctor long ghost might have fallen he had
certainly at some time or other spent money drunk burgundy and
associated with gentlemen

as for his learning he quoted virgil and talked of hobbs of
malmsbury beside repeating poetry by the canto especially hudibras
he was moreover a man who had seen the world in the easiest way
imaginable he could refer to an amour he had in palermo his
lion-hunting before breakfast among the caffres and the quality of
the coffee to be drunk in muscat and about these places and a
hundred others he had more anecdotes than i can tell of then such
mellow old songs as he sang in a voice so round and racy the real
juice of sound how such notes came forth from his lank body was a
constant marvel

upon the whole long ghost was as entertaining a companion as one
could wish and to me in the julia an absolute godsend



chapter iii

further account of the julia

owing to the absence of anything like regular discipline the vessel
was in a state of the greatest uproar the captain having for some
time past been more or less confined to the cabin from sickness was
seldom seen the mate however was as hearty as a young lion and
ran about the decks making himself heard at all hours bembo the
new zealand harpooner held little intercourse with anybody but the
mate who could talk to him freely in his own lingo part of his time
he spent out on the bowsprit fishing for albicores with a bone hook
and occasionally he waked all hands up of a dark night dancing some
cannibal fandango all by himself on the forecastle but upon the
whole he was remarkably quiet though something in his eye showed he
was far from being harmless

doctor long ghost having sent in a written resignation as the ship's
doctor gave himself out as a passenger for sydney and took the
world quite easy as for the crew those who were sick seemed
marvellously contented for men in their condition and the rest not
displeased with the general licence gave themselves little thought
of the morrow

the julia's provisions were very poor when opened the barrels of
pork looked as if preserved in iron rust and diffused an odour like
a stale ragout the beef was worse yet a mahogany-coloured fibrous
substance so tough and tasteless that i almost believed the cook's
story of a horse's hoof with the shoe on having been fished up out of
the pickle of one of the casks nor was the biscuit much better
nearly all of it was broken into hard little gunflints honeycombed
through and through as if the worms usually infesting this article
in long tropical voyages had in boring after nutriment come out at
the antipodes without finding anything

of what sailors call small stores we had but little tea
however we had in abundance though i dare say the hong merchants
never had the shipping of it beside this every other day we had
what english seamen call shot soup great round peas polishing
themselves like pebbles by rolling about in tepid water

it was afterward told me that all our provisions had been purchased
by the owners at an auction sale of condemned navy stores in sydney

but notwithstanding the wateriness of the first course of soup and
the saline flavour of the beef and pork a sailor might have made a
satisfactory meal aboard of the julia had there been any side
dishes a potato or two a yam or a plantain but there was nothing
of the kind still there was something else which in the estimation
of the men made up for all deficiencies and that was the regular
allowance of pisco

it may seem strange that in such a state of affairs the captain should
be willing to keep the sea with his ship but the truth was that by
lying in harbour he ran the risk of losing the remainder of his men
by desertion and as it was he still feared that in some outlandish
bay or other he might one day find his anchor down and no crew to
weigh it

with judicious officers the most unruly seamen can at sea be kept in
some sort of subjection but once get them within a cable's length of
the land and it is hard restraining them it is for this reason that
many south sea whalemen do not come to anchor for eighteen or twenty
months on a stretch when fresh provisions are needed they run for
the nearest land heave to eight or ten miles off and send a boat
ashore to trade the crews manning vessels like these are for the most
part villains of all nations and dyes picked up in the lawless ports
of the spanish main and among the savages of the islands like
galley-slaves they are only to be governed by scourges and chains
their officers go among them with dirk and pistol concealed but
ready at a grasp

not a few of our own crew were men of this stamp but riotous at
times as they were the bluff drunken energies of jennin were just
the thing to hold them in some sort of noisy subjection upon an
emergency he flew in among them showering his kicks and cuffs right
and left and creating a sensation in every direction and as
hinted before they bore this knock-down authority with great
good-humour a sober discreet dignified officer could have done
nothing with them such a set would have thrown him and his dignity
overboard

matters being thus there was nothing for the ship but to keep the
sea nor was the captain without hope that the invalid portion of his
crew as well as himself would soon recover and then there was no
telling what luck in the fishery might yet be in store for us at any
rate at the time of my coming aboard the report was that captain
guy was resolved upon retrieving the past and filling the vessel with
oil in the shortest space possible

with this intention we were now shaping our course for hytyhoo a
village on the island of st christina one of the marquesas and so
named by mendanna for the purpose of obtaining eight seamen who
some weeks before had stepped ashore there from the julia it was
supposed that by this time they must have recreated themselves
sufficiently and would be glad to return to their duty

so to hytyhoo with all our canvas spread and coquetting with the
warm breezy trades we bowled along gliding up and down the long
slow swells the bonettas and albicores frolicking round us



chapter iv

a scene in the forecastle

i had scarcely been aboard of the ship twenty-four hours when a
circumstance occurred which although noways picturesque is so
significant of the state of affairs that i cannot forbear relating
it

in the first place however it must be known that among the crew was
a man so excessively ugly that he went by the ironical appellation
of beauty he was the ship's carpenter and for that reason was
sometimes known by his nautical cognomen of chips there was no
absolute deformity about the man he was symmetrically ugly but ill
favoured as he was in person beauty was none the less ugly in
temper but no one could blame him his countenance had soured his
heart now jermin and beauty were always at swords points the
truth was the latter was the only man in the ship whom the mate had
never decidedly got the better of and hence the grudge he bore him
as for beauty he prided himself upon talking up to the mate as we
shall soon see

toward evening there was something to be done on deck and the
carpenter who belonged to the watch was missing where's that skulk
chips shouted jermin down the forecastle scuttle

taking his ease d'ye see down here on a chest if you want to
know replied that worthy himself quietly withdrawing his pipe from
his mouth this insolence flung the fiery little mate into a mighty
rage but beauty said nothing puffing away with all the tranquillity
imaginable here it must be remembered that never mind what may be
the provocation no prudent officer ever dreams of entering a ship's
forecastle on a hostile visit if he wants to see anybody who happens
to be there and refuses to come up why he must wait patiently until
the sailor is willing the reason is this the place is very dark
and nothing is easier than to knock one descending on the head
before he knows where he is and a very long while before he ever
finds out who did it

nobody knew this better than jermin and so he contented himself with
looking down the scuttle and storming at last beauty made some cool
observation which set him half wild

tumble on deck he then bellowed come up with you or i'll jump
down and make you the carpenter begged him to go about it at once

no sooner said than done prudence forgotten jermin was there and by
a sort of instinct had his man by the throat before he could well
see him one of the men now made a rush at him but the rest dragged
him off protesting that they should have fair play

now come on deck shouted the mate struggling like a good fellow to
hold the carpenter fast

take me there was the dogged answer and beauty wriggled about in
the nervous grasp of the other like a couple of yards of
boa-constrictor

his assailant now undertook to make him up into a compact bundle the
more easily to transport him while thus occupied beauty got his
arms loose and threw him over backward but jermin quickly recovered
himself when for a time they had it every way dragging each other
about bumping their heads against the projecting beams and
returning each other's blows the first favourable opportunity that
offered unfortunately jermin at last slipped and fell his foe
seating himself on his chest and keeping him down now this was one
of those situations in which the voice of counsel or reproof comes
with peculiar unction nor did beauty let the opportunity slip but
the mate said nothing in reply only foaming at the mouth and
struggling to rise

just then a thin tremor of a voice was heard from above it was the
captain who happening to ascend to the quarter-deck at the
commencement of the scuffle would gladly have returned to the cabin
but was prevented by the fear of ridicule as the din increased and
it became evident that his officer was in serious trouble he thought
it would never do to stand leaning over the bulwarks so he made his
appearance on the forecastle resolved as his best policy to treat
the matter lightly

why why he begun speaking pettishly and very fast what's all
this about mr jermin mr jermin carpenter carpenter what are
you doing down there come on deck come on deck

whereupon doctor long ghost cries out in a squeak ah miss guy is
that you now my dear go right home or you'll get hurt

pooh pooh you sir whoever you are i was not speaking to you
none of your nonsense mr jermin i was talking to you have the
kindness to come on deck sir i want to see you

and how in the devil's name am i to get there cried the mate
furiously jump down here captain guy and show yourself a man let
me up you chips unhand me i say oh i'll pay you for this some
day come on captain guy

at this appeal the poor man was seized with a perfect spasm of
fidgets pooh pooh carpenter have done with your nonsense let
him up sir let him up do you hear let mr jermm come on deck

go along with you paper jack replied beauty this quarrel's
between the mate and me so go aft where you belong

as the captain once more dipped his head down the scuttle to make
answer from an unseen hand he received full in the face the
contents of a tin can of soaked biscuit and tea-leaves the doctor
was not far off just then without waiting for anything more the
discomfited gentleman with both hands to his streaming face
retreated to the quarter-deck

a few moments more and jermin forced to a compromise followed
after in his torn frock and scarred face looking for all the world
as if he had just disentangled himself from some intricate piece of
machinery for about half an hour both remained in the cabin where
the mate's rough tones were heard high above the low smooth voice of
the captain

of all his conflicts with the men this was the first in which jermin
had been worsted and he was proportionably enraged upon going
below as the steward afterward told us he bluntly informed guy
that for the future he might look out for his ship himself for his
part he had done with her if that was the way he allowed his
officers to be treated after many high words the captain finally
assured him that the first fitting opportunity the carpenter should
be cordially flogged though as matters stood the experiment would
be a hazardous one upon this jermin reluctantly consented to drop
the matter for the present and he soon drowned all thoughts of it in
a can of flip which guy had previously instructed the steward to
prepare as a sop to allay his wrath

nothing more ever came of this



chapter v

what happened at hytyhoo

less than forty-eight hours after leaving nukuheva the blue looming
island of st christina greeted us from afar drawing near the
shore the grim black spars and waspish hull of a small man-of-war
craft crept into view the masts and yards lined distinctly against
the sky she was riding to her anchor in the bay and proved to be a
french corvette

this pleased our captain exceedingly and coming on deck he examined
her from the mizzen rigging with his glass his original intention
was not to let go an anchor but counting upon the assistance of the
corvette in case of any difficulty he now changed his mind and
anchored alongside of her as soon as a boat could be lowered he
then went off to pay his respects to the commander and moreover as
we supposed to concert measures for the apprehension of the
runaways

returning in the course of twenty minutes he brought along with him
two officers in undress and whiskers and three or four drunken
obstreperous old chiefs one with his legs thrust into the armholes
of a scarlet vest another with a pair of spurs on his heels and a
third in a cocked hat and feather in addition to these articles
they merely wore the ordinary costume of their race a slip of native
cloth about the loins indecorous as their behaviour was these
worthies turned out to be a deputation from the reverend the clergy
of the island and the object of their visit was to put our ship
under a rigorous taboo to prevent the disorderly scenes and
facilities for desertion which would ensue were the natives men and
women allowed to come off to us freely

there was little ceremony about the matter the priests went aside for
a moment laid their shaven old crowns together and went over a
little mummery whereupon their leader tore a long strip from his
girdle of white tappa and handed it to one of the french officers
who after explaining what was to be done gave it to jermin the
mate at once went out to the end of the flying jib boom and fastened
there the mystic symbol of the ban this put to flight a party of
girls who had been observed swimming toward us tossing their arms
about and splashing the water like porpoises with loud cries of
taboo taboo they turned about and made for the shore

the night of our arrival the mate and the mowree were to stand watch
and watch relieving each other every four hours the crew as is
sometimes customary when lying at an anchor being allowed to remain
all night below a distrust of the men however was in the present
instance the principal reason for this proceeding indeed it was
all but certain that some kind of attempt would be made at
desertion and therefore when jermin's first watch came on at eight
bells midnight by which time all was quiet he mounted to the deck
with a flask of spirits in one hand and the other in readiness to
assail the first countenance that showed itself above the forecastle
scuttle

thus prepared he doubtless meant to stay awake but for all that he
before long fell asleep and slept with such hearty good-will too
that the men who left us that night might have been waked up by his
snoring certain it was the mate snored most strangely and no
wonder with that crooked bugle of his when he came to himself it
was just dawn but quite light enough to show two boats gone from the
side in an instant he knew what had happened

dragging the mowree out of an old sail where he was napping he
ordered him to clear away another boat and then darted into the
cabin to tell the captain the news springing on deck again he
drove down into the forecastle for a couple of oarsmen but hardly
got there before there was a cry and a loud splash heard over the
side it was the mowree and the boat into which he had just leaped
to get ready for lowering rolling over and over in the water

the boat having at nightfall been hoisted up to its place over the
starboard quarter someone had so cut the tackles which held it
there that a moderate strain would at once part them bembo's weight
had answered the purpose showing that the deserters must have
ascertained his specific gravity to a fibre of hemp there was
another boat remaining but it was as well to examine it before
attempting to lower and it was well they did for there was a hole
in the bottom large enough to drop a barrel through she had been
scuttled most ruthlessly

jermin was frantic dashing his hat upon deck he was about to plunge
overboard and swim to the corvette for a cutter when captain guy
made his appearance and begged him to stay where he was by this time
the officer of the deck aboard the frenchman had noticed our
movements and hailed to know what had happened guy informed him
through his trumpet and men to go in pursuit were instantly
promised there was a whistling of a boatswain's pipe an order or
two and then a large cutter pulled out from the man-of-war's stern
and in half a dozen strokes was alongside the mate leaped into her
and they pulled rapidly ashore

another cutter carrying an armed crew soon followed

in an hour's time the first returned towing the two whale-boats
which had been found turned up like tortoises on the beach

noon came and nothing more was heard from the deserters meanwhile
doctor long ghost and myself lounged about cultivating an
acquaintance and gazing upon the shore scenery the bay was as calm
as death the sun high and hot and occasionally a still gliding
canoe stole out from behind the headlands and shot across the water

and all the morning long our sick men limped about the deck casting
wistful glances inland where the palm-trees waved and beckoned them
into their reviving shades poor invalid rascals how conducive to
the restoration of their shattered health would have been those
delicious groves but hard-hearted jermin assured them with an oath
that foot of theirs should never touch the beach

toward sunset a crowd was seen coming down to the water in advance of
all were the fugitives bareheaded their frocks and trousers hanging
in tatters every face covered with blood and dust and their arms
pinioned behind them with green thongs following them up was a
shouting rabble of islanders pricking them with the points of their
long spears the party from the corvette menacing them in flank with
their naked cutlasses

the bonus of a musket to the king of the bay and the promise of a
tumblerful of powder for every man caught had set the whole
population on their track and so successful was the hunt that not
only were that morning's deserters brought back but five of those
left behind on a former visit the natives however were the mere
hounds of the chase raising the game in their coverts but leaving
the securing of it to the frenchmen here as elsewhere the
islanders have no idea of taking part in such a scuffle as ensues
upon the capture of a party of desperate seamen

the runaways were at once brought aboard and though they looked
rather sulky soon came round and treated the whole affair as a
frolicsome adventure

fearful of spending another night at hytyhoo captain guy caused the
ship to be got under way shortly after dark

the next morning when all supposed that we were fairly embarked for a
long cruise our course was suddenly altered for la dominica or
hivarhoo an island just north of the one we had quitted the object
of this as we learned was to procure if possible several english
sailors who according to the commander of the corvette had
recently gone ashore there from an american whaler and were desirous
of shipping aboard one of their own country vessels

we made the land in the afternoon coming abreast of a shady glen
opening from a deep bay and winding by green denies far out of
sight hands by the weather-main-brace roared the mate jumping up
on the bulwarks and in a moment the prancing julia suddenly
arrested in her course bridled her head like a steed reined in
while the foam flaked under her bows

this was the place where we expected to obtain the men so a boat was
at once got in readiness to go ashore now it was necessary to
provide a picked crew men the least likely to abscond after
considerable deliberation on the part of the captain and mate four
of the seamen were pitched upon as the most trustworthy or rather
they were selected from a choice assortment of suspicious characters
as being of an inferior order of rascality

armed with cutlasses all round the natives were said to be an ugly
set they were followed over the side by the invalid captain who on
this occasion it seems was determined to signalize himself
accordingly in addition to his cutlass he wore an old boarding
belt in which was thrust a brace of pistols they at once shoved
off

my friend long ghost had among other things which looked somewhat
strange in a ship's forecastle a capital spy-glass and on the
present occasion we had it in use

when the boat neared the head of the inlet though invisible to the
naked eye it was plainly revealed by the glass looking no bigger
than an egg-shell and the men diminished to pigmies

at last borne on what seemed a long flake of foam the tiny craft
shot up the beach amid a shower of sparkles not a soul was there
leaving one of their number by the water the rest of the pigmies
stepped ashore looking about them very circumspectly pausing now
and then hand to ear and peering under a dense grove which swept
down within a few paces of the sea no one came and to all
appearances everything was as still as the grave presently he with
the pistols followed by the rest flourishing their bodkins entered
the wood and were soon lost to view they did not stay long probably
anticipating some inhospitable ambush were they to stray any distance
up the glen

in a few moments they embarked again and were soon riding pertly over
the waves of the bay all of a sudden the captain started to his
feet the boat spun round and again made for the shore some twenty
or thirty natives armed with spears which through the glass looked
like reeds had just come out of the grove and were apparently
shouting to the strangers not to be in such a hurry but return and
be sociable but they were somewhat distrusted for the boat paused
about its length from the beach when the captain standing up in its
head delivered an address in pantomime the object of which seemed to
be that the islanders should draw near one of them stepped forward
and made answer seemingly again urging the strangers not to be
diffident but beach their boat the captain declined tossing his
arms about in another pantomime in the end he said something which
made them shake their spears whereupon he fired a pistol among them
which set the whole party running while one poor little fellow
dropping his spear and clapping his hand behind him limped away in a
manner which almost made me itch to get a shot at his assailant

wanton acts of cruelty like this are not unusual on the part of sea
captains landing at islands comparatively unknown even at the pomotu
group but a day's sail from tahiti the islanders coming down to the
shore have several times been fired at by trading schooners passing
through their narrow channels and this too as a mere amusement on
the part of the ruffians

indeed it is almost incredible the light in which many sailors
regard these naked heathens they hardly consider them human but it
is a curious fact that the more ignorant and degraded men are the
more contemptuously they look upon those whom they deem their
inferiors

all powers of persuasion being thus lost upon these foolish savages
and no hope left of holding further intercourse the boat returned to
the ship



chapter vii

what happened at hannamanoo

on the other side of the island was the large and populous bay of
hannamanoo where the men sought might yet be found but as the sun
was setting by the time the boat came alongside we got our offshore
tacks aboard and stood away for an offing about daybreak we wore
and ran in and by the time the sun was well up entered the long
narrow channel dividing the islands of la dominica and st christina

on one hand was a range of steep green bluffs hundreds of feet high
the white huts of the natives here and there nestling like birds
nests in deep clefts gushing with verdure across the water the
land rolled away in bright hillsides so warm and undulating that
they seemed almost to palpitate in the sun on we swept past bluff
and grove wooded glen and valley and dark ravines lighted up far
inland with wild falls of water a fresh land-breeze filled our
sails the embayed waters were gentle as a lake and every wave broke
with a tinkle against our coppered prow

on gaining the end of the channel we rounded a point and came full
upon the bay of hannamanoo this is the only harbour of any note
about the island though as far as a safe anchorage is concerned it
hardly deserves the title

before we held any communication with the shore an incident occurred
which may convey some further idea of the character of our crew

having approached as near the land as we could prudently our headway
was stopped and we awaited the arrival of a canoe which was coming
out of the bay all at once we got into a strong current which swept
us rapidly toward a rocky promontory forming one side of the harbour
the wind had died away so two boats were at once lowered for the
purpose of pulling the ship's head round before this could be done
the eddies were whirling upon all sides and the rock so near that it
seemed as if one might leap upon it from the masthead notwithstanding
the speechless fright of the captain and the hoarse shouts of the
unappalled jennin the men handled the ropes as deliberately as
possible some of them chuckling at the prospect of going ashore and
others so eager for the vessel to strike that they could hardly
contain themselves unexpectedly a countercurrent befriended us and
assisted by the boats we were soon out of danger

what a disappointment for our crew all their little plans for
swimming ashore from the wreck and having a fine time of it for the
rest of their days thus cruelly nipped in the bud

soon after the canoe came alongside in it were eight or ten natives
comely vivacious-looking youths all gesture and exclamation the
red feathers in their head-bands perpetually nodding with them also
came a stranger a renegade from christendom and humanity a white
man in the south sea girdle and tattooed in the face a broad blue
band stretched across his face from ear to ear and on his forehead
was the taper figure of a blue shark nothing but fins from head to
tail

some of us gazed upon this man with a feeling akin to horror no ways
abated when informed that he had voluntarily submitted to this
embellishment of his countenance what an impress far worse than
cain's his was perhaps a wrinkle or a freckle which some of our
modern cosmetics might have effaced but the blue shark was a mark
indelible which all the waters of abana and pharpar rivers of
damascus could never wash out he was an englishman lem hardy he
called himself who had deserted from a trading brig touching at the
island for wood and water some ten years previous he had gone ashore
as a sovereign power armed with a musket and a bag of ammunition and
ready if need were to prosecute war on his own account the country
was divided by the hostile kings of several large valleys with one
of them from whom he first received overtures he formed an
alliance and became what he now was the military leader of the
tribe and war-god of the entire island

his campaigns beat napoleon's in one night attack his invincible
musket backed by the light infantry of spears and javelins
vanquished two clans and the next morning brought all the others to
the feet of his royal ally

nor was the rise of his domestic fortunes at all behind the
corsican's three days after landing the exquisitely tattooed hand
of a princess was his receiving along with the damsel as her
portion one thousand fathoms of fine tappa fifty double-braided
mats of split grass four hundred hogs ten houses in different parts
of her native valley and the sacred protection of an express edict
of the taboo declaring his person inviolable for ever

now this man was settled for life perfectly satisfied with his
circumstances and feeling no desire to return to his friends

friends indeed he had none he told me his history thrown upon
the world a foundling his paternal origin was as much a mystery to
him as the genealogy of odin and scorned by everybody he fled the
parish workhouse when a boy and launched upon the sea he had
followed it for several years a dog before the mast and now he had
thrown it up for ever

and for the most part it is just this sort of men so many of whom
are found among sailors uncared for by a single soul without ties
reckless and impatient of the restraints of civilization who are
occasionally found quite at home upon the savage islands of the
pacific and glancing at their hard lot in their own country what
marvel at their choice

according to the renegado there was no other white man on the island
and as the captain could have no reason to suppose that hardy
intended to deceive us he concluded that the frenchmen were in some
way or other mistaken in what they had told us however when our
errand was made known to the rest of our visitors one of them a
fine stalwart fellow his face all eyes and expression volunteered
for a cruise all the wages he asked was a red shirt a pair of
trousers and a hat which were to be put on there and then besides
a plug of tobacco and a pipe the bargain was struck directly but
wymontoo afterward came in with a codicil to the effect that a
friend of his who had come along with him should be given ten whole
sea-biscuits without crack or flaw twenty perfectly new and
symmetrically straight nails and one jack-knife this being agreed
to the articles were at once handed over the native receiving them
with great avidity and in the absence of clothing using his mouth as
a pocket to put the nails in two of them however were first made
to take the place of a pair of ear-ornaments curiously fashioned out
of bits of whitened wood

it now began breezing strongly from seaward and no time was to be
lost in getting away from the land so after an affecting rubbing of
noses between our new shipmate and his countrymen we sailed away
with him

to our surprise the farewell shouts from the canoe as we dashed
along under bellied royals were heard unmoved by our islander but
it was not long thus that very evening when the dark blue of his
native hills sunk in the horizon the poor savage leaned over the
bulwarks dropped his head upon his chest and gave way to
irrepressible emotions the ship was plunging hard and wymontoo sad
to tell in addition to his other pangs was terribly sea-sick



chapter viii

the tattooers of la dominica

for a while leaving little jule to sail away by herself i will here
put down some curious information obtained from hardy

the renegado had lived so long on the island that its customs were
quite familiar and i much lamented that from the shortness of our
stay he could not tell us more than he did

from the little intelligence gathered however i learned to my
surprise that in some things the people of hivarhoo though of the
same group of islands differed considerably from my tropical friends
in the valley of typee

as his tattooing attracted so much remark hardy had a good deal to
say concerning the manner in which that art was practised upon the
island

throughout the entire cluster the tattooers of hivarhoo enjoyed no
small reputation they had carried their art to the highest
perfection and the profession was esteemed most honourable no
wonder then that like genteel tailors they rated their services
very high so much so that none but those belonging to the higher
classes could afford to employ them so true was this that the
elegance of one's tattooing was in most cases a sure indication of
birth and riches

professors in large practice lived in spacious houses divided by
screens of tappa into numerous little apartments where subjects were
waited upon in private the arrangement chiefly grew out of a
singular ordinance of the taboo which enjoined the strictest privacy
upon all men high and low while under the hands of a tattooer for
the time the slightest intercourse with others is prohibited and the
small portion of food allowed is pushed under the curtain by an
unseen hand the restriction with regard to food is intended to
reduce the blood so as to diminish the inflammation consequent upon
puncturing the skin as it is this comes on very soon and takes
some time to heal so that the period of seclusion generally embraces
many days sometimes several weeks

all traces of soreness vanished the subject goes abroad but only
again to return for on account of the pain only a small surface
can be operated upon at once and as the whole body is to be more or
less embellished by a process so slow the studios alluded to are
constantly filled indeed with a vanity elsewhere unheard of many
spend no small portion of their days thus sitting to an artist

to begin the work the period of adolescence is esteemed the most
suitable after casting about for some eminent tattooer the friends
of the youth take him to his house to have the outlines of the
general plan laid out it behoves the professor to have a nice eye
for a suit to be worn for life should be well cut

some tattooers yearning after perfection employ at large wages one
or two men of the commonest order vile fellows utterly regardless
of appearances upon whom they first try their patterns and practise
generally their backs remorselessly scrawled over and no more
canvas remaining they are dismissed and ever after go about the
scorn of their countrymen

hapless wights thus martyred in the cause of the fine arts

beside the regular practitioners there are a parcel of shabby
itinerant tattooers who by virtue of their calling stroll
unmolested from one hostile bay to another doing their work
dog-cheap for the multitude they always repair to the various
religious festivals which gather great crowds when these are
concluded and the places where they are held vacated even by the
tattooers scores of little tents of coarse tappa are left standing
each with a solitary inmate who forbidden to talk to his unseen
neighbours is obliged to stay there till completely healed the
itinerants are a reproach to their profession mere cobblers dealing
in nothing but jagged lines and clumsy patches and utterly incapable
of soaring to those heights of fancy attained by the gentlemen of the
faculty

all professors of the arts love to fraternize and so in hannamanoo
the tattooers came together in the chapters of their worshipful
order in this society duly organized and conferring degrees
hardy from his influence as a white was a sort of honorary grand
master the blue shark and a sort of urim and thummim engraven upon
his chest were the seal of his initiation all over hivarhoo are
established these orders of tattooers the way in which the renegado's
came to be founded is this a year or two after his landing there
happened to be a season of scarcity owing to the partial failure of
the breadfruit harvest for several consecutive seasons this brought
about such a falling off in the number of subjects for tattooing that
the profession became quite needy the royal ally of hardy however
hit upon a benevolent expedient to provide for their wants at the
same time conferring a boon upon many of his subjects

by sound of conch-shell it was proclaimed before the palace on the
beach and at the head of the valley that noomai king of
hannamanoo and friend of hardee-hardee the white kept open heart
and table for all tattooers whatsoever but to entitle themselves to
this hospitality they were commanded to practise without fee upon
the meanest native soliciting their services

numbers at once flocked to the royal abode both artists and sitters
it was a famous time and the buildings of the palace being taboo
to all but the tattooers and chiefs the sitters bivouacked on the
common and formed an extensive encampment

the lora tattoo or the time of tattooing will be long remembered
an enthusiastic sitter celebrated the event in verse several lines
were repeated to us by hardy some of which in a sort of colloquial
chant he translated nearly thus

 where is that sound
 in hannamanoo
 and wherefore that sound
 the sound of a hundred hammers
 tapping tapping tapping
 the shark teeth

 where is that light
 round about the king's house
 and the small laughter
 the small merry laughter it is
 of the sons and daughters of the tattooed



chapter ix

we steer to the westward state of affairs

the night we left hannamanoo was bright and starry and so warm that
when the watches were relieved most of the men instead of going
below flung themselves around the foremast

toward morning finding the heat of the forecastle unpleasant i
ascended to the deck where everything was noiseless the trades were
blowing with a mild steady strain upon the canvas and the ship
heading right out into the immense blank of the western pacific the
watch were asleep with one foot resting on the rudder even the man
at the helm nodded and the mate himself with arms folded was
leaning against the capstan

on such a night and all alone reverie was inevitable i leaned over
the side and could not help thinking of the strange objects we might
be sailing over

but my meditations were soon interrupted by a gray spectral shadow
cast over the heaving billows it was the dawn soon followed by the
first rays of the morning they flashed into view at one end of the
arched night like to compare great things with small the gleamings
of guy fawkes's lantern in the vaults of the parliament house
before long what seemed a live ember rested for a moment on the rim
of the ocean and at last the blood-red sun stood full and round in
the level east and the long sea-day began

breakfast over the first thing attended to was the formal baptism of
wymontoo who after thinking over his affairs during the night
looked dismal enough

there were various opinions as to a suitable appellation some
maintained that we ought to call him sunday that being the day we
caught him others eighteen forty-two the then year of our lord
while doctor long ghost remarked that he ought by all means to
retain his original name wymontoo-hee meaning as he maintained
in the figurative language of the island something analogous to one
who had got himself into a scrape the mate put an end to the
discussion by sousing the poor fellow with a bucket of salt water
and bestowing upon him the nautical appellation of luff

though a certain mirthfulness succeeded his first pangs at leaving
home wymontoo we will call him thus gradually relapsed into his
former mood and became very melancholy often i noticed him
crouching apart in the forecastle his strange eyes gleaming
restlessly and watching the slightest movement of the men many a
time he must have been thinking of his bamboo hut when they were
talking of sydney and its dance-houses

we were now fairly at sea though to what particular cruising-ground
we were going no one knew and to all appearances few cared the
men after a fashion of their own began to settle down into the
routine of sea-life as if everything was going on prosperously
blown along over a smooth sea there was nothing to do but steer the
ship and relieve the look-outs at the mast-heads as for the sick
they had two or three more added to their number the air of the
island having disagreed with the constitutions of several of the
runaways to crown all the captain again relapsed and became quite
ill

the men fit for duty were divided into two small watches headed
respectively by the mate and the mowree the latter by virtue of his
being a harpooner succeeding to the place of the second mate who
had absconded

in this state of things whaling was out of the question but in the
face of everything jermin maintained that the invalids would soon be
well however that might be with the same pale hue sky overhead we
kept running steadily to the westward forever advancing we seemed
always in the same place and every day was the former lived over
again we saw no ships expected to see none no sign of life was
perceptible but the porpoises and other fish sporting under the bows
like pups ashore but at intervals the gray albatross peculiar to
these seas came flapping his immense wings over us and then skimmed
away silently as if from a plague-ship or flights of the tropic
bird known among seamen as the boatswain wheeled round and round
us whistling shrilly as they flew

the uncertainty hanging over our destination at this time and the
fact that we were abroad upon waters comparatively little traversed
lent an interest to this portion of the cruise which i shall never
forget

from obvious prudential considerations the pacific has been
principally sailed over in known tracts and this is the reason why
new islands are still occasionally discovered by exploring ships and
adventurous whalers notwithstanding the great number of vessels of
all kinds of late navigating this vast ocean indeed considerable
portions still remain wholly unexplored and there is doubt as to the
actual existence of certain shoals and reefs and small clusters of
islands vaguely laid down in the charts the mere circumstance
therefore of a ship like ours penetrating into these regions was
sufficient to cause any reflecting mind to feel at least a little
uneasy for my own part the many stories i had heard of ships
striking at midnight upon unknown rocks with all sail set and a
slumbering crew often recurred to me especially as from the
absence of discipline and our being so shorthanded the watches at
night were careless in the extreme

but no thoughts like these were entertained by my reckless shipmates
and along we went the sun every evening setting right ahead of our
jib boom

for what reason the mate was so reserved with regard to our precise
destination was never made known the stories he told us i for one
did not believe deeming them all a mere device to lull the crew

he said we were bound to a fine cruising ground scarcely known to
other whalemen which he had himself discovered when commanding a
small brig upon a former voyage here the sea was alive with large
whales so tame that all you had to do was to go up and kill them
they were too frightened to resist a little to leeward of this was a
small cluster of islands where we were going to refit abounding with
delicious fruits and peopled by a race almost wholly unsophisticated
by intercourse with strangers

in order perhaps to guard against the possibility of anyone finding
out the precise latitude and longitude of the spot we were going to
jermin never revealed to us the ship's place at noon though such is
the custom aboard of most vessels

meanwhile he was very assiduous in his attention to the invalids
doctor long ghost having given up the keys of the medicine-chest
they were handed over to him and as physician he discharged his
duties to the satisfaction of all pills and powders in most cases
were thrown to the fish and in place thereof the contents of a
mysterious little quarter cask were produced diluted with water from
the butt his draughts were mixed on the capstan in cocoa-nut
shells marked with the patients names like shore doctors he did
not eschew his own medicines for his professional calls in the
forecastle were sometimes made when he was comfortably tipsy nor did
he omit keeping his invalids in good-humour spinning his yarns to
them by the hour whenever he went to see them

owing to my lameness from which i soon began to recover i did no
active duty except standing an occasional trick at the helm it
was in the forecastle chiefly that i spent my time in company with
the long doctor who was at great pains to make himself agreeable
his books though sadly torn and tattered were an invaluable
resource i read them through again and again including a learned
treatise on the yellow fever in addition to these he had an old
file of sydney papers and i soon became intimately acquainted with
the localities of all the advertising tradesmen there in particular
the rhetorical flourishes of stubbs the real-estate auctioneer
diverted me exceedingly and i set him down as no other than a pupil
of robins the londoner

aside from the pleasure of his society my intimacy with long ghost
was of great service to me in other respects his disgrace in the
cabin only confirmed the good-will of the democracy in the
forecastle and they not only treated him in the most friendly
manner but looked up to him with the utmost deference besides
laughing heartily at all his jokes as his chosen associate this
feeling for him extended to me and gradually we came to be regarded
in the light of distinguished guests at meal-times we were always
first served and otherwise were treated with much respect

among other devices to kill time during the frequent calms long
ghost hit upon the game of chess with a jack-knife we carved the
pieces quite tastefully out of bits of wood and our board was the
middle of a chest-lid chalked into squares which in playing we
straddled at either end having no other suitable way of
distinguishing the sets i marked mine by tying round them little
scarfs of black silk torn from an old neck-handkerchief putting
them in mourning this way the doctor said was quite appropriate
seeing that they had reason to feel sad three games out of four of
chess the men never could make head nor tail indeed their wonder
rose to such a pitch that they at last regarded the mysterious
movements of the game with something more than perplexity and after
puzzling over them through several long engagements they came to the
conclusion that we must be a couple of necromancers



chapter x

a sea-parlour described with some of its tenants

i might as well give some idea of the place in which the doctor and i
lived together so sociably

most persons know that a ship's forecastle embraces the forward part
of the deck about the bowsprit the same term however is generally
bestowed upon the sailors sleeping-quarters which occupy a space
immediately beneath and are partitioned off by a bulkhead

planted right in the bows or as sailors say in the very eyes of the
ship this delightful apartment is of a triangular shape and is
generally fitted with two tiers of rude bunks those of the julia
were in a most deplorable condition mere wrecks some having been
torn down altogether to patch up others and on one side there were
but two standing but with most of the men it made little difference
whether they had a bunk or not since having no bedding they had
nothing to put in it but themselves

upon the boards of my own crib i spread all the old canvas and old
clothes i could pick up for a pillow i wrapped an old jacket round
a log this helped a little the wear and tear of one's bones when the
ship rolled

rude hammocks made out of old sails were in many cases used as
substitutes for the demolished bunks but the space they swung in was
so confined that they were far from being agreeable

the general aspect of the forecastle was dungeon-like and dingy in the
extreme in the first place it was not five feet from deck to deck
and even this space was encroached upon by two outlandish
cross-timbers bracing the vessel and by the sailors chests over
which you must needs crawl in getting about at meal-times and
especially when we indulged in after-dinner chat we sat about the
chests like a parcel of tailors

in the middle of all were two square wooden columns denominated in
marine architecture bowsprit bitts they were about a foot apart
and between them by a rusty chain swung the forecastle lamp
burning day and night and forever casting two long black shadows
lower down between the bitts was a locker or sailors pantry kept
in abominable disorder and sometimes requiring a vigorous cleaning
and fumigation

all over the ship was in a most dilapidated condition but in the
forecastle it looked like the hollow of an old tree going to decay
in every direction the wood was damp and discoloured and here and
there soft and porous moreover it was hacked and hewed without
mercy the cook frequently helping himself to splinters for
kindling-wood from the bitts and beams overhead every carline was
sooty and here and there deep holes were burned in them a freak of
some drunken sailors on a voyage long previous

from above you entered by a plank with two elects slanting down
from the scuttle which was a mere hole in the deck there being no
slide to draw over in case of emergency the tarpaulin temporarily
placed there was little protection from the spray heaved over the
bows so that in anything of a breeze the place was miserably wet
in a squall the water fairly poured down in sheets like a cascade
swashing about and afterward spirting up between the chests like the
jets of a fountain

such were our accommodations aboard of the julia but bad as they
were we had not the undisputed possession of them myriads of
cockroaches and regiments of rats disputed the place with us a
greater calamity than this can scarcely befall a vessel in the south
seas

so warm is the climate that it is almost impossible to get rid of
them you may seal up every hatchway and fumigate the hull till the
smoke forces itself out at the seams and enough will survive to
repeople the ship in an incredibly short period in some vessels the
crews of which after a hard fight have given themselves up as it
were for lost the vermin seem to take actual possession the
sailors being mere tenants by sufferance with sperm whalemen
hanging about the line as many of them do for a couple of years on a
stretch it is infinitely worse than with other vessels

as for the julia these creatures never had such free and easy times
as they did in her crazy old hull every chink and cranny swarmed
with them they did not live among you but you among them so true
was this that the business of eating and drinking was better done in
the dark than in the light of day

concerning the cockroaches there was an extraordinary phenomenon for
which none of us could ever account

every night they had a jubilee the first symptom was an unusual
clustering and humming among the swarms lining the beams overhead
and the inside of the sleeping-places this was succeeded by a
prodigious coming and going on the part of those living out of sight
presently they all came forth the larger sort racing over the chests
and planks winged monsters darting to and fro in the air and the
small fry buzzing in heaps almost in a state of fusion

on the first alarm all who were able darted on deck while some of
the sick who were too feeble lay perfectly quiet the distracted
vermin running over them at pleasure the performance lasted some
ten minutes during which no hive ever hummed louder often it was
lamented by us that the time of the visitation could never be
predicted it was liable to come upon us at any hour of the night and
what a relief it was when it happened to fall in the early part of
the evening

nor must i forget the rats they did not forget me tame as trenck's
mouse they stood in their holes peering at you like old grandfathers
in a doorway often they darted in upon us at meal-times and nibbled
our food the first time they approached wymontoo he was actually
frightened but becoming accustomed to it he soon got along with
them much better than the rest with curious dexterity he seized the
animals by their legs and flung them up the scuttle to find a watery
grave

but i have a story of my own to tell about these rats one day the
cabin steward made me a present of some molasses which i was so
choice of that i kept it hid away in a tin can in the farthest corner
of my bunk faring as we did this molasses dropped upon a biscuit
was a positive luxury which i shared with none but the doctor and
then only in private and sweet as the treacle was how could bread
thus prepared and eaten in secret be otherwise than pleasant

one night our precious can ran low and in canting it over in the
dark something beside the molasses slipped out how long it had been
there kind providence never revealed nor were we over anxious to
know for we hushed up the bare thought as quickly as possible the
creature certainly died a luscious death quite equal to clarence's
in the butt of malmsey



chapter xi

doctor long ghost a wag one of his capers

grave though he was at times doctor long ghost was a decided wag

everyone knows what lovers of fun sailors are ashore afloat they are
absolutely mad after it so his pranks were duly appreciated

the poor old black cook unlashing his hammock for the night and
finding a wet log fast asleep in it and then waking in the morning
with his woolly head tarred opening his coppers and finding an old
boot boiling away as saucy as could be and sometimes cakes of pitch
candying in his oven

baltimore's tribulations were indeed sore there was no peace for him
day nor night poor fellow he was altogether too good-natured say
what they will about easy-tempered people it is far better on some
accounts to have the temper of a wolf whoever thought of taking
liberties with gruff black dan

the most curious of the doctor's jokes was hoisting the men aloft by
the foot or shoulder when they fell asleep on deck during the
night-watches

ascending from the forecastle on one occasion he found every soul
napping and forthwith went about his capers fastening a rope's end
to each sleeper he rove the lines through a number of blocks and
conducted them all to the windlass then by heaving round cheerily
in spite of cries and struggles he soon had them dangling aloft in
all directions by arms and legs waked by the uproar we rushed up
from below and found the poor fellows swinging in the moonlight from
the tops and lower yard-arms like a parcel of pirates gibbeted at
sea by a cruiser

connected with this sort of diversion was another prank of his during
the night some of those on deck would come below to light a pipe or
take a mouthful of beef and biscuit sometimes they fell asleep and
being missed directly that anything was to be done their shipmates
often amused themselves by running them aloft with a pulley dropped
down the scuttle from the fore-top

one night when all was perfectly still i lay awake in the
forecastle the lamp was burning low and thick and swinging from its
blackened beam and with the uniform motion of the ship the men in
the bunks rolled slowly from side to side the hammocks swaying in
unison

presently i heard a foot upon the ladder and looking up saw a wide
trousers leg immediately navy bob a stout old triton stealthily
descended and at once went to groping in the locker after something
to eat

supper ended he proceeded to load his pipe now for a good
comfortable smoke at sea there never was a better place than the
julia's forecastle at midnight to enjoy the luxury one wants to
fall into a kind of dreamy reverie only known to the children of the
weed and the very atmosphere of the place laden as it was with the
snores of the sleepers was inducive of this no wonder then that
after a while bob's head sunk upon his breast presently his hat fell
off the extinguished pipe dropped from his mouth and the next
moment he lay out on the chest as tranquil as an infant

suddenly an order was heard on deck followed by the trampling of feet
and the hauling of rigging the yards were being braced and soon
after the sleeper was missed for there was a whispered conference
over the scuttle

directly a shadow glided across the forecastle and noiselessly
approached the unsuspecting bob it was one of the watch with the end
of a rope leading out of sight up the scuttle pausing an instant
the sailor pressed softly the chest of his victim sounding his
slumbers and then hitching the cord to his ankle returned to the
deck

hardly was his back turned when a long limb was thrust from a hammock
opposite and doctor long ghost leaping forth warily whipped the
rope from bob's ankle and fastened it like lightning to a great
lumbering chest the property of the man who had just disappeared

scarcely was the thing done when lo with a thundering bound the
clumsy box was torn from its fastenings and banging from side to
side flew toward the scuttle here it jammed and thinking that bob
who was as strong as a windlass was grappling a beam and trying to
cut the line the jokers on deck strained away furiously on a
sudden the chest went aloft and striking against the mast flew
open raining down on the heads of a party the merciless shower of
things too numerous to mention

of course the uproar roused all hands and when we hurried on deck
there was the owner of the box looking aghast at its scattered
contents and with one wandering hand taking the altitude of a bump
on his head



chapter xii

death and burial of two of the crew

the mirthfulness which at times reigned among us was in strange and
shocking contrast with the situation of some of the invalids thus at
least did it seem to me though not to others

but an event occurred about this period which in removing by far the
most pitiable cases of suffering tended to make less grating to my
feelings the subsequent conduct of the crew

we had been at sea about twenty days when two of the sick who had
rapidly grown worse died one night within an hour of each other

one occupied a bunk right next to mine and for several days had not
risen from it during this period he was often delirious starting
up and glaring around him and sometimes wildly tossing his arms

on the night of his decease i retired shortly after the middle watch
began and waking from a vague dream of horrors felt something
clammy resting on me it was the sick man's hand two or three times
during the evening previous he had thrust it into my bunk and i had
quietly removed it but now i started and flung it from me the arm
fell stark and stiff and i knew that he was dead

waking the men the corpse was immediately rolled up in the strips of
blanketing upon which it lay and carried on deck the mate was then
called and preparations made for an instantaneous burial laying
the body out on the forehatch it was stitched up in one of the
hammocks some kentledge being placed at the feet instead of shot
this done it was borne to the gangway and placed on a plank laid
across the bulwarks two men supported the inside end by way of
solemnity the ship's headway was then stopped by hauling aback the
main-top-sail

the mate who was far from being sober then staggered up and holding
on to a shroud gave the word as the plank tipped the body slid off
slowly and fell with a splash into the sea a bubble or two and
nothing more was seen

brace forward the main-yard swung round to its place and the ship
glided on whilst the corpse perhaps was still sinking

we had tossed a shipmate to the sharks but no one would have thought
it to have gone among the crew immediately after the dead man had
been a churlish unsocial fellow while alive and no favourite and
now that he was no more little thought was bestowed upon him all
that was said was concerning the disposal of his chest which having
been always kept locked was supposed to contain money someone
volunteered to break it open and distribute its contents clothing
and all before the captain should demand it

while myself and others were endeavouring to dissuade them from this
all started at a cry from the forecastle there could be no one there
but two of the sick unable to crawl on deck we went below and
found one of them dying on a chest he had fallen out of his hammock
in a fit and was insensible the eyes were open and fixed and his
breath coming and going convulsively the men shrunk from him but
the doctor taking his hand held it a few moments in his and
suddenly letting it fall exclaimed he's gone the body was
instantly borne up the ladder

another hammock was soon prepared and the dead sailor stitched up as
before some additional ceremony however was now insisted upon
and a bible was called for but none was to be had not even a prayer
book when this was made known antone a portuguese from the
cape-de-verd islands stepped up muttering something over the corpse
of his countryman and with his finger described upon the back of
the hammock the figure of a large cross whereupon it received the
death-launch

these two men both perished from the proverbial indiscretions of
seamen heightened by circumstances apparent but had either of them
been ashore under proper treatment he would in all human
probability have recovered

behold here the fate of a sailor they give him the last toss and no
one asks whose child he was

for the rest of that night there was no more sleep many stayed on
deck until broad morning relating to each other those marvellous
tales of the sea which the occasion was calculated to call forth
little as i believed in such things i could not listen to some of
these stories unaffected above all was i struck by one of the
carpenter's

on a voyage to india they had a fever aboard which carried off
nearly half the crew in the space of a few days after this the men
never went aloft in the night-time except in couples when topsails
were to be reefed phantoms were seen at the yard-arm ends and in
tacking ship voices called aloud from the tops the carpenter
himself going with another man to furl the main-top-gallant-sail in a
squall was nearly pushed from the rigging by an unseen hand and his
shipmate swore that a wet hammock was flirted in his face

stories like these were related as gospel truths by those who
declared themselves eye-witnesses

it is a circumstance not generally known perhaps that among ignorant
seamen philanders or finns as they are more commonly called are
regarded with peculiar superstition for some reason or other which
i never could get at they are supposed to possess the gift of second
sight and the power to wreak supernatural vengeance upon those who
offend them on this account they have great influence among sailors
and two or three with whom i have sailed at different times were
persons well calculated to produce this sort of impression at least
upon minds disposed to believe in such things

now we had one of these sea-prophets aboard an old yellow-haired
fellow who always wore a rude seal-skin cap of his own make and
carried his tobacco in a large pouch made of the same stuff van as
we called him was a quiet inoffensive man to look at and among
such a set his occasional peculiarities had hitherto passed for
nothing at this time however he came out with a prediction which
was none the less remarkable from its absolute fulfilment though not
exactly in the spirit in which it was given out

the night of the burial he laid his hand on the old horseshoe nailed
as a charm to the foremast and solemnly told us that in less than
three weeks not one quarter of our number would remain aboard the
ship by that time they would have left her for ever

some laughed flash jack called him an old fool but among the men
generally it produced a marked effect for several days a degree of
quiet reigned among us and allusions of such a kind were made to
recent events as could be attributed to no other cause than the
finn's omen

for my own part what had lately come to pass was not without its
influence it forcibly brought to mind our really critical condition
doctor long ghost too frequently revealed his apprehensions and
once assured me that he would give much to be safely landed upon any
island around us

where we were exactly no one but the mate seemed to know nor
whither we were going the captain a mere cipher was an invalid in
his cabin to say nothing more of so many of his men languishing in
the forecastle

our keeping the sea under these circumstances a matter strange enough
at first now seemed wholly unwarranted and added to all was the
thought that our fate was absolutely in the hand of the reckless
jermin were anything to happen to him we would be left without a
navigator for according to jermin himself he had from the
commencement of the voyage always kept the ship's reckoning the
captain's nautical knowledge being insufficient

but considerations like these strange as it may seem seldom or never
occurred to the crew they were alive only to superstitious fears
and when in apparent contradiction to the finn's prophecy the sick
men rallied a little they began to recover their former spirits and
the recollection of what had occurred insensibly faded from their
minds in a week's time the unworthiness of little jule as a sea
vessel always a subject of jest now became more so than ever in the
forecastle flash jack with his knife often dug into the dank
rotten planks ribbed between us and death and flung away the
splinters with some sea joke

as to the remaining invalids they were hardly ill enough to occasion
any serious apprehension at least for the present in the breasts of
such thoughtless beings as themselves and even those who suffered
the most studiously refrained from any expression of pain

the truth is that among sailors as a class sickness at sea is so
heartily detested and the sick so little cared for that the
greatest invalid generally strives to mask his sufferings he has
given no sympathy to others and he expects none in return their
conduct in this respect so opposed to their generous-hearted
behaviour ashore painfully affects the landsman on his first
intercourse with them as a sailor

sometimes but seldom our invalids inveighed against their being kept
at sea where they could be of no service when they ought to be
ashore and in the way of recovery but oh cheer up cheer up my
hearties the mate would say and after this fashion he put a stop
to their murmurings

but there was one circumstance to which heretofore i have but barely
alluded that tended more than anything else to reconcile many to
their situation this was the receiving regularly twice every day a
certain portion of pisco which was served out at the capstan by the
steward in little tin measures called tots

the lively affection seamen have for strong drink is well known but
in the south seas where it is so seldom to be had a thoroughbred
sailor deems scarcely any price too dear which will purchase his
darling tot nowadays american whalemen in the pacific never think
of carrying spirits as a ration and aboard of most of them it is
never served out even in times of the greatest hardships all sydney
whalemen however still cling to the old custom and carry it as a
part of the regular supplies for the voyage

in port the allowance of pisco was suspended with a view
undoubtedly of heightening the attractions of being out of sight of
land

now owing to the absence of proper discipline our sick in addition
to what they took medicinally often came in for their respective
tots convivially and added to all this the evening of the last
day of the week was always celebrated by what is styled on board of
english vessels the saturday-night bottles two of these were sent
down into the forecastle just after dark one for the starboard
watch and the other for the larboard

by prescription the oldest seaman in each claims the treat as his
and accordingly pours out the good cheer and passes it round like a
lord doing the honours of his table but the saturday-night bottles
were not all the carpenter and cooper in sea parlance chips and
bungs who were the cods or leaders of the forecastle in some way
or other managed to obtain an extra supply which perpetually kept
them in fine after-dinner spirits and moreover disposed them to
look favourably upon a state of affairs like the present

but where were the sperm whales all this time in good sooth it made
little matter where they were since we were in no condition to
capture them about this time indeed the men came down from the
mast-heads where until now they had kept up the form of relieving
each other every two hours they swore they would go there no more
upon this the mate carelessly observed that they would soon be where
look-outs were entirely unnecessary the whales he had in his eye
though flash jack said they were all in his being so tame that they
made a practice of coming round ships and scratching their backs
against them

thus went the world of waters with us some four weeks or more after
leaving hannamanoo



chapter xiii

our destination changed

it was not long after the death of the two men that captain guy was
reported as fast declining and in a day or two more as dying the
doctor who previously had refused to enter the cabin upon any
consideration now relented and paid his old enemy a professional
visit

he prescribed a warm bath which was thus prepared the skylight being
removed a cask was lowered down into the cabin and then filled with
buckets of water from the ship's coppers the cries of the patient
when dipped into his rude bath were most painful to hear they at
last laid him on the transom more dead than alive

that evening the mate was perfectly sober and coming forward to the
windlass where we were lounging summoned aft the doctor myself
and two or three others of his favourites when in the presence of
bembo the mowree he spoke to us thus

i have something to say to ye men there's none but bembo here as
belongs aft so i've picked ye out as the best men for'ard to take
counsel with d'ye see consarning the ship the captain's anchor is
pretty nigh atrip i shouldn't wonder if he croaked afore morning so
what's to be done if we have to sew him up some of those pirates
there for'ard may take it into their heads to run off with the ship
because there's no one at the tiller now i've detarmined what's
best to be done but i don't want to do it unless i've good men to
back me and make things all fair and square if ever we get home
again

we all asked what his plan was

i'll tell ye what it is men if the skipper dies all agree to obey
my orders and in less than three weeks i'll engage to have five
hundred barrels of sperm oil under hatches enough to give every
mother's son of ye a handful of dollars when we get to sydney if ye
don't agree to this ye won't have a farthing coming to ye

doctor long ghost at once broke in he said that such a thing was not
to be dreamt of that if the captain died the mate was in duty bound
to navigate the ship to the nearest civilized port and deliver her
up into an english consul's hands when in all probability after a
run ashore the crew would be sent home everything forbade the
mate's plan still said he assuming an air of indifference if
the men say stick it out stick it out say i but in that case the
sooner we get to those islands of yours the better

something more he went on to say and from the manner in which the
rest regarded him it was plain that our fate was in his hands it
was finally resolved upon that if captain guy was no better in
twenty-four hours the ship's head should be pointed for the island
of tahiti

this announcement produced a strong sensation the sick rallied and
the rest speculated as to what was next to befall us while the
doctor without alluding to guy congratulated me upon the prospect
of soon beholding a place so famous as the island in question

the night after the holding of the council i happened to go on deck
in the middle watch and found the yards braced sharp up on the
larboard tack with the south east trades strong on our bow the
captain was no better and we were off for tahiti



chapter xiv

rope yarn

while gliding along on our way i cannot well omit some account of a
poor devil we had among us who went by the name of rope yarn or
ropey

he was a nondescript who had joined the ship as a landsman being so
excessively timid and awkward it was thought useless to try and make
a sailor of him so he was translated into the cabin as steward the
man previously filling that post a good seaman going among the crew
and taking his place but poor ropey proved quite as clumsy among the
crockery as in the rigging and one day when the ship was pitching
having stumbled into the cabin with a wooden tureen of soup he
scalded the officers so that they didn't get over it in a week upon
which he was dismissed and returned to the forecastle

now nobody is so heartily despised as a pusillanimous lazy
good-for-nothing land-lubber a sailor has no bowels of compassion
for him yet useless as such a character may be in many respects a
ship's company is by no means disposed to let him reap any benefit
from his deficiencies regarded in the light of a mechanical power
whenever there is any plain hard work to be done he is put to it
like a lever everyone giving him a pry

then again he is set about all the vilest work is there a heavy job
at tarring to be done he is pitched neck and shoulders into a
tar-barrel and set to work at it moreover he is made to fetch and
carry like a dog like as not if the mate sends him after his
quadrant on the way he is met by the captain who orders him to pick
some oakum and while he is hunting up a bit of rope a sailor comes
along and wants to know what the deuce he's after and bids him be
off to the forecastle

obey the last order is a precept inviolable at sea so the
land-lubber afraid to refuse to do anything rushes about
distracted and does nothing in the end receiving a shower of kicks
and cuffs from all quarters

added to his other hardships he is seldom permitted to open his mouth
unless spoken to and then he might better keep silent alas for
him if he should happen to be anything of a droll for in an evil
hour should he perpetrate a joke he would never know the last of it

the witticisms of others however upon himself must be received in
the greatest good-humour

woe be unto him if at meal-times he so much as look sideways at the
beef-kid before the rest are helped

then he is obliged to plead guilty to every piece of mischief which
the real perpetrator refuses to acknowledge thus taking the place of
that sneaking rascal nobody ashore in short there is no end to his
tribulations

the land-lubber's spirits often sink and the first result of his
being moody and miserable is naturally enough an utter neglect of his
toilet

the sailors perhaps ought to make allowances but heartless as they
are they do not no sooner is his cleanliness questioned than they
rise upon him like a mob of the middle ages upon a jew drag him into
the lee-scuppers and strip him to the buff in vain he bawls for
mercy in vain calls upon the captain to save him

alas i say again for the land-lubber at sea he is the veriest
wretch the watery world over and such was bope tarn of all
landlubbers the most lubberly and most miserable a forlorn
stunted hook-visaged mortal he was too one of those whom you know
at a glance to have been tried hard and long in the furnace of
affliction his face was an absolute puzzle though sharp and sallow
it had neither the wrinkles of age nor the smoothness of youth so
that for the soul of me i could hardly tell whether he was
twenty-five or fifty

but to his history in his better days it seems he had been a
journeyman baker in london somewhere about holborn and on sundays
wore a hue coat and metal buttons and spent his afternoons in a
tavern smoking his pipe and drinking his ale like a free and easy
journeyman baker that he was but this did not last long for an
intermeddling old fool was the ruin of him he was told that london
might do very well for elderly gentlemen and invalids but for a lad
of spirit australia was the land of promise in a dark day ropey
wound up his affairs and embarked

arriving in sydney with a small capital and after a while waxing snug
and comfortable by dint of hard kneading he took unto himself a
wife and so far as she was concerned might then have gone into the
country and retired for she effectually did his business in short
the lady worked him woe in heart and pocket and in the end ran off
with his till and his foreman ropey went to the sign of the pipe and
tankard got fuddled and over his fifth pot meditated suicide an
intention carried out for the next day he shipped as landsman aboard
the julia south seaman

the ex-baker would have fared far better had it not been for his
heart which was soft and underdone a kind word made a fool of him
and hence most of the scrapes he got into two or three wags aware
of his infirmity used to draw him out in conversation whenever the
most crabbed and choleric old seamen were present

to give an instance the watch below just waked from their sleep are
all at breakfast and ropey in one corner is disconsolately
partaking of its delicacies now sailors newly waked are no
cherubs and therefore not a word is spoken everybody munching his
biscuit grim and unshaven at this juncture an affable-looking
scamp flash jack crosses the forecastle tin can in hand and seats
himself beside the land-lubber

hard fare this ropey he begins hard enough too for them that's
known better and lived in lun'nun i say now ropey s'posing you
were back to holborn this morning what would you have for breakfast
eh

have for breakfast cried ropey in a rapture don't speak of it

what ails that fellow here growled an old sea-bear turning round
savagely

oh nothing nothing said jack and then leaning over to rope
yarn he bade him go on but speak lower

well then said he in a smuggled tone his eyes lighting up like
two lanterns well then i'd go to mother moll's that makes the
great muffins i'd go there you know and cock my foot on the ob
and call for a noggin o somethink to begin with

what then ropey

why then flashy continued the poor victim unconsciously warming
with his theme why then i'd draw my chair up and call for betty
the gal wot tends to customers betty my dear says i you looks
charmin this mornin give me a nice rasher of bacon and h'eggs
betty my love and i wants a pint of h'ale and three nice h'ot
muffins and butter and a slice of cheshire and betty i wants 

a shark-steak and be hanged to you roared black dan with an oath
whereupon dragged over the chests the ill-starred fellow is
pummelled on deck

i always made a point of befriending poor ropey when i could and for
this reason was a great favourite of his



chapter xv

chips and bungs

bound into port chips and bungs increased their devotion to the
bottle and to the unspeakable envy of the rest these jolly
companions or the partners as the men called them rolled about
deck day after day in the merriest mood imaginable

but jolly as they were in the main two more discreet tipplers it
would be hard to find no one ever saw them take anything except
when the regular allowance was served out by the steward and to make
them quite sober and sensible you had only to ask them how they
contrived to keep otherwise some time after however their secret
leaked out

the casks of pisco were kept down the after-hatchway which for this
reason was secured with bar and padlock the cooper nevertheless
from time to time effected a burglarious entry by descending into
the fore-hold and then at the risk of being jammed to death
crawling along over a thousand obstructions to where the casks were
stowed

on the first expedition the only one to be got at lay among others
upon its bilge with the bung-hole well over with a bit of iron hoop
suitably bent and a good deal of prying and punching the bung was
forced in and then the cooper's neck-handkerchief attached to the
end of the hoop was drawn in and out the absorbed liquor being
deliberately squeezed into a small bucket

bungs was a man after a barkeeper's own heart drinking steadily
until just manageably tipsy he contrived to continue so getting
neither more nor less inebriated but to use his own phrase
remaining just about right when in this interesting state he had
a free lurch in his gait a queer way of hitching up his waistbands
looked unnecessarily steady at you when speaking and for the rest
was in very tolerable spirits at these times moreover he was
exceedingly patriotic and in a most amusing way frequently showed
his patriotism whenever he happened to encounter dunk a
good-natured square-faced dane aboard

it must be known here by the bye that the cooper had a true sailor
admiration for lord nelson but he entertained a very erroneous idea
of the personal appearance of the hero not content with depriving
him of an eye and an arm he stoutly maintained that he had also lost
a leg in one of his battles under this impression he sometimes
hopped up to dunk with one leg curiously locked behind him into his
right arm at the same time closing an eye

in this attitude he would call upon him to look up and behold the man
who gave his countrymen such a thrashing at copenhagen look you
dunk says he staggering about and winking hard with one eye to
keep the other shut look you one man hang me half a man with
one leg one arm one eye hang me with only a piece of a carcase
flogged your whole shabby nation do you deny it you lubber

the dane was a mule of a man and understanding but little english
seldom made anything of a reply so the cooper generally dropped his
leg and marched off with the air of a man who despised saying
anything further



chapter xvi

we encounter a gale

the mild blue weather we enjoyed after leaving the marquesas gradually
changed as we ran farther south and approached tahiti in these
generally tranquil seas the wind sometimes blows with great
violence though as every sailor knows a spicy gale in the tropic
latitudes of the pacific is far different from a tempest in the
howling north atlantic we soon found ourselves battling with the
waves while the before mild trades like a woman roused blew
fiercely but still warmly in our face

for all this the mate carried sail without stint and as for brave
little jule she stood up to it well and though once in a while
floored in the trough of a sea sprang to her keel again and showed
play every old timber groaned every spar buckled every chafed cord
strained and yet spite of all she plunged on her way like a racer
jermin sea-jockey that he was sometimes stood in the fore-chains
with the spray every now and then dashing over him and shouting out
well done jule dive into it sweetheart hurrah

one afternoon there was a mighty queer noise aloft which set the men
running in every direction it was the main-t-gallant-mast crash
it broke off just above the cap and held there by the rigging
dashed with every roll from side to side with all the hamper that
belonged to it the yard hung by a hair and at every pitch thumped
against the cross-trees while the sail streamed in ribbons and the
loose ropes coiled and thrashed the air like whip-lashes stand
from under and down came the rattling blocks like so many shot
the yard with a snap and a plunge went hissing into the sea
disappeared and shot its full length out again the crest of a great
wave then broke over it the ship rushed by and we saw the stick no
more

while this lively breeze continued baltimore our old black cook was
in great tribulation

like most south seamen the julia's caboose or cook-house was
planted on the larboard side of the forecastle under such a press of
canvas and with the heavy sea running the barque diving her bows
under now and then shipped green glassy waves which breaking over
the head-rails fairly deluged that part of the ship and washed
clean aft the caboose-house thought to be fairly lashed down to its
place served as a sort of breakwater to the inundation

about these times baltimore always wore what he called his gale
suit among other things comprising a sou-wester and a huge pair of
well-anointed sea-boots reaching almost to his knees thus equipped
for a ducking or a drowning as the case might be our culinary
high-priest drew to the slides of his temple and performed his sooty
rites in secret

so afraid was the old man of being washed overboard that he actually
fastened one end of a small line to his waistbands and coiling the
rest about him made use of it as occasion required when engaged
outside he unwound the cord and secured one end to a ringbolt in
the deck so that if a chance sea washed him off his feet it could
do nothing more

one evening just as he was getting supper the julia reared up on her
stern like a vicious colt and when she settled again forward fairly
dished a tremendous sea nothing could withstand it one side of the
rotten head-bulwarks came in with a crash it smote the caboose tore
it from its moorings and after boxing it about dashed it against
the windlass where it stranded the water then poured along the deck
like a flood rolling over and over pots pans and kettles and even
old baltimore himself who went breaching along like a porpoise

striking the taffrail the wave subsided and washing from side to
side left the drowning cook high and dry on the after-hatch his
extinguished pipe still between his teeth and almost bitten in two

the few men on deck having sprung into the main-rigging sailor-like
did nothing but roar at his calamity

the same night our flying-jib-boom snapped off like a pipe-stem and
our spanker-gaff came down by the run

by the following morning the wind in a great measure had gone down
the sea with it and by noon we had repaired our damages as well as
we could and were sailing along as pleasantly as ever

but there was no help for the demolished bulwarks we had nothing to
replace them and so whenever it breezed again our dauntless craft
went along with her splintered prow dripping but kicking up her
fleet heels just as high as before



chapter xvii

the coral islands

how far we sailed to the westward after leaving the marquesas or what
might have been our latitude and longitude at any particular time or
how many leagues we voyaged on our passage to tahiti are matters
about which i am sorry to say i cannot with any accuracy enlighten
the reader jermin as navigator kept our reckoning and as hinted
before kept it all to himself at noon he brought out his quadrant
a rusty old thing so odd-looking that it might have belonged to an
astrologer

sometimes when rather flustered from his potations he went
staggering about deck instrument to eye looking all over for the
sun a phenomenon which any sober observer might have seen right
overhead how upon earth he contrived on some occasions to settle
his latitude is more than i can tell the longitude he must either
have obtained by the rule of three or else by special revelation not
that the chronometer in the cabin was seldom to be relied on or was
any ways fidgety quite the contrary it stood stock-still and by
that means no doubt the true greenwich time at the period of
stopping at least was preserved to a second

the mate however in addition to his dead reckoning pretended to
ascertain his meridian distance from bow bells by an occasional lunar
observation this i believe consists in obtaining with the proper
instruments the angular distance between the moon and some one of the
stars the operation generally requires two observers to take sights
and at one and the same time

now though the mate alone might have been thought well calculated for
this inasmuch as he generally saw things double the doctor was
usually called upon to play a sort of second quadrant to jermin's
first and what with the capers of both they used to furnish a good
deal of diversion the mate's tremulous attempts to level his
instrument at the star he was after were comical enough for my own
part when he did catch sight of it i hardly knew how he managed to
separate it from the astral host revolving in his own brain

however by hook or by crook he piloted us along and before many
days a fellow sent aloft to darn a rent in the fore-top-sail threw
his hat into the air and bawled out land ho

land it was but in what part of the south seas jermin alone knew
and some doubted whether even he did but no sooner was the
announcement made than he came running on deck spy-glass in hand
and clapping it to his eye turned round with the air of a man
receiving indubitable assurance of something he was quite certain of
before the land was precisely that for which he had been steering
and with a wind in less than twenty-four hours we would sight
tahiti what he said was verified

the island turned out to be one of the pomotu or low group sometimes
called the coral islands perhaps the most remarkable and interesting
in the pacific lying to the east of tahiti the nearest are within a
day's sail of that place

they are very numerous mostly small low and level sometimes
wooded but always covered with verdure many are crescent-shaped
others resemble a horse-shoe in figure these last are nothing more
than narrow circles of land surrounding a smooth lagoon connected by
a single opening with the sea some of the lagoons said to have
subterranean outlets have no visible ones the inclosing island in
such cases being a complete zone of emerald other lagoons still
are girdled by numbers of small green islets very near to each
other

the origin of the entire group is generally ascribed to the coral
insect

according to some naturalists this wonderful little creature
commencing its erections at the bottom of the sea after the lapse of
centuries carries them up to the surface where its labours cease
here the inequalities of the coral collect all floating bodies
forming after a time a soil in which the seeds carried thither by
birds germinate and cover the whole with vegetation here and there
all over this archipelago numberless naked detached coral
formations are seen just emerging as it were from the ocean these
would appear to be islands in the very process of creation at any
rate one involuntarily concludes so on beholding them

as far as i know there are but few bread-fruit trees in any part of
the pomotu group in many places the cocoa-nut even does not grow
though in others it largely flourishes consequently some of the
islands are altogether uninhabited others support but a single
family and in no place is the population very large in some
respects the natives resemble the tahitians their language too is
very similar the people of the southeasterly clusters concerning
whom however but little is known have a bad name as cannibals and
for that reason their hospitality is seldom taxed by the mariner

within a few years past missionaries from the society group have
settled among the leeward islands where the natives have treated
them kindly indeed nominally many of these people are now
christians and through the political influence of their
instructors no doubt a short time since came tinder the allegiance
of pomaree the queen of tahiti with which island they always
carried on considerable intercourse

the coral islands are principally visited by the pearl-shell
fishermen who arrive in small schooners carrying not more than five
or six men

for a long while the business was engrossed by merenhout the french
consul at tahiti but a dutchman by birth who in one year is said
to have sent to france fifty thousand dollars worth of shells the
oysters are found in the lagoons and about the reefs and for
half-a-dozen nails a day or a compensation still less the natives
are hired to dive after them

a great deal of cocoa-nut oil is also obtained in various places some
of the uninhabited islands are covered with dense groves and the
ungathered nuts which have fallen year after year lie upon the
ground in incredible quantities two or three men provided with the
necessary apparatus for trying out the oil will in the course of a
week or two obtain enough to load one of the large sea-canoes

cocoa-nut oil is now manufactured in different parts of the south
seas and forms no small part of the traffic carried on with trading
vessels a considerable quantity is annually exported from the
society islands to sydney it is used in lamps and for machinery
being much cheaper than the sperm and for both purposes better
than the right-whale oil they bottle it up in large bamboos six or
eight feet long and these form part of the circulating medium of
tahiti

to return to the ship the wind dying away evening came on before we
drew near the island but we had it in view during the whole
afternoon

it was small and round presenting one enamelled level free from
trees and did not seem four feet above the water beyond it was
another and larger island about which a tropical sunset was throwing
its glories flushing all that part of the heavens and making it
flame like a vast dyed oriel illuminated

the trades scarce filled our swooning sails the air was languid with
the aroma of a thousand strange flowering shrubs upon inhaling it
one of the sick who had recently shown symptoms of scurvy cried out
in pain and was carried below this is no unusual effect in such
instances

on we glided within less than a cable's length of the shore which was
margined with foam that sparkled all round within nestled the
still blue lagoon no living thing was seen and for aught we
knew we might have been the first mortals who had ever beheld the
spot the thought was quickening to the fancy nor could i help
dreaming of the endless grottoes and galleries far below the reach of
the mariner's lead

and what strange shapes were lurking there think of those arch
creatures the mermaids chasing each other in and out of the coral
cells and catching their long hair in the coral twigs



chapter xviii

tahiti

at early dawn of the following morning we saw the peaks of tahiti in
clear weather they may be seen at the distance of ninety miles

hivarhoo shouted wymontoo overjoyed and running out upon the
bowsprit when the land was first faintly descried in the distance
but when the clouds floated away and showed the three peaks standing
like obelisks against the sky and the bold shore undulating along
the horizon the tears gushed from his eyes poor fellow it was not
hivarhoo green hivarhoo was many a long league off

tahiti is by far the most famous island in the south seas indeed a
variety of causes has made it almost classic its natural features
alone distinguish it from the surrounding groups two round and lofty
promontories whose mountains rise nine thousand feet above the level
of the ocean are connected by a low narrow isthmus the whole being
some one hundred miles in circuit from the great central peaks of
the larger peninsula orohena aorai and pirohitee the land radiates
on all sides to the sea in sloping green ridges between these are
broad and shadowy valleys in aspect each a tempe watered with fine
streams and thickly wooded unlike many of the other islands there
extends nearly all round tahiti a belt of low alluvial soil teeming
with the richest vegetation here chiefly the natives dwell

seen from the sea the prospect is magnificent it is one mass of
shaded tints of green from beach to mountain top endlessly
diversified with valleys ridges glens and cascades over the
ridges here and there the loftier peaks fling their shadows and
far down the valleys at the head of these the waterfalls flash out
into the sunlight as if pouring through vertical bowers of verdure
such enchantment too breathes over the whole that it seems a fairy
world all fresh and blooming from the hand of the creator

upon a near approach the picture loses not its attractions it is no
exaggeration to say that to a european of any sensibility who for
the first time wanders back into these valleys away from the haunts
of the natives the ineffable repose and beauty of the landscape is
such that every object strikes him like something seen in a dream
and for a time he almost refuses to believe that scenes like these
should have a commonplace existence no wonder that the french
bestowed upon the island the appellation of the new cytherea
often says de bourgainville i thought i was walking in the
garden of eden

nor when first discovered did the inhabitants of this charming
country at all diminish the wonder and admiration of the voyager
their physical beauty and amiable dispositions harmonized completely
with the softness of their clime in truth everything about them was
calculated to awaken the liveliest interest glance at their civil
and religious institutions to their king divine rights were paid
while for poetry their mythology rivalled that of ancient greece

of tahiti earlier and more full accounts were given than of any
other island in polynesia and this is the reason why it still
retains so strong a hold on the sympathies of all readers of south
sea voyages the journals of its first visitors containing as they
did such romantic descriptions of a country and people before
unheard of produced a marked sensation throughout europe and when
the first tahitiana were carried thither omai in london and
aotooroo in paris were caressed by nobles scholars and ladies

in addition to all this several eventful occurrences more or less
connected with tahiti have tended to increase its celebrity over
two centuries ago quiros the spaniard is supposed to have touched
at the island and at intervals wallis byron cook de
bourgainville vancouver le perouse and other illustrious
navigators refitted their vessels in its harbours here the famous
transit of venus was observed in here the memorable mutiny of
the bounty afterwards had its origin it was to the pagans of tahiti
that the first regularly constituted protestant missionaries were
sent and from their shores also have sailed successive missions to
the neighbouring islands

these with other events which might be mentioned have united in
keeping up the first interest which the place awakened and the
recent proceedings of the french have more than ever called forth the
sympathies of the public



chapter xix

a surprise more about bembo

the sight of the island was right welcome going into harbour after a
cruise is always joyous enough and the sailor is apt to indulge in
all sorts of pleasant anticipations but to us the occasion was
heightened by many things peculiar to our situation

since steering for the land our prospects had been much talked over
by many it was supposed that should the captain leave the ship the
crew were no longer bound by her articles this was the opinion of
our forecastle cokes though probably it would not have been
sanctioned by the marine courts of law at any rate such was the
state of both vessel and crew that whatever might be the event a
long stay and many holidays in tahiti were confidently predicted

everybody was in high spirits the sick who had been improving day by
day since the change in our destination were on deck and leaning
over the bulwarks some all animation and others silently admiring
an object unrivalled for its stately beauty tahiti from the sea

the quarter-deck however furnished a marked contrast to what was
going on at the other end of the ship the mowree was there as
usual scowling by himself and jermin walked to and fro in deep
thought every now and then looking to windward or darting into the
cabin and quickly returning

with all our light sails wooingly spread we held on our way until
with the doctor's glass papeetee the village metropolis of tahiti
came into view several ships were descried lying in the harbour and
among them one which loomed up black and large her two rows of
teeth proclaiming a frigate this was the reine blanche last from
the marquesas and carrying at the fore the flag of rear-admiral du
petit thouars hardly had we made her out when the booming of her
guns came over the water she was firing a salute which afterwards
turned out to be in honour of a treaty or rather as far as the
natives were concerned a forced cession of tahiti to the french
that morning concluded

the cannonading had hardly died away when jermin's voice was heard
giving an order so unexpected that everyone started stand by to
haul back the main-yard

what's that mean shouted the men are we not going into port

tumble after here and no words cried the mate and in a moment the
main-yard swung round when with her jib-boom pointing out to sea
the julia lay as quiet as a duck we all looked blank what was to
come next

presently the steward made his appearance carrying a mattress which
he spread out in the stern-sheets of the captain's boat two or three
chests and other things belonging to his master were similarly
disposed of

this was enough a slight hint suffices for a sailor

still adhering to his resolution to keep the ship at sea in spite of
everything the captain doubtless intended to set himself ashore
leaving the vessel under the mate to resume her voyage at once but
after a certain period agreed upon to touch at the island and take
him off all this of course could easily be done without
approaching any nearer the land with the julia than we now were
invalid whaling captains often adopt a plan like this but in the
present instance it was wholly unwarranted and everything
considered at war with the commonest principles of prudence and
humanity and although on guy's part this resolution showed more
hardihood than he had ever been given credit for it at the same
time argued an unaccountable simplicity in supposing that such a
crew would in any way submit to the outrage

it was soon made plain that we were right in our suspicions and the
men became furious the cooper and carpenter volunteered to head a
mutiny forthwith and while jermin was below four or five rushed aft
to fasten down the cabin scuttle others throwing down the
main-braces called out to the rest to lend a hand and fill away for
the land all this was done in an instant and things were looking
critical when doctor long ghost and myself prevailed upon them to
wait a while and do nothing hastily there was plenty of time and
the ship was completely in our power

while the preparations were still going on in the cabin we mustered
the men together and went into counsel upon the forecastle

it was with much difficulty that we could bring these rash spirits to
a calm consideration of the case but the doctor's influence at last
began to tell and with a few exceptions they agreed to be guided
by him assured that if they did so the ship would eventually be
brought to her anchors without anyone getting into trouble still
they told us up and down that if peaceable means failed they would
seize little jule and carry her into papeetee if they all swung for
it but for the present the captain should have his own way

by this time everything was ready the boat was lowered and brought to
the gangway and the captain was helped on deck by the mate and
steward it was the first time we had seen him in more than two
weeks and he was greatly altered as if anxious to elude every eye
a broad-brimmed payata hat was pulled down over his brow so that his
face was only visible when the brim flapped aside by a sling rigged
from the main-yard the cook and bembo now assisted in lowering him
into the boat as he went moaning over the side he must have heard
the whispered maledictions of his crew

while the steward was busy adjusting matters in the boat the mate
after a private interview with the mowree turned round abruptly and
told us that he was going ashore with the captain to return as soon
as possible in his absence bembo as next in rank would command
there being nothing to do but keep the ship at a safe distance from
the land he then sprang into the boat and with only the cook and
steward as oarsmen steered for the shore

guy's thus leaving the ship in the men's hands contrary to the mate's
advice was another evidence of his simplicity for at this
particular juncture had neither the doctor nor myself been aboard
there is no telling what they might have done

for the nonce bembo was captain and so far as mere seamanship was
concerned he was as competent to command as anyone in truth a
better seaman never swore this accomplishment by the bye together
with a surprising familiarity with most nautical names and phrases
comprised about all the english he knew

being a harpooner and as such having access to the cabin this man
though not yet civilized was according to sea usages which know no
exceptions held superior to the sailors and therefore nothing was
said against his being left in charge of the ship nor did it
occasion any surprise

some additional account must be given of bembo in the first place he
was far from being liked a dark moody savage everybody but the
mate more or less distrusted or feared him nor were these feelings
unreciprocated unless duty called he seldom went among the crew
hard stories too were told about him something in particular
concerning an hereditary propensity to kill men and eat them true he
came from a race of cannibals but that was all that was known to a
certainty

whatever unpleasant ideas were connected with the mowree his
personal appearance no way lessened them unlike most of his
countrymen he was if anything below the ordinary height but then
he was all compact and under his swart tattooed skin the muscles
worked like steel rods hair crisp and coal-black curled over
shaggy brows and ambushed small intense eyes always on the glare
in short he was none of your effeminate barbarians

previous to this he had been two or three voyages in sydney whalemen
always however as in the present instance shipping at the bay of
islands and receiving his discharge there on the homeward-bound
passage in this way his countrymen frequently enter on board the
colonial whaling vessels

there was a man among us who had sailed with the mowree on his first
voyage and he told me that he had not changed a particle since then

some queer things this fellow told me the following is one of his
stories i give it for what it is worth premising however that
from what i know of bembo and the foolhardy dare-devil feats
sometimes performed in the sperm-whale fishery i believe in its
substantial truth

as may be believed bembo was a wild one after a fish indeed all new
zealanders engaged in this business are it seems to harmonize
sweetly with their blood-thirsty propensities at sea the best
english they speak is the south seaman's slogan in lowering away a
dead whale or a stove boat game to the marrow these fellows are
generally selected for harpooners a post in which a nervous timid
man would be rather out of his element

in darting the harpooner of course stands erect in the head of the
boat one knee braced against a support but bembo disdained this
and was always pulled up to his fish balancing himself right on the
gunwale

but to my story one morning at daybreak they brought him up to a
large long whale he darted his harpoon and missed and the fish
sounded after a while the monster rose again about a mile off and
they made after him but he was frightened or gallied as they
call it and noon came and the boat was still chasing him in
whaling as long as the fish is in sight and no matter what may have
been previously undergone there is no giving up except when night
comes and nowadays when whales are so hard to be got frequently
not even then at last bembo's whale was alongside for the second
time he darted both harpoons but as sometimes happens to the best
men by some unaccountable chance once more missed though it is
well known that such failures will happen at times they
nevertheless occasion the bitterest disappointment to a boat's crew
generally expressed in curses both loud and deep and no wonder let
any man pull with might and main for hours and hours together under
a burning sun and if it do not make him a little peevish he is no
sailor

the taunts of the seamen may have maddened the mowree however it was
no sooner was he brought up again than harpoon in hand he bounded
upon the whale's back and for one dizzy second was seen there the
next all was foam and fury and both were out of sight the men
sheered off flinging overboard the line as fast as they could while
ahead nothing was seen but a red whirlpool of blood and brine

presently a dark object swam out the line began to straighten then
smoked round the loggerhead and quick as thought the boat sped
like an arrow through the water they were fast and the whale was
running

where was the mowree his brown hand was on the boat's gunwale and he
was hauled aboard in the very midst of the mad bubbles that burst
under the bows

such a man or devil if you will was bembo



chapter xx

the round robin visitors from shore

after the captain left the land-breeze died away and as is usual
about these islands toward noon it fell a dead calm there was
nothing to do but haul up the courses run down the jib and lay and
roll upon the swells the repose of the elements seemed to
communicate itself to the men and for a time there was a lull

early in the afternoon the mate having left the captain at papeetee
returned to the ship according to the steward they were to go
ashore again right after dinner with the remainder of guy's effects

on gaining the deck jermin purposely avoided us and went below
without saying a word meanwhile long ghost and i laboured hard to
diffuse the right spirit among the crew impressing upon them that a
little patience and management would in the end accomplish all that
their violence could and that too without making a serious matter
of it

for my own part i felt that i was under a foreign flag that an
english consul was close at hand and that sailors seldom obtain
justice it was best to be prudent still so much did i sympathize
with the men so far at least as their real grievances were
concerned and so convinced was i of the cruelty and injustice of what
captain guy seemed bent upon that if need were i stood ready to
raise a hand

in spite of all we could do some of them again became most
refractory breathing nothing but downright mutiny when we went
below to dinner these fellows stirred up such a prodigious tumult
that the old hull fairly echoed many and fierce too were the
speeches delivered and uproarious the comments of the sailors among
others long jim or as the doctor afterwards called him lacedaemonian
jim rose in his place and addressed the forecastle parliament in the
following strain

look ye britons if after what's happened this here craft goes to
sea with us we are no men and that's the way to say it speak the
word my livelies and i'll pilot her in i've been to tahiti before
and i can do it whereupon he sat down amid a universal pounding of
chest-lids and cymbaling of tin pans the few invalids who as yet
had not been actively engaged with the rest now taking part in the
applause creaking their bunk-boards and swinging their hammocks
cries also were heard of handspikes and a shindy out
stun-sails hurrah

several now ran on deck and for the moment i thought it was all
over with us but we finally succeeded in restoring some degree of
quiet

at last by way of diverting their thoughts i proposed that a round
robin should be prepared and sent ashore to the consul by baltimore
the cook the idea took mightily and i was told to set about it at
once on turning to the doctor for the requisite materials he told
me he had none there was not a fly-leaf even in any of his books
so after great search a damp musty volume entitled a history of
the most atrocious and bloody piracies was produced and its two
remaining blank leaves being torn out were by help of a little pitch
lengthened into one sheet for ink some of the soot over the lamp
was then mixed with water by a fellow of a literary turn and an
immense quill plucked from a distended albatross wing which
nailed against the bowsprit bitts had long formed an ornament of the
forecastle supplied a pen

making use of the stationery thus provided i indited upon a
chest-lid a concise statement of our grievances concluding with the
earnest hope that the consul would at once come off and see how
matters stood for himself eight beneath the note was described the
circle about which the names were to be written the great object of
a round robin being to arrange the signatures in such a way that
although they are all found in a ring no man can be picked out as
the leader of it

few among them had any regular names many answering to some familiar
title expressive of a personal trait or oftener still to the name
of the place from which they hailed and in one or two cases were
known by a handy syllable or two significant of nothing in
particular but the men who bore them some to be sure had for the
sake of formality shipped under a feigned cognomen or purser's
name these however were almost forgotten by themselves and so
to give the document an air of genuineness it was decided that every
man's name should be put down as it went among the crew

it is due to the doctor to say that the circumscribed device was his

folded and sealed with a drop of tar the round robin was directed to
the english consul tahiti and handed to the cook was by him
delivered into that gentleman's hands as soon as the mate went
ashore

on the return of the boat sometime after dark we learned a good deal
from old baltimore who having been allowed to run about as much as
he pleased had spent his time gossiping

owing to the proceedings of the french everything in tahiti was in an
uproar pritchard the missionary consul was absent in england but
his place was temporarily filled by one wilson an educated white
man born on the island and the son of an old missionary of that
name still living

with natives and foreigners alike wilson the younger was exceedingly
unpopular being held an unprincipled and dissipated man a character
verified by his subsequent conduct pritchard's selecting a man like
this to attend to the duties of his office had occasioned general
dissatisfaction ashore

though never in europe or america the acting consul had been several
voyages to sydney in a schooner belonging to the mission and
therefore our surprise was lessened when baltimore told us that he
and captain guy were as sociable as could be old acquaintances in
fact and that the latter had taken up his quarters at wilson's
house for us this boded ill

the mate was now assailed by a hundred questions as to what was going
to be done with us his only reply was that in the morning the
consul would pay us a visit and settle everything

after holding our ground off the harbour during the night in the
morning a shore boat manned by natives was seen coming off in it
were wilson and another white man who proved to be a doctor johnson
an englishman and a resident physician of papeetee

stopping our headway as they approached jermin advanced to the
gangway to receive them no sooner did the consul touch the deck
than he gave us a specimen of what he was

mr jermin he cried loftily and not deigning to notice the
respectful salutation of the person addressed mr jermin tack
ship and stand off from the land

upon this the men looked hard at him anxious to see what sort of a
looking cove he was upon inspection he turned out to be an
exceedingly minute cove with a viciously pugged nose and a
decidedly thin pair of legs there was nothing else noticeable about
him jermin with ill-assumed suavity at once obeyed the order and
the ship's head soon pointed out to sea

now contempt is as frequently produced at first sight as love and
thus was it with respect to wilson no one could look at him without
conceiving a strong dislike or a cordial desire to entertain such a
feeling the first favourable opportunity there was such an
intolerable air of conceit about this man that it was almost as much
as one could do to refrain from running up and affronting him

so the counsellor is come exclaimed navy bob who like all the
rest invariably styled him thus much to mine and the doctor's
diversion ay said another and for no good i'll be bound

such were some of the observations made as wilson and the mate went
below conversing

but no one exceeded the cooper in the violence with which he inveighed
against the ship and everything connected with her swearing like a
trooper he called the main-mast to witness that if he bungs ever
again went out of sight of land in the julia he prayed heaven that a
fate might be his altogether too remarkable to be here related

much had he to say also concerning the vileness of what we had to
eat not fit for a dog besides enlarging upon the imprudence of
intrusting the vessel longer to a man of the mate's intemperate
habits with so many sick too what could we expect to do in the
fishery it was no use talking come what come might the ship must
let go her anchor

now as bungs besides being an able seaman a cod in the
forecastle and about the oldest man in it was moreover thus
deeply imbued with feelings so warmly responded to by the rest he
was all at once selected to officiate as spokesman as soon as the
consul should see fit to address us the selection was made contrary
to mine and the doctor's advice however all assured us they would
keep quiet and hear everything wilson had to say before doing
anything decisive

we were not kept long in suspense for very soon he was seen standing
in the cabin gangway with the tarnished tin case containing the
ship's papers and jennin at once sung out for the ship's company to
muster on the quarter-deck



chapter xxi

proceedings of the consul

the order was instantly obeyed and the sailors ranged themselves
facing the consul

they were a wild company men of many climes not at all precise in
their toilet arrangements but picturesque in their very tatters my
friend the long doctor was there too and with a view perhaps of
enlisting the sympathies of the consul for a gentleman in distress
had taken more than ordinary pains with his appearance but among the
sailors he looked like a land-crane blown off to sea and consorting
with petrels

the forlorn rope yarn however was by far the most remarkable figure
land-lubber that he was his outfit of sea-clothing had long since
been confiscated and he was now fain to go about in whatever he
could pick up his upper garment an unsailor-like article of dress
which he persisted in wearing though torn from his back twenty times
in the day was an old claw-hammer jacket or swallow-tail coat
formerly belonging to captain guy and which had formed one of his
perquisites when steward

by the side of wilson was the mate bareheaded his gray locks lying
in rings upon his bronzed brow and his keen eye scanning the crowd
as if he knew their every thought his frock hung loosely exposing
his round throat mossy chest and short and nervous arm embossed
with pugilistic bruises and quaint with many a device in india ink

in the midst of a portentous silence the consul unrolled his papers
evidently intending to produce an effect by the exceeding bigness of
his looks

mr jermin call off their names and he handed him a list of the
ship's company

all answered but the deserters and the two mariners at the bottom of
the sea

it was now supposed that the round robin would be produced and
something said about it but not so among the consul's papers that
unique document was thought to be perceived but if there it was
too much despised to be made a subject of comment some present very
justly regarding it as an uncommon literary production had been
anticipating all sorts of miracles therefrom and were therefore
much touched at this neglect

well men began wilson again after a short pause although you all
look hearty enough i'm told there are some sick among you now then
mr jermin call off the names on that sick-list of yours and let
them go over to the other side of the deck i should like to see who
they are

so then said he after we had all passed over you are the sick
fellows are you very good i shall have you seen to you will go
down into the cabin one by one to doctor johnson who will report
your respective cases to me such as he pronounces in a dying state i
shall have sent ashore the rest will be provided with everything
needful and remain aboard

at this announcement we gazed strangely at each other anxious to see
who it was that looked like dying and pretty nearly deciding to stay
aboard and get well rather than go ashore and be buried there were
some nevertheless who saw very plainly what wilson was at and they
acted accordingly for my own part i resolved to assume as dying an
expression as possible hoping that on the strength of it i might
be sent ashore and so get rid of the ship without any further
trouble

with this intention i determined to take no part in anything that
might happen until my case was decided upon as for the doctor he
had all along pretended to be more or less unwell and by a
significant look now given me it was plain that he was becoming
decidedly worse

the invalids disposed of for the present and one of them having gone
below to be examined the consul turned round to the rest and
addressed them as follows 

men i'm going to ask you two or three questions let one of you
answer yes or no and the rest keep silent now then have you
anything to say against your mate mr jermin and he looked
sharply among the sailors and at last right into the eye of the
cooper whom everybody was eyeing

well sir faltered bungs we can't say anything against mr
jermin's seamanship but 

i want no buts cried the consul breaking in answer me yes or
no have you anything to say against mr jermin

i was going on to say sir mr jermin's a very good man but then 
here the mate looked marlinespikes at bungs and bungs after
stammering out something looked straight down to a seam in the deck
and stopped short

a rather assuming fellow heretofore the cooper had sported many
feathers in his cap he was now showing the white one

so much then for that part of the business exclaimed wilson
smartly you have nothing to say against him i see

upon this several seemed to be on the point of saying a good deal
but disconcerted by the cooper's conduct checked themselves and the
consul proceeded

have you enough to eat aboard answer me you man who spoke
before

well i don't know as to that said the cooper looking excessively
uneasy and trying to edge back but pushed forward again some of
that salt horse ain't as sweet as it might be

that's not what i asked you shouted the consul growing brave quite
fast answer my questions as i put them or i'll find a way to make
you

this was going a little too far the ferment into which the cooper's
poltroonery had thrown the sailors now brooked no restraint and one
of them a young american who went by the name of salem dashed out
from among the rest and fetching the cooper a blow that sent him
humming over toward the consul flourished a naked sheath-knife in
the air and burst forth with i'm the little fellow that can answer
your questions just put them to me once counsellor but the
counsellor had no more questions to ask just then for at the
alarming apparition of salem's knife and the extraordinary effect
produced upon bungs he had popped his head down the companion-way
and was holding it there

upon the mate's assuring him however that it was all over he looked
up quite flustered if not frightened but evidently determined to
put as fierce a face on the matter as practicable speaking sharply
he warned all present to look out and then repeated the question
whether there was enough to eat aboard everyone now turned
spokesman and he was assailed by a perfect hurricane of yells in
which the oaths fell like hailstones

how's this what d'ye mean he cried upon the first lull who told
you all to speak at once here you man with the knife you'll be
putting someone's eyes out yet d'ye hear you sir you seem to have
a good deal to say who are you pray where did you ship

i'm nothing more nor a bloody beach-comber retorted salem stepping
forward piratically and eyeing him and if you want to know i
shipped at the islands about four months ago

only four months ago and here you have more to say than men who have
been aboard the whole voyage and the consul made a dash at looking
furious but failed let me hear no more from you sir where's
that respectable gray-headed man the cooper he's the one to answer
my questions

there's no spectable gray-headed men aboard returned salem
we're all a parcel of mutineers and pirates

all this time the mate was holding his peace and wilson now
completely abashed and at a loss what to do took him by the arm
and walked across the deck returning to the cabin-scuttle after a
close conversation he abruptly addressed the sailors without taking
any further notice of what had just happened

for reasons you all know men this ship has been placed in my hands
as captain guy will remain ashore for the present your mate mr
jermin will command until his recovery according to my judgment
there is no reason why the voyage should not be at once resumed
especially as i shall see that you have two more harpooners and
enough good men to man three boats as for the sick neither you nor i
have anything to do with them they will be attended to by doctor
johnson but i've explained that matter before as soon as things can
be arranged in a day or two at farthest you will go to sea for a
three months cruise touching here at the end of it for your
captain let me hear a good report of you now when you come back
at present you will continue lying off and on the harbour i will
send you fresh provisions as soon as i can get them there i've
nothing more to say go forward to your stations

and without another word he wheeled round to descend into the cabin
but hardly had he concluded before the incensed men were dancing
about him on every side and calling upon him to lend an ear each
one for himself denied the legality of what he proposed to do
insisted upon the necessity for taking the ship in and finally gave
him to understand roughly and roundly that go to sea in her they
would not

in the midst of this mutinous uproar the alarmed consul stood fast by
the scuttle his tactics had been decided upon beforehand indeed
they must have been concerted ashore between him and the captain
for all he said as he now hurried below was go forward men i'm
through with you you should have mentioned these matters before my
arrangements are concluded go forward i say i've nothing more to
say to you and drawing over the slide of the scuttle he
disappeared upon the very point of following him down the attention
of the exasperated seamen was called off to a party who had just then
taken the recreant bungs in hand amid a shower of kicks and cuffs
the traitor was borne along to the forecastle where i forbear to
relate what followed



chapter xxii

the consul's departure

during the scenes just described doctor johnson was engaged in
examining the sick of whom as it turned out all but two were to
remain in the ship he had evidently received his cue from wilson

one of the last called below into the cabin just as the quarter-deck
gathering dispersed i came on deck quite incensed my lameness
which to tell the truth was now much better was put down as in a
great measure affected and my name was on the list of those who
would be fit for any duty in a day or two this was enough as for
doctor long ghost the shore physician instead of extending to him
any professional sympathy had treated him very cavalierly to a
certain extent therefore we were now both bent on making common
cause with the sailors

i must explain myself here all we wanted was to have the ship snugly
anchored in papeetee bay entertaining no doubt that could this be
done it would in some way or other peaceably lead to our
emancipation without a downright mutiny there was but one way to
accomplish this to induce the men to refuse all further duty unless
it were to work the vessel in the only difficulty lay in restraining
them within proper bounds nor was it without certain misgivings
that i found myself so situated that i must necessarily link myself
however guardedly with such a desperate company and in an
enterprise too of which it was hard to conjecture what might be the
result but anything like neutrality was out of the question and
unconditional submission was equally so

on going forward we found them ten times more tumultuous than ever
after again restoring some degree of tranquillity we once more urged
our plan of quietly refusing duty and awaiting the result at first
few would hear of it but in the end a good number were convinced by
our representations others held out nor were those who thought with
us in all things to be controlled

upon wilson's coming on deck to enter his boat he was beset on all
sides and for a moment i thought the ship would be seized before
his very eyes

nothing more to say to you men my arrangements are made go
forward where you belong i'll take no insolence and in a tremor
wilson hurried over the side in the midst of a volley of execrations

shortly after his departure the mate ordered the cook and steward
into his boat and saying that he was going to see how the captain
did left us as before under the charge of bembo

at this time we were lying becalmed pretty close in with the land
having gone about again our main-topsail flapping against the mast
with every roll

the departure of the consul and jermin was followed by a scene
absolutely indescribable the sailors ran about deck like madmen
bembo all the while leaning against the taff-rail by himself
smoking his heathenish stone pipe and never interfering

the cooper who that morning had got himself into a fluid of an
exceedingly high temperature now did his best to regain the favour
of the crew without distinction of party he called upon all hands
to step up and partake of the contents of his bucket

but it was quite plain that before offering to intoxicate others he
had taken the wise precaution of getting well tipsy himself he was
now once more happy in the affection of his shipmates who one and
all pronounced him sound to the kelson

the pisco soon told and with great difficulty we restrained a party
in the very act of breaking into the after-hold in pursuit of more
all manner of pranks were now played

mast-head there what d'ye see bawled beauty hailing the
main-truck through an enormous copper funnel stand by for stays
roared flash jack bawling off with the cook's axe at the fastening
of the main-stay looky out for quails shrieked the portuguese
antone darting a handspike through the cabin skylight and heave
round cheerly men sung out navy bob dancing a hornpipe on the
forecastle



chapter xxiii

the second night off papeetee

toward sunset the mate came off singing merrily in the stern of his
boat and in attempting to climb up the side succeeded in going
plump into the water he was rescued by the steward and carried
across the deck with many moving expressions of love for his bearer
tumbled into the quarter-boat he soon fell asleep and waking about
midnight somewhat sobered went forward among the men here to
prepare for what follows we must leave him for a moment

it was now plain enough that jermin was by no means unwilling to take
the julia to sea indeed there was nothing he so much desired
though what his reasons were seeing our situation we could only
conjecture nevertheless so it was and having counted much upon his
rough popularity with the men to reconcile them to a short cruise
under him he had consequently been disappointed in their behaviour
still thinking that they would take a different view of the matter
when they came to know what fine times he had in store for them he
resolved upon trying a little persuasion

so on going forward he put his head down the forecastle scuttle and
hailed us quite cordially inviting us down into the cabin where he
said he had something to make merry withal nothing loth we went
and throwing ourselves along the transom waited for the steward to
serve us

as the can circulated jermin leaning on the table and occupying the
captain's arm-chair secured to the deck opened his mind as bluntly
and freely as ever he was by no means yet sober

he told us we were acting very foolishly that if we only stuck to the
ship he would lead us all a jovial life of it enumerating the casks
still remaining untapped in the julia's wooden cellar it was even
hinted vaguely that such a thing might happen as our not coming back
for the captain whom he spoke of but lightly asserting what he had
often said before that he was no sailor

moreover and perhaps with special reference to doctor long ghost and
myself he assured us generally that if there were any among us
studiously inclined he would take great pleasure in teaching such
the whole art and mystery of navigation including the gratuitous use
of his quadrant

i should have mentioned that previous to this he had taken the
doctor aside and said something about reinstating him in the cabin
with augmented dignity beside throwing out a hint that i myself was
in some way or other to be promoted but it was all to no purpose
bent the men were upon going ashore and there was no moving them

at last he flew into a rage much increased by the frequency of his
potations and with many imprecations concluded by driving everybody
out of the cabin we tumbled up the gangway in high good-humour

upon deck everything looked so quiet that some of the most pugnacious
spirits actually lamented that there was so little prospect of an
exhilarating disturbance before morning it was not five minutes
however ere these fellows were gratified

sydney ben said to be a runaway ticket-of-leave-man and for reasons
of his own one of the few who still remained on duty had for the
sake of the fun gone down with the rest into the cabin where bembo
who meanwhile was left in charge of the deck had frequently called
out for him at first ben pretended not to hear but on being sung
out for again and again bluntly refused at the same time casting
some illiberal reflections on the mowree's maternal origin which the
latter had been long enough among the sailors to understand as in the
highest degree offensive so just after the men came up from below
bembo singled him out and gave him such a cursing in his broken
lingo that it was enough to frighten one the convict was the worse
for liquor indeed the mowree had been tippling also and before we
knew it a blow was struck by ben and the two men came together like
magnets

the ticket-of-leave-man was a practised bruiser but the savage knew
nothing of the art pugilistic and so they were even it was clear
hugging and wrenching till both came to the deck here they rolled
over and over in the middle of a ring which seemed to form of itself
at last the white man's head fell back and his face grew purple
bembo's teeth were at his throat rushing in all round they hauled
the savage off but not until repeatedly struck on the head would he
let go

his rage was now absolutely demoniac he lay glaring and writhing on
the deck without attempting to rise cowed as they supposed he was
from his attitude the men rejoiced at seeing him thus humbled left
him after rating him in sailor style for a cannibal and a coward

ben was attended to and led below

soon after this the rest also with but few exceptions retired into
the forecastle and having been up nearly all the previous night
they quickly dropped about the chests and rolled into the hammocks
in an hour's time not a sound could be heard in that part of the
ship

before bembo was dragged away the mate had in vain endeavoured to
separate the combatants repeatedly striking the mowree but the
seamen interposing at last kept him off

and intoxicated as he was when they dispersed he knew enough to
charge the steward a steady seaman be it remembered with the
present safety of the ship and then went below when he fell
directly into another drunken sleep

having remained upon deck with the doctor some time after the rest had
gone below i was just on the point of following him down when i saw
the mowree rise draw a bucket of water and holding it high above
his head pour its contents right over him this he repeated several
times there was nothing very peculiar in the act but something else
about him struck me however i thought no more of it but descended
the scuttle

after a restless nap i found the atmosphere of the forecastle so
close from nearly all the men being down at the same time that i
hunted up an old pea-jacket and went on deck intending to sleep it
out there till morning here i found the cook and steward wymontoo
hope yarn and the dane who being all quiet manageable fellows
and holding aloof from the rest since the captain's departure had
been ordered by the mate not to go below until sunrise they were
lying under the lee of the bulwarks two or three fast asleep and
the others smoking their pipes and conversing

to my surprise bembo was at the helm but there being so few to stand
there now they told me he had offered to take his turn with the
rest at the same time heading the watch and to this of course
they made no objection

it was a fine bright night all moon and stars and white crests of
waves the breeze was light but freshening and close-hauled poor
little jule as if nothing had happened was heading in for the land
which rose high and hazy in the distance

after the day's uproar the tranquillity of the scene was soothing
and i leaned over the side to enjoy it

more than ever did i now lament my situation but it was useless to
repine and i could not upbraid myself so at last becoming drowsy
i made a bed with my jacket under the windlass and tried to forget
myself

how long i lay there i cannot tell but as i rose the first object
that met my eye was bembo at the helm his dark figure slowly rising
and falling with the ship's motion against the spangled heavens
behind he seemed all impatience and expectation standing at arm's
length from the spokes with one foot advanced and his bare head
thrust forward where i was the watch were out of sight and no one
else was stirring the deserted decks and broad white sails were
gleaming in the moonlight

presently a swelling dashing sound came upon my ear and i had a
sort of vague consciousness that i had been hearing it before the
next instant i was broad awake and on my feet eight ahead and so
near that my heart stood still was a long line of breakers heaving
and frothing it was the coral reef girdling the island behind it
and almost casting their shadows upon the deck were the sleeping
mountains about whose hazy peaks the gray dawn was just breaking
the breeze had freshened and with a steady gliding motion we were
running straight for the reef

all was taken in at a glance the fell purpose of bembo was obvious
and with a frenzied shout to wake the watch i rushed aft they
sprang to their feet bewildered and after a short but desperate
scuffle we tore him from the helm in wrestling with him the
wheel left for a moment unguarded flew to leeward thus fortunately
bringing the ship's head to the wind and so retarding her progress
previous to this she had been kept three or four points free so as
to close with the breakers her headway now shortened i steadied the
helm keeping the sails just lifting while we glided obliquely
toward the land to have run off before the wind an easy
thing would have been almost instant destruction owing to a curve of
the reef in that direction at this time the dane and the steward
were still struggling with the furious mowree and the others were
running about irresolute and shouting

but darting forward the instant i had the helm the old cook thundered
on the forecastle with a handspike breakers breakers close
aboard bout ship bout ship

up came the sailors staring about them in stupid horror

haul back the head-yards let go the lee fore-brace beady about
about were now shouted on all sides while distracted by a thousand
orders they ran hither and thither fairly panic-stricken

it seemed all over with us and i was just upon the point of throwing
the ship full into the wind a step which saving us for the
instant would have sealed our fate in the end when a sharp cry
shot by my ear like the flight of an arrow

it was salem all ready for'ard hard down

round and round went the spokes the julia with her short keel
spinning to windward like a top soon the jib-sheets lashed the
stays and the men more self-possessed flew to the braces

main-sail haul was now heard as the fresh breeze streamed fore and
aft the deck and directly the after-yards were whirled round

in a half-a-minute more we were sailing away from the land on the
other tack with every sail distended

turning on her heel within little more than a biscuit's toss of the
reef no earthly power could have saved us were it not that up to
the very brink of the coral rampart there are no soundings



chapter xxiv

outbreak of the crew

the purpose of bembo had been made known to the men generally by the
watch and now that our salvation was certain by an instinctive
impulse they raised a cry and rushed toward him

just before liberated by dunk and the steward he was standing
doggedly by the mizzen-mast and as the infuriated sailors came on
his bloodshot eye rolled and his sheath-knife glittered over his
head

down with him strike him down hang him at the main-yard such
were the shouts now raised but he stood unmoved and for a single
instant they absolutely faltered

cowards cried salem and he flung himself upon him the steel
descended like a ray of light but did no harm for the sailor's
heart was beating against the mowree's before he was aware

they both fell to the deck when the knife was instantly seized and
bembo secured

for'ard for'ard with him was again the cry give him a sea-toss
overboard with him and he was dragged along the deck struggling
and fighting with tooth and nail

all this uproar immediately over the mate's head at last roused him
from his drunken nap and he came staggering on deck

what's this he shouted running right in among them

it's the mowree zur they are going to murder him zur here sobbed
poor rope yarn crawling close up to him

avast avast roared jermin making a spring toward bembo and
dashing two or three of the sailors aside at this moment the wretch
was partly flung over the bulwarks which shook with his frantic
struggles in vain the doctor and others tried to save him the men
listened to nothing

murder and mutiny by the salt sea shouted the mate and dashing
his arms right and left he planted his iron hand upon the mowree's
shoulder

there are two of us now and as you serve him you serve me he
cried turning fiercely round

over with them together then exclaimed the carpenter springing
forward but the rest fell back before the courageous front of
jermin and with the speed of thought bembo unharmed stood upon
deck

aft with ye cried his deliverer and he pushed him right among the
men taking care to follow him up close giving the sailors no time
to recover he pushed the mowree before him till they came to the
cabin scuttle when he drew the slide over him and stood still
throughout bembo never spoke one word

now for'ard where ye belong cried the mate addressing the seamen
who by this time rallying again had no idea of losing their victim

the mowree the mowree they shouted

here the doctor in answer to the mate's repeated questions stepped
forward and related what bembo had been doing a matter which the
mate but dimly understood from the violent threatenings he had been
hearing

for a moment he seemed to waver but at last turning the key of the
padlock of the slide he breathed through his set teeth ye can't
have him i'll hand him over to the consul so for'ard with ye i
say when there's any drowning to be done i'll pass the word so
away with ye ye blood-thirsty pirates

it was to no purpose that they begged or threatened jermin although
by no means sober stood his ground manfully and before long they
dispersed soon to forget everything that had happened

though we had no opportunity to hear him confess it bembo's intention
to destroy us was beyond all question his only motive could have
been a desire to revenge the contumely heaped upon him the night
previous operating upon a heart irreclaimably savage and at no time
fraternally disposed toward the crew

during the whole of this scene the doctor did his best to save him
but well knowing that all i could do would have been equally useless
i maintained my place at the wheel indeed no one but jermin could
have prevented this murder



chapter xxv

jermin encounters an old shipmate

during the morning of the day which dawned upon the events just
recounted we remained a little to leeward of the harbour waiting
the appearance of the consul who had promised the mate to come off
in a shore boat for the purpose of seeing him

by this time the men had forced his secret from the cooper and the
consequence was that they kept him continually coming and going from
the after-hold the mate must have known this but he said nothing
notwithstanding all the dancing and singing and occasional fighting
which announced the flow of the pisco

the peaceable influence which the doctor and myself had heretofore
been exerting was now very nearly at an end

confident from the aspect of matters that the ship after all would
be obliged to go in and learning moreover that the mate had said
so the sailors for the present seemed in no hurry about it
especially as the bucket of bungs gave such generous cheer

as for bembo we were told that after putting him in double irons
the mate had locked him up in the captain's state-room taking the
additional precaution of keeping the cabin scuttle secured from this
time forward we never saw the mowree again a circumstance which will
explain itself as the narrative proceeds

noon came and no consul and as the afternoon advanced without any
word even from the shore the mate was justly incensed more
especially as he had taken great pains to keep perfectly sober
against wilson's arrival

two or three hours before sundown a small schooner came out of the
harbour and headed over for the adjoining island of imeeo or
moreea in plain sight about fifteen miles distant the wind
failing the current swept her down under our bows where we had a
fair glimpse of the natives on her decks

there were a score of them perhaps lounging upon spread mats and
smoking their pipes on floating so near and hearing the maudlin
cries of our crew and beholding their antics they must have taken
us for a pirate at any rate they got out their sweeps and pulled
away as fast as they could the sight of our two six-pounders which
by way of a joke were now run out of the side-ports giving a fresh
impetus to their efforts but they had not gone far when a white
man with a red sash about his waist made his appearance on deck
the natives immediately desisting

hailing us loudly he said he was coming aboard and after some
confusion on the schooner's decks a small canoe was launched
over-hoard and in a minute or two he was with us he turned out to
be an old shipmate of jermin's one viner long supposed dead but
now resident on the island

the meeting of these men under the circumstances is one of a
thousand occurrences appearing exaggerated in fiction but
nevertheless frequently realized in actual lives of adventure

some fifteen years previous they had sailed together as officers of
the barque jane of london a south seaman somewhere near the new
hebrides they struck one night upon an unknown reef and in a few
hours the jane went to pieces the boats however were saved some
provisions also a quadrant and a few other articles but several of
the men were lost before they got clear of the wreck

the three boats commanded respectively by the captain jermin and
the third mate then set sail for a small english settlement at the
bay of islands in new zealand of course they kept together as much
as possible after being at sea about a week a lascar in the
captain's boat went crazy and it being dangerous to keep him they
tried to throw him overboard in the confusion that ensued the boat
capsized from the sail's jibing and a considerable sea running at
the time and the other boats being separated more than usual only
one man was picked up the very next night it blew a heavy gale and
the remaining boats taking in all sail made bundles of their oars
flung them overboard and rode to them with plenty of line when
morning broke jermin and his men were alone upon the ocean the
third mate's boat in all probability having gone down

after great hardships the survivors caught sight of a brig which
took them on board and eventually landed them at sydney

ever since then our mate had sailed from that port never once hearing
of his lost shipmates whom by this time of course he had long
given up judge then his feelings when viner the lost third mate
the instant he touched the deck rushed up and wrung him by the hand

during the gale his line had parted so that the boat drifting fast
to leeward was out of sight by morning reduced after this to
great extremities the boat touched for fruit at an island of which
they knew nothing the natives at first received them kindly but
one of the men getting into a quarrel on account of a woman and the
rest taking his part they were all massacred but viner who at the
time was in an adjoining village after staying on the island more
than two years he finally escaped in the boat of an american whaler
which landed him at valparaiso from this period he had continued to
follow the seas as a man before the mast until about eighteen
months previous when he went ashore at tahiti where he now owned the
schooner we saw in which he traded among the neighbouring islands

the breeze springing up again just after nightfall viner left us
promising his old shipmate to see him again three days hence in
papeetee harbour



chapter xxvi

we enter the harbour jim the pilot

exhausted by the day's wassail most of the men went below at an early
hour leaving the deck to the steward and two of the men remaining on
duty the mate with baltimore and the dane engaging to relieve them
at midnight at that hour the ship now standing off shore under
short sail was to be tacked

it was not long after midnight when we were wakened in the forecastle
by the lion roar of jermin's voice ordering a pull at the
jib-halyards and soon afterwards a handspike struck the scuttle
and all hands were called to take the ship into port

this was wholly unexpected but we learned directly that the mate no
longer relying upon the consul and renouncing all thought of
inducing the men to change their minds had suddenly made up his own
he was going to beat up to the entrance of the harbour so as to show
a signal for a pilot before sunrise

notwithstanding this the sailors absolutely refused to assist in
working the ship under any circumstances whatever to all mine and
the doctor's entreaties lending a deaf ear sink or strike they
swore they would have nothing more to do with her this perverse-ness
was to be attributed in a great measure to the effects of their
late debauch

with a strong breeze all sail set and the ship in the hands of four
or five men exhausted by two nights watching our situation was bad
enough especially as the mate seemed more reckless than ever and we
were now to tack ship several times close under the land

well knowing that if anything untoward happened to the vessel before
morning it would be imputed to the conduct of the crew and so lead
to serious results should they ever be brought to trial i called
together those on deck to witness my declaration that now that the
julia was destined for the harbour the only object for which i at
least had been struggling i was willing to do what i could toward
carrying her in safely in this step i was followed by the doctor

the hours passed anxiously until morning when being well to windward
of the mouth of the harbour we bore up for it with the union-jack
at the fore no sign however of boat or pilot was seen and after
running close in several times the ensign was set at the
mizzen-peak union down in distress but it was of no avail

attributing to wilson this unaccountable remissness on the part of
those ashore jermin quite enraged now determined to stand boldly
in upon his own responsibility trusting solely to what he remembered
of the harbour on a visit there many years previous

this resolution was characteristic even with a competent pilot
papeetee bay is considered a ticklish one to enter formed by a
bold sweep of the shore it is protected seaward by the coral reef
upon which the rollers break with great violence after stretching
across the bay the barrier extends on toward point venus in the
district of matavia eight or nine miles distant here there is an
opening by which ships enter and glide down the smooth deep canal
between the reef and the shore to the harbour but by seamen
generally the leeward entrance is preferred as the wind is
extremely variable inside the reef this latter entrance is a break in
the barrier directly facing the bay and village of papeetee it is
very narrow and from the baffling winds currents and sunken rocks
ships now and then grate their keels against the coral

but the mate was not to be daunted so stationing what men he had at
the braces he sprang upon the bulwarks and bidding everybody keep
wide awake ordered the helm up in a few moments we were running
in being toward noon the wind was fast leaving us and by the time
the breakers were roaring on either hand little more than
steerage-way was left but on we glided smoothly and deftly avoiding
the green darkling objects here and there strewn in our path jermin
occasionally looking down in the water and then about him with the
utmost calmness and not a word spoken just fanned along thus it
was not many minutes ere we were past all danger and floated into
the placid basin within this was the cleverest specimen of his
seamanship that he ever gave us

as we held on toward the frigate and shipping a canoe coming out
from among them approached in it were a boy and an old man both
islanders the former nearly naked and the latter dressed in an old
naval frock-coat both were paddling with might and main the old
man once in a while tearing his paddle out of the water and after
rapping his companion over the head both fell to with fresh vigour
as they came within hail the old fellow springing to his feet and
flourishing his paddle cut some of the queerest capers all the
while jabbering something which at first we could not understand

presently we made out the following ah you pemi ah you
come what for you come you be fine for come no pilot i say you
hear i say you ita maitui no good you hear you no
pilot yes you d   me you no pilot t all i d   you you
hear

this tirade which showed plainly that whatever the profane old
rascal was at he was in right good earnest produced peals of
laughter from the ship upon which he seemed to get beside himself
and the boy who with suspended paddle was staring about him
received a sound box over the head which set him to work in a
twinkling and brought the canoe quite near the orator now opening
afresh it turned out that his vehement rhetoric was all addressed to
the mate still standing conspicuously on the bulwarks

but jermin was in no humour for nonsense so with a sailor's
blessing he ordered him off the old fellow then flew into a regular
frenzy cursing and swearing worse than any civilized being i ever
heard

you sabbee me he shouted you know me ah well me jim me
pilot been pilot now long time

ay cried jermin quite surprised as indeed we all were you are
the pilot then you old pagan why didn't you come off before this

ah me scibbee me know you piratee pirate see you long time
but no me come i sabbee you you ita maitai nuee superlatively
bad

paddle away with ye roared jermin in a rage be off or i'll dart
a harpoon at ye

but instead of obeying the order jim seizing his paddle darted the
canoe right up to the gangway and in two bounds stood on deck

pulling a greasy silk handkerchief still lower over his brow and
improving the sit of his frock-coat with a vigorous jerk he then
strode up to the mate and in a more flowery style than ever gave
him to understand that the redoubtable jim himself was before
him that the ship was his until the anchor was down and he should
like to hear what anyone had to say to it

as there now seemed little doubt that he was all he claimed to be the
julia was at last surrendered

our gentleman now proceeded to bring us to an anchor jumping up
between the knight-heads and bawling out luff luff keepy off
leeepy off and insisting upon each time being respectfully
responded to by the man at the helm at this time our steerage-way
was almost gone and yet in giving his orders the passionate old
man made as much fuss as a white squall aboard the flying dutchman

jim turned out to be the regular pilot of the harbour a post be it
known of no small profit and in his eyes at least invested with
immense importance our unceremonious entrance therefore was
regarded as highly insulting and tending to depreciate both the
dignity and lucrativeness of his office

the old man is something of a wizard having an understanding with the
elements certain phenomena of theirs are exhibited for his
particular benefit unusually clear weather with a fine steady
breeze is a certain sign that a merchantman is at hand whale-spouts
seen from the harbour are tokens of a whaling vessel's approach and
thunder and lightning happening so seldom as they do are proof
positive that a man-of-war is drawing near

in short jim the pilot is quite a character in his way and no one
visits tahiti without hearing some curious story about him



chapter xxvii

a glance at papeetee we are sent aboard the frigate

the village of papeetee struck us all very pleasantly lying in a
semicircle round the bay the tasteful mansions of the chiefs and
foreign residents impart an air of tropical elegance heightened by
the palm-trees waving here and there and the deep-green groves of
the bread-fruit in the background the squalid huts of the common
people are out of sight and there is nothing to mar the prospect

all round the water extends a wide smooth beach of mixed pebbles and
fragments of coral this forms the thoroughfare of the village the
handsomest houses all facing it the fluctuation of the tides being
so inconsiderable that they cause no inconvenience

the pritchard residence a fine large building occupies a site on one
side of the bay a green lawn slopes off to the sea and in front
waves the english flag across the water the tricolour also and the
stars and stripes distinguish the residences of the other consuls

what greatly added to the picturesqueness of the bay at this time was
the condemned hull of a large ship which at the farther end of the
harbour lay bilged upon the beach its stern settled low in the
water and the other end high and dry from where we lay the trees
behind seemed to lock their leafy boughs over its bowsprit which
from its position looked nearly upright

she was an american whaler a very old craft having sprung a leak at
sea she had made all sail for the island to heave down for repairs
found utterly unseaworthy however her oil was taken out and sent
home in another vessel the hull was then stripped and sold for a
trifle

before leaving tahiti i had the curiosity to go over this poor old
ship thus stranded on a strange shore what were my emotions when i
saw upon her stern the name of a small town on the river hudson she
was from the noble stream on whose banks i was born in whose waters
i had a hundred times bathed in an instant palm-trees and
elms canoes and skiffs church spires and bamboos all mingled in one
vision of the present and the past

but we must not leave little jule

at last the wishes of many were gratified and like an aeronaut's
grapnel her rusty little anchor was caught in the coral groves at
the bottom of papeetee bay this must have been more than forty days
after leaving the marquesas

the sails were yet unfurled when a boat came alongside with our
esteemed friend wilson the consul

how's this how's this mr jermin he began looking very savage as
he touched the deck what brings you in without orders

you did not come off to us as you promised sir and there was no
hanging on longer with nobody to work the ship was the blunt reply

so the infernal scoundrels held out did they very good i'll make
them sweat for it and he eyed the scowling men with unwonted
intrepidity the truth was he felt safer now than when outside the
reef

muster the mutineers on the quarter-deck he continued drive them
aft sir sick and well i have a word to say to them

now men said he you think it's all well with you i suppose you
wished the ship in and here she is captain guy's ashore and you
think you must go too but we'll see about that i'll miserably
disappoint you these last were his very words mr jermin call
off the names of those who did not refuse duty and let them go over
to the starboard side

this done a list was made out of the mutineers as he was pleased
to call the rest among these the doctor and myself were included
though the former stepped forward and boldly pleaded the office held
by him when the vessel left sydney the mate also who had always
been friendly stated the service rendered by myself two nights
previous as well as my conduct when he announced his intention to
enter the harbour for myself i stoutly maintained that according
to the tenor of the agreement made with captain guy my time aboard
the ship had expired the cruise being virtually at an end however
it had been brought about and i claimed my discharge

but wilson would hear nothing marking something in my manner
nevertheless he asked my name and country and then observed with a
sneer ah you are the lad i see that wrote the round robin i'll
take good care of you my fine fellow step back sir

as for poor long ghost he denounced him as a sydney flash-gorger
though what under heaven he meant by that euphonious title is more
than i can tell upon this the doctor gave him such a piece of his
mind that the consul furiously commanded him to hold his peace or he
would instantly have him seized into the rigging and flogged there
was no help for either of us we were judged by the company we kept

all were now sent forward not a word being said as to what he
intended doing with us

after a talk with the mate the consul withdrew going aboard the
french frigate which lay within a cable's length we now suspected
his object and since matters had come to this pass were rejoiced at
it in a day or two the frenchman was to sail for valparaiso the
usual place of rendezvous for the english squadron in the pacific
and doubtless wilson meant to put us on board and send us thither to
be delivered up should our conjecture prove correct all we had to
expect according to our most experienced shipmates was the fag end
of a cruise in one of her majesty's ships and a discharge before
long at portsmouth

we now proceeded to put on all the clothes we could frock over frock
and trousers over trousers so as to be in readiness for removal at a
moment's warning armed ships allow nothing superfluous to litter up
the deck and therefore should we go aboard the frigate our chests
and their contents would have to be left behind

in an hour's time the first cutter of the reine blanche came
alongside manned by eighteen or twenty sailors armed with cutlasses
and boarding pistols the officers of course wearing their
side-arms and the consul in an official cocked hat borrowed for the
occasion the boat was painted a pirate black its crew were a
dark grim-looking set and the officers uncommonly fierce-looking
little frenchmen on the whole they were calculated to intimidate the
consul's object doubtless in bringing them

summoned aft again everyone's name was called separately and being
solemnly reminded that it was his last chance to escape punishment
was asked if he still refused duty the response was instantaneous
ay sir i do in some cases followed up by divers explanatory
observations cut short by wilson's ordering the delinquent to the
cutter as a general thing the order was promptly obeyed some
taking a sequence of hops skips and jumps by way of showing not
only their unimpaired activity of body but their alacrity in
complying with all reasonable requests

having avowed their resolution not to pull another rope of the
julia's even if at once restored to perfect health all the
invalids with the exception of the two to be set ashore accompanied
us into the cutter they were in high spirits so much so that
something was insinuated about their not having been quite as ill as
pretended

the cooper's name was the last called we did not hear what he
answered but he stayed behind nothing was done about the mowree

shoving clear from the ship three loud cheers were raised flash jack
and others receiving a sharp reprimand for it from the consul

good-bye little jule cried navy bob as we swept under the bows
don't fall overboard ropey said another to the poor landlubber
who with wymontoo the dane and others left behind was looking
over at us from the forecastle

give her three more cried salem springing to his feet and whirling
his hat round you sacre dam raakeel shouted the lieutenant of
the party bringing the flat of his sabre across his shoulders you
now keepy steel

the doctor and myself more discreet sat quietly in the bow of the
cutter and for my own part though i did not repent what i had done
my reflections were far from being enviable



chapter xxviii

reception from the frenchman

in a few moments we were paraded in the frigate's gangway the first
lieutenant an elderly yellow-faced officer in an ill-cut coat and
tarnished gold lace coming up and frowning upon us

this gentleman's head was a mere bald spot his legs sticks in
short his whole physical vigour seemed exhausted in the production
of one enormous moustache old gamboge as he was forthwith
christened now received a paper from the consul and opening it
proceeded to compare the goods delivered with the invoice

after being thoroughly counted a meek little midshipman was called
and we were soon after given in custody to half-a-dozen
sailor-soldiers fellows with tarpaulins and muskets preceded by a
pompous functionary whom we took for one of the ship's corporals
from his ratan and the gold lace on his sleeve we were now escorted
down the ladders to the berth-deck

here we were politely handcuffed all round the man with the bamboo
evincing the utmost solicitude in giving us a good fit from a large
basket of the articles of assorted sizes

taken by surprise at such an uncivil reception a few of the party
demurred but all coyness was at last overcome and finally our
feet were inserted into heavy anklets of iron running along a great
bar bolted down to the deck after this we considered ourselves
permanently established in our new quarters

the deuce take their old iron exclaimed the doctor if i'd known
this i'd stayed behind

ha ha cried flash jack you're in for it doctor long ghost

my hands and feet are any way was the reply

they placed a sentry over us a great lubber of a fellow who marched
up and down with a dilapidated old cutlass of most extraordinary
dimensions from its length we had some idea that it was expressly
intended to keep a crowd in order reaching over the heads of
half-a-dozen say so as to get a cut at somebody behind

mercy ejaculated the doctor with a shudder what a sensation it
must be to be killed by such a tool

we fasted till night when one of the boys came along with a couple of
kids containing a thin saffron-coloured fluid with oily particles
floating on top the young wag told us this was soup it turned out
to be nothing more than oleaginous warm water such as it was
nevertheless we were fain to make a meal of it our sentry being
attentive enough to undo our bracelets the kids passed from mouth
to mouth and were soon emptied

the next morning when the sentry's back was turned someone whom we
took for an english sailor tossed over a few oranges the rinds of
which we afterward used for cups

on the second day nothing happened worthy of record on the third we
were amused by the following scene

a man whom we supposed a boatswain's mate from the silver whistle
hanging from his neck came below driving before him a couple of
blubbering boys and followed by a whole troop of youngsters in
tears the pair it seemed were sent down to be punished by command
of an officer the rest had accompanied them out of sympathy

the boatswain's mate went to work without delay seizing the poor
little culprits by their loose frocks and using a ratan without
mercy the other boys wept clasped their hands and fell on their
knees but in vain the boatswain's mate only hit out at them once
in a while making them yell ten times louder than ever

in the midst of the tumult down comes a midshipman who with a great
air orders the man on deck and running in among the bows sets them
to scampering in all directions

the whole of this proceeding was regarded with infinite scorn by navy
bob who years before had been captain of the foretop on board a
line-of-battle ship in his estimation it was a lubberly piece of
business throughout they did things differently in the english navy



chapter xxix

the reine blanche

i cannot forbear a brief reflection upon the scene ending the last
chapter

the ratanning of the young culprits although significant of the
imperfect discipline of a french man-of-war may also be considered
as in some measure characteristic of the nation

in an american or english ship a boy when flogged is either lashed to
the breech of a gun or brought right up to the gratings the same
way the men are but as a general rule he is never punished beyond
his strength you seldom or never draw a cry from the young rogue he
bites his tongue and stands up to it like a hero if practicable
which is not always the case he makes a point of smiling under the
operation and so far from his companions taking any compassion on
him they always make merry over his misfortunes should he turn baby
and cry they are pretty sure to give him afterward a sly pounding in
some dark corner

this tough training produces its legitimate results the boy becomes
in time a thoroughbred tar equally ready to strip and take a dozen
on board his own ship or cutlass in hand dash pell-mell on board
the enemy's whereas the young frenchman as all the world knows
makes but an indifferent seaman and though for the most part he
fights well enough somehow or other he seldom fights well enough to
beat

how few sea-battles have the french ever won but more how few ships
have they ever carried by the board that true criterion of naval
courage but not a word against french bravery there is plenty of
it but not of the right sort a yankee's or an englishman's is the
downright waterloo game the french fight better on land and not
being essentially a maritime people they ought to stay there the
best of shipwrights they are no sailors

and this carries me back to the reine blanche as noble a specimen of
what wood and iron can make as ever floated

she was a new ship the present her maiden cruise the greatest pains
having been taken in her construction she was accounted the crack
craft in the french navy she is one of the heavy sixty-gun frigates
now in vogue all over the world and which we yankees were the first
to introduce in action these are the most murderous vessels ever
launched

the model of the reine blanche has all that warlike comeliness only to
be seen in a fine fighting ship still there is a good deal of
french flummery about her brass plates and other gewgaws stuck on
all over like baubles on a handsome woman

among other things she carries a stern gallery resting on the
uplifted hands of two caryatides larger than life you step out upon
this from the commodore's cabin to behold the rich hangings and
mirrors and mahogany within one is almost prepared to see a bevy of
ladies trip forth on the balcony for an airing

but come to tread the gun-deck and all thoughts like these are put to
flight such batteries of thunderbolt hurlers with a
sixty-eight-pounder or two thrown in as make-weights on the spar-deck
also are carronades of enormous calibre

recently built this vessel of course had the benefit of the latest
improvements i was quite amazed to see on what high principles of
art some exceedingly simple things were done but your gaul is
scientific about everything what other people accomplish by a few
hard knocks he delights in achieving by a complex arrangement of the
pulley lever and screw

what demi-semi-quavers in a french air in exchanging naval
courtesies i have known a french band play yankee doodle with such
a string of variations that no one but a pretty cute yankee could
tell what they were at

in the french navy they have no marines their men taking turns at
carrying the musket are sailors one moment and soldiers the next a
fellow running aloft in his line frock to-day to-morrow stands
sentry at the admiral's cabin door this is fatal to anything like
proper sailor pride to make a man a seaman he should be put to no
other duty indeed a thorough tar is unfit for anything else and
what is more this fact is the best evidence of his being a true
sailor

on board the reine blanche they did not have enough to eat and what
they did have was not of the right sort instead of letting the
sailors file their teeth against the rim of a hard sea-biscuit they
baked their bread daily in pitiful little rolls then they had no
grog as a substitute they drugged the poor fellows with a thin
sour wine the juice of a few grapes perhaps to a pint of the juice
of water-faucets moreover the sailors asked for meat and they
gave them soup a rascally substitute as they well knew

ever since leaving home they had been on short allowance at the
present time those belonging to the boats and thus getting an
occasional opportunity to run ashore frequently sold their rations
of bread to some less fortunate shipmate for sixfold its real value

another thing tending to promote dissatisfaction among the crew was
their having such a devil of a fellow for a captain he was one of
those horrid naval bores a great disciplinarian in port he kept
them constantly exercising yards and sails and maneuvering with the
boats and at sea they were forever at quarters running in and out
the enormous guns as if their arms were made for nothing else then
there was the admiral aboard also and no doubt he too had a
paternal eye over them

in the ordinary routine of duty we could not but be struck with the
listless slovenly behaviour of these men there was nothing of the
national vivacity in their movements nothing of the quick precision
perceptible on the deck of a thoroughly-disciplined armed vessel

all this however when we came to know the reason was no matter of
surprise three-fourths of them were pressed men some old merchant
sailors had been seized the very day they landed from distant
voyages while the landsmen of whom there were many had been driven
down from the country in herds and so sent to sea

at the time i was quite amazed to hear of press-gangs in a day of
comparative peace but the anomaly is accounted for by the fact that
of late the french have been building up a great military marine to
take the place of that which nelson gave to the waves of the sea at
trafalgar but it is to be hoped that they are not building their
ships for the people across the channel to take in case of a war
what a fluttering of french ensigns there would be

though i say the french are no sailors i am far from seeking to
underrate them as a people they are an ingenious and right gallant
nation and as an american i take pride in asserting it



chapter xxx

they take us ashore what happened there

five days and nights if i remember right we were aboard the frigate
on the afternoon of the fifth we were told that the next morning she
sailed for valparaiso rejoiced at this we prayed for a speedy
passage but as it turned out the consul had no idea of letting us
off so easily to our no small surprise an officer came along toward
night and ordered us out of irons being then mustered in the
gangway we were escorted into a cutter alongside and pulled ashore

accosted by wilson as we struck the beach he delivered us up to a
numerous guard of natives who at once conducted us to a house near
by here we were made to sit down under a shade without and the
consul and two elderly european residents passed by us and entered

after some delay during which we were much diverted by the hilarious
good-nature of our guard one of our number was called out for
followed by an order for him to enter the house alone

on returning a moment after he told us we had little to encounter it
had simply been asked whether he still continued of the same mind on
replying yes something was put down upon a piece of paper and he
was waved outside all being summoned in rotation my own turn came
at last

within wilson and his two friends were seated magisterially at a
table an inkstand a pen and a sheet of paper lending quite a
business-like air to the apartment these three gentlemen being
arrayed in coats and pantaloons looked respectable at least in a
country where complete suits of garments are so seldom met with one
present essayed a solemn aspect but having a short neck and full
face only made out to look stupid

it was this individual who condescended to take a paternal interest in
myself after declaring my resolution with respect to the ship
unalterable i was proceeding to withdraw in compliance with a sign
from the consul when the stranger turned round to him saying wait
a minute if you please mr wilson let me talk to that youth come
here my young friend i'm extremely sorry to see you associated with
these bad men do you know what it will end in

oh that's the lad that wrote the round robin interposed the
consul he and that rascally doctor are at the bottom of the whole
affair go outside sir

i retired as from the presence of royalty backing out with many
bows

the evident prejudice of wilson against both the doctor and myself was
by no means inexplicable a man of any education before the mast is
always looked upon with dislike by his captain and never mind how
peaceable he may be should any disturbance arise from his
intellectual superiority he is deemed to exert an underhand
influence against the officers

little as i had seen of captain guy the few glances cast upon me
after being on board a week or so were sufficient to reveal his
enmity a feeling quickened by my undisguised companionship with long
ghost whom he both feared and cordially hated guy's relations with
the consul readily explains the latter's hostility

the examination over wilson and his friends advanced to the doorway
when the former assuming a severe expression pronounced our
perverseness infatuation in the extreme nor was there any hope left
our last chance for pardon was gone even were we to become contrite
and crave permission to return to duty it would not now be
permitted

oh get along with your gammon counsellor exclaimed black dan
absolutely indignant that his understanding should be thus insulted

quite enraged wilson bade him hold his peace and then summoning a
fat old native to his side addressed him in tahitian giving
directions for leading us away to a place of safe keeping

hereupon being marshalled in order with the old man at our head we
were put in motion with loud shouts along a fine pathway running
far on through wide groves of the cocoa-nut and bread-fruit

the rest of our escort trotted on beside us in high good-humour
jabbering broken english and in a hundred ways giving us to
understand that wilson was no favourite of theirs and that we were
prime good fellows for holding out as we did they seemed to know
our whole history

the scenery around was delightful the tropical day was fast drawing
to a close and from where we were the sun looked like a vast red
fire burning in the woodlands its rays falling aslant through the
endless ranks of trees and every leaf fringed with flame escaped
from the confined decks of the frigate the air breathed spices to
us streams were heard flowing green boughs were rocking and far
inland all sunset flushed rose the still steep peaks of the
island

as we proceeded i was more and more struck by the picturesqueness of
the wide shaded road in several places durable bridges of wood
were thrown over large water-courses others were spanned by a single
arch of stone in any part of the road three horsemen might have
ridden abreast

this beautiful avenue by far the best thing which civilization has
done for the island is called by foreigners the broom road though
for what reason i do not know originally planned for the convenience
of the missionaries journeying from one station to another it almost
completely encompasses the larger peninsula skirting for a distance
of at least sixty miles along the low fertile lands bordering the
sea but on the side next taiarboo or the lesser peninsula it
sweeps through a narrow secluded valley and thus crosses the island
in that direction

the uninhabited interior being almost impenetrable from the
densely-wooded glens frightful precipices and sharp mountain ridges
absolutely inaccessible is but little known even to the natives
themselves and so instead of striking directly across from one
village to another they follow the broom road round and round

it is by no means however altogether travelled on foot horses being
now quite plentiful they were introduced from chili and possessing
all the gaiety fleetness and docility of the spanish breed are
admirably adapted to the tastes of the higher classes who as
equestrians have become very expert the missionaries and chiefs
never think of journeying except in the saddle and at all hours of
the day you see the latter galloping along at full speed like the
sandwich islanders they ride like pawnee-loups

for miles and miles i have travelled the broom road and never wearied
of the continual change of scenery but wherever it leads
you whether through level woods across grassy glens or over hills
waving with palms the bright blue sea on one side and the green
mountain pinnacles on the other are always in sight



chapter xxxi

the calabooza beretanee

about a mile from the village we came to a halt

it was a beautiful spot a mountain stream here flowed at the foot of
a verdant slope on one hand it murmured along until the waters
spreading themselves upon a beach of small sparkling shells
trickled into the sea on the other was a long defile where the eye
pursued a gleaming sinuous thread lost in shade and verdure

the ground next the road was walled in by a low rude parapet of
stones and upon the summit of the slope beyond was a large native
house the thatch dazzling white and in shape an oval

calabooza calabooza beretanee the english jail cried our
conductor pointing to the building

for a few months past having been used by the consul as a house of
confinement for his refractory sailors it was thus styled to
distinguish it from similar places in and about papeetee

though extremely romantic in appearance on a near approach it proved
hut ill adapted to domestic comfort in short it was a mere shell
recently built and still unfinished it was open all round and
tufts of grass were growing here and there under the very roof the
only piece of furniture was the stocks a clumsy machine for
keeping people in one place which i believe is pretty much out of
date in most countries it is still in use however among the
spaniards in south america from whom it seems the tahitians have
borrowed the contrivance as well as the name by which all places of
confinement are known among them

the stocks were nothing more than two stout timbers about twenty feet
in length and precisely alike one was placed edgeways on the
ground and the other resting on top left at regular intervals
along the seam several round holes the object of which was evident
at a glance

by this time our guide had informed us that he went by the name of
capin bob captain bob and a hearty old bob he proved it was
just the name for him from the first so pleased were we with the
old man that we cheerfully acquiesced in his authority

entering the building he set us about fetching heaps of dry leaves to
spread behind the stocks for a couch a trunk of a small cocoa-nut
tree was then placed for a bolster rather a hard one but the
natives are used to it for a pillow they use a little billet of
wood scooped out and standing on four short legs a sort of
head-stool

these arrangements completed captain bob proceeded to hanna-par or
secure us for the night the upper timber of the machine being
lifted at one end and our ankles placed in the semicircular spaces
of the lower one the other beam was then dropped both being
finally secured together by an old iron hoop at either extremity
this initiation was performed to the boisterous mirth of the natives
and diverted ourselves not a little

captain bob now bustled about like an old woman seeing the children
to bed a basket of baked taro or indian turnip was brought in
and we were given a piece all round then a great counterpane of
coarse brown tappa was stretched over the whole party and after
sundry injunctions to moee-moee and be maitai in other words
to go to sleep and be good boys we were left to ourselves fairly
put to bed and tucked in

much talk was now had concerning our prospects in life but the doctor
and i who lay side by side thinking the occasion better adapted to
meditation kept pretty silent and before long the rest ceased
conversing and wearied with loss of rest on board the frigate were
soon sound asleep

after sliding from one reverie into another i started and gave the
doctor a pinch he was dreaming however and resolved to follow his
example i troubled him no more

how the rest managed i know not but for my own part i found it very
hard to get to sleep the consciousness of having one's foot pinned
and the impossibility of getting it anywhere else than just where it
was was most distressing

but this was not all there was no way of lying but straight on your
back unless to be sure one's limb went round and round in the
ankle like a swivel upon getting into a sort of doze it was no
wonder this uneasy posture gave me the nightmare under the delusion
that i was about some gymnastics or other i gave my unfortunate
member such a twitch that i started up with the idea that someone was
dragging the stocks away

captain bob and his friends lived in a little hamlet hard by and when
morning showed in the east the old gentleman came forth from that
direction likewise emerging from a grove and saluting us loudly as
he approached

finding everybody awake he set us at liberty and leading us down to
the stream ordered every man to strip and bathe

all han's my boy hanna-hanna wash he cried bob was a linguist
and had been to sea in his day as he many a time afterwards told us

at this moment we were all alone with him and it would have been the
easiest thing in the world to have given him the slip but he seemed
to have no idea of such a thing treating us so frankly and
cordially indeed that even had we thought of running we should
have been ashamed of attempting it he very well knew nevertheless
as we ourselves were not slow in finding out that for various
reasons any attempt of the kind without some previously arranged
plan for leaving the island would be certain to fail

as bob was a rare one every way i must give some account of him
there was a good deal of personal appearance about him in short
he was a corpulent giant over six feet in height and literally as
big round as a hogshead the enormous bulk of some of the tahitians
has been frequently spoken of by voyagers

beside being the english consul's jailer as it were he carried on a
little tahitian farming that is to say he owned several groves of
the bread-fruit and palm and never hindered their growing close by
was a taro patch of his which he occasionally visited

bob seldom disposed of the produce of his lands it was all needed for
domestic consumption indeed for gormandizing i would have matched
him against any three common-council men at a civic feast

a friend of bob's told me that owing to his voraciousness his visits
to other parts of the island were much dreaded for according to
tahitian customs hospitality without charge is enjoined upon
everyone and though it is reciprocal in most cases in bob's it was
almost out of the question the damage done to a native larder in one
of his morning calls was more than could be made good by his
entertainer's spending the holidays with them

the old man as i have hinted had once upon a time been a cruise or
two in a whaling-vessel and therefore he prided himself upon his
english having acquired what he knew of it in the forecastle he
talked little else than sailor phrases which sounded whimsically
enough

i asked him one day how old he was olee he exclaimed looking very
profound in consequence of thoroughly understanding so subtile a
question oh very olee tousand ear more big man when capin
tootee captain cook heavey in sight in sea parlance came into
view

this was a thing impossible but adapting my discourse to the man i
rejoined ah you see capin tootee well how you like him

oh he maitai good friend of me and know my wife

on my assuring him strongly that he could not have been born at the
time he explained himself by saying that he was speaking of his
father all the while this indeed might very well have been

it is a curious fact that all these people young and old will tell
you that they have enjoyed the honour of a personal acquaintance with
the great navigator and if you listen to them they will go on and
tell anecdotes without end this springs from nothing but their great
desire to please well knowing that a more agreeable topic for a
white man could not be selected as for the anachronism of the thing
they seem to have no idea of it days and years are all the same to
them

after our sunrise bath bob once more placed us in the stocks almost
moved to tears at subjecting us to so great a hardship but he could
not treat us otherwise he said on pain of the consul's displeasure
how long we were to be confined he did not know nor what was to be
done with us in the end

as noon advanced and no signs of a meal were visible someone
inquired whether we were to be boarded as well as lodged at the
hotel de calabooza

vast heavey avast heaving or wait a bit said bob kow-kow
food come ship by by

and sure enough along comes rope tarn with a wooden bucket of the
julia's villainous biscuit with a grin he said it was a present
from wilson it was all we were to get that day a great cry was now
raised and well was it for the land-lubber that lie had a pair of
legs and the men could not use theirs one and all we resolved not
to touch the bread come what come might and so we told the natives

being extravagantly fond of ship-biscuit the harder the better they
were quite overjoyed and offered to give us every day a small
quantity of baked bread-fruit and indian turnip in exchange for the
bread this we agreed to and every morning afterward when the
bucket came its contents were at once handed over to bob and his
friends who never ceased munching until nightfall

our exceedingly frugal meal of bread-fruit over captain bob waddled
up to us with a couple of long poles hooked at one end and several
large baskets of woven cocoa-nut branches

not far off was an extensive grove of orange-trees in full bearing
and myself and another were selected to go with him and gather a
supply for the party when we went in among the trees the
sumptuousness of the orchard was unlike anything i had ever seen
while the fragrance shaken from the gently waving boughs regaled our
senses most delightfully

in many places the trees formed a dense shade spreading overhead a
dark rustling vault groined with boughs and studded here and there
with the ripened spheres like gilded balls in several places the
overladen branches were borne to the earth hiding the trunk in a
tent of foliage once fairly in the grove we could see nothing else
it was oranges all round

to preserve the fruit from bruising bob hooking the twigs with his
pole let them fall into his basket but this would not do for us
seizing hold of a bough we brought such a shower to the ground that
our old friend was fain to run from under heedless of remonstrance
we then reclined in the shade and feasted to our heart's content
heaping up the baskets afterwards we returned to our comrades by
whom our arrival was hailed with loud plaudits and in a marvellously
short time nothing was left of the oranges we brought but the rinds

while inmates of the calabooza we had as much of the fruit as we
wanted and to this cause and others that might be mentioned may be
ascribed the speedy restoration of our sick to comparative health

the orange of tahiti is delicious small and sweet with a thin dry
rind though now abounding it was unknown before cook's time to
whom the natives are indebted for so great a blessing he likewise
introduced several other kinds of fruit among these were the fig
pineapple and lemon now seldom met with the lime still grows and
some of the poorer natives express the juice to sell to the shipping
it is highly valued as an anti-scorbutic nor was the variety of
foreign fruits and vegetables which were introduced the only benefit
conferred by the first visitors to the society group cattle and
sheep were left at various places more of them anon

thus after all that of late years has been done for these islanders
cook and vancouver may in one sense at least be considered their
greatest benefactors



chapter xxxii

proceedings of the french at tahiti

as i happened to arrive at the island at a very interesting period in
its political affairs it may be well to give some little account
here of the proceedings of the french by way of episode to the
narrative my information was obtained at the time from the general
reports then rife among the natives as well as from what i learned
upon a subsequent visit and reliable accounts which i have seen
since reaching home

it seems that for some time back the french had been making repeated
ineffectual attempts to plant a roman catholic mission here but
invariably treated with contumely they sometimes met with open
violence and in every case those directly concerned in the
enterprise were ultimately forced to depart in one instance two
priests laval and caset after enduring a series of persecutions
were set upon by the natives maltreated and finally carried aboard
a small trading schooner which eventually put them ashore at wallis
island a savage place some two thousand miles to the westward

now that the resident english missionaries authorized the banishment
of these priests is a fact undenied by themselves i was also
repeatedly informed that by their inflammatory harangues they
instigated the riots which preceded the sailing of the schooner at
all events it is certain that their unbounded influence with the
natives would easily have enabled them to prevent everything that
took place on this occasion had they felt so inclined

melancholy as such an example of intolerance on the part of protestant
missionaries must appear it is not the only one and by no means the
most flagrant which might be presented but i forbear to mention any
others since they have been more than hinted at by recent voyagers
and their repetition here would perhaps be attended with no good
effect besides the conduct of the sandwich island missionaries in
particular has latterly much amended in this respect

the treatment of the two priests formed the principal ground and the
only justifiable one upon which du petit thouars demanded
satisfaction and which subsequently led to his seizure of the
island in addition to other things he also charged that the flag of
merenhout the consul had been repeatedly insulted and the property
of a certain french resident violently appropriated by the
government in the latter instance the natives were perfectly in the
right at that time the law against the traffic in ardent spirits
every now and then suspended and revived happened to be in force
and finding a large quantity on the premises of victor a low
knavish adventurer from marseilles the tahitians pronounced it
forfeit

for these and similar alleged outrages a large pecuniary restitution
was demanded dollars which there being no exchequer to
supply the island was forthwith seized under cover of a mock
treaty dictated to the chiefs on the gun-deck of du petit thouars
frigate

but notwithstanding this formality there seems now little doubt that
the downfall of the pomarees was decided upon at the tuilleries

after establishing the protectorate so called the rear-admiral
sailed leaving m bruat governor assisted by reine and carpegne
civilians named members of the council of government and merenhout
the consul now made commissioner royal no soldiers however were
landed until several months afterward as men reine and carpegne
were not disliked by the natives but bruat and merenhout they
bitterly detested in several interviews with the poor queen the
unfeeling governor sought to terrify her into compliance with his
demands clapping his hand upon his sword shaking his fist in her
face and swearing violently oh king of a great nation said
pomaree in her letter to louis philippe fetch away this man i and
my people cannot endure his evil doings he is a shameless man

although the excitement among the natives did not wholly subside upon
the rear-admiral's departure no overt act of violence immediately
followed the queen had fled to imeeo and the dissensions among the
chiefs together with the ill-advised conduct of the missionaries
prevented a union upon some common plan of resistance but the great
body of the people as well as their queen confidently relied upon
the speedy interposition of england a nation bound to them by many
ties and which more than once had solemnly guaranteed their
independence

as for the missionaries they openly defied the french governor
childishly predicting fleets and armies from britain but what is the
welfare of a spot like tahiti to the mighty interests of france and
england there was a remonstrance on one side and a reply on the
other and there the matter rested for once in their brawling lives
st george and st denis were hand and glove and they were not
going to cross sabres about tahiti

during my stay upon the island so far as i could see there was
little to denote that any change had taken place in the government

such laws as they had were administered the same as ever the
missionaries went about unmolested and comparative tranquillity
everywhere prevailed nevertheless i sometimes heard the natives
inveighing against the french no favourites by the bye throughout
polynesia and bitterly regretting that the queen had not at the
outset made a stand

in the house of the chief adeea frequent discussions took place
concerning the ability of the island to cope with the french the
number of fighting men and muskets among the natives were talked of
as well as the propriety of fortifying several heights overlooking
papeetee imputing these symptoms to the mere resentment of a recent
outrage and not to any determined spirit of resistance i little
anticipated the gallant though useless warfare so soon to follow my
departure

at a period subsequent to my first visit the island which before was
divided into nineteen districts with a native chief over each in
capacity of governor and judge was by bruat divided into four
over these he set as many recreant chiefs kitoti tati utamai and
paraita to whom he paid dollars each to secure their
assistance in carrying out his evil designs

the first blood shed in any regular conflict was at mahanar upon
the peninsula of taraiboo the fight originated in the seizure of a
number of women from the shore by men belonging to one of the french
vessels of war in this affair the islanders fought desperately
killing about fifty of the enemy and losing ninety of their own
number the french sailors and marines who at the time were
reported to be infuriated with liquor gave no quarter and the
survivors only saved themselves by fleeing to the mountains
subsequently the battles of hararparpi and fararar were fought in
which the invaders met with indifferent success

shortly after the engagement at hararparpi three frenchmen were
waylaid in a pass of the valleys and murdered by the incensed
natives one was lefevre a notorious scoundrel and a spy whom
bruat had sent to conduct a certain major fergus said to be a pole
to the hiding-place of four chiefs whom the governor wished to seize
and execute this circumstance violently inflamed the hostility of
both parties

about this time kitoti a depraved chief and the pliant tool of
bruat was induced by him to give a great feast in the vale of paree
to which all his countrymen were invited the governor's object was
to gain over all he could to his interests he supplied an abundance
of wine and brandy and a scene of bestial intoxication was the
natural consequence before it came to this however several speeches
were made by the islanders one of these delivered by an aged
warrior who had formerly been at the head of the celebrated aeorai
society was characteristic this is a very good feast said the
reeling old man and the wine also is very good but you evil-minded
wee-wees french and you false-hearted men of tahiti are all very
bad

by the latest accounts most of the islanders still refuse to submit
to the french and what turn events may hereafter take it is hard to
predict at any rate these disorders must accelerate the final
extinction of their race

along with the few officers left by du petit thouars were several
french priests for whose unobstructed exertions in the dissemination
of their faith the strongest guarantees were provided by an article
of the treaty but no one was bound to offer them facilities much
less a luncheon the first day they went ashore true they had
plenty of gold but to the natives it was anathema taboo and for
several hours and some odd minutes they would not touch it
emissaries of the pope and the devil as the strangers were
considered the smell of sulphur hardly yet shaken out of their
canonicals what islander would venture to jeopardize his soul and
call down a blight on his breadfruit by holding any intercourse with
them that morning the priests actually picknicked in grove of
cocoa-nut trees but before night christian hospitality in
exchange for a commercial equivalent of hard dollars was given them
in an adjoining house

wanting in civility as the conduct of the english missionaries may be
thought in withholding a decent reception to these persons the
latter were certainly to blame in needlessly placing themselves in
so unpleasant a predicament under far better auspices they might
have settled upon some one of the thousand unconverted isles of the
pacific rather than have forced themselves thus upon a people
already professedly christians



chapter xxxiii

we receive calls at the hotel de calabooza

our place of confinement being open all round and so near the broom
road of course we were in plain sight of everybody passing and
therefore we had no lack of visitors among such an idle inquisitive
set as the tahitians for a few days they were coming and going
continually while thus ignobly fast by the foot we were fain to
give passive audience

during this period we were the lions of the neighbourhood and no
doubt strangers from the distant villages were taken to see the
karhowrees white men in the same way that countrymen in a city
are gallanted to the zoological gardens

all this gave us a fine opportunity of making observations i was
painfully struck by the considerable number of sickly or deformed
persons undoubtedly made so by a virulent complaint which under
native treatment almost invariably affects in the end the muscles
and bones of the body in particular there is a distortion of the
back most unsightly to behold originating in a horrible form of the
malady

although this and other bodily afflictions were unknown before the
discovery of the islands by the whites there are several cases found
of the pa-fa or elephantiasis a native disease which seems to have
prevailed among them from the earliest antiquity affecting the legs
and feet alone it swells them in some instances to the girth of a
man's body covering the skin with scales it might be supposed that
one thus afflicted would be incapable of walking but to all
appearance they seem to be nearly as active as anybody apparently
suffering no pain and bearing the calamity with a degree of
cheerfulness truly marvellous

the fa-fa is very gradual in its approaches and years elapse before
the limb is fully swollen its origin is ascribed by the natives to
various causes but the general impression seems to be that it
arises in most cases from the eating of unripe bread-fruit and
indian turnip so far as i could find out it is not hereditary in no
stage do they attempt a cure the complaint being held incurable

speaking of the fa-fa reminds me of a poor fellow a sailor whom i
afterward saw at roorootoo a lone island some two days sail from
tahiti

the island is very small and its inhabitants nearly extinct we sent
a boat off to see whether any yams were to be had as formerly the
yams of roorootoo were as famous among the islands round about as
sicily oranges in the mediterranean going ashore to my surprise i
was accosted near a little shanty of a church by a white man who
limped forth from a wretched hut his hair and beard were unshorn
his face deadly pale and haggard and one limb swelled with the fa-fa
to an incredible bigness this was the first instance of a foreigner
suffering from it that i had ever seen or heard of and the
spectacle shocked me accordingly

he had been there for years from the first symptoms he could not
believe his complaint to be what it really was and trusted it would
soon disappear but when it became plain that his only chance for
recovery was a speedy change of climate no ship would receive him as
a sailor to think of being taken as a passenger was idle this
speaks little for the humanity of sea captains but the truth is that
those in the pacific have little enough of the virtue and nowadays
when so many charitable appeals are made to them they have become
callous

i pitied the poor fellow from the bottom of my heart but nothing
could i do as our captain was inexorable why said he here we
are started on a six months cruise i can't put back and he is
better off on the island than at sea so on roorootoo he must die
and probably he did

i afterwards heard of this melancholy object from two seamen his
attempts to leave were still unavailing and his hard fate was fast
closing in

notwithstanding the physical degeneracy of the tahitians as a people
among the chiefs individuals of personable figures are still
frequently met with and occasionally majestic-looking men and
diminutive women as lovely as the nymphs who nearly a century ago
swam round the ships of wallis in these instances tahitian beauty
is quite as seducing as it proved to the crew of the bounty the
young girls being just such creatures as a poet would picture in the
tropics soft plump and dreamy-eyed

the natural complexion of both sexes is quite light but the males
appear much darker from their exposure to the sun a dark
complexion however in a man is highly esteemed as indicating
strength of both body and soul hence there is a saying of great
antiquity among them

if dark the cheek of the mother the son will sound the war-conch if
strong her frame he will give laws

with this idea of manliness no wonder the tahitians regarded all pale
and tepid-looking europeans as weak and feminine whereas a sailor
with a cheek like the breast of a roast turkey is held a lad of
brawn to use their own phrase a taata tona or man of bones

speaking of bones recalls an ugly custom of theirs now obsolete that
of making fish-hooks and gimlets out of those of their enemies this
beats the scandinavians turning people's skulls into cups and
saucers

but to return to the calabooza beretanee immense was the interest we
excited among the throngs that called there they would stand talking
about us by the hour growing most unnecessarily excited too and
dancing up and down with all the vivacity of their race they
invariably sided with us flying out against the consul and
denouncing him as ita maitai nuee or very bad exceedingly they
must have borne him some grudge or other

nor were the women sweet souls at all backward in visiting indeed
they manifested even more interest than the men gazing at us with
eyes full of a thousand meanings and conversing with marvellous
rapidity but alas inquisitive though they were and doubtless
taking some passing compassion on us there was little real feeling
in them after all and still less sentimental sympathy many of them
laughed outright at us noting only what was ridiculous in our
plight

i think it was the second day of our confinement that a wild
beautiful girl burst into the calabooza and throwing herself into
an arch attitude stood afar off and gazed at us she was a
heartless one tickled to death with black dan's nursing his chafed
ankle and indulging in certain moral reflections on the consul and
captain guy after laughing her fill at him she condescended to
notice the rest glancing from one to another in the most methodical
and provoking manner imaginable whenever anything struck her
comically you saw it like a flash her finger levelled
instantaneously and flinging herself back she gave loose to
strange hollow little notes of laughter that sounded like the bass
of a music-box playing a lively air with the lid down

now i knew not that there was anything in my own appearance
calculated to disarm ridicule and indeed to have looked at all
heroic under the circumstances would have been rather difficult
still i could not but feel exceedingly annoyed at the prospect of
being screamed at in turn by this mischievous young witch even
though she were but an islander and to tell a secret her beauty
had something to do with this sort of feeling and pinioned as i was
to a log and clad most unbecomingly i began to grow sentimental

ere her glance fell upon me i had unconsciously thrown myself into
the most graceful attitude i could assume leaned my head upon my
hand and summoned up as abstracted an expression as possible though
my face was averted i soon felt it flush and knew that the glance
was on me deeper and deeper grew the flush and not a sound of
laughter

delicious thought she was moved at the sight of me i could stand it
no longer but started up lo there she was her great hazel eyes
rounding and rounding in her head like two stars her whole frame in
a merry quiver and an expression about the mouth that was sudden and
violent death to anything like sentiment

the next moment she spun round and bursting from peal to peal of
laughter went racing out of the calabooza and in mercy to me
never returned



chapter xxxiv

life at the calabooza

a few days passed and at last our docility was rewarded by some
indulgence on the part of captain bob

he allowed the entire party to be at large during the day only
enjoining upon us always to keep within hail this to be sure was
in positive disobedience to wilson's orders and so care had to be
taken that he should not hear of it there was little fear of the
natives telling him but strangers travelling the broom road might by
way of precaution boys were stationed as scouts along the road at
sight of a white man they sounded the alarm when we all made for
our respective holes the stocks being purposely left open the beam
then descended and we were prisoners as soon as the traveller was
out of sight of course we were liberated

notwithstanding the regular supply of food which we obtained from
captain bob and his friends it was so small that we often felt most
intolerably hungry we could not blame them for not bringing us more
for we soon became aware that they had to pinch themselves in order
to give us what they did besides they received nothing for their
kindness but the daily bucket of bread

among a people like the tahitians what we call hard times can only
be experienced in the scarcity of edibles yet so destitute are many
of the common people that this most distressing consequence of
civilization may be said with them to be ever present to be sure
the natives about the calabooza had abundance of limes and oranges
but what were these good for except to impart a still keener edge to
appetites which there was so little else to gratify during the height
of the bread-fruit season they fare better but at other times the
demands of the shipping exhaust the uncultivated resources of the
island and the lands being mostly owned by the chiefs the inferior
orders have to suffer for their cupidity deprived of their nets many
of them would starve

as captain bob insensibly remitted his watchfulness and we began to
stroll farther and farther from the calabooza we managed by a
systematic foraging upon the country round about to make up some of
our deficiencies and fortunate it was that the houses of the
wealthier natives were just as open to us as those of the most
destitute we were treated as kindly in one as the other

once in a while we came in at the death of a chiefs pig the noise of
whose slaughtering was generally to be heard at a great distance an
occasion like this gathers the neighbours together and they have a
bit of a feast where a stranger is always welcome a good loud
squeal therefore was music in our ears it showed something going
on in that direction

breaking in upon the party tumultuously as we did we always created
a sensation sometimes we found the animal still alive and
struggling in which case it was generally dropped at our approach

to provide for these emergencies flash jack generally repaired to the
scene of operations with a sheath-knife between his teeth and a club
in his hand others were exceedingly officious in singeing off the
bristles and disembowelling doctor long ghost and myself however
never meddled with these preliminaries but came to the feast itself
with unimpaired energies

like all lank men my long friend had an appetite of his own others
occasionally went about seeking what they might devour but he was
always on the alert

he had an ingenious way of obviating an inconvenience which we all
experienced at times the islanders seldom use salt with their food
so he begged rope yarn to bring him some from the ship also a little
pepper if he could which accordingly was done this he placed in
a small leather wallet a monkey bag so called by sailors usually
worn as a purse about the neck

in my opinion said long ghost as he tucked the wallet out of
sight it behooves a stranger in tahiti to have his knife in
readiness and his castor slung



chapter xxxv

visit from an old acquaintance

we had not been many days ashore when doctor johnson was espied
coming along the broom road

we had heard that he meditated a visit and suspected what he was
after being upon the consul's hands all our expenses were of course
payable by him in his official capacity and therefore as a friend
of wilson and sure of good pay the shore doctor had some idea of
allowing us to run up a bill with him true it was rather awkward to
ask us to take medicines which on board the ship he told us were
not needed however he resolved to put a bold face on the matter and
give us a call

his approach was announced by one of the scouts upon which someone
suggested that we should let him enter and then put him in the
stocks but long ghost proposed better sport what it was we shall
presently see

very bland and amiable doctor johnson advanced and resting his cane
on the stocks glanced to right and left as we lay before him
well my lads he began how do you find yourselves to-day

looking very demure the men made some rejoinder and he went on

those poor fellows i saw the other day the sick i mean how are
they and he scrutinized the company at last he singled out one
who was assuming a most unearthly appearance and remarked that he
looked as if he were extremely ill yes said the sailor dolefully
i'm afeard doctor i'll soon be losing the number of my mess a
sea phrase for departing this life and he closed his eyes and
moaned

what does he say said johnson turning round eagerly

why exclaimed flash jack who volunteered as interpreter he
means he's going to croak die

croak and what does that mean applied to a patient

oh i understand said he when the word was explained and he
stepped over the stocks and felt the man's pulse

what's his name he asked turning this time to old navy bob

we calls him jingling joe replied that worthy

well then men you must take good care of poor joseph and i will
send him a powder which must be taken according to the directions
some of you know how to read i presume

that ere young cove does replied bob pointing toward the place
where i lay as if he were directing attention to a sail at sea

after examining the rest some of whom were really invalids but
convalescent and others only pretending to be labouring under divers
maladies johnson turned round and addressed the party

men said he if any more of you are ailing speak up and let me
know by order of the consul i'm to call every day so if any of you
are at all sick it's my duty to prescribe for you this sudden
change from ship fare to shore living plays the deuce with you
sailors so be cautious about eating fruit good-day i'll send you
the medicines the first thing in the morning

now i am inclined to suspect that with all his want of understanding
johnson must have had some idea that we were quizzing him still
that was nothing so long as it answered his purpose and therefore
if he did see through us he never showed it

sure enough at the time appointed along came a native lad with a
small basket of cocoa-nut stalks filled with powders pill-boxes
and-vials each with names and directions written in a large round
hand the sailors one and all made a snatch at the collection
under the strange impression that some of the vials were seasoned
with spirits but asserting his privilege as physician to the first
reading of the labels doctor long ghost was at last permitted to
take possession of the basket

the first thing lighted upon was a large vial labelled for
william rub well in

this vial certainly had a spirituous smell and upon handing it to the
patient he made a summary internal application of its contents the
doctor looked aghast

there was now a mighty commotion powders and pills were voted mere
drugs in the market and the holders of vials were pronounced lucky
dogs johnson must have known enough of sailors to make some of his
medicines palatable this at least long ghost suspected certain it
was everyone took to the vials if at all spicy directions were
unheeded their contents all going one road

the largest one of all quite a bottle indeed and having a sort of
burnt brandy odour was labelled for daniel drink freely and
until relieved this black dan proceeded to do and would have made
an end of it at once had not the bottle after a hard struggle been
snatched from his hands and passed round like a jovial decanter
the old tar had complained of the effects of an immoderate eating of
fruit

upon calling the following morning our physician found his precious
row of patients reclining behind the stocks and doing as well as
could be expected

but the pills and powders were found to have been perfectly inactive
probably because none had been taken to make them efficacious it
was suggested that for the future a bottle of pisco should be sent
along with them according to flash jack's notions unmitigated
medical compounds were but dry stuff at the best and needed
something good to wash them down

thus far our own md doctor long ghost after starting the frolic
had taken no further part in it but on the physician's third visit
he took him to one side and had a private confabulation what it
was exactly we could not tell but from certain illustrative signs
and gestures i fancied that he was describing the symptoms of some
mysterious disorganization of the vitals which must have come on
within the hour assisted by his familiarity with medical terms he
seemed to produce a marked impression at last johnson went his way
promising aloud that he would send long ghost what he desired

when the medicine boy came along the following morning the doctor was
the first to accost him walking off with a small purple vial this
time there was little else in the basket but a case-bottle of the
burnt brandy cordial which after much debate was finally disposed
of by someone pouring the contents little by little into the half of
a cocoa-nut shell and so giving all who desired a glass no further
medicinal cheer remaining the men dispersed

an hour or two passed when flash jack directed attention to my long
friend who since the medicine boy left had not been noticed till
now with eyes closed he was lying behind the stocks and jack was
lifting his arm and letting it fall as if life were extinct on
running up with the rest i at once connected the phenomenon with the
mysterious vial searching his pocket i found it and holding it up
it proved to be laudanum flash jack snatching it from my hand in a
rapture quickly informed all present what it was and with much
glee proposed a nap for the company some of them not comprehending
him exactly the apparently defunct long ghost who lay so still that
i a little suspected the genuineness of his sleep was rolled about as
an illustration of the virtues of the vial's contents the idea
tickled everybody mightily and throwing themselves down the magic
draught was passed from hand to hand thinking that as a matter of
course they must at once become insensible each man upon taking
his sip fell back and closed his eyes

there was little fear of the result since the narcotic was equally
distributed but curious to see how it would operate i raised
myself gently after a while and looked around it was about noon
and perfectly still and as we all daily took the siesta i was not
much surprised to find everyone quiet still in one or two instances
i thought i detected a little peeping

presently i heard a footstep and saw doctor johnson approaching

and perplexed enough did he look at the sight of his prostrate file of
patients plunged apparently in such unaccountable slumbers

daniel he cried at last punching in the side with his cane the
individual thus designated daniel my good fellow get up do you
hear

but black dan was immovable and he poked the next sleeper

joseph joseph come wake up it's me doctor johnson

but jingling joe with mouth open and eyes shut was not to be
started

bless my soul he exclaimed with uplifted hands and cane what's
got into em i say men he shouted running up and down come to
life men what under the sun's the matter with you and he struck
the stocks and bawled with increased vigour

at last he paused folded his hands over the head of his cane and
steadfastly gazed upon us the notes of the nasal orchestra were
rising and falling upon his ear and a new idea suggested itself

yes yes the rascals must have been getting boozy well it's none
of my business i'll be off and off he went

no sooner was he out of sight than nearly all started to their feet
and a hearty laugh ensued

like myself most of them had been watching the event from under a sly
eyelid by this time too doctor long ghost was as wide awake as
anybody what were his reasons for taking laudanum if indeed he
took any whatever is best known to himself and as it is neither
mine nor the reader's business we will say no more about it



chapter xxxvi

we are carried before the consul and captain

we had been inmates of the calabooza beretanee about two weeks when
one morning captain bob coming from the bath in a state of utter
nudity brought into the building an armful of old tappa and began
to dress to go out

the operation was quite simple the tappa of the coarsest kind was
in one long heavy piece and fastening one end to a column of
habiscus wood supporting the calabooza he went off a few paces and
putting the other about his waist wound himself right up to the
post this unique costume in rotundity something like a farthingale
added immensely to his large hulk so much so that he fairly waddled
in his gait but he was only adhering to the fashion of his fathers
for in the olden time the kihee or big girdle was quite the
mode for both sexes bob despising recent innovations still clung
to it he was a gentleman of the old school one of the last of the
kihees

he now told us that he had orders to take us before the consul
nothing loth we formed in procession and with the old man at our
head sighing and labouring like an engine and flanked by a guard of
some twenty natives we started for the village

arrived at the consular office we found wilson there and four or
five europeans seated in a row facing us probably with the view of
presenting as judicial an appearance as possible

on one side was a couch where captain guy reclined he looked
convalescent and as we found out intended soon to go aboard his
ship he said nothing but left everything to the consul

the latter now rose and drawing forth a paper from a large roll tied
with red tape commenced reading aloud

it purported to be the affidavit of john jennin first officer of
the british colonial barque julia guy master and proved to be a
long statement of matters from the time of leaving sydney down to
our arrival in the harbour though artfully drawn up so as to bear
hard against every one of us it was pretty correct in the de-
tails excepting that it was wholly silent as to the manifold
derelictions of the mate himself a fact which imparted unusual
significance to the concluding sentence and furthermore this
deponent sayeth not

no comments were made although we all looked round for the mate to
see whether it was possible that he could have authorized this use of
his name but he was not present

the next document produced was the deposition of the captain himself
as on all other occasions however he had very little to say for
himself and it was soon set aside

the third affidavit was that of the seamen remaining aboard the
vessel including the traitor bungs who it seemed had turned
ship's evidence it was an atrocious piece of exaggeration from
beginning to end and those who signed it could not have known what
they were about certainly wymontoo did not though his mark was
there in vain the consul commanded silence during the reading of this
paper comments were shouted out upon every paragraph

the affidavits read wilson who all the while looked as stiff as a
poker solemnly drew forth the ship's articles from their tin case
this document was a discoloured musty bilious-looking affair and
hard to read when finished the consul held it up and pointing to
the marks of the ship's company at the bottom asked us one by one
whether we acknowledged the same for our own

what's the use of asking that said black dan captain guy there
knows as well as we they are

silence sir said wilson who intending to produce a suitable
impression by this ridiculous parade was not a little mortified by
the old sailor's bluntness

a pause of a few moments now ensued during which the bench of judges
communed with captain guy in a low tone and the sailors canvassed
the motives of the consul in having the affidavits taken

the general idea seemed to be that it was done with a view of
bouncing or frightening us into submission such proved to be the
case for wilson rising to his feet again addressed us as
follows 

you see men that every preparation has been made to send you to
sydney for trial the rosa a small australian schooner lying in
the harbour will sail for that place in the course of ten days at
farthest the julia sails on a cruise this day week do you still
refuse duty

we did

hereupon the consul and captain exchanged glances and the latter
looked bitterly disappointed

presently i noticed guy's eye upon me and for the first time he
spoke and told me to come near i stepped forward

was it not you that was taken off the island

it was

it was you then who owe your life to my humanity yet this is the
gratitude of a sailor mr wilson

not so sir and i at once gave him to understand that i was
perfectly acquainted with his motives in sending a boat into the bay
his crew was reduced and he merely wished to procure the sailor whom
he expected to find there the ship was the means of my deliverance
and no thanks to the benevolence of its captain

doctor long ghost also had a word to say in two masterly sentences he
summed up captain guy's character to the complete satisfaction of
every seaman present

matters were now growing serious especially as the sailors became
riotous and talked about taking the consul and the captain back to
the calabooza with them

the other judges fidgeted and loudly commanded silence it was at
length restored when wilson for the last time addressing us said
something more about the rose and sydney and concluded by reminding
us that a week would elapse ere the julia sailed

leaving these hints to operate for themselves he dismissed the party
ordering captain bob and his friends to escort us back whence we
came



chapter xxxvii

the french priests pay their respects

a day or two after the events just related we were lounging in the
calabooza beretanee when we were honoured by a visit from three of
the french priests and as about the only notice ever taken of us by
the english missionaries was their leaving their cards for us in the
shape of a package of tracts we could not help thinking that the
frenchmen in making a personal call were at least much better bred

by this time they had settled themselves down quite near our
habitation a pleasant little stroll down the broom road and a
rustic cross peeped through the trees and soon you came to as
charming a place as one would wish to see a soft knoll planted with
old breadfruit trees in front a savannah sloping to a grove of
palms and between these glimpses of blue sunny waves

on the summit of the knoll was a rude chapel of bamboos quite small
and surmounted by the cross between the canes at nightfall the
natives stole peeps at a small portable altar a crucifix to
correspond and gilded candlesticks and censers their curiosity
carried them no further nothing could induce them to worship there
such queer ideas as they entertained of the hated strangers masses
and chants were nothing more than evil spells as for the priests
themselves they were no better than diabolical sorcerers like those
who in old times terrified their fathers

close by the chapel was a range of native houses rented from a chief
and handsomely furnished here lived the priests and very
comfortably too they looked sanctimonious enough abroad but that
went for nothing since at home in their retreat they were a club
of friar tucks holding priestly wassail over many a good cup of red
brandy and rising late in the morning

pity it was they couldn't marry pity for the ladies of the island i
mean and the cause of morality for what business had the
ecclesiastical old bachelors with such a set of trim little native
handmaidens these damsels were their first converts and devoted
ones they were

the priests as i have said before were accounted necromancers the
appearance of two of our three visitors might have justified the
conceit

they were little dried-up frenchmen in long straight gowns of black
cloth and unsightly three-cornered hats so preposterously big that
in putting them on the reverend fathers seemed to extinguish
themselves

their companion was dressed differently he wore a sort of yellow
flannel morning gown and a broad-brimmed manilla hat large and
portly he was also hale and fifty with a complexion like an
autumnal leaf handsome blue eyes fine teeth and a racy milesian
brogue in short he was an irishman father murphy by name and as
such pretty well known and very thoroughly disliked throughout all
the protestant missionary settlements in polynesia in early youth
he had been sent to a religious seminary in france and taking
orders there had but once or twice afterwards revisited his native
land

father murphy marched up to us briskly and the first words he uttered
were to ask whether there were any of his countrymen among us
there were two of them one a lad of sixteen a bright curly-headed
rascal and being a young irishman of course his name was pat the
other was an ugly and rather melancholy-looking scamp one m'gee
whose prospects in life had been blasted by a premature
transportation to sydney this was the report at least though it
might have been scandal

in most of my shipmates were some redeeming qualities but about
m'gee there was nothing of the kind and forced to consort with him
i could not help regretting a thousand times that the gallows had
been so tardy as if impelled against her will to send him into the
world nature had done all she could to insure his being taken for
what he was about the eyes there was no mistaking him with a
villainous cast in one they seemed suspicious of each other

glancing away from him at once the bluff priest rested his gaze on
the good-humoured face of pat who with a pleasant roguishness was
twigging the enormous hats or hytee belteezers as land beavers
are called by sailors from under which like a couple of snails
peeped the two little frenchmen

pat and the priest were both from the same town in meath and when
this was found out there was no end to the questions of the latter
to him pat seemed a letter from home and said a hundred times as
much

after a long talk between these two and a little broken english from
the frenchmen our visitors took leave but father murphy had hardly
gone a dozen rods when back he came inquiring whether we were in
want of anything

yes cried one something to eat upon this he promised to send us
some fresh wheat bread of his own baking a great luxury in tahiti

we all felicitated pat upon picking up such a friend and told him his
fortune was made

the next morning a french servant of the priest's made his appearance
with a small bundle of clothing for our young hibernian and the
promised bread for the party pat being out at the knees and elbows
and like the rest of us not full inside the present was acceptable
all round

in the afternoon father murphy himself came along and in addition
to his previous gifts gave pat a good deal of advice said he was
sorry to see him in limbo and that he would have a talk with the
consul about having him set free

we saw nothing more of him for two or three days at the end of which
time he paid us another call telling pat that wilson was inexorable
having refused to set him at liberty unless to go aboard the ship
this the priest now besought him to do forthwith and so escape the
punishment which it seems wilson had been hinting at to his
intercessor pat however was staunch against entreaties and with
all the ardour of a sophomorean sailor protested his intention to
hold out to the last with none of the meekness of a good little boy
about him the blunt youngster stormed away at such a rate that it
was hard to pacify him and the priest said no more

how it came to pass whether from murphy's speaking to the consul or
otherwise we could not tell but the next day pat was sent for by
wilson and being escorted to the village by our good old keeper
three days elapsed before he returned

bent upon reclaiming him they had taken him on board the ship
feasted him in the cabin and finding that of no avail down they
thrust him into the hold in double irons and on bread and water
all would not do and so he was sent back to the calabooza boy that
he was they must have counted upon his being more susceptible to
discipline than the rest

the interest felt in pat's welfare by his benevolent countryman was
very serviceable to the rest of us especially as we all turned
catholics and went to mass every morning much to captain bob's
consternation upon finding it out he threatened to keep us in the
stocks if we did not desist he went no farther than this though
and so every few days we strolled down to the priest's residence
and had a mouthful to eat and something generous to drink in
particular dr long ghost and myself became huge favourites with
pat's friend and many a time he regaled us from a quaint-looking
travelling case for spirits stowed away in one corner of his
dwelling it held four square flasks which somehow or other always
contained just enough to need emptying in truth the fine old
irishman was a rosy fellow in canonicals his countenance and his
soul were always in a glow it may be ungenerous to reveal his
failings but he often talked thick and sometimes was perceptibly
eccentric in his gait

i never drink french brandy but i pledge father murphy his health
again and many jolly proselytes may he make in polynesia



chapter xxxviii

little julia sails without us

to make good the hint thrown out by the consul upon the conclusion of
the farce of the affidavits we were again brought before him within
the time specified

it was the same thing over again he got nothing out of us and we
were remanded our resolute behaviour annoying him prodigiously

what we observed led us to form the idea that on first learning the
state of affairs on board the julia wilson must have addressed his
invalid friend the captain something in the following style

guy my poor fellow don't worry yourself now about those rascally
sailors of yours i'll dress them out for you just leave it all to
me and set your mind at rest

but handcuffs and stocks big looks threats dark hints and
depositions had all gone for nought

conscious that as matters now stood nothing serious could grow out
of what had happened and never dreaming that our being sent home for
trial had ever been really thought of we thoroughly understood
wilson and laughed at him accordingly

since leaving the julia we had caught no glimpse of the mate but we
often heard of him

it seemed that he remained on board keeping house in the cabin for
himself and viner who going to see him according to promise was
induced to remain a guest these two cronies now had fine times
tapping the captain's quarter-casks playing cards on the transom
and giving balls of an evening to the ladies ashore in short they
cut up so many queer capers that the missionaries complained of them
to the consul and jermin received a sharp reprimand

this so affected him that he still drank more freely than before and
one afternoon when mellow as a grape he took umbrage at a canoe
full of natives who on being hailed from the deck to come aboard
and show their papers got frightened and paddled for the shore

lowering a boat instantly he equipped wymontoo and the dane with a
cutlass apiece and seizing another himself off they started in
pursuit the ship's ensign flying in the boat's stern the alarmed
islanders beaching their canoe with loud cries fled through the
village the mate after them slashing his naked weapon to right and
left a crowd soon collected and the karhowree toonee or crazy
stranger was quickly taken before wilson

now it so chanced that in a native house hard by the consul and
captain guy were having a quiet game at cribbage by themselves a
decanter on the table standing sentry the obstreperous jermin was
brought in and finding the two thus pleasantly occupied it had a
soothing effect upon him and he insisted upon taking a hand at the
cards and a drink of the brandy as the consul was nearly as tipsy as
himself and the captain dared not object for fear of giving offence
at it they went all three of them and made a night of it the
mate's delinquencies being summarily passed over and his captors
sent away

an incident worth relating grew out of this freak

there wandered about papeetee at this time a shrivelled little
fright of an englishwoman known among sailors as old mother tot
from new zealand to the sandwich islands she had been all over the
south seas keeping a rude hut of entertainment for mariners and
supplying them with rum and dice upon the missionary islands of
course such conduct was severely punishable and at various places
mother tot's establishment had been shut up and its proprietor made
to quit in the first vessel that could be hired to land her
elsewhere but with a perseverance invincible wherever she went she
always started afresh and so became notorious everywhere

by some wicked spell of hers a patient one-eyed little cobbler
followed her about mending shoes for white men doing the old
woman's cooking and bearing all her abuse without grumbling strange
to relate a battered bible was seldom out of his sight and whenever
he had leisure and his mistress back was turned he was forever
poring over it this pious propensity used to enrage the old crone
past belief and oftentimes she boxed his ears with the book and
tried to burn it mother tot and her man josy were indeed a curious
pair

but to my story

a week or so after our arrival in the harbour the old lady had once
again been hunted down and forced for the time to abandon her
nefarious calling this was brought about chiefly by wilson who for
some reason unknown had contracted the most violent hatred for her
which on her part was more than reciprocated

well passing in the evening where the consul and his party were
making merry she peeped through the bamboos of the house and
straightway resolved to gratify her spite

the night was very dark and providing herself with a huge ship's
lantern which usually swung in her hut she waited till they came
forth this happened about midnight wilson making his appearance
supported by two natives holding him up by the arms these three
went first and just as they got under a deep shade a bright light
was thrust within an inch of wilson's nose the old hag was kneeling
before him holding the lantern with uplifted hands

ha ha my fine counsellor she shrieked ye persecute a lone old
body like me for selling rum do ye and here ye are carried home
drunk hoot ye villain i scorn ye and she spat upon him

terrified at the apparition the poor natives arrant believers in
ghosts dropped the trembling consul and fled in all directions
after giving full vent to her rage mother tot hobbled away and left
the three revellers to stagger home the best way they could

the day following our last interview with wilson we learned that
captain guy had gone on board his vessel for the purpose of shipping
a new crew there was a round bounty offered and a heavy bag of
spanish dollars with the julia's articles ready for signing were
laid on the capstan-head

now there was no lack of idle sailors ashore mostly beachcombers
who had formed themselves into an organized gang headed by one mack
a scotchman whom they styled the commodore by the laws of the
fraternity no member was allowed to ship on board a vessel unless
granted permission by the rest in this way the gang controlled the
port all discharged seamen being forced to join them

to mack and his men our story was well known indeed they had several
times called to see us and of course as sailors and congenial
spirits they were hard against captain guy

deeming the matter important they came in a body to the calabooza
and wished to know whether all things considered we thought it best
for any of them to join the julia

anxious to pack the ship off as soon as possible we answered by all
means some went so far as to laud the julia to the skies as the best
and fastest of ships jermin too as a good fellow and a sailor
every inch came in for his share of praise and as for the
captain quiet man he would never trouble anyone in short every
inducement we could think of was presented and plash jack ended by
assuring the beachcombers solemnly that now we were all well and
hearty nothing but a regard to principle prevented us from returning
on board ourselves

the result was that a new crew was finally obtained together with a
steady new englander for second mate and three good whalemen for
harpooners in part what was wanting for the ship's larder was also
supplied and as far as could be done in a place like tahiti the
damages the vessel had sustained were repaired as for the mowree
the authorities refusing to let him be put ashore he was carried to
sea in irons down in the hold what eventually became of him we
never heard

ropey poor poor ropey who a few days previous had fallen sick was
left ashore at the sailor hospital at townor a small place upon the
beach between papeetee and matavai here some time after he
breathed his last no one knew his complaint he must have died of
hard times several of us saw him interred in the sand and i planted
a rude post to mark his resting-place

the cooper and the rest who had remained aboard from the first of
course composed part of the julia's new crew

to account for the conduct all along of the consul and captain in
trying so hard to alter our purpose with respect to the ship the
following statement is all that is requisite beside an advance of
from fifteen to twenty-five dollars demanded by every sailor shipping
at tahiti an additional sum for each man so shipped has to be paid
into the hands of the government as a charge of the port beside
this the men with here and there an exception will only ship for
one cruise thus becoming entitled to a discharge before the vessel
reaches home which in time creates the necessity of obtaining
other men at a similar cost now the julia's exchequer was at
low-water mark or rather it was quite empty and to meet these
expenses a good part of what little oil there was aboard had to be
sold for a song to a merchant of papeetee

it was sunday in tahiti and a glorious morning when captain bob
waddling into the calabooza startled us by announcing ah my
boy shippy you harre maky sail in other words the julia was
off

the beach was quite near and in this quarter altogether uninhabited
so down we ran and at cable's length saw little jule gliding
past top-gallant-sails hoisting and a boy aloft with one leg thrown
over the yard loosing the fore-royal the decks were all life and
commotion the sailors on the forecastle singing ho cheerly men
as they catted the anchor and the gallant jennin bare-headed as his
wont standing up on the bowsprit and issuing his orders by the man
at the helm stood captain guy very quiet and gentlemanly and
smoking a cigar

soon the ship drew near the reef and altering her course glided out
through the break and went on her way

thus disappeared little jule about three weeks after entering the
harbour and nothing more have i ever heard of her



chapter xxxix

jermin serves us a good turn friendships in polynesia

the ship out of the way we were quite anxious to know what was going
to be done with us on this head captain bob could tell us nothing
no further at least than that he still considered himself
responsible for our safe-keeping however he never put us to bed any
more and we had everything our own way

the day after the julia left the old man came up to us in great
tribulation saying that the bucket of bread was no longer
forthcoming and that wilson had refused to send anything in its
place one and all we took this for a hint to disperse quietly and
go about our business nevertheless we were not to be shaken off so
easily and taking a malicious pleasure in annoying our old enemy we
resolved for the present to stay where we were for the part he had
been acting we learned that the consul was the laughing-stock of all
the foreigners ashore who frequently twitted him upon his hopeful
proteges of the calabooza beretanee

as we were wholly without resources so long as we remained on the
island no better place than captain bob's could be selected for an
abiding-place beside we heartily loved the old gentleman and could
not think of leaving him so telling him to give no thought as to
wherewithal we should be clothed and fed we resolved by extending
and systematizing our foraging operations to provide for ourselves

we were greatly assisted by a parting legacy of jermin's to him we
were indebted for having all our chests sent ashore and everything
left therein they were placed in the custody of a petty chief living
near by who was instructed by the consul not to allow them to be
taken away but we might call and make our toilets whenever we
pleased

we went to see mahinee the old chief captain bob going along and
stoutly insisting upon having the chattels delivered up at last this
was done and in solemn procession the chests were borne by the
natives to the calabooza here we disposed them about quite
tastefully and made such a figure that in the eyes of old bob and
his friends the calabooza beretanee was by far the most sumptuously
furnished saloon in tahiti

indeed so long as it remained thus furnished the native courts of
the district were held there the judge mahinee and his associates
sitting upon one of the chests and the culprits and spectators
thrown at full length upon the ground both inside of the building
and under the shade of the trees without while leaning over the
stocks as from a gallery the worshipful crew of the julia looked on
and canvassed the proceedings

i should have mentioned before that previous to the vessel's
departure the men had bartered away all the clothing they could
possibly spare but now it was resolved to be more provident

the contents of the chests were of the most miscellaneous
description sewing utensils marling-spikes strips of calico bits
of rope jack-knives nearly everything in short that a seaman
could think of but of wearing apparel there was little but old
frocks remnants of jackets and legs of trousers with now and then
the foot of a stocking

these however were far from being valueless for among the poorer
tahitians everything european is highly esteemed they come from
beretanee fenooa pararee britain land of wonders and that is
enough

the chests themselves were deemed exceedingly precious especially
those with unfractured looks which would absolutely click and
enable the owner to walk off with the key scars however and
bruises were considered great blemishes one old fellow smitten
with the doctor's large mahogany chest a well-filled one by the
bye and finding infinite satisfaction in merely sitting thereon
was detected in the act of applying a healing ointment to a shocking
scratch which impaired the beauty of the lid

there is no telling the love of a tahitian for a sailor's trunk so
ornamental is it held as an article of furniture in the hut that the
women are incessantly tormenting their husbands to bestir themselves
and make them a present of one when obtained no pier-table just
placed in a drawing-room is regarded with half the delight for these
reasons then our coming into possession of our estate at this time
was an important event

the islanders are much like the rest of the world and the news of our
good fortune brought us troops of tayos or friends eager to form
an alliance after the national custom and do our slightest bidding

the really curious way in which all the polynesians are in the habit
of making bosom friends at the shortest possible notice is deserving
of remark although among a people like the tahitians vitiated as
they are by sophisticating influences this custom has in most cases
degenerated into a mere mercenary relation it nevertheless had its
origin in a fine and in some instances heroic sentiment formerly
entertained by their fathers

in the annals of the island are examples of extravagant friendships
unsurpassed by the story of damon and pythias in truth much more
wonderful for notwithstanding the devotion even of life in some
cases to which they led they were frequently entertained at first
sight for some stranger from another island

filled with love and admiration for the first whites who came among
them the polynesians could not testify the warmth of their emotions
more strongly than by instantaneously making their abrupt proffer of
friendship hence in old voyages we read of chiefs coming off from
the shore in their canoes and going through with strange antics
expressive of the desire in the same way their inferiors accosted
the seamen and thus the practice has continued in some islands down
to the present day

there is a small place not many days sail from tahiti and seldom
visited by shipping where the vessel touched to which i then
happened to belong

of course among the simple-hearted natives we had a friend all
round mine was poky a handsome youth who never could do enough for
me every morning at sunrise his canoe came alongside loaded with
fruits of all kinds upon being emptied it was secured by a line to
the bowsprit under which it lay all day long ready at any time to
carry its owner ashore on an errand

seeing him so indefatigable i told poky one day that i was a virtuoso
in shells and curiosities of all kinds that was enough away he
paddled for the head of the bay and i never saw him again for
twenty-four hours the next morning his canoe came gliding slowly
along the shore with the full-leaved bough of a tree for a sail for
the purpose of keeping the things dry he had also built a sort of
platform just behind the prow railed in with green wicker-work and
here was a heap of yellow bananas and cowree shells young cocoa-nuts
and antlers of red coral two or three pieces of carved wood a
little pocket-idol black as jet and rolls of printed tappa

we were given a holiday and upon going ashore poky of course was
my companion and guide for this no mortal could be better
qualified his native country was not large and he knew every inch
of it gallanting me about everyone was stopped and ceremoniously
introduced to poty's tayo karhowree nuee or his particular white
friend

he showed me all the lions but more than all he took me to see a
charming lioness a young damsel the daughter of a chief the
reputation of whose charms had spread to the neighbouring islands
and even brought suitors therefrom among these was tooboi the heir
of tamatory king of eaiatair one of the society isles the girl was
certainly fair to look upon many heavens were in her sunny eyes and
the outline of that arm of hers peeping forth from a capricious
tappa robe was the very curve of beauty

though there was no end to poky's attentions not a syllable did he
ever breathe of reward but sometimes he looked very knowing at last
the day came for sailing and with it also his canoe loaded down
to the gunwale with a sea stock of fruits giving him all i could
spare from my chest i went on deck to take my place at the windlass
for the anchor was weighing poky followed and heaved with me at the
same handspike

the anchor was soon up and away we went out of the bay with more than
twenty shallops towing astern at last they left us but long as i
could see him at all there was poky standing alone and motionless
in the bow of his canoe



part ii

chapter xl

we take unto ourselves friends

the arrival of the chests made my friend the doctor by far the
wealthiest man of the party so much the better for me seeing that i
had little or nothing myself though from our intimacy the natives
courted my favour almost as much as his

among others kooloo was a candidate for my friendship and being a
comely youth quite a buck in his way i accepted his overtures by
this i escaped the importunities of the rest for be it known that
though little inclined to jealousy in love matters the tahitian will
hear of no rivals in his friendship

kooloo running over his qualifications as a friend first of all
informed me that he was a mickonaree thus declaring his communion
with the church

the way this tayo of mine expressed his regard was by assuring me
over and over again that the love he bore me was nuee nuee nuee
or infinitesimally extensive all over these seas the word nuee
is significant of quantity its repetition is like placing ciphers at
the right hand of a numeral the more places you carry it out to the
greater the sum judge then of kooloo's esteem nor is the allusion
to the ciphers at all inappropriate seeing that in themselves
kooloo's profession turned out to be worthless he was alas as
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal one of those who make no music
unless the clapper be silver

in the course of a few days the sailors like the doctor and myself
were cajoled out of everything and our tayos all round began to
cool off quite sensibly so remiss did they become in their
attentions that we could no longer rely upon their bringing us the
daily supply of food which all of them had faithfully promised

as for kooloo after sponging me well he one morning played the part
of a retrograde lover informing me that his affections had undergone
a change he had fallen in love at first sight with a smart sailor
who had just stepped ashore quite flush from a lucky whaling-cruise

it was a touching interview and with it our connection dissolved
but the sadness which ensued would soon have been dissipated had not
my sensibilities been wounded by his indelicately sporting some of my
gifts very soon after this transfer of his affections hardly a day
passed that i did not meet him on the broom road airing himself in a
regatta shirt which i had given him in happier hours

he went by with such an easy saunter too looking me pleasantly in the
eye and merely exchanging the cold salute of the road yar onor
boyoee a mere sidewalk how d'ye do after several experiences like
this i began to entertain a sort of respect for kooloo as quite a
man of the world in good sooth he turned out to be one in one
week's time giving me the cut direct and lounging by without even
nodding he must have taken me for part of the landscape

before the chests were quite empty we had a grand washing in the
stream of our best raiment for the purpose of looking tidy and
visiting the european chapel in the village every sunday morning it
is open for divine service some member of the mission officiating
this was the first time we ever entered papeetee unattended by an
escort

in the chapel there were about forty people present including the
officers of several ships in harbour it was an energetic discourse
and the pulpit cushion was well pounded occupying a high seat in the
synagogue and stiff as a flagstaff was our beloved guardian
wilson i shall never forget his look of wonder when his interesting
wards filed in at the doorway and took up a seat directly facing
him

service over we waited outside in hopes of seeing more of him but
sorely annoyed at the sight of us he reconnoitred from the window
and never came forth until we had started for home



chapter xli

we levy contributions on the shipping

scarcely a week went by after the julia's sailing when with the
proverbial restlessness of sailors some of the men began to grow
weary of the calabooza beretanee and resolved to go boldly among the
vessels in the bay and offer to ship

the thing was tried but though strongly recommended by the commodore
of the beachcombers in the end they were invariably told by the
captains to whom they applied that they bore an equivocal character
ashore and would not answer so often were they repulsed that we
pretty nearly gave up all thoughts of leaving the island in this way
and growing domestic again settled down quietly at captain bob's

it was about this time that the whaling-ships which have their
regular seasons for cruising began to arrive at papeetee and of
course their crews frequently visited us this is customary all over
the pacific no sailor steps ashore but he straightway goes to the
calabooza where he is almost sure to find some poor fellow or other
in confinement for desertion or alleged mutiny or something of that
sort sympathy is proffered and if need be tobacco the latter
however is most in request as a solace to the captive it is
invaluable

having fairly carried the day against both consul and captain we were
objects of even more than ordinary interest to these philanthropists
and they always cordially applauded our conduct besides they
invariably brought along something in the way of refreshments
occasionally smuggling in a little pisco upon one occasion when
there was quite a number present a calabash was passed round and a
pecuniary collection taken up for our benefit

one day a newcomer proposed that two or three of us should pay him a
sly nocturnal visit aboard his ship engaging to send us away well
freighted with provisions this was not a bad idea nor were we at
all backward in acting upon it right after night every vessel in
the harbour was visited in rotation the foragers borrowing captain
bob's canoe for the purpose as we all took turns at this two by
two in due course it came to long ghost and myself for the sailors
invariably linked us together in such an enterprise i somewhat
distrusted the doctor for he was no sailor and very tall and a
canoe is the most ticklish of navigable things however it could
not be helped and so we went

but a word about the canoes before we go any further among the
society islands the art of building them like all native
accomplishments has greatly deteriorated and they are now the most
inelegant as well as the most insecure of any in the south seas in
cook's time according to his account there was at tahiti a royal
fleet of seventeen hundred and twenty large war canoes handsomely
carved and otherwise adorned at present those used are quite
small nothing more than logs hollowed out sharpened at one end and
then launched into the water

to obviate a certain rolling propensity the tahitians like all
polynesians attach to them what sailors call an outrigger it
consists of a pole floating alongside parallel to the canoe and
connected with it by a couple of cross sticks a yard or more in
length thus equipped the canoe cannot be overturned unless you
overcome the buoyancy of the pole or lift it entirely out of the
water

now captain bob's gig was exceedingly small so small and of such
a grotesque shape that the sailors christened it the pill box and
by this appellation it always went in fact it was a sort of
sulky meant for a solitary paddler but on an emergency capable
of floating two or three the outrigger was a mere switch alternately
rising in air and then depressed in the water

assuming the command of the expedition upon the strength of my being
a sailor i packed the long doctor with a paddle in the bow and then
shoving off leaped into the stern thus leaving him to do all the
work and reserving to myself the dignified sinecure of steering all
would have gone on well were it not that my paddler made such clumsy
work that the water spattered and showered down upon us without
ceasing continuing to ply his tool however quite energetically i
thought he would improve after a while and so let him alone but by
and bye getting wet through with this little storm we were raising
and seeing no signs of its clearing off i conjured him in mercy's
name to stop short and let me wring myself out upon this he
suddenly turned round when the canoe gave a roll the outrigger flew
overhead and the next moment came rap on the doctor's skull and we
were both in the water

fortunately we were just over a ledge of coral not half-a-fathom
under the surface depressing one end of the filled canoe and
letting go of it quickly it bounced up and discharged a great part
of its contents so that we easily baled out the remainder and again
embarked this time my comrade coiled himself away in a very small
space and enjoining upon him not to draw a single unnecessary
breath i proceeded to urge the canoe along by myself i was
astonished at his docility never speaking a word and stirring
neither hand nor foot but the secret was he was unable to swim and
in case we met with a second mishap there were no more ledges
beneath to stand upon crowning's but a shabby way of going out of
the world he exclaimed upon my rallying him and i'm not going to
be guilty of it

at last the ship was at hand and we approached with much caution
wishing to avoid being hailed by anyone from the quarter-deck
dropping silently under her bows we heard a low whistle the signal
agreed upon and presently a goodly-sized bag was lowered over to us

we cut the line and then paddled away as fast as we could and made
the best of our way home here we found the rest waiting
impatiently

the bag turned out to be well filled with sweet potatoes boiled cubes
of salt beef and pork and a famous sailors pudding what they call
duff made of flour and water and of about the consistence of an
underdone brick with these delicacies and keen appetites we went
out into the moonlight and had a nocturnal picnic



chapter xlii

motoo-otoo a tahitian casuist

the pill box was sometimes employed for other purposes than that
described in the last chapter we sometimes went a-pleasuring in it

right in the middle of papeetee harbour is a bright green island one
circular grove of waving palms and scarcely a hundred yards across
it is of coral formation and all round for many rods out the bay
is so shallow that you might wade anywhere down in these waters as
transparent as air you see coral plants of every hue and shape
imaginable antlers tufts of azure waving reeds like stalks of
grain and pale green buds and mosses in some places you look
through prickly branches down to a snow-white floor of sand
sprouting with flinty bulbs and crawling among these are strange
shapes some bristling with spikes others clad in shining coats of
mail and here and there round forms all spangled with eyes

the island is called hotoo-otoo and around hotoo-otoo have i often
paddled of a white moonlight night pausing now and then to admire
the marine gardens beneath

the place is the private property of the queen who has a residence
there a melancholy-looking range of bamboo houses neglected and
falling to decay among the trees

commanding the harbour as it does her majesty has done all she could
to make a fortress of the island the margin has been raised and
levelled and built up with a low parapet of hewn hocks of coral
behind the parapet are ranged at wide intervals a number of rusty
old cannon of all fashions and calibres they are mounted upon lame
decrepit-looking carriages ready to sink under the useless burden of
bearing them up indeed two or three have given up the ghost
altogether and the pieces they sustained lie half buried among their
bleaching bones several of the cannon are spiked probably with a
view of making them more formidable as they certainly must be to
anyone undertaking to fire them off

presented to pomaree at various times by captains of british armed
ships these poor old dogs of war thus toothless and turned out to
die formerly bayed in full pack as the battle-hounds of old england

there was something about hotoo-otoo that struck my fancy and i
registered a vow to plant my foot upon its soil notwithstanding an
old bareheaded sentry menaced me in the moonlight with an unsightly
musket as my canoe drew scarcely three inches of water i could
paddle close up to the parapet without grounding but every time i
came near the old man ran toward me pushing his piece forward but
never clapping it to his shoulder thinking he only meant to frighten
me i at last dashed the canoe right up to the wall purposing a
leap it was the rashest act of my life for never did cocoa-nut come
nearer getting demolished than mine did then with the stock of his
gun the old warder fetched a tremendous blow which i managed to
dodge and then falling back succeeded in paddling out of harm's
reach

he must have been dumb for never a word did he utter but grinning
from ear to ear and with his white cotton robe streaming in the
moonlight he looked more like the spook of the island than anything
mortal

i tried to effect my object by attacking him in the rear but he was
all front running about the place as i paddled and presenting his
confounded musket wherever i went at last i was obliged to retreat
and to this day my vow remains unfulfilled

it was a few days after my repulse from before the walls of hotoo-otoo
that i heard a curious case of casuistry argued between one of the
most clever and intelligent natives i ever saw in tahiti a man by
the name of arheetoo and our learned theban of a doctor

it was this whether it was right and lawful for anyone being a
native to keep the european sabbath in preference to the day set
apart as such by the missionaries and so considered by the islanders
in general

it must be known that the missionaries of the good ship duff who more
than half-a-century ago established the tahitian reckoning came
hither by the way of the cape of good hope and by thus sailing to
the eastward lost one precious day of their lives all round getting
about that much in advance of greenwich time for this reason
vessels coming round cape horn as they most all do nowadays find it
sunday in tahiti when according to their own view of the matter it
ought to be saturday but as it won't do to alter the log the
sailors keep their sabbath and the islanders theirs

this confusion perplexes the poor natives mightily and it is to no
purpose that you endeavour to explain so incomprehensible a
phenomenon i once saw a worthy old missionary essay to shed some
light on the subject and though i understood but a few of the words
employed i could easily get at the meaning of his illustrations
they were something like the following

here says he you see this circle describing a large one on the
ground with a stick very good now you see this spot here
marking a point in the perimeter well this is beretanee
england and i'm going to sail round to tahiti here i go then
following the circle round and there goes the sun snatching up
another stick and commissioning a bandy-legged native to travel
round with it in a contrary direction now then we are both off
and both going away from each other and here you see i have arrived
at tahiti making a sudden stop and look now where bandy legs is

but the crowd strenuously maintained that bandy legs ought to be
somewhere above them in the atmosphere for it was a traditionary
fact that the people from the duff came ashore when the sun was high
overhead and here the old gentleman being a very good sort of man
doubtless but no astronomer was obliged to give up

arheetoo the casuist alluded to though a member of the church and
extremely conscientious about what sabbath he kept was more liberal
in other matters learning that i was something of a mick-onaree
in this sense a man able to read and cunning in the use of the
pen he desired the slight favour of my forging for him a set of
papers for which he said he would be much obliged and give me a
good dinner of roast pig and indian turnip in the bargain

now arheetoo was one of those who board the shipping for their
washing and the competition being very great the proudest chiefs
not disdaining to solicit custom in person though the work is done
by their dependants he had decided upon a course suggested by a
knowing sailor a friend of his he wished to have manufactured a set
of certificates purporting to come from certain man-of-war and
merchant captains known to have visited the island recommending him
as one of the best getters up of fine linen in all polynesia

at this time arheetoo had known me but two hours and as he made the
proposition very coolly i thought it rather presumptuous and told
him so but as it was quite impossible to convey a hint and there
was a slight impropriety in the thing i did not resent the insult
but simply declined



chapter xliii

one is judged by the company he keeps

although from its novelty life at captain bob's was pleasant enough
for the time there were some few annoyances connected with it
anything but agreeable to a soul of sensibility

prejudiced against us by the malevolent representations of the consul
and others many worthy foreigners ashore regarded us as a set of
lawless vagabonds though truth to speak better behaved sailors
never stepped on the island nor any who gave less trouble to the
natives but for all this whenever we met a respectably-dressed
european ten to one he shunned us by going over to the other side of
the road this was very unpleasant at least to myself though
certes it did not prey upon the minds of the others

to give an instance

of a fine evening in tahiti but they are all fine evenings there you
may see a bevy of silk bonnets and parasols passing along the broom
road perhaps a band of pale little white urchins sickly
exotics and oftener still sedate elderly gentlemen with canes
at whose appearance the natives here and there slink into their
huts these are the missionaries their wives and children taking a
family airing sometimes by the bye they take horse and ride down
to point venus and back a distance of several miles at this place
is settled the only survivor of the first missionaries that
landed an old white-headed saint-like man by the name of wilson
the father of our friend the consul

the little parties on foot were frequently encountered and
recalling as they did so many pleasant recollections of home and
the ladies i really longed for a dress coat and beaver that i might
step up and pay my respects but situated as i was this was out of
the question on one occasion however i received a kind inquisitive
glance from a matron in gingham sweet lady i have not forgotten
her her gown was a plaid

but a glance like hers was not always bestowed

one evening passing the verandah of a missionary's dwelling the
dame his wife and a pretty blonde young girl with ringlets were
sitting there enjoying the sea-breeze then coming in all cool and
refreshing from the spray of the reef as i approached the old lady
peered hard at me and her very cap seemed to convey a prim rebuke
the blue english eyes by her side were also bent on me but oh
heavens what a glance to receive from such a beautiful creature as
for the mob cap not a fig did i care for it but to be taken for
anything but a cavalier by the ringleted one was absolutely
unendurable

i resolved on a courteous salute to show my good-breeding if nothing
more but happening to wear a sort of turban hereafter to be
particularly alluded to there was no taking it off and putting it on
again with anything like dignity at any rate then here goes a how
but another difficulty presented itself my loose frock was so
voluminous that i doubted whether any spinal curvature would be
perceptible

good evening ladies exclaimed i at last advancing winningly a
delightful air from the sea ladies

hysterics and hartshorn who would have thought it the young lady
screamed and the old one came near fainting as for myself i
retreated in double-quick time and scarcely drew breath until safely
housed in the calabooza



chapter xliv

cathedral of papoar the church of the cocoa-nuts

on sundays i always attended the principal native church on the
outskirts of the village of papeetee and not far from the calabooza
beretanee it was esteemed the best specimen of architecture in
tahiti

of late they have built their places of worship with more reference
to durability than formerly at one time there were no less than
thirty-six on the island mere barns tied together with thongs
which went to destruction in a very few years

one built many years ago in this style was a most remarkable
structure it was erected by pomaree ii who on this occasion
showed all the zeal of a royal proselyte the building was over seven
hundred feet in length and of a proportionate width the vast
ridge-pole was at intervals supported by a row of thirty-six
cylindrical trunks of the bread-fruit tree and all round the
wall-plates rested on shafts of the palm the roof steeply inclining
to within a man's height of the ground was thatched with leaves and
the sides of the edifice were open thus spacious was the royal
mission chapel of papoar

at its dedication three distinct sermons were from different
pulpits preached to an immense concourse gathered from all parts of
the island

as the chapel was built by the king's command nearly as great a
multitude was employed in its construction as swarmed over the
scaffolding of the great temple of the jews much less time however
was expended in less than three weeks from planting the first post
the last tier of palmetto-leaves drooped from the eaves and the work
was done

apportioned to the several chiefs and their dependants the labour
though immense was greatly facilitated by everyone's bringing his
post or his rafter or his pole strung with thatching ready for
instant use the materials thus prepared being afterwards secured
together by thongs there was literally neither hammer nor axe nor
any tool of iron heard in the house while it was building

but the most singular circumstance connected with this south sea
cathedral remains to be related as well for the beauty as the
advantages of such a site the islanders love to dwell near the
mountain streams and so a considerable brook after descending from
the hills and watering the valley was bridged over in three places
and swept clean through the chapel

flowing waters what an accompaniment to the songs of the sanctuary
mingling with them the praises and thanksgivings of the green
solitudes inland

but the chapel of the polynesian solomon has long since been deserted
its thousand rafters of habiscus have decayed and fallen to the
ground and now the stream murmurs over them in its bed

the present metropolitan church of tahiti is very unlike the one just
described it is of moderate dimensions boarded over and painted
white it is furnished also with blinds but no sashes indeed were
it not for the rustic thatch it would remind one of a plain chapel
at home

the woodwork was all done by foreign carpenters of whom there are
always several about papeetee

within its aspect is unique and cannot fail to interest a stranger
the rafters overhead are bound round with fine matting of variegated
dyes and all along the ridge-pole these trappings hang pendent in
alternate bunches of tassels and deep fringes of stained grass the
floor is composed of rude planks regular aisles run between ranges
of native settees bottomed with crossed braids of the cocoa-nut
fibre and furnished with backs

but the pulpit made of a dark lustrous wood and standing at one
end is by far the most striking object it is preposterously lofty
indeed a capital bird's-eye view of the congregation ought to be had
from its summit

nor does the church lack a gallery which runs round on three sides
and is supported by columns of the cocoa-nut tree

its facings are here and there daubed over with a tawdry blue and in
other places without the slightest regard to uniformity patches of
the same colour may be seen in their ardour to decorate the
sanctuary the converts must have borrowed each a brush full of
paint and zealously daubed away at the first surface that offered

as hinted the general impression is extremely curious little light
being admitted and everything being of a dark colour there is an
indefinable indian aspect of duskiness throughout a strange woody
smell also more or less pervading every considerable edifice in
polynesia is at once perceptible it suggests the idea of worm-eaten
idols packed away in some old lumber-room at hand

for the most part the congregation attending this church is composed
of the better and wealthier orders the chiefs and their retainers
in short the rank and fashion of the island this class is
infinitely superior in personal beauty and general healthfulness to
the marenhoar or common people the latter having been more
exposed to the worst and most debasing evils of foreign intercourse
on sundays the former are invariably arrayed in their finery and
thus appear to the best advantage nor are they driven to the chapel
as some of their inferiors are to other places of worship on the
contrary capable of maintaining a handsome exterior and possessing
greater intelligence they go voluntarily

in respect of the woodland colonnade supporting its galleries i
called this chapel the church of the cocoa-nuts

it was the first place for christian worship in polynesia that i had
seen and the impression upon entering during service was all the
stronger majestic-looking chiefs whose fathers had hurled the
battle-club and old men who had seen sacrifices smoking upon the
altars of oro were there and hark hanging from the bough of a
bread-fruit tree without a bell is being struck with a bar of iron by
a native lad in the same spot the blast of the war-conch had often
resounded but to the proceedings within

the place is well filled everywhere meets the eye the gay calico
draperies worn on great occasions by the higher classes and forming
a strange contrast of patterns and colours in some instances these
are so fashioned as to resemble as much as possible european
garments this is in excessively bad taste coats and pantaloons
too are here and there seen but they look awkwardly enough and take
away from the general effect

but it is the array of countenances that most strikes you each is
suffused with the peculiar animation of the polynesians when thus
collected in large numbers every robe is rustling every limb in
motion and an incessant buzzing going on throughout the assembly
the tumult is so great that the voice of the placid old missionary
who now rises is almost inaudible some degree of silence is at
length obtained through the exertions of half-a-dozen strapping
fellows in white shirts and no pantaloons running in among the
settees they are at great pains to inculcate the impropriety of
making a noise by creating a most unnecessary racket themselves this
part of the service was quite comical

there is a most interesting sabbath school connected with the church
and the scholars a vivacious mischievous set were in one part of
the gallery i was amused by a party in a corner the teacher sat at
one end of the bench with a meek little fellow by his side when the
others were disorderly this young martyr received a rap intended
probably as a sample of what the rest might expect if they didn't
amend

standing in the body of the church and leaning against a pillar was
an old man in appearance very different from others of his
countrymen he wore nothing but a coarse scant mantle of faded
tappa and from his staring bewildered manner i set him down as an
aged bumpkin from the interior unaccustomed to the strange sights
and sounds of the metropolis this old worthy was sharply reprimanded
for standing up and thus intercepting the view of those behind but
not comprehending exactly what was said to him one of the
white-liveried gentry made no ceremony of grasping him by the
shoulders and fairly crushing him down into a seat

during all this the old missionary in the pulpit as well as his
associates beneath never ventured to interfere leaving everything
to native management with south sea islanders assembled in any
numbers there is no other way of getting along



chapter xlv

missionary's sermon with some reflections

some degree of order at length restored the service was continued by
singing the choir was composed of twelve or fifteen ladies of the
mission occupying a long bench to the left of the pulpit almost the
entire congregation joined in

the first air fairly startled me it was the brave tune of old
hundred adapted to a tahitian psalm after the graceless scenes i
had recently passed through this circumstance with all its
accessories moved me forcibly

many voices around were of great sweetness and compass the singers
also seemed to enjoy themselves mightily some of them pausing now
and then and looking round as if to realize the scene more fully
in truth they sang right joyously despite the solemnity of the
tune

the tahitians have much natural talent for singing and on all
occasions are exceedingly fond of it i have often heard a stave or
two of psalmody hummed over by rakish young fellows like a snatch
from an opera

with respect to singing as in most other matters the tahitians
widely differ from the people of the sandwich islands where the
parochial flocks may be said rather to heat than sing

the psalm concluded a prayer followed very considerately the good
old missionary made it short for the congregation became fidgety and
inattentive as soon as it commenced

a chapter of the tahitian bible was now read a text selected and the
sermon began it was listened to with more attention than i had
anticipated

having been informed from various sources that the discourses of the
missionaries being calculated to engage the attention of their
simple auditors were naturally enough of a rather amusing
description to strangers in short that they had much to say about
steamboats lord mayor's coaches and the way fires are put out in
london i had taken care to provide myself with a good interpreter in
the person of an intelligent hawaiian sailor whose acquaintance i
had made

now jack said i before entering hear every word and tell me
what you can as the missionary goes on

jack's was not perhaps a critical version of the discourse and at
the time i took no notes of what he said nevertheless i will here
venture to give what i remember of it and as far as possible in
jack's phraseology so as to lose nothing by a double translation

good friends i glad to see you and i very well like to have some
talk with you to-day good friends very bad times in tahiti it make
me weep pomaree is gone the island no more yours but the wee-wees
french wicked priests here too and wicked idols in woman's
clothes and brass chains

good friends no you speak or look at them but i know you
won't they belong to a set of robbers the wicked wee-wees soon these
bad men be made to go very quick beretanee ships of thunder come and
away they go but no more bout this now i speak more by by

good friends many whale-ships here now and many bad men come in
em no good sailors living that you know very well they come here
cause so bad they no keep em home

my good little girls no run after sailors no go where they go they
harm you where they come from no good people talk to em just like
dogs here they talk to pomaree and drink arva with great poofai

good friends this very small island but very wicked and very poor
these two go together why beretanee so great because that island
good island and send mickonaree to poor kannaka in beretanee every
man rich plenty things to buy and plenty things to sell houses
bigger than pomaree's and more grand everybody too ride about in
coaches bigger than hers and wear fine tappa every day several
luxurious appliances of civilization were here enumerated and
described

good friends little to eat left at my house schooner from sydney no
bring bag of flour and kannaka no bring pig and fruit enough
mickonaree do great deal for kannaka kannaka do little for
mickonaree so good friends weave plenty of cocoa-nut baskets fill
em and bring em to-morrow

such was the substance of great part of this discourse and whatever
may be thought of it it was specially adapted to the minds of the
islanders who are susceptible to no impressions except from things
palpable or novel and striking to them a dry sermon would be dry
indeed

the tahitians can hardly ever be said to reflect they are all
impulse and so instead of expounding dogmas the missionaries give
them the large type pleasing cuts and short and easy lessons of the
primer hence anything like a permanent religious impression is
seldom or never produced

in fact there is perhaps no race upon earth less disposed by
nature to the monitions of christianity than the people of the
south seas and this assertion is made with full knowledge of what is
called the great revival at the sandwich islands about the year
 when several thousands were in the course of a few weeks
admitted into the bosom of the church but this result was brought
about by no sober moral convictions as an almost instantaneous
relapse into every kind of licentiousness soon after testified it
was the legitimate effect of a morbid feeling engendered by the
sense of severe physical wants preying upon minds excessively prone
to superstition and by fanatical preaching inflamed into the belief
that the gods of the missionaries were taking vengeance upon the
wickedness of the land

it is a noteworthy fact that those very traits in the tahitians which
induced the london missionary society to regard them as the most
promising subjects for conversion and which led moreover to the
selection of their island as the very first field for missionary
labour eventually proved the most serious obstruction an air of
softness in their manners great apparent ingenuousness and docility
at first misled but these were the mere accompaniments of an
indolence bodily and mental a constitutional voluptuousness and an
aversion to the least restraint which however fitted for the
luxurious state of nature in the tropics are the greatest possible
hindrances to the strict moralities of christianity

added to all this is a quality inherent in polynesians and more akin
to hypocrisy than anything else it leads them to assume the most
passionate interest in matters for which they really feel little or
none whatever but in which those whose power they dread or whose
favour they court they believe to be at all affected thus in their
heathen state the sandwich islanders actually knocked out their
teeth tore their hair and mangled their bodies with shells to
testify their inconsolable grief at the demise of a high chief or
member of the royal family and yet vancouver relates that on such
an occasion upon which he happened to be present those apparently
the most abandoned to their feelings immediately assumed the utmost
light-heartedness on receiving the present of a penny whistle or a
dutch looking-glass similar instances also have come under my own
observation

the following is an illustration of the trait alluded to as
occasionally manifested among the converted polynesians

at one of the society islands baiatair i believe the natives for
special reasons desired to commend themselves particularly to the
favour of the missionaries accordingly during divine service many
of them behaved in a manner otherwise unaccountable and precisely
similar to their behaviour as heathens they pretended to be wrought
up to madness by the preaching which they heard they rolled their
eyes foamed at the mouth fell down in fits and so were carried
home yet strange to relate all this was deemed the evidence of the
power of the most high and as such was heralded abroad

but to return to the church of the cocoa-nuts the blessing
pronounced the congregation disperse enlivening the broom road with
their waving mantles on either hand they disappear down the shaded
pathways which lead off from the main route conducting to hamlets
in the groves or to the little marine villas upon the beach there
is considerable hilarity and you would suppose them just from an
old-fashioned hevar or jolly heathen dance those who carry bibles
swing them carelessly from their arms by cords of sinnate

the sabbath is no ordinary day with the tahitians so far as doing any
work is concerned it is scrupulously observed the canoes are hauled
up on the beach the nets are spread to dry passing by the hen-coop
huts on the roadside you find their occupants idle as usual but
less disposed to gossip after service repose broods over the whole
island the valleys reaching inland look stiller than ever

in short it is sunday their taboo day the very word formerly
expressing the sacredness of their pagan observances now proclaiming
the sanctity of the christian sabbath



chapter xlvi

something about the kannakippers

a worthy young man formerly a friend of mine i speak of kooloo with
all possible courtesy since after our intimacy there would be an
impropriety in doing otherwise this worthy youth having some
genteel notions of retirement dwelt in a maroo boro or
bread-fruit shade a pretty nook in a wood midway between the
calabooza beretanee and the church of cocoa-nuts hence at the latter
place he was one of the most regular worshippers

kooloo was a blade standing up in the congregation in all the bravery
of a striped calico shirt with the skirts rakishly adjusted over a
pair of white sailor trousers and hair well anointed with cocoa-nut
oil he ogled the ladies with an air of supreme satisfaction nor
were his glances unreturned

but such looks as the tahitian belles cast at each other frequently
turning up their noses at the advent of a new cotton mantle recently
imported in the chest of some amorous sailor upon one occasion i
observed a group of young girls in tunics of course soiled
sheeting disdainfully pointing at a damsel in a flaming red one
oee tootai owree said they with ineffable scorn itai maitai
you are a good-for-nothing huzzy no better than you should be

now kooloo communed with the church so did all these censorious
young ladies yet after eating bread-fruit at the eucharist i knew
several of them the same night to be guilty of some sad
derelictions

puzzled by these things i resolved to find out if possible what
ideas if any they entertained of religion but as one's spiritual
concerns are rather delicate for a stranger to meddle with i went to
work as adroitly as i could

farnow an old native who had recently retired from active pursuits
having thrown up the business of being a sort of running footman to
the queen had settled down in a snug little retreat not fifty rods
from captain bob's his selecting our vicinity for his residence may
have been with some view to the advantages it afforded for
introducing his three daughters into polite circles at any rate not
averse to receiving the attentions of so devoted a gallant as the
doctor the sisters communicants be it remembered kindly extended
to him free permission to visit them sociably whenever he pleased

we dropped in one evening and found the ladies at home my long
friend engaged his favourites the two younger girls at the game of
now or hunting a stone under three piles of tappa for myself i
lounged on a mat with ideea the eldest dallying with her grass fan
and improving my knowledge of tahitian

the occasion was well adapted to my purpose and i began

ah ideea mickonaree oee the same as drawling out by the bye
miss ideea do you belong to the church

yes me mickonaree was the reply

but the assertion was at once qualified by certain reservations so
curious that i cannot forbear their relation

mickonaree ena church member here exclaimed she laying her hand
upon her mouth and a strong emphasis on the adverb in the same way
and with similar exclamations she touched her eyes and hands this
done her whole air changed in an instant and she gave me to
understand by unmistakable gestures that in certain other respects
she was not exactly a mickonaree in short ideea was

a sad good christian at the heart a very heathen in the carnal
part

the explanation terminated in a burst of laughter in which all three
sisters joined and for fear of looking silly the doctor and myself
as soon as good-breeding would permit we took leave

the hypocrisy in matters of religion so apparent in all polynesian
converts is most injudiciously nourished in tahiti by a zealous and
in many cases a coercive superintendence over their spiritual
well-being but it is only manifested with respect to the common
people their superiors being exempted

on sunday mornings when the prospect is rather small for a full house
in the minor churches a parcel of fellows are actually sent out with
ratans into the highways and byways as whippers-in of the
congregation this is a sober fact

these worthies constitute a religious police and you always know them
by the great white diapers they wear on week days they are quite as
busy as on sundays to the great terror of the inhabitants going all
over the island and spying out the wickedness thereof

moreover they are the collectors of fines levied generally in grass
mats for obstinate non-attendance upon divine worship and other
offences amenable to the ecclesiastical judicature of the
missionaries

old bob called these fellows kannakippers a corruption i fancy of
our word constable

he bore them a bitter grudge and one day drawing near home and
learning that two of them were just then making a domiciliary visit
at his house he ran behind a bush and as they came forth two green
bread-fruit from a hand unseen took them each between the shoulders
the sailors in the calabooza were witnesses to this as well as
several natives who when the intruders were out of sight applauded
captain bob's spirit in no measured terms the ladies present
vehemently joining in indeed the kannakippers have no greater
enemies than the latter and no wonder the impertinent varlets
popping into their houses at all hours are forever prying into their
peccadilloes

kooloo who at times was patriotic and pensive and mourned the evils
under which his country was groaning frequently inveighed against
the statute which thus authorized an utter stranger to interfere with
domestic arrangements he himself quite a ladies man had often
been annoyed thereby he considered the kannakippers a bore

beside their confounded inquisitiveness they add insult to injury by
making a point of dining out every day at some hut within the limits
of their jurisdiction as for the gentleman of the house his meek
endurance of these things is amazing but good easy man there is
nothing for him but to be as hospitable as possible

these gentry are indefatigable at the dead of night prowling round
the houses and in the daytime hunting amorous couples in the groves
yet in one instance the chase completely baffled them

it was thus

several weeks previous to our arrival at the island someone's husband
and another person's wife having taken a mutual fancy for each
other went out for a walk the alarm was raised and with hue and
cry they were pursued but nothing was seen of them again until the
lapse of some ninety days when we were called out from the calabooza
to behold a great mob inclosing the lovers and escorting them for
trial to the village

their appearance was most singular the girdle excepted they were
quite naked their hair was long burned yellow at the ends and
entangled with burrs and their bodies scratched and scarred in all
directions it seems that acting upon the love in a cottage
principle they had gone right into the interior and throwing up a
hut in an uninhabited valley had lived there until in an unlucky
stroll they were observed and captured

they were subsequently condemned to make one hundred fathoms of broom
road a six months work if not more

often when seated in a house conversing quietly with its inmates i
have known them betray the greatest confusion at the sudden
announcement of a kannakipper's being in sight to be reported by one
of these officials as a tootai owree in general signifying a bad
person or disbeliever in christianity is as much dreaded as the
forefinger of titus gates was levelled at an alleged papist

but the islanders take a sly revenge upon them upon entering a
dwelling the kannakippers oftentimes volunteer a pharisaical
prayer-meeting hence they go in secret by the name of
boora-artuas literally pray-to-gods



chapter xlvii

how they dress in tahiti

except where the employment of making tappa is inflicted as a
punishment the echoes of the cloth-mallet have long since died away
in the listless valleys of tahiti formerly the girls spent their
mornings like ladies at their tambour frames now they are lounged
away in almost utter indolence true most of them make their own
garments but this comprises but a stitch or two the ladies of the
mission by the bye being entitled to the credit of teaching them to
sew

the kihee whihenee or petticoat is a mere breadth of white cotton
or calico loosely enveloping the person from the waist to the feet
fastened simply by a single tuck or by twisting the upper corners
together this garment frequently becomes disordered thus affording
an opportunity of being coquettishly adjusted over the kihee they
wear a sort of gown open in front very loose and as negligent as
you please the ladies here never dress for dinner

but what shall be said of those horrid hats fancy a bunch of straw
plaited into the shape of a coal-scuttle and stuck bolt upright on
the crown with a yard or two of red ribbon flying about like
kite-strings milliners of paris what would ye say to them though
made by the natives they are said to have been first contrived and
recommended by the missionaries wives a report which i really
trust is nothing but scandal

curious to relate these things for the head are esteemed exceedingly
becoming the braiding of the straw is one of the few employments of
the higher classes all of which but minister to the silliest vanity

the young girls however wholly eschew the hats leaving those dowdy
old souls their mothers to make frights of themselves

as for the men those who aspire to european garments seem to have no
perception of the relation subsisting between the various parts of a
gentleman's costume to the wearer of a coat for instance
pantaloons are by no means indispensable and a bell-crowned hat and
a girdle are full dress the young sailor for whom kooloo deserted
me presented him with a shaggy old pea-jacket and with this buttoned
up to his chin under a tropical sun he promenaded the broom road
quite elated doctor long ghost who saw him thus ran away with the
idea that he was under medical treatment at the time in the act of
taking what the quacks call a sweat

a bachelor friend of captain bob rejoiced in the possession of a full
european suit in which he often stormed the ladies hearts having a
military leaning he ornamented the coat with a great scarlet patch
on the breast and mounted it also here and there with several
regimental buttons slyly cut from the uniform of a parcel of drunken
marines sent ashore on a holiday from a man-of-war but in spite of
the ornaments the dress was not exactly the thing from the
tightness of the cloth across the shoulders his elbows projected
from his sides like an ungainly rider's and his ponderous legs were
jammed so hard into his slim nether garments that the threads of
every seam showed and at every step you looked for a catastrophe

in general there seems to be no settled style of dressing among the
males they wear anything they can get in some cases awkwardly
modifying the fashions of their fathers so as to accord with their
own altered views of what is becoming

but ridiculous as many of them now appear in foreign habiliments the
tahitians presented a far different appearance in the original
national costume which was graceful in the extreme modest to all
but the prudish and peculiarly adapted to the climate but the short
kilts of dyed tappa the tasselled maroes and other articles
formerly worn are at the present day prohibited by law as
indecorous for what reason necklaces and garlands of flowers among
the women are also forbidden i never could learn but it is said
that they were associated in some way with a forgotten heathen
observance

many pleasant and seemingly innocent sports and pastimes are
likewise interdicted in old times there were several athletic games
practised such as wrestling foot-racing throwing the javelin and
archery in all these they greatly excelled and for some splendid
festivals were instituted among their everyday amusements were
dancing tossing the football kite-flying flute-playing and
singing traditional ballads now all punishable offences though
most of them have been so long in disuse that they are nearly
forgotten

in the same way the opio or festive harvest-home of the
breadfruit has been suppressed though as described to me by
captain bob it seemed wholly free from any immoral tendency against
tattooing of any kind there is a severe law

that this abolition of their national amusements and customs was not
willingly acquiesced in is shown in the frequent violation of many
of the statutes inhibiting them and especially in the frequency
with which their hevars or dances are practised in secret

doubtless in thus denationalizing the tahitians as it were the
missionaries were prompted by a sincere desire for good but the
effect has been lamentable supplied with no amusements in place of
those forbidden the tahitians who require more recreation than
other people have sunk into a listlessness or indulge in
sensualities a hundred times more pernicious than all the games ever
celebrated in the temple of tanee



chapter xlviii

tahiti as it is

as in the last few chapters several matters connected with the
general condition of the natives have been incidentally touched upon
it may be well not to leave so important a subject in a state
calculated to convey erroneous impressions let us bestow upon it
therefore something more than a mere cursory glance

but in the first place let it be distinctly understood that in all i
have to say upon this subject both here and elsewhere i mean no
harm to the missionaries nor their cause i merely desire to set
forth things as they actually exist

of the results which have flowed from the intercourse of foreigners
with the polynesians including the attempts to civilize and
christianize them by the missionaries tahiti on many accounts is
obviously the fairest practical example indeed it may now be
asserted that the experiment of christianizing the tahitians and
improving their social condition by the introduction of foreign
customs has been fully tried the present generation have grown up
under the auspices of their religious instructors and although it
may be urged that the labours of the latter have at times been more
or less obstructed by unprincipled foreigners still this in no wise
renders tahiti any the less a fair illustration for with obstacles
like these the missionaries in polynesia must always and everywhere
struggle

nearly sixty years have elapsed since the tahitian mission was
started and during this period it has received the unceasing
prayers and contributions of its friends abroad nor has any
enterprise of the kind called forth more devotion on the part of
those directly employed in it

it matters not that the earlier labourers in the work although
strictly conscientious were as a class ignorant and in many
cases deplorably bigoted such traits have in some degree
characterized the pioneers of all faiths and although in zeal and
disinterestedness the missionaries now on the island are perhaps
inferior to their predecessors they have nevertheless in their own
way at least laboured hard to make a christian people of their
charge

let us now glance at the most obvious changes wrought in their
condition

the entire system of idolatry has been done away together with
several barbarous practices engrafted thereon but this result is not
so much to be ascribed to the missionaries as to the civilizing
effects of a long and constant intercourse with whites of all
nations to whom for many years tahiti has been one of the principal
places of resort in the south seas at the sandwich islands the
potent institution of the taboo together with the entire paganism of
the land was utterly abolished by a voluntary act of the natives
some time previous to the arrival of the first missionaries among
them

the next most striking change in the tahitians is this from the
permanent residence among them of influential and respectable
foreigners as well as from the frequent visits of ships-of-war
recognizing the nationality of the island its inhabitants are no
longer deemed fit subjects for the atrocities practised upon mere
savages and hence secure from retaliation vessels of all kinds now
enter their harbours with perfect safety

but let us consider what results are directly ascribable to the
missionaries alone

in all cases they have striven hard to mitigate the evils resulting
from the commerce with the whites in general such attempts however
have been rather injudicious and often ineffectual in truth a
barrier almost insurmountable is presented in the dispositions of the
people themselves still in this respect the morality of the
islanders is upon the whole improved by the presence of the
missionaries

but the greatest achievement of the latter and one which in itself is
most hopeful and gratifying is that they have translated the entire
bible into the language of the island and i have myself known
several who were able to read it with facility they have also
established churches and schools for both children and adults the
latter i regret to say are now much neglected which must be
ascribed in a great measure to the disorders growing out of the
proceedings of the french

it were unnecessary here to enter diffusely into matters connected
with the internal government of the tahitian churches and schools
nor upon this head is my information copious enough to warrant me
in presenting details but we do not need them we are merely
considering general results as made apparent in the moral and
religious condition of the island at large

upon a subject like this however it would be altogether too assuming
for a single individual to decide and so in place of my own random
observations which may be found elsewhere i will here present those
of several known authors made under various circumstances at
different periods and down to a comparative late date a few very
brief extracts will enable the reader to mark for himself what
progressive improvement if any has taken place

nor must it be overlooked that of these authorities the two first in
order are largely quoted by the right reverend m kussell in a work
composed for the express purpose of imparting information on the
subject of christian missions in polynesia and he frankly
acknowledges moreover that they are such as cannot fail to have
great weight with the public

after alluding to the manifold evils entailed upon the natives by
foreigners and their singularly inert condition and after somewhat
too severely denouncing the undeniable errors of the mission
kotzebue the russian navigator says a religion like this which
forbids every innocent pleasure and cramps or annihilates every
mental power is a libel on the divine founder of christianity it is
true that the religion of the missionaries has with a great deal of
evil effected some good it has restrained the vices of theft and
incontinence but it has given birth to ignorance hypocrisy and a
hatred of all other modes of faith which was once foreign to the
open and benevolent character of the tahitian

captain beechy says that while at tahiti he saw scenes which must
have convinced the great sceptic of the thoroughly immoral condition
of the people and which would force him to conclude as turnbull
did many years previous that their intercourse with the europeans
had tended to debase rather than exalt their condition

about the year daniel wheeler an honest-hearted quaker
prompted by motives of the purest philanthropy visited in a vessel
of his own most of the missionary settlements in the south seas he
remained some time at tahiti receiving the hospitalities of the
missionaries there and from time to time exhorting the natives

after bewailing their social condition he frankly says of their
religious state certainly appearances are unpromising and however
unwilling to adopt such a conclusion there is reason to apprehend
that christian principle is a great rarity

such then is the testimony of good and unbiassed men who have been
upon the spot but how comes it to differ so widely from impressions
of others at home simply thus instead of estimating the result of
missionary labours by the number of heathens who have actually been
made to understand and practise in some measure at least the
precepts of christianity this result has been unwarrantably inferred
from the number of those who without any understanding of these
things have in any way been induced to abandon idolatry and conform
to certain outward observances

by authority of some kind or other exerted upon the natives through
their chiefs and prompted by the hope of some worldly benefit to the
latter and not by appeals to the reason have conversions in
polynesia been in most cases brought about

even in one or two instances so often held up as wonderful examples
of divine power where the natives have impulsively burned their
idols and rushed to the waters of baptism the very suddenness of
the change has but indicated its unsoundness williams the martyr of
erromanga relates an instance where the inhabitants of an island
professing christianity voluntarily assembled and solemnly revived
all their heathen customs

all the world over facts are more eloquent than words the following
will show in what estimation the missionaries themselves hold the
present state of christianity and morals among the converted
polynesians

on the island of imeeo attached to the tahitian mission is a
seminary under the charge of the rev mr simpson and wife for the
education of the children of the missionaries exclusively sent
home in many cases at a very early age to finish their education
the pupils here are taught nothing but the rudiments of knowledge
nothing more than may be learned in the native schools
notwithstanding this the two races are kept as far as possible from
associating the avowed reason being to preserve the young whites
from moral contamination the better to insure this end every effort
is made to prevent them from acquiring the native language

they went even further at the sandwich islands where a few years
ago a playground for the children of the missionaries was inclosed
with a fence many feet high the more effectually to exclude the
wicked little hawaiians

and yet strange as it may seem the depravity among the polynesians
which renders precautions like these necessary was in a measure
unknown before their intercourse with the whites the excellent
captain wilson who took the first missionaries out to tahiti
affirms that the people of that island had in many things more
refined ideas of decency than ourselves vancouver also has some
noteworthy ideas on this subject respecting the sandwich islanders

that the immorality alluded to is continually increasing is plainly
shown in the numerous severe and perpetually violated laws against
licentiousness of all kinds in both groups of islands

it is hardly to be expected that the missionaries would send home
accounts of this state of things hence captain beechy in alluding
to the polynesian researches of ellis says that the author has
impressed his readers with a far more elevated idea of the moral
condition of the tahitians and the degree of civilization to which
they have attained than they deserve or at least than the facts
which came under his observation authorized he then goes on to say
that in his intercourse with the islanders they had no fear of
him and consequently acted from the impulse of their natural
feeling so that he was the better enabled to obtain a correct
knowledge of their real disposition and habits

prom my own familiar intercourse with the natives this last
reflection still more forcibly applies to myself



chapter xlix

same subject continued

we have glanced at their moral and religious condition let us see how
it is with them socially and in other respects

it has been said that the only way to civilize a people is to form in
them habits of industry judged by this principle the tahitians are
less civilized now than formerly true their constitutional
indolence is excessive but surely if the spirit of christianity is
among them so unchristian a vice ought to be at least partially
remedied but the reverse is the fact instead of acquiring new
occupations old ones have been discontinued

as previously remarked the manufacture of tappa is nearly obsolete in
many parts of the island so too with that of the native tools and
domestic utensils very few of which are now fabricated since the
superiority of european wares has been made so evident

this however would be all very well were the natives to apply
themselves to such occupations as would enable them to supply the few
articles they need but they are far from doing so and the majority
being unable to obtain european substitutes for many things before
made by themselves the inevitable consequence is seen in the present
wretched and destitute mode of life among the common people to me so
recently from a primitive valley of the marquesas the aspect of most
of the dwellings of the poorer tahitians and their general habits
seemed anything but tidy nor could i avoid a comparison
immeasurably to the disadvantage of these partially civilized
islanders

in tahiti the people have nothing to do and idleness everywhere is
the parent of vice there is scarcely anything says the good old
quaker wheeler so striking or pitiable as their aimless
nerveless mode of spending life

attempts have repeatedly been made to rouse them from their
sluggishness but in vain several years ago the cultivation of
cotton was introduced and with their usual love of novelty they
went to work with great alacrity but the interest excited quickly
subsided and now not a pound of the article is raised

about the same time machinery for weaving was sent out from london
and a factory was started at afrehitoo in imeeo the whiz of the
wheels and spindles brought in volunteers from all quarters who
deemed it a privilege to be admitted to work yet in six months not
a boy could be hired and the machinery was knocked down and packed
off to sydney

it was the same way with the cultivation of the sugar-cane a plant
indigenous to the island peculiarly fitted to the soil and climate
and of so excellent a quality that bligh took slips of it to the west
indies all the plantations went on famously for a while the natives
swarming in the fields like ants and making a prodigious stir what
few plantations now remain are owned and worked by whites who would
rather pay a drunken sailor eighteen or twenty spanish dollars a
month than hire a sober native for his fish and tarro

it is well worthy remark here that every evidence of civilization
among the south sea islands directly pertains to foreigners though
the fact of such evidence existing at all is usually urged as a proof
of the elevated condition of the natives thus at honolulu the
capital of the sandwich islands there are fine dwelling-houses
several hotels and barber-shops ay even billiard-rooms but all
these are owned and used be it observed by whites there are
tailors and blacksmiths and carpenters also but not one of them is
a native

the fact is that the mechanical and agricultural employment of
civilized life require a kind of exertion altogether too steady and
sustained to agree with an indolent people like the polynesians
calculated for a state of nature in a climate providentially adapted
to it they are unfit for any other nay as a race they cannot
otherwise long exist

the following statement speaks for itself

about the year captain cook estimated the population of tahiti
at about two hundred thousand by a regular census taken some four
or five years ago it was found to be only nine thousand this
amazing decrease not only shows the malignancy of the evils necessary
to produce it but from the fact the inference unavoidably follows
that all the wars child murders and other depopulating causes
alleged to have existed in former times were nothing in comparison to
them

these evils of course are solely of foreign origin to say nothing
of the effects of drunkenness the occasional inroads of the
small-pox and other things which might be mentioned it is
sufficient to allude to a virulent disease which now taints the blood
of at least two-thirds of the common people of the island and in
some form or other is transmitted from father to son

their first horror and consternation at the earlier ravages of this
scourge were pitiable in the extreme the very name bestowed upon it
is a combination of all that is horrid and unmentionable to a
civilized being

distracted with their sufferings they brought forth their sick before
the missionaries when they were preaching and cried out lies
lies you tell us of salvation and behold we are dying we want no
other salvation than to live in this world where are there any saved
through your speech pomaree is dead and we are all dying with your
cursed diseases when will you give over

at present the virulence of the disorder in individual cases has
somewhat abated but the poison is only the more widely diffused

how dreadful and appalling breaks forth old wheeler the
consideration that the intercourse of distant nations should have
entailed upon these poor untutored islanders a curse unprecedented
and unheard of in the annals of history

in view of these things who can remain blind to the fact that so far
as mere temporal felicity is concerned the tahitians are far worse
off now than formerly and although their circumstances upon the
whole are bettered by the presence of the missionaries the benefits
conferred by the latter become utterly insignificant when confronted
with the vast preponderance of evil brought about by other means

their prospects are hopeless nor can the most devoted efforts now
exempt them from furnishing a marked illustration of a principle
which history has always exemplified years ago brought to a stand
where all that is corrupt in barbarism and civilization unite to the
exclusion of the virtues of either state like other uncivilized
beings brought into contact with europeans they must here remain
stationary until utterly extinct

the islanders themselves are mournfully watching their doom

several years since pomaree ii said to tyreman and bennet the
deputies of the london missionary society you have come to see me
at a very bad time your ancestors came in the time of men when
tahiti was inhabited you are come to behold just the remnant of my
people

of like import was the prediction of teearmoar the high-priest of
paree who lived over a hundred years ago i have frequently heard it
chanted in a low sad tone by aged tahitiana 

 a harree ta fow
 a toro ta farraro
 a now ta tararta

 the palm-tree shall grow
 the coral shall spread
 but man shall cease



chapter l

something happens to long ghost

we will now return to the narrative

the day before the julia sailed dr johnson paid his last call he
was not quite so bland as usual all he wanted was the men's names to
a paper certifying to their having received from him sundry
medicaments therein mentioned this voucher endorsed by captain guy
secured his pay but he would not have obtained for it the sailors
signs manual had either the doctor or myself been present at the
time

now my long friend wasted no love upon johnson but for reasons of
his own hated him heartily all the same thing in one sense for
either passion argues an object deserving thereof and so to be
hated cordially is only a left-handed compliment which shows how
foolish it is to be bitter against anyone

for my own part i merely felt a cool purely incidental and passive
contempt for johnson as a selfish mercenary apothecary and hence
i often remonstrated with long ghost when he flew out against him
and heaped upon him all manner of scurrilous epithets in his
professional brother's presence however he never acted thus
maintaining an amiable exterior to help along the jokes which were
played

i am now going to tell another story in which my long friend figures
with the physician i do not wish to bring one or the other of them
too often upon the stage but as the thing actually happened i must
relate it

a few days after johnson presented his bill as above mentioned the
doctor expressed to me his regret that although he johnson had
apparently been played off for our entertainment yet nevertheless
he had made money out of the transaction and i wonder added the
doctor if that now he cannot expect to receive any further pay he
could be induced to call again

by a curious coincidence not five minutes after making this
observation doctor long ghost himself fell down in an unaccountable
fit and without asking anybody's leave captain bob who was by at
once dispatched a boy hot foot for johnson

meanwhile we carried him into the calabooza and the natives who
assembled in numbers suggested various modes of treatment one
rather energetic practitioner was for holding the patient by the
shoulders while somebody tugged at his feet this resuscitatory
operation was called the potata but thinking our long comrade
sufficiently lengthy without additional stretching we declined
potataing him

presently the physician was spied coming along the broom road at a
great rate and so absorbed in the business of locomotion that he
heeded not the imprudence of being in a hurry in a tropical climate
he was in a profuse perspiration which must have been owing to the
warmth of his feelings notwithstanding we had supposed him a man of
no heart but his benevolent haste upon this occasion was
subsequently accounted for it merely arose from professional
curiosity to behold a case most unusual in his polynesian practice
now under certain circumstances sailors generally so frolicsome
are exceedingly particular in having everything conducted with the
strictest propriety accordingly they deputed me as his intimate
friend to sit at long ghost's head so as to be ready to officiate
as spokesman and answer all questions propounded the rest to keep
silent

what's the matter exclaimed johnson out of breath and bursting
into the calabooza how did it happen speak quick and he looked
at long ghost

i told him how the fit came on

singular he observed very good enough pulse and he let go of
it and placed his hand upon the heart

but what's all that frothing at the mouth he continued and bless
me look at the abdomen

the region thus denominated exhibited the most unaccountable
symptoms a low rumbling sound was heard and a sort of undulation
was discernible beneath the thin cotton frock

colic sir suggested a bystander

colic be hanged shouted the physician who ever heard of anybody
in a trance of the colic

during this the patient lay upon his back stark and straight
giving no signs of life except those above mentioned

i'll bleed him cried johnson at last run for a calabash one of
you

life ho here sung out navy bob as if he had just spied a sail

what under the sun's the matter with him cried the physician
starting at the appearance of the mouth which had jerked to one
side and there remained fixed

pr'aps it's st witus's hornpipe suggested bob

hold the calabash and the lancet was out in a moment

but before the deed could be done the face became natural a sigh
was heaved the eyelids quivered opened closed and long ghost
twitching all over rolled on his side and breathed audibly by
degrees he became sufficiently recovered to speak

after trying to get something coherent out of him johnson withdrew
evidently disappointed in the scientific interest of the case soon
after his departure the doctor sat up and upon being asked what
upon earth ailed him shook his head mysteriously he then deplored
the hardship of being an invalid in such a place where there was not
the slightest provision for his comfort this awakened the compassion
of our good old keeper who offered to send him to a place where he
would be better cared for long ghost acquiesced and being at once
mounted upon the shoulders of four of captain bob's men was marched
off in state like the grand lama of thibet

now i do not pretend to account for his remarkable swoon but his
reason for suffering himself to be thus removed from the calabooza
was strongly suspected to be nothing more than a desire to insure
more regularity in his dinner-hour hoping that the benevolent native
to whom he was going would set a good table

the next morning we were all envying his fortune when of a sudden
he bolted in upon us looking decidedly out of humour

hang it he cried i'm worse off than ever let me have some
breakfast we lowered our slender bag of ship-stores from a rafter
and handed him a biscuit while this was being munched he went on
and told us his story

after leaving here they trotted me back into a valley and left me
in a hut where an old woman lived by herself this must be the
nurse thought i and so i asked her to kill a pig and bake it for
i felt my appetite returning ha hal oee mattee mattee
nuee no no you too sick the devil mattee ye said i give me
something to eat but nothing could be had night coming on i had
to stay creeping into a corner i tried to sleep but it was to no
purpose the old crone must have had the quinsy or something else
and she kept up such a wheezing and choking that at last i sprang up
and groped after her but she hobbled away like a goblin and that was
the last of her as soon as the sun rose i made the best of my way
back and here i am he never left us more nor ever had a second
fit



chapter li

wilson gives us the cut departure for imeeo

about three weeks after the julia's sailing our conditions began to
be a little precarious we were without any regular supply of food
the arrival of ships was growing less frequent and what was worse
yet all the natives but good old captain bob began to tire of us
nor was this to be wondered at we were obliged to live upon their
benevolence when they had little enough for themselves besides we
were sometimes driven to acts of marauding such as kidnapping pigs
and cooking them in the groves at which their proprietors were by no
means pleased

in this state of affairs we determined to march off to the consul in
a body and as he had brought us to these straits demand an
adequate maintenance

on the point of starting captain bob's men raised the most outrageous
cries and tried to prevent us though hitherto we had strolled about
wherever we pleased this grand conjunction of our whole force upon
one particular expedition seemed to alarm them but we assured them
that we were not going to assault the village and so after a good
deal of gibberish they permitted us to leave

we went straight to the pritchard residence where the consul dwelt
this house to which i have before referred is quite commodious it
has a wide verandah glazed windows and other appurtenances of a
civilized mansion upon the lawn in front are palm-trees standing
erect here and there like sentinels the consular office a small
building by itself is inclosed by the same picket which fences in the
lawn

we found the office closed but in the verandah of the
dwelling-house was a lady performing a tonsorial operation on the
head of a prim-looking elderly european in a low white
cravat the most domestic little scene i had witnessed since leaving
home bent upon an interview with wilson the sailors now deputed the
doctor to step forward as a polite inquirer after his health

the pair stared very hard as he advanced but no ways disconcerted he
saluted them gravely and inquired for the consul

upon being informed that he had gone down to the beach we proceeded
in that direction and soon met a native who told us that apprised
of our vicinity wilson was keeping out of the way we resolved to
meet him and passing through the village he suddenly came walking
toward us having apparently made up his mind that any attempt to
elude us would be useless

what do you want of me you rascals he cried a greeting which
provoked a retort in no measured terms at this juncture the natives
began to crowd round and several foreigners strolled along caught
in the very act of speaking to such disreputable acquaintances
wilson now fidgeted and moved rapidly toward his office the men
following turning upon them incensed he bade them be off he would
have nothing more to say to us and then hurriedly addressing captain
bob in tahitian he hastened on and never stopped till the postern
of pritchard's wicket was closed behind him

our good old keeper was now highly excited bustling about in his huge
petticoats and conjuring us to return to the calabooza after a
little debate we acquiesced

this interview was decisive sensible that none of the charges brought
against us would stand yet unwilling formally to withdraw them the
consul now wished to get rid of us altogether but without being
suspected of encouraging our escape thus only could we account for
his conduct

some of the party however with a devotion to principle truly heroic
swore they would never leave him happen what might for my own part
i began to long for a change and as there seemed to be no getting
away in a ship i resolved to hit upon some other expedient but
first i cast about for a comrade and of course the long doctor was
chosen we at once laid our heads together and for the present
resolved to disclose nothing to the rest

a few days previous i had fallen in with a couple of yankee lads
twins who originally deserting their ship at tanning's island an
uninhabited spot but exceedingly prolific in fruit of all kinds
had after a long residence there roved about among the society
group they were last from imeeo the island immediately
adjoining where they had been in the employ of two foreigners who had
recently started a plantation there these persons they said had
charged them to send over from papeetee if they could two white men
for field-labourers

now all but the prospect of digging and delving suited us exactly
but the opportunity for leaving the island was not to be slighted
and so we held ourselves in readiness to return with the planters
who in a day or two were expected to visit papeetee in their boat

at the interview which ensued we were introduced to them as peter and
paul and they agreed to give peter and paul fifteen silver dollars a
month promising something more should we remain with them
permanently what they wanted was men who would stay to elude the
natives many of whom not exactly understanding our relations with
the consul might arrest us were they to see us departing the
coming midnight was appointed for that purpose

when the hour drew nigh we disclosed our intention to the rest some
upbraided us for deserting them others applauded and said that on
the first opportunity they would follow our example at last we
bade them farewell and there would now be a serene sadness in
thinking over the scene since we never saw them again had not all
been dashed by m'gee's picking the doctor's pocket of a jack-knife in
the very act of embracing him

we stole down to the beach where under the shadow of a grove the
boat was waiting after some delay we shipped the oars and pulling
outside of the reef set the sail and with a fair wind glided away
for imeeo

it was a pleasant trip the moon was up the air warm the waves
musical and all above was the tropical night one purple vault hung
round with soft trembling stars

the channel is some five leagues wide on one hand you have the three
great peaks of tahiti lording it over ranges of mountains and
valleys and on the other the equally romantic elevations of imeeo
high above which a lone peak called by our companions the
marling-pike shot up its verdant spire

the planters were quite sociable they had been sea-faring men and
this of course was a bond between us to strengthen it a flask of
wine was produced one of several which had been procured in person
from the french admiral's steward for whom the planters when on a
former visit to papeetee had done a good turn by introducing the
amorous frenchman to the ladies ashore besides this they had a
calabash filled with wild boar's meat baked yams bread-fruit and
tombez potatoes pipes and tobacco also were produced and while
regaling ourselves plenty of stories were told about the
neighbouring islands

at last we heard the roar of the imeeo reef and gliding through a
break floated over the expanse within which was smooth as a young
girl's brow and beached the boat



chapter lii

the valley of martair

we went up through groves to an open space where we heard voices and
a light was seen glimmering from out a bamboo dwelling it was the
planters retreat and in their absence several girls were keeping
house assisted by an old native who wrapped up in tappa lay in
the corner smoking

a hasty meal was prepared and after it we essayed a nap but alas a
plague little anticipated prevented unknown in tahiti the
mosquitoes here fairly eddied round us but more of them anon

we were up betimes and strolled out to view the country we were in
the valley of martair shut in on both sides by lofty hills here
and there were steep cliffs gay with flowering shrubs or hung with
pendulous vines swinging blossoms in the air of considerable width
at the sea the vale contracts as it runs inland terminating at the
distance of several miles in a range of the most grotesque
elevations which seem embattled with turrets and towers grown over
with verdure and waving with trees the valley itself is a
wilderness of woodland with links of streams flashing through and
narrow pathways fairly tunnelled through masses of foliage

all alone in this wild place was the abode of the planters the only
one back from the beach their sole neighbours the few fishermen and
their families dwelling in a small grove of cocoa-nut trees whose
roots were washed by the sea

the cleared tract which they occupied comprised some thirty acres
level as a prairie part of which was under cultivation the whole
being fenced in by a stout palisade of trunks and boughs of trees
staked firmly in the ground this was necessary as a defence against
the wild cattle and hogs overrunning the island

thus far tombez potatoes were the principal crop raised a ready sale
for them being obtained among the shipping touching at papeetee
there was a small patch of the taro or indian turnip also another
of yams and in one corner a thrifty growth of the sugar-cane just
ripening

on the side of the inclosure next the sea was the house newly built
of bamboos in the native style the furniture consisted of a couple
of sea-chests an old box a few cooking utensils and agricultural
tools together with three fowling-pieces hanging from a rafter and
two enormous hammocks swinging in opposite corners and composed of
dried bullocks hides stretched out with poles

the whole plantation was shut in by a dense forest and close by the
house a dwarfed aoa or species of banian-tree had purposely been
left twisting over the palisade in the most grotesque manner and
thus made a pleasant shade the branches of this curious tree
afforded low perches upon which the natives frequently squatted
after the fashion of their race and smoked and gossiped by the hour

we had a good breakfast of fish speared by the natives before
sunrise on the reef pudding of indian turnip fried bananas and
roasted bread-fruit

during the repast our new friends were quite sociable and
communicative it seems that like nearly all uneducated foreigners
residing in polynesia they had some time previous deserted from a
ship and having heard a good deal about the money to be made by
raising supplies for whaling-vessels they determined upon embarking
in the business strolling about with this intention they at last
came to martair and thinking the soil would suit set themselves to
work they began by finding out the owner of the particular spot
coveted and then making a tayo of him

he turned out to be tonoi the chief of the fishermen who one day
when exhilarated with brandy tore his meagre tappa from his loins
and gave me to know that he was allied by blood with pomaree herself
and that his mother came from the illustrious race of pontiffs who
in old times swayed their bamboo crosier over all the pagans of
imeeo a regal and right reverend lineage but at the time i speak
of the dusky noble was in decayed circumstances and therefore by
no means unwilling to alienate a few useless acres as an equivalent
he received from the strangers two or three rheumatic old muskets
several red woollen shirts and a promise to be provided for in his
old age he was always to find a home with the planters

desirous of living on the cosy footing of a father-in-law he frankly
offered his two daughters for wives but as such they were politely
declined the adventurers though not averse to courting being
unwilling to entangle themselves in a matrimonial alliance however
splendid in point of family

tonoi's men the fishermen of the grove were a sad set secluded in
a great measure from the ministrations of the missionaries they
gave themselves up to all manner of lazy wickedness strolling among
the trees of a morning you came upon them napping on the shady side
of a canoe hauled up among the bushes lying on a tree smoking or
more frequently still gambling with pebbles though a little
tobacco excepted what they gambled for at their outlandish games it
would be hard to tell other idle diversions they had also in which
they seemed to take great delight as for fishing it employed but a
small part of their time upon the whole they were a merry
indigent godless race

tonoi the old sinner leaning against the fallen trunk of a cocoa-nut
tree invariably squandered his mornings at pebbles a gray-headed
rook of a native regularly plucking him of every other stick of
tobacco obtained from his friends the planters toward afternoon
he strolled back to their abode where he tarried till the next
morning smoking and snoozing and at times prating about the
hapless fortunes of the house of tonoi but like any other easy-going
old dotard he seemed for the most part perfectly content with
cheerful board and lodging

on the whole the valley of martair was the quietest place imaginable
could the mosquitoes be induced to emigrate one might spend the
month of august there quite pleasantly but this was not the case
with the luckless long ghost and myself as will presently be seen



chapter liii

farming in polynesia

the planters were both whole-souled fellows but in other respects
as unlike as possible

one was a tall robust yankee hern in the backwoods of maine sallow
and with a long face the other was a short little cockney who had
first clapped his eyes on the monument

the voice of zeke the yankee had a twang like a cracked viol and
shorty as his comrade called him clipped the aspirate from every
word beginning with one the latter though not the tallest man in
the world was a good-looking young fellow of twenty-five his cheeks
were dyed with the fine saxon red burned deeper from his roving
life his blue eye opened well and a profusion of fair hair curled
over a well-shaped head

but zeke was no beauty a strong ugly man he was well adapted for
manual labour and that was all his eyes were made to see with and
not for ogling compared with the cockney he was grave and rather
taciturn but there was a deal of good old humour bottled up in him
after all for the rest he was frank good-hearted shrewd and
resolute and like shorty quite illiterate

though a curious conjunction the pair got along together famously
but as no two men were ever united in any enterprise without one
getting the upper hand of the other so in most matters zeke had his
own way shorty too had imbibed from him a spirit of invincible
industry and heaven only knows what ideas of making a fortune on
their plantation

we were much concerned at this for the prospect of their setting us
in their own persons an example of downright hard labour was
anything but agreeable but it was now too late to repent what we had
done

the first day thank fortune we did nothing having treated us as
guests thus far they no doubt thought it would be wanting in
delicacy to set us to work before the compliments of the occasion
were well over the next morning however they both looked
business-like and we were put to

wall b'ys boys said zeke knocking the ashes out of his pipe
after breakfast we must get at it shorty give peter there the
doctor the big hoe and paul the other and let's be off going to
a corner shorty brought forth three of the implements and
distributing them impartially trudged on after his partner who took
the lead with something in the shape of an axe

for a moment left alone in the house we looked at each other
quaking we were each equipped with a great clumsy piece of a tree
armed at one end with a heavy flat mass of iron

the cutlery part especially adapted to a primitive soil was an
importation from sydney the handles must have been of domestic
manufacture hoes so called we had heard of and seen but they
were harmless in comparison with the tools in our hands

what's to be done with them inquired i of peter

lift them up and down he replied or put them in motion some way
or other paul we are in a scrape but hark they are calling and
shouldering the hoes off we marched

our destination was the farther side of the plantation where the
ground cleared in part had not yet been broken up but they were
now setting about it upon halting i asked why a plough was not
used some of the young wild steers might be caught and trained for
draught

zeke replied that for such a purpose no cattle to his knowledge
had ever been used in any part of polynesia as for the soil of
martair so obstructed was it with roots crossing and recrossing
each other at all points that no kind of a plough could be used to
advantage the heavy sydney hoes were the only thing for such land

our work was now before us but previous to commencing operations i
endeavoured to engage the yankee in a little further friendly chat
concerning the nature of virgin soils in general and that of the
valley of martair in particular so masterly a stratagem made long
ghost brighten up and he stood by ready to join in but what our
friend had to say about agriculture all referred to the particular
part of his plantation upon which we stood and having communicated
enough on this head to enable us to set to work to the best
advantage he fell to himself and shorty who had been looking on
followed suit

the surface here and there presented closely amputated branches of
what had once been a dense thicket they seemed purposely left
projecting as if to furnish a handle whereby to drag out the roots
beneath after loosening the hard soil by dint of much thumping and
pounding the yankee jerked one of the roots this way and that
twisting it round and round and then tugging at it horizontally

come lend us a hand he cried at last and running up we all four
strained away in concert the tough obstacle convulsed the surface
with throes and spasms but stuck fast notwithstanding

dumn it cried zeke we'll have to get a rope run to the house
shorty and fetch one

the end of this being attached we took plenty of room and strained
away once more

give us a song shorty said the doctor who was rather sociable on
a short acquaintance where the work to be accomplished is any way
difficult this mode of enlivening toil is quite efficacious among
sailors so willing to make everything as cheerful as possible
shorty struck up were you ever in dumbarton a marvellously
inspiring but somewhat indecorous windlass chorus

at last the yankee cast a damper on his enthusiasm by exclaiming in
a pet oh dumn your singing keep quiet and pull away this we
now did in the most uninteresting silence until with a jerk that
made every elbow hum the root dragged out and most inelegantly we
all landed upon the ground the doctor quite exhausted stayed
there and deluded into believing that after so doughty a
performance we would be allowed a cessation of toil took off his
hat and fanned himself

rayther a hard customer that peter observed the yankee going up
to him but it's no use for any on em to hang back for i'm dumned
if they hain't got to come out whether or no hurrah let's get at
it agin

mercy ejaculated the doctor rising slowly and turning round
he'll be the death of us

falling to with our hoes again we worked singly or together as
occasion required until nooning time came

the period so called by the planters embraced about three hours in
the middle of the day during which it was so excessively hot in
this still brooding valley shut out from the trades and only open
toward the leeward side of the island that labour in the sun was out
of the question to use a hyperbolical phrase of shorty's it was
ot enough to melt the nose h'off a brass monkey

returning to the house shorty assisted by old tonoi cooked the
dinner and after we had all partaken thereof both the cockney and
zeke threw themselves into one of the hammocks inviting us to occupy
the other thinking it no bad idea we did so and after skirmishing
with the mosquitoes managed to fall into a doze as for the
planters more accustomed to nooning they at once presented a
nuptial back to each other and were soon snoring away at a great
rate tonoi snoozed on a mat in one corner

at last we were roused by zeke's crying out up b'ys up rise and
shine time to get at it agin

looking at the doctor i perceived very plainly that he had decided
upon something

in a languid voice he told zeke that he was not very well indeed
that he had not been himself for some time past though a little
rest no doubt would recruit him the yankee thinking from this
that our valuable services might be lost to him altogether were he
too hard upon us at the outset at once begged us both to consult our
own feelings and not exert ourselves for the present unless we felt
like it then without recognizing the fact that my comrade claimed
to be actually unwell he simply suggested that since he was so
tired he had better perhaps swing in his hammock for the rest of
the day if agreeable however i myself might accompany him upon a
little bullock-hunting excursion in the neighbouring hills in this
proposition i gladly acquiesced though peter who was a great
sportsman put on a long face the muskets and ammunition were
forthwith got from overhead and everything being then ready zeke
cried out tonoi come aramai get up we want you for pilot
shorty my lad look arter things you know and if you likes why
there's them roots in the field yonder

having thus arranged his domestic affairs to please himself though
little to shorty's satisfaction i thought he slung his powder-horn
over his shoulder and we started tonoi was at once sent on in
advance and leaving the plantation he struck into a path which led
toward the mountains

after hurrying through the thickets for some time we came out into
the sunlight in an open glade just under the shadow of the hills
here zeke pointed aloft to a beetling crag far distant where a
bullock with horns thrown back stood like a statue



chapter liv

some account of the wild cattle in polynesia

before we proceed further a word or two concerning these wild cattle
and the way they came on the island

some fifty years ago vancouver left several bullocks sheep and
goats at various places in the society group he instructed the
natives to look after the animals carefully and by no means to
slaughter any until a considerable stock had accumulated

the sheep must have died off for i never saw a solitary fleece in any
part of polynesia the pair left were an ill-assorted couple
perhaps separated in disgust and died without issue

as for the goats occasionally you come across a black misanthropic
ram nibbling the scant herbage of some height inaccessible to man
in preference to the sweet grasses of the valley below the goats are
not very numerous

the bullocks coming of a prolific ancestry are a hearty set racing
over the island of imeeo in considerable numbers though in tahiti
but few of them are seen at the former place the original pair must
have scampered off to the interior since it is now so thickly
populated by their wild progeny the herds are the private property
of queen pomaree from whom the planters had obtained permission to
shoot for their own use as many as they pleased

the natives stand in great awe of these cattle and for this reason
are excessively timid in crossing the island preferring rather to
sail round to an opposite village in their canoes

tonoi abounded in bullock stories most of which by the bye had a
spice of the marvellous the following is one of these

once upon a time he was going over the hills with a brother now no
more when a great bull came bellowing out of a wood and both took
to their heels the old chief sprang into a tree his companion
flying in an opposite direction was pursued and in the very act of
reaching up to a bough trampled underfoot the unhappy man was then
gored tossed in the air and finally run away with on the bull's
horns more dead than alive tonoi waited till all was over and then
made the best of his way home the neighbours armed with two or
three muskets at once started to recover if possible his
unfortunate brother's remains at nightfall they returned without
discovering any trace of him but the next morning tonoi himself
caught a glimpse of the bullock marching across the mountain's brow
with a long dark object borne aloft on his horns

having referred to vancouver's attempts to colonize the islands with
useful quadrupeds we may as well say something concerning his
success upon hawaii one of the largest islands in the whole
polynesian archipelago and which gives the native name to the
well-known cluster named by cook in honour of lord sandwich

hawaii is some one hundred leagues in circuit and covers an area of
over four thousand miles until within a few years past its interior
was almost unknown even to the inhabitants themselves who for
ages had been prevented from wandering thither by certain strange
superstitions pelee the terrific goddess of the volcanoes mount eoa
and mount kea was supposed to guard all the passes to the extensive
valleys lying round their base there are legends of her having chased
with streams of fire several impious adventurers near hilo a
jet-black cliff is shown with the vitreous torrent apparently
pouring over into the sea just as it cooled after one of these
supernatural eruptions

to these inland valleys and the adjoining hillsides which are
clothed in the most luxuriant vegetation vancouver's bullocks soon
wandered and unmolested for a long period multiplied in vast herds

some twelve or fifteen years ago the natives lost sight of their
superstitions and learning the value of the hides in commerce began
hunting the creatures that wore them but being very fearful and
awkward in a business so novel their success was small and it was
not until the arrival of a party of spanish hunters men regularly
trained to their calling upon the plains of california that the work
of slaughter was fairly begun

the spaniards were showy fellows tricked out in gay blankets
leggings worked with porcupine quills and jingling spurs mounted
upon trained indian mares these heroes pursued their prey up to the
very base of the burning mountains making the profoundest solitudes
ring with their shouts and flinging the lasso under the very nose of
the vixen goddess pelee hilo a village upon the coast was their
place of resort and thither flocked roving whites from all the
islands of the group as pupils of the dashing spaniards many of
these dissipated fellows quaffing too freely of the stirrup-cup and
riding headlong after the herds when they reeled in the saddle were
unhorsed and killed

this was about the year when the present king tammahamaha iii
was a lad with royal impudence laying claim to the sole property of
the cattle he was delighted with the idea of receiving one of every
two silver dollars paid down for their hides so with no thought for
the future the work of extermination went madly on in three years
time eighteen thousand bullocks were slain almost entirely upon the
single island of hawaii

the herds being thus nearly destroyed the sagacious young prince
imposed a rigorous taboo upon the few surviving cattle which was
to remain in force for ten years during this period not yet
expired all hunting is forbidden unless directly authorized by the
king

the massacre of the cattle extended to the hapless goats in one year
three thousand of their skins were sold to the merchants of honolulu
fetching a quartila or a shilling sterling apiece

after this digression it is time to run on after tonoi and the
yankee



chapter lv

a hunting ramble with zeke

at the foot of the mountain a steep path went up among rocks and
clefts mantled with verdure here and there were green gulfs down
which it made one giddy to peep at last we gained an overhanging
wooded shelf of land which crowned the heights and along this the
path well shaded ran like a gallery

in every direction the scenery was enchanting there was a low
rustling breeze and below in the vale the leaves were quivering
the sea lay blue and serene in the distance and inland the surface
swelled up ridge after ridge and peak upon peak all bathed in the
indian haze of the tropics and dreamy to look upon still valleys
leagues away reposed in the deep shadows of the mountains and here
and there waterfalls lifted up their voices in the solitude high
above all and central the marling-spike lifted its finger upon
the hillsides small groups of bullocks were seen some quietly
browsing others slowly winding into the valleys

we went on directing our course for a slope of these hills a mile or
two further where the nearest bullocks were seen

we were cautious in keeping to the windward of them their sense of
smell and hearing being like those of all wild creatures
exceedingly acute

as there was no knowing that we might not surprise some other kind of
game in the coverts through which we were passing we crept along
warily

the wild hogs of the island are uncommonly fierce and as they often
attack the natives i could not help following tonoi's example of
once in a while peeping in under the foliage frequent retrospective
glances also served to assure me that our retreat was not cut off

as we rounded a clump of bushes a noise behind them like the
crackling of dry branches broke the stillness in an instant
tonoi's hand was on a bough ready for a spring and zeke's finger
touched the trigger of his piece again the stillness was broken and
thinking it high time to get ready i brought my musket to my
shoulder

look sharp cried the yankee and dropping on one knee he brushed
the twigs aside presently off went his piece and with a wild
snort a black bristling boar his cherry red lip curled up by two
glittering tusks dashed unharmed across the path and crashed
through the opposite thicket i saluted him with a charge as he
disappeared but not the slightest notice was taken of the civility

by this time tonoi the illustrious descendant of the bishops of
imeeo was twenty feet from the ground aramai come down you old
fool cried the yankee the pesky critter's on t'other side of the
island afore this

i rayther guess he continued as we began reloading that we've
spoiled sport by firing at that ere tarnal hog them bullocks heard
the racket and are flinging their tails about now on the keen jump
quick paul and let's climb that rock yonder and see if so be
there's any in sight

but none were to be seen except at such a distance that they looked
like ants

as evening was now at hand my companion proposed our returning home
forthwith and then after a sound night's rest starting in the
morning upon a good day's hunt with the whole force of the
plantation

following another pass in descending into the valley we passed
through some nobly wooded land on the face of the mountain

one variety of tree particularly attracted my attention the dark
mossy stem over seventy feet high was perfectly branchless for many
feet above the ground when it shot out in broad boughs laden with
lustrous leaves of the deepest green and all round the lower part of
the trunk thin slab-like buttresses of bark perfectly smooth and
radiating from a common centre projected along the ground for at
least two yards from below these natural props tapered upward until
gradually blended with the trunk itself there were signs of the wild
cattle having sheltered themselves behind them zeke called this the
canoe tree as in old times it supplied the navies of the kings of
tahiti for canoe building the woods is still used being extremely
dense and impervious to worms it is very durable

emerging from the forest when half-way down the hillside we came
upon an open space covered with ferns and grass over which a few
lonely trees were casting long shadows in the setting sun here a
piece of ground some hundred feet square covered with weeds and
brambles and sounding hollow to the tread was inclosed by a ruinous
wall of stones tonoi said it was an almost forgotten burial-place of
great antiquity where no one had been interred since the islanders
had been christians sealed up in dry deep vaults many a dead
heathen was lying here

curious to prove the old man's statement i was anxious to get a peep
at the catacombs but hermetically overgrown with vegetation as they
were no aperture was visible

before gaining the level of the valley we passed by the site of a
village near a watercourse long since deserted there was nothing
but stone walls and rude dismantled foundations of houses
constructed of the same material large trees and brushwood were
growing rankly among them

i asked tonoi how long it was since anyone had lived here me
tammaree boy plenty kannaker men martair he replied now
only poor pehe kannaka fishermen left me born here

going down the valley vegetation of every kind presented a different
aspect from that of the high land

chief among the trees of the plain on this island is the ati large
and lofty with a massive trunk and broad laurel-shaped leaves the
wood is splendid in tahiti i was shown a narrow polished plank fit
to make a cabinet for a king taken from the heart of the tree it
was of a deep rich scarlet traced with yellow veins and in some
places clouded with hazel

in the same grove with the regal ah you may see the beautiful
flowering hotoo its pyramid of shining leaves diversified with
numberless small white blossoms

planted with trees as the valley is almost throughout its entire
length i was astonished to observe so very few which were useful to
the natives not one in a hundred was a cocoa-nut or bread-fruit
tree

but here tonoi again enlightened me in the sanguinary religious
hostilities which ensued upon the conversion of christianity of the
first pomaree a war-party from tahiti destroyed by girdling the
bark entire groves of these invaluable trees for some time
afterwards they stood stark and leafless in the sun sad monuments of
the fate which befell the inhabitants of the valley



chapter lvi

mosquitoes

the night following the hunting trip long ghost and myself after a
valiant defence had to fly the house on account of the mosquitoes

and here i cannot avoid relating a story rife among the natives
concerning the manner in which these insects were introduced upon the
island

some years previous a whaling captain touching at an adjoining bay
got into difficulty with its inhabitants and at last carried his
complaint before one of the native tribunals but receiving no
satisfaction and deeming himself aggrieved he resolved upon taking
signal revenge one night he towed a rotten old water-cask ashore
and left it in a neglected taro patch where the ground was warm and
moist hence the mosquitoes

i tried my best to learn the name of this man and hereby do what i
can to hand it down to posterity it was coleman nathan cole-man
the ship belonged to nantucket

when tormented by the mosquitoes i found much relief in coupling the
word coleman with another of one syllable and pronouncing them
together energetically

the doctor suggested a walk to the beach where there was a long low
shed tumbling to pieces but open lengthwise to a current of air
which he thought might keep off the mosquitoes so thither we went

the ruin partially sheltered a relic of times gone by which a few
days after we examined with much curiosity it was an old war-canoe
crumbling to dust being supported by the same rude blocks upon
which apparently it had years before been hollowed out in all
probability it had never been afloat

outside it seemed originally stained of a green colour which here
and there was now changed into a dingy purple the prow terminated
in a high blunt beak both sides were covered with carving and upon
the stern was something which long ghost maintained to be the arms
of the royal house of pomaree the device had an heraldic look
certainly being two sharks with the talons of hawks clawing a knot
left projecting from the wood

the canoe was at least forty feet long about two wide and four deep
the upper part consisting of narrow planks laced together with cords
of sinnate had in many places fallen off and lay decaying upon the
ground still there were ample accommodations left for sleeping and
in we sprang the doctor into the bow and i into the stern i soon
fell asleep but waking suddenly cramped in every joint from my
constrained posture i thought for an instant that i must have been
prematurely screwed down in my coffin

presenting my compliments to long ghost i asked how it fared with
him

bad enough he replied as he tossed about in the outlandish rubbish
lying in the bottom of our couch pah how these old mats smell

as he continued talking in this exciting strain for some time i at
last made no reply having resumed certain mathematical reveries to
induce repose but finding the multiplication table of no avail i
summoned up a grayish image of chaos in a sort of sliding fluidity
and was just falling into a nap on the strength of it when i heard a
solitary and distinct buzz the hour of my calamity was at hand one
blended hum the creature darted into the canoe like a small
swordfish and i out of it

upon getting into the open air to my surprise there was long ghost
fanning himself wildly with an old paddle he had just made a
noiseless escape from a swarm which had attacked his own end of the
canoe

it was now proposed to try the water so a small fishing canoe hauled
up near by was quickly launched and paddling a good distance off
we dropped overboard the native contrivance for an anchor a heavy
stone attached to a cable of braided bark at this part of the
island the encircling reef was close to the shore leaving the water
within smooth and extremely shallow

it was a blessed thought we knew nothing till sunrise when the
motion of our aquatic cot awakened us i looked up and beheld zeke
wading toward the shore and towing us after him by the bark cable
pointing to the reef he told us we had had a narrow escape

it was true enough the water-sprites had rolled our stone out of its
noose and we had floated away



chapter lvii

the second hunt in the mountains

fair dawned over the hills of martair the jocund morning of our
hunt

everything had been prepared for it overnight and when we arrived at
the house a good breakfast was spread by shorty and old tonoi was
bustling about like an innkeeper several of his men also were in
attendance to accompany us with calabashes of food and in case we
met with any success to officiate as bearers of burdens on our
return

apprised the evening previous of the meditated sport the doctor had
announced his willingness to take part therein

now subsequent events made us regard this expedition as a shrewd
device of the yankee's once get us off on a pleasure trip and with
what face could we afterward refuse to work beside he enjoyed all
the credit of giving us a holiday nor did he omit assuring us that
work or play our wages were all the while running on

a dilapidated old musket of tonoi's was borrowed for the doctor it
was exceedingly short and heavy with a clumsy lock which required a
strong finger to pull the trigger on trying the piece by firing at
a mark long ghost was satisfied that it could not fail of doing
execution the charge went one way and he the other

upon this he endeavoured to negotiate an exchange of muskets with
shorty but the cockney was proof against his blandishments at last
he intrusted his weapon to one of the natives to carry for him

marshalling our forces we started for the head of the valley near
which a path ascended to a range of high land said to be a favourite
resort of the cattle

shortly after gaining the heights a small herd some way off was
perceived entering a wood we hurried on and dividing our party
went in after them at four different points each white man followed
by several natives

i soon found myself in a dense covert and after looking round was
just emerging into a clear space when i heard a report and a bullet
knocked the bark from a tree near by the same instant there was a
trampling and crashing and five bullocks nearly abreast broke into
view across the opening and plunged right toward the spot where
myself and three of the islanders were standing

they were small black vicious-looking creatures with short sharp
horns red nostrils and eyes like coals of fire on they came their
dark woolly heads hanging down

by this time my island backers were roosting among the trees glancing
round for an instant to discover a retreat in case of emergency i
raised my piece when a voice cried out from the wood right
between the orns paul right between the orns down went my
barrel in range with a small white tuft on the forehead of the
headmost one and letting him have it i darted to one side as i
turned again the five bullocks shot by like a blast making the air
eddy in their wake

the yankee now burst into view and saluted them in flank whereupon
the fierce little bull with the tufted forehead flirted his long tail
over his buttocks kicked out with his hind feet and shot forward a
full length it was nothing but a graze and in an instant they
were out of sight the thicket into which they broke rocking
overhead and marking their progress

the action over the heavy artillery came up in the person of the
long doctor with the blunderbuss

where are they he cried out of breath

a mile or two h'off by this time replied the cockney lord paul
i you ought to've sent an ailstone into that little black un

while excusing my want of skill as well as i could zeke rushing
forward suddenly exclaimed creation what are you bout there
peter

peter incensed at our ill luck and ignorantly imputing it to the
cowardice of our native auxiliaries was bringing his piece to bear
upon his trembling squire the musket-carrier now descending a tree

pulling trigger the bullet went high over his head and hopping to
the ground bellowing like a calf the fellow ran away as fast as his
heels could carry him the rest followed us after this with fear
and trembling

after forming our line of march anew we went on for several hours
without catching a glimpse of the game the reports of the muskets
having been heard at a great distance at last we mounted a craggy
height to obtain a wide view of the country prom this place we
beheld three cattle quietly browsing in a green opening of a wood
below the trees shutting them in all round

a general re-examination of the muskets now took place followed by a
hasty lunch from the calabashes we then started as we descended the
mountainside the cattle were in plain sight until we entered the
forest when we lost sight of them for a moment but only to see them
again as we crept close up to the spot where they grazed

they were a bull a cow and a calf the cow was lying down in the
shade by the edge of the wood the calf sprawling out before her in
the grass licking her lips while old taurus himself stood close by
casting a paternal glance at this domestic little scene and
conjugally elevating his nose in the air

now then said zeke in a whisper let's take the poor creeturs while
they are huddled together crawl along b'ys crawl along fire
together mind and not till i say the word

we crept up to the very edge of the open ground and knelt behind a
clump of bushes resting our levelled barrels among the branches the
slight rustling was heard taurus turned round dropped his head to
the ground and sent forth a low sullen bellow then snuffed the
air the cow rose on her foreknees pitched forward alannedly and
stood upon her legs while the calf with ears pricked got right
underneath her all three were now grouped and in an instant would be
off

i take the bull cried our leader fire

the calf fell like a clod its dam uttered a cry and thrust her head
into the thicket but she turned and came moaning up to the lifeless
calf going round and round it snuffing fiercely with her bleeding
nostrils a crashing in the wood and a loud roar announced the
flying bull

soon another shot was fired and the cow fell leaving some of the
natives to look after the dead cattle the rest of us hurried on
after the bull his dreadful bellowing guiding us to the spot where
he lay wounded in the shoulder in his fright and agony he had
bounded into the wood but when we came up to him he had sunk to the
earth in a green hollow thrusting his black muzzle into a pool of his
own blood and tossing it over his hide in clots

the yankee brought his piece to a rest and the next instant the
wild brute sprang into the air and with his forelegs crouching under
him fell dead

our island friends were now in high spirits all courage and alacrity
old tonoi thought nothing of taking poor taurus himself by the horns
and peering into his glazed eyes

our ship knives were at once in request and skinning the cattle we
hung them high up by cords of bark from the boughs of a tree
withdrawing into a covert we there waited for the wild hogs which
according to zeke would soon make their appearance lured by the
smell of blood presently we heard them coming in two or three
different directions and in a moment they were tearing the offal to
pieces

as only one shot at these creatures could be relied on we intended
firing simultaneously but somehow or other the doctor's piece went
off by itself and one of the hogs dropped the others then breaking
into the thicket the rest of us sprang after them resolved to have
another shot at all hazards

the cockney darted among some bushes and a few moments after we
heard the report of his musket followed by a quick cry on running
up we saw our comrade doing battle with a young devil of a boar as
black as night whose snout had been partly torn away firing when
the game was in full career and coming directly toward him shorty
had been assailed by the enraged brute it was now crunching the
breech of the musket with which he had tried to club it shorty
holding fast to the barrel and fingering his waist for a knife
being in advance of the others i clapped my gun to the boar's head
and so put an end to the contest

evening now coming on we set to work loading our carriers the cattle
were so small that a stout native could walk off with an entire
quarter brushing through thickets and descending rocks without an
apparent effort though to tell the truth no white man present
could have done the thing with any ease as for the wild hogs none
of the islanders could be induced to carry shorty's some invincible
superstition being connected with its black colour we were
therefore obliged to leave it the other a spotted one being slung
by green thongs to a pole was marched off with by two young natives

with our bearers of burdens ahead we then commenced our return down
the valley half-way home darkness overtook us in the woods and
torches became necessary we stopped and made them of dry palm
branches and then sending two lads on in advance for the purpose of
gathering fuel to feed the flambeaux we continued our journey

it was a wild sight the torches waved aloft flashed through the
forest and where the ground admitted the islanders went along on a
brisk trot notwithstanding they bent forward under their loads
their naked backs were stained with blood and occasionally running
by each other they raised wild cries which startled the hillsides



chapter lviii

the hunting-feast and a visit to afrehitoo

two bullocks and a boar no bad trophies of our day's sport so by
torchlight we marched into the plantation the wild hog rocking from
its pole and the doctor singing an old hunting-song tally-ho the
chorus of which swelled high above the yells of the natives

we resolved to make a night of it kindling a great fire just outside
the dwelling and hanging one of the heifer's quarters from a limb of
the banian-tree everyone was at liberty to cut and broil for
himself baskets of roasted bread-fruit and plenty of taro pudding
bunches of bananas and young cocoa-nuts had also been provided by
the natives against our return

the fire burned bravely keeping off the mosquitoes and making every
man's face glow like a beaker of port the meat had the true
wild-game flavour not at all impaired by our famous appetites and a
couple of flasks of white brandy which zeke producing from his
secret store circulated freely

there was no end to my long comrade's spirits after telling his
stories and singing his songs he sprang to his feet clasped a
young damsel of the grove round the waist and waltzed over the grass
with her but there's no telling all the pranks he played that night
the natives who delight in a wag emphatically pronounced him
maitai

it was long after midnight ere we broke up but when the rest had
retired zeke with the true thrift of a yankee salted down what was
left of the meat

the next day was sunday and at my request shorty accompanied me to
afrehitoo a neighbouring bay and the seat of a mission almost
directly opposite papeetee in afrehitoo is a large church and
school-house both quite dilapidated and planted amid shrubbery on a
fine knoll stands a very tasteful cottage commanding a view across
the channel in passing i caught sight of a graceful calico skirt
disappearing from the piazza through a doorway the place was the
residence of the missionary

a trim little sail-boat was dancing out at her moorings a few yards
from the beach

straggling over the low lands in the vicinity were several native
huts untidy enough but much better every way than most of those in
tahiti

we attended service at the church where we found but a small
congregation and after what i had seen in papeetee nothing very
interesting took place but the audience had a curious fidgety look
which i knew not how to account for until we ascertained that a
sermon with the eighth commandment for a text was being preached

it seemed that there lived an englishman in the district who like
our friends the planters was cultivating tombez potatoes for the
papeetee market

in spite of all his precautions the natives were in the habit of
making nocturnal forays into his inclosure and carrying off the
potatoes one night he fired a fowling-piece charged with pepper and
salt at several shadows which he discovered stealing across his
premises they fled but it was like seasoning anything else the
knaves stole again with a greater relish than ever and the very next
night he caught a party in the act of roasting a basketful of
potatoes under his own cooking-shed at last he stated his
grievances to the missionary who for the benefit of his
congregation preached the sermon we heard

now there were no thieves in martair but then the people of the
valley were bribed to be honest it was a regular business
transaction between them and the planters in consideration of so
many potatoes to them in hand duly paid they were to abstain from
all depredations upon the plantation another security against roguery
was the permanent residence upon the premises of their chief tonoi

on our return to martair in the afternoon we found the doctor and
zeke making themselves comfortable the latter was reclining on the
ground pipe in mouth watching the doctor who sitting like a turk
before a large iron kettle was slicing potatoes and indian turnip
and now and then shattering splinters from a bone all of which by
turns were thrown into the pot he was making what he called
bullock broth

in gastronomic affairs my friend was something of an artist and by
way of improving his knowledge did nothing the rest of the day but
practise in what might be called experimental cookery broiling and
grilling and deviling slices of meat and subjecting them to all
sorts of igneous operations it was the first fresh beef that either
of us had tasted in more than a year

oh ye'll pick up arter a while peter observed zeke toward night
as long ghost was turning a great rib over the coals what d'ye
think paul

he'll get along i dare say replied i he only wants to get those
cheeks of his tanned to tell the truth i was not a little pleased
to see the doctor's reputation as an invalid fading away so fast
especially as on the strength of his being one he had promised to
have such easy times of it and very likely too at my expense



chapter lix

the murphies

dozing in our canoe the next morning about daybreak we were awakened
by zeke's hailing us loudly from the beach

upon paddling up he told us that a canoe had arrived overnight from
papeetee with an order from a ship lying there for a supply of his
potatoes and as they must be on board the vessel by noon he wanted
us to assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat

my long comrade was one of those who from always thrusting forth the
wrong foot foremost when they rise or committing some other
indiscretion of the limbs are more or less crabbed or sullen before
breakfast it was in vain therefore that the yankee deplored the
urgency of the case which obliged him to call us up thus early the
doctor only looked the more glum and said nothing in reply

at last by way of getting up a little enthusiasm for the occasion
the yankee exclaimed quite spiritedly what d'ye say then b'ys
shall we get at it

yes in the devil's name replied the doctor like a snapping
turtle and we moved on to the house notwithstanding his ungracious
answer he probably thought that after the gastronomic performance
of the day previous it would hardly do to hang back at the house
we found shorty ready with the hoes and we at once repaired to the
farther side of the inclosure where the potatoes had yet to be taken
out of the ground

the rich tawny soil seemed specially adapted to the crop the great
yellow murphies rolling out of the hills like eggs from a nest

my comrade really surprised me by the zeal with which he applied
himself to his hoe for my own part exhilarated by the cool breath
of the morning i worked away like a good fellow as for zeke and the
cockney they seemed mightily pleased at this evidence of our
willingness to exert ourselves

it was not long ere all the potatoes were turned out and then came
the worst of it they were to be lugged down to the beach a
distance of at least a quarter of a mile and there being no such
thing as a barrow or cart on the island there was nothing for it
but spinal-marrows and broad shoulders well knowing that this part of
the business would be anything but agreeable zeke did his best to
put as encouraging a face upon it as possible and giving us no time
to indulge in desponding thoughts gleefully directed our attention
to a pile of rude baskets made of stout stalks which had been
provided for the occasion so without more ado we helped ourselves
from the heap and soon we were all four staggering along under our
loads

the first trip down we arrived at the beach together zeke's
enthusiastic cries proving irresistible a trip or two more however
and my shoulders began to grate in their sockets while the doctor's
tall figure acquired an obvious stoop presently we both threw down
our baskets protesting we could stand it no longer but our
employers bent as it were upon getting the work out of us by a
silent appeal to our moral sense toiled away without pretending to
notice us it was as much as to say there men we've been boarding
and lodging ye for the last three days and yesterday ye did nothing
earthly but eat so stand by now and look at us working if ye
dare thus driven to it then we resumed our employment yet in
spite of all we could do we lagged behind zeke and shorty who
breathing hard and perspiring at every pore toiled away without
pause or cessation i almost wickedly wished that they would load
themselves down with one potato too many

gasping as i was with my own hamper i could not for the life of me
help laughing at long ghost there he went his long neck thrust
forward his arms twisted behind him to form a shelf for his basket
to rest on and his stilts of legs every once in a while giving way
under him as if his knee-joints slipped either way

there i carry no more he exclaimed all at once flinging his
potatoes into the boat where the yankee was just then stowing them
away

oh then said zeke quite briskly i guess you and paul had better
try the barrel-machine come along i'll fix ye out in no time
and so saying he waded ashore and hurried back to the house
bidding us follow

wondering what upon earth the barrel-machine could be and rather
suspicious of it we limped after on arriving at the house we found
him getting ready a sort of sedan-chair it was nothing more than an
old barrel suspended by a rope from the middle of a stout oar quite
an ingenious contrivance of the yankee's and his proposed
arrangement with regard to mine and the doctor's shoulders was
equally so

there now said he when everything was ready there's no
back-breaking about this you can stand right up under it you see
jist try it once and he politely rested the blade of the oar on my
comrade's right shoulder and the other end on mine leaving the
barrel between us

jist the thing he added standing off admiringly while we remained
in this interesting attitude

there was no help for us with broken hearts and backs we trudged back
to the field the doctor all the while saying masses

upon starting with the loaded barrel for a few paces we got along
pretty well and were constrained to think the idea not a bad one
but we did not long think so in less than five minutes we came to a
dead halt the springing and buckling of the clumsy oar being almost
unendurable

let's shift ends cried the doctor who did not relish the blade of
the stick which was cutting into the blade of his shoulder

at last by stages short and frequent we managed to shamble down the
beach where we again dumped our cargo in something of a pet

why not make the natives help asked long ghost rubbing his
shoulder

natives be dumned said the yankee twenty on em ain't worth one
white man they never was meant to work any them chaps and they
knows it too for dumned little work any on em ever does

but notwithstanding this abuse zeke was at last obliged to press a
few of the bipeds into service aramai come here he shouted to
several who reclining on a bank had hitherto been critical
observers of our proceedings and among other things had been
particularly amused by the performance with the sedan-chair

after making these fellows load their baskets together the yankee
filled his own and then drove them before him down to the beach
probably he had seen the herds of panniered mules driven in this way
by mounted indians along the great callao to lima the boat at last
loaded the yankee taking with him a couple of natives at once
hoisted sail and stood across the channel for papeetee

the next morning at breakfast old tonoi ran in and told us that the
voyagers were returning we hurried down to the beach and saw the
boat gliding toward us with a dozing islander at the helm and zeke
standing up in the bows jingling a small bag of silver the proceeds
of his cargo



chapter lx

what they thought of us in martair

several quiet days now passed away during which we just worked
sufficiently to sharpen our appetites the planters leniently
exempting us from any severe toil

their desire to retain us became more and more evident which was not
to be wondered at for beside esteeming us from the beginning a
couple of civil good-natured fellows who would soon become quite
at-home with them they were not slow in perceiving that we were far
different from the common run of rovers and that our society was
both entertaining and instructive to a couple of solitary illiterate
men like themselves

in a literary point of view indeed they soon regarded us with
emotions of envy and wonder and the doctor was considered nothing
short of a prodigy the cockney found out that he the doctor could
read a book upside down without even so much as spelling the big
words beforehand and the yankee in the twinkling of an eye
received from him the sum total of several arithmetical items stated
aloud with the view of testing the extent of his mathematical lore

then frequently in discoursing upon men and things my long comrade
employed such imposing phrases that upon one occasion they actually
remained uncovered while he talked

in short their favourable opinion of long ghost in particular rose
higher and higher every day and they began to indulge in all manner
of dreams concerning the advantages to be derived from employing so
learned a labourer among other projects revealed was that of
building a small craft of some forty tons for the purpose of trading
among the neighbouring islands with a native crew we would then
take turns cruising over the tranquil pacific touching here and
there as caprice suggested and collecting romantic articles of
commerce beach-de-mer the pearl-oyster arrow-root ambergris
sandal-wood cocoa-nut oil and edible birdnests

this south sea yachting was delightful to think of and straightway
the doctor announced his willingness to navigate the future schooner
clear of all shoals and reefs whatsoever his impudence was
audacious he enlarged upon the science of navigation treated us to
a dissertation on mercator's sailing and the azimuth compass and
went into an inexplicable explanation of the lord only knows what
plan of his for infallibly settling the longitude

whenever my comrade thus gave the reins to his fine fancy it was a
treat to listen and therefore i never interfered but with the
planters sat in mute admiration before him this apparent
self-abasement on my part must have been considered as truly
indicative of our respective merits for to my no small concern i
quickly perceived that in the estimate formed of us long ghost
began to be rated far above myself for aught i knew indeed he
might have privately thrown out a hint concerning the difference in
our respective stations aboard the julia or else the planters must
have considered him some illustrious individual for certain
inscrutable reasons going incog with this idea of him his
undisguised disinclination for work became venial and entertaining
such views of extending their business they counted more upon his
ultimate value to them as a man of science than as a mere ditcher

nor did the humorous doctor forbear to foster an opinion every way so
advantageous to himself at times for the sake of the joke assuming
airs of superiority over myself which though laughable enough were
sometimes annoying

to tell the plain truth things at last came to such a pass that i
told him up and down that i had no notion to put up with his
pretensions if he were going to play the gentleman i was going to
follow suit and then there would quickly be an explosion

at this he laughed heartily and after some mirthful chat we resolved
upon leaving the valley as soon as we could do so with a proper
regard to politeness

at supper therefore the same evening the doctor hinted at our
intention

though much surprised and vexed zeke moved not a muscle peter
said he at last very gravely and after mature deliberation would
you like to do the cooking it's easy work and you needn't do
anything else paul's heartier he can work in the field when it
suits him and before long we'll have ye at something more
agreeable won't we shorty

shorty assented

doubtless the proposed arrangement was a snug one especially the
sinecure for the doctor but i by no means relished the functions
allotted to myself they were too indefinite nothing final however
was agreed upon our intention to leave was revealed and that was
enough for the present but as we said nothing further about going
the yankee must have concluded that we might yet be induced to remain
he redoubled his endeavours to make us contented

it was during this state of affairs that one morning before
breakfast we were set to weeding in a potato-patch and the planters
being engaged at the house we were left to ourselves

now though the pulling of weeds was considered by our employers an
easy occupation for which reason they had assigned it to us and
although as a garden recreation it may be pleasant enough for those
who like it still long persisted in the business becomes
excessively irksome

nevertheless we toiled away for some time until the doctor who
from his height was obliged to stoop at a very acute angle suddenly
sprang upright and with one hand propping his spinal column
exclaimed oh that one's joints were but provided with holes to
drop a little oil through

vain as the aspiration was for this proposed improvement upon our
species i cordially responded thereto for every vertebra in my
spine was articulating in sympathy

presently the sun rose over the mountains inducing that deadly
morning languor so fatal to early exertion in a warm climate we
could stand it no longer but shouldering our hoes moved on to the
house resolved to impose no more upon the good-nature of the
planters by continuing one moment longer in an occupation so
extremely uncongenial

we freely told them so zeke was exceedingly hurt and said everything
he could think of to alter our determination but finding all
unavailing he very hospitably urged us not to be in any hurry about
leaving for we might stay with him as guests until we had time to
decide upon our future movements

we thanked him sincerely but replied that the following morning we
must turn our backs upon the hills of martair



chapter lxi

preparing for the journey

during the remainder of the day we loitered about talking over our
plans

the doctor was all eagerness to visit tamai a solitary inland
village standing upon the banks of a considerable lake of the same
name and embosomed among groves from afrehitoo you went to this
place by a lonely pathway leading through the wildest scenery in the
world much too we had heard concerning the lake itself which
abounded in such delicious fish that in former times angling parties
occasionally came over to it from papeetee

upon its banks moreover grew the finest fruit of the islands and in
their greatest perfection the ve or brazilian plum here attained
the size of an orange and the gorgeous arheea or red apple of
tahiti blushed with deeper dyes than in any of the seaward valleys

beside all this in tamai dwelt the most beautiful and unsophisticated
women in the entire society group in short the village was so
remote from the coast and had been so much less affected by recent
changes than other places that in most things tahitian life was
here seen as formerly existing in the days of young otoo the
boy-king in cook's time

after obtaining from the planters all the information which was
needed we decided upon penetrating to the village and after a
temporary sojourn there to strike the beach again and journey round
to taloo a harbour on the opposite side of the island

we at once put ourselves in travelling trim just previous to leaving
tahiti having found my wardrobe reduced to two suits frock and
trousers both much the worse for wear i had quilted them together
for mutual preservation after a fashion peculiar to sailors
engrafting a red frock upon a blue one and producing thereby a
choice variety in the way of clothing this was the extent of my
wardrobe nor was the doctor by any means better off his
improvidence had at last driven him to don the nautical garb but by
this time his frock a light cotton one had almost given out and he
had nothing to replace it shorty very generously offered him one
which was a little less ragged but the alms were proudly refused
long ghost preferring to assume the ancient costume of tahiti the
roora

this garment once worn as a festival dress is now seldom met with
but captain bob had often shown us one which he kept as an heirloom
it was a cloak or mantle of yellow tappa precisely similar to the
poncho worn by the south-american spaniards the head being slipped
through a slit in the middle the robe hangs about the person in
ample drapery tonoi obtained sufficient coarse brown tappa to make a
short mantle of this description and in five minutes the doctor was
equipped zeke eyeing his toga critically reminded its proprietor
that there were many streams to ford and precipices to scale
between martair and tamai and if he travelled in petticoats he had
better hold them up

besides other deficiencies we were utterly shoeless in the free and
easy pacific sailors seldom wear shoes mine had been tossed
overboard the day we met the trades and except in one or two tramps
ashore i had never worn any since in martair they would have been
desirable but none were to be had for the expedition we meditated
however they were indispensable zeke being the owner of a pair of
huge dilapidated boots hanging from a rafter like saddlebags the
doctor succeeded in exchanging for them a case-knife the last
valuable article in his possession for myself i made sandals from a
bullock's hide such as are worn by the indians in california they
are made in a minute the sole rudely fashioned to the foot being
confined across the instep by three straps of leather

our headgear deserves a passing word my comrade's was a brave old
panama hat made of grass almost as fine as threads of silk and so
elastic that upon rolling it up it sprang into perfect shape again
set off by the jaunty slouch of this spanish sombrero doctor long
ghost in this and his eoora looked like a mendicant grandee

nor was my own appearance in an eastern turban less distinguished the
way i came to wear it was this my hat having been knocked overboard
a few days before reaching papeetee i was obliged to mount an
abominable wad of parti-coloured worsted what sailors call a scotch
cap everyone knows the elasticity of knit wool and this caledonian
head-dress crowned my temples so effectually that the confined
atmosphere engendered was prejudicial to my curls in vain i tried to
ventilate the cap every gash made seemed to heal whole in no time
then such a continual chafing as it kept up in a hot sun

seeing my dislike to the thing kooloo my worthy friend prevailed
upon me to bestow it upon him i did so hinting that a good boiling
might restore the original brilliancy of the colours

it was then that i mounted the turban taking a new regatta frock of
the doctor's which was of a gay calico and winding it round my head
in folds i allowed the sleeves to droop behind thus forming a good
defence against the sun though in a shower it was best off the
pendent sleeves adding much to the effect the doctor called me the
bashaw with two tails

thus arrayed we were ready for tamai in whose green saloons we
counted upon creating no small sensation



chapter lxii

tamai

long before sunrise the next morning my sandals were laced on and the
doctor had vaulted into zeke's boots

expecting to see us again before we went to taloo the planters wished
us a pleasant journey and on parting very generously presented us
with a pound or two of what sailors call plug tobacco telling us
to cut it up into small change the virginian weed being the
principal circulating medium on the island

tamai we were told was not more than three or four leagues distant
so making allowances for a wild road a few hours to rest at noon
and our determination to take the journey leisurely we counted upon
reaching the shores of the lake some time in the flush of the
evening

for several hours we went on slowly through wood and ravine and over
hill and precipice seeing nothing but occasional herds of wild
cattle and often resting until we found ourselves about noon in
the very heart of the island

it was a green cool hollow among the mountains into which we at last
descended with a bound the place was gushing with a hundred springs
and shaded over with great solemn trees on whose mossy boles the
moisture stood in beads strange to say no traces of the bullocks
ever having been here were revealed nor was there a sound to be
heard nor a bird to be seen nor any breath of wind stirring the
leaves the utter solitude and silence were oppressive and after
peering about under the shades and seeing nothing but ranks of dark
motionless trunks we hurried across the hollow and ascended a steep
mountain opposite

midway up we rested where the earth had gathered about the roots of
three palms and thus formed a pleasant lounge from which we looked
down upon the hollow now one dark green tuft of woodland at our
feet here we brought forth a small calabash of poee a parting
present from tonoi after eating heartily we obtained fire by two
sticks and throwing ourselves back puffed forth our fatigue in
wreaths of smoke at last we fell asleep nor did we waken till the
sun had sunk so low that its rays darted in upon us under the
foliage

starting up we then continued our journey and as we gained the
mountain top there to our surprise lay the lake and village of
tamai we had thought it a good league off where we stood the
yellow sunset was still lingering but over the valley below long
shadows were stealing the rippling green lake reflecting the houses
and trees just as they stood along its banks several small canoes
moored here and there to posts in the water were dancing upon the
waves and one solitary fisherman was paddling over to a grassy
point in front of the houses groups of natives were seen some
thrown at full length upon the ground and others indolently leaning
against the bamboos

with whoop and halloo we ran down the hills the villagers soon
hurrying forth to see who were coming as we drew near they gathered
round all curiosity to know what brought the karhowrees into their
quiet country the doctor contriving to make them understand the
purely social object of our visit they gave us a true tahitian
welcome pointing into their dwellings and saying they were ours as
long as we chose to remain

we were struck by the appearance of these people both men and women
so much more healthful than the inhabitants of the bays as for the
young girls they were more retiring and modest more tidy in their
dress and far fresher and more beautiful than the damsels of the
coast a thousand pities thought i that they should bury their
charms in this nook of a valley

that night we abode in the house of rartoo a hospitable old chief it
was right on the shore of the lake and at supper we looked out
through a rustling screen of foliage upon the surface of the starlit
water

the next day we rambled about and found a happy little community
comparatively free from many deplorable evils to which the rest of
their countrymen are subject their time too was more occupied to
my surprise the manufacture of tappa was going on in several
buildings european calicoes were seldom seen and not many articles
of foreign origin of any description

the people of tamai were nominally christians but being so remote
from ecclesiastical jurisdiction their religion sat lightly upon
them we had been told even that many heathenish games and dances
still secretly lingered in their valley

now the prospect of seeing an old-fashioned hevar or tahitian reel
was one of the inducements which brought us here and so finding
rartoo rather liberal in his religious ideas we disclosed our
desire at first he demurred and shrugging his shoulders like a
frenchman declared it could not be brought about was a dangerous
matter to attempt and might bring all concerned into trouble but we
overcame all this convinced him that the thing could be done and a
hevar a genuine pagan fandango was arranged for that very night



chapter lxiii

a dance in the valley

there were some ill-natured people tell-tales it seemed in tamai
and hence there was a deal of mystery about getting up the dance

an hour or two before midnight rartoo entered the house and
throwing robes of tappa over us bade us follow at a distance behind
him and until out of the village hood our faces keenly alive to
the adventure we obeyed at last after taking a wide circuit we
came out upon the farthest shore of the lake it was a wide dewy
space lighted up by a full moon and carpeted with a minute species
of fern growing closely together it swept right down to the water
showing the village opposite glistening among the groves

near the trees on one side of the clear space was a ruinous pile of
stones many rods in extent upon which had formerly stood a temple of
oro at present there was nothing but a rude hut planted on the
lowermost terrace it seemed to have been used as a tappa herree
or house for making the native cloth

here we saw lights gleaming from between the bamboos and casting
long rod-like shadows upon the ground without voices also were
heard we went up and had a peep at the dancers who were getting
ready for the ballet they were some twenty in number-waited upon by
hideous old crones who might have been duennas long ghost proposed
to send the latter packing but rartoo said it would never do and so
they were permitted to remain

we tried to effect an entrance at the door which was fastened but
after a noisy discussion with one of the old witches within our
guide became fidgety and at last told us to desist or we would
spoil all he then led us off to a distance to await the performance
as the girls he said did not wish to be recognized he
furthermore made us promise to remain where we were until all was
over and the dancers had retired

we waited impatiently and at last they came forth they were
arrayed in short tunics of white tappa with garlands of flowers on
their heads following them were the duennas who remained clustering
about the house while the girls advanced a few paces and in an
instant two of them taller than their companions were standing
side by side in the middle of a ring formed by the clasped hands of
the rest this movement was made in perfect silence

presently the two girls join hands overhead and crying out ahloo
ahloo wave them to and fro upon which the ring begins to circle
slowly the dancers moving sideways with their arms a little
drooping soon they quicken their pace and at last fly round and
round bosoms heaving hair streaming flowers dropping and every
sparkling eye circling in what seemed a line of light

meanwhile the pair within are passing and repassing each other
incessantly inclining sideways so that their long hair falls far
over they glide this way and that one foot continually in the air
and their fingers thrown forth and twirling in the moonbeams

ahloo ahloo again cry the dance queens and coming together in the
middle of the ring they once more lift up the arch and stand
motionless

ahloo ahloo every link of the circle is broken and the girls
deeply breathing stand perfectly still they pant hard and fast a
moment or two and then just as the deep flush is dying away from
their faces slowly recede all round thus enlarging the ring

again the two leaders wave their hands when the rest pause and now
far apart stand in the still moonlight like a circle of fairies
presently raising a strange chant they softly sway themselves
gradually quickening the movement until at length for a few
passionate moments with throbbing bosoms and glowing cheeks they
abandon themselves to all the spirit of the dance apparently lost to
everything around but soon subsiding again into the same languid
measure as before they become motionless and then reeling forward
on all sides their eyes swimming in their heads join in one wild
chorus and sink into each other's arms

such is the lory-lory i think they call it the dance of the
backsliding girls of tamai

while it was going on we had as much as we could do to keep the
doctor from rushing forward and seizing a partner

they would give us no more hevars that night and rartoo fairly
dragged us away to a canoe hauled up on the lake shore when we
reluctantly embarked and paddling over to the village arrived there
in time for a good nap before sunrise

the next day the doctor went about trying to hunt up the overnight
dancers he thought to detect them by their late rising but never
was man more mistaken for on first sallying out the whole village
was asleep waking up in concert about an hour after but in the
course of the day he came across several whom he at once charged
with taking part in the hevar there were some prim-looking fellows
standing by visiting elders from afrehitoo perhaps and the girls
looked embarrassed but parried the charge most skilfully

though soft as doves in general the ladies of tamai are
nevertheless flavoured with a slight tincture of what we queerly
enough call the devil and they showed it on the present occasion
for when the doctor pressed one rather hard she all at once turned
round upon him and giving him a box on the ear told him to hanree
perrar be off with himself



chapter lxiv

mysterious

there was a little old man of a most hideous aspect living in tamai
who in a coarse mantle of tappa went about the village dancing
and singing and making faces he followed us about wherever we went
and when unobserved by others plucked at our garments making
frightful signs for us to go along with him somewhere and see
something

it was in vain that we tried to get rid of him kicks and cuffs even
were at last resorted to but though he howled like one possessed
he would not go away but still haunted us at last we conjured the
natives to rid us of him but they only laughed so we were forced to
endure the dispensation as well as we could

on the fourth night of our visit returning home late from paying a
few calls through the village we turned a dark corner of trees and
came full upon our goblin friend as usual chattering and motioning
with his hands the doctor venting a curse hurried forward but
from some impulse or other i stood my ground resolved to find out
what this unaccountable object wanted of us seeing me pause he crept
close up to me peered into my face and then retreated beckoning me
to follow which i did

in a few moments the village was behind us and with my guide in
advance i found myself in the shadow of the heights overlooking the
farther side of the valley here my guide paused until i came up with
him when side by side and without speaking we ascended the hill

presently we came to a wretched hut barely distinguishable in the
shade cast by the neighbouring trees pushing aside a rude sliding
door held together with thongs the goblin signed me to enter
within it looked dark as pitch so i gave him to understand that he
must strike a light and go in before me without replying he
disappeared in the darkness and after groping about i heard two
sticks rubbing together and directly saw a spark a native taper was
then lighted and i stooped and entered

it was a mere kennel foul old mats and broken cocoa-nut shells and
calabashes were strewn about the floor of earth and overhead i
caught glimpses of the stars through chinks in the roof here and
there the thatch had fallen through and hung down in wisps

i now told him to set about what he was going to do or produce
whatever he had to show without delay looking round fearfully as if
dreading a surprise he commenced turning over and over the rubbish
in one corner at last he clutched a calabash stained black and
with the neck broken off on one side of it was a large hole
something seemed to be stuffed away in the vessel and after a deal of
poking at the aperture a musty old pair of sailor trousers was drawn
forth and holding them up eagerly he inquired how many pieces of
tobacco i would give for them

without replying i hurried away the old man chasing me and shouting
as i ran until i gained the village here i dodged him and made my
way home resolved never to disclose so inglorious an adventure

to no purpose the next morning my comrade besought me to enlighten
him i preserved a mysterious silence

the occurrence served me a good turn however so long as we abode in
tamai for the old clothesman never afterwards troubled me but
forever haunted the doctor who in vain supplicated heaven to be
delivered from him



chapter lxv

the hegira or flight

i say doctor cried i a few days after my adventure with the
goblin as in the absence of our host we were one morning lounging
upon the matting in his dwelling smoking our reed pipes tamai's a
thriving place why not settle down

faith said he not a bad idea paul but do you fancy they'll let
us stay though

why certainly they would be overjoyed to have a couple of
karhowrees for townsmen

gad you're right my pleasant fellow ha ha i'll put up a
banana-leaf as a physician from london deliver lectures on
polynesian antiquities teach english in five lessons of one hour
each establish power-looms for the manufacture of tappa lay out a
public park in the middle of the village and found a festival in
honour of captain cook

but surely not without stopping to take breath observed i

the doctor's projects to be sure were of a rather visionary cast
but we seriously thought nevertheless of prolonging our stay in the
valley for an indefinite period and with this understanding we
were turning over various plans for spending our time pleasantly
when several women came running into the house and hurriedly
besought us to heree heree make our escape crying out something
about the mickonarees

thinking that we were about to be taken up under the act for the
suppression of vagrancy we flew out of the house sprang into a
canoe before the door and paddled with might and main over to the
opposite side of the lake

approaching rartoo's dwelling was a great crowd among which we
perceived several natives who from their partly european dress we
were certain did not reside in tamai

plunging into the groves we thanked our stars that we had thus
narrowly escaped being apprehended as runaway seamen and marched off
to the beach this at least was what we thought we had escaped

having fled the village we could not think of prowling about its
vicinity and then returning in doing so we might be risking our
liberty again we therefore determined upon journeying back to
martair and setting our faces thitherward we reached the planters
house about nightfall they gave us a cordial reception and a hearty
supper and we sat up talking until a late hour

we now prepared to go round to taloo a place from which we were not
far off when at tamai but wishing to see as much of the island as we
could we preferred returning to martair and then going round by way
of the beach

taloo the only frequented harbour of imeeo lies on the western side
of the island almost directly over against martair upon one shore
of the bay stands the village of partoowye a missionary station in
its vicinity is an extensive sugar plantation the best in the south
seas perhaps worked by a person from sydney

the patrimonial property of the husband of pomaree and every way a
delightful retreat partoowye was one of the occasional residences of
the court but at the time i write of it was permanently fixed there
the queen having fled thither from tahiti

partoowye they told us was by no means the place papeetee was ships
seldom touched and very few foreigners were living ashore a
solitary whaler however was reported to be lying in the harbour
wooding and watering and to be in want of men

all things considered i could not help looking upon taloo as offering
a splendid opening for us adventurers to say nothing of the
facilities presented for going to sea in the whaler or hiring
ourselves out as day labourers in the sugar plantation there were
hopes to be entertained of being promoted to some office of high
trust and emolument about the person of her majesty the queen

nor was this expectation altogether quixotic in the train of many
polynesian princes roving whites are frequently found gentleman
pensioners of state basking in the tropical sunshine of the court
and leading the pleasantest lives in the world upon islands little
visited by foreigners the first seaman that settles down is generally
domesticated in the family of the head chief or king where he
frequently discharges the functions of various offices elsewhere
filled by as many different individuals as historiographer for
instance he gives the natives some account of distant countries as
commissioner of the arts and sciences he instructs them in the use of
the jack-knife and the best way of shaping bits of iron hoop into
spear-heads and as interpreter to his majesty he facilitates
intercourse with strangers besides instructing the people generally
in the uses of the most common english phrases civil and profane
but oftener the latter

these men generally marry well often like hardy of hannamanoo into
the wood royal

sometimes they officiate as personal attendant or first lord in
waiting to the king at amboi one of the tonga islands a vagabond
welshman bends his knee as cupbearer to his cannibal majesty he
mixes his morning cup of arva and with profound genuflections
presents it in a cocoa-nut bowl richly carved upon another island
of the same group where it is customary to bestow no small pains in
dressing the hair frizzing it out by a curious process into an
enormous pope's head an old man-of-war's-man fills the post of
barber to the king and as his majesty is not very neat his mop is
exceedingly populous so that when jack is not engaged in dressing
the head intrusted to his charge he busies himself in gently
titillating it a sort of skewer being actually worn about in the
patient's hair for that special purpose

even upon the sandwich islands a low rabble of foreigners is kept
about the person of tammahammaha for the purpose of ministering to
his ease or enjoyment

billy loon a jolly little negro tricked out in a soiled blue jacket
studded all over with rusty bell buttons and garnished with shabby
gold lace is the royal drummer and pounder of the tambourine joe a
wooden-legged portuguese who lost his leg by a whale is violinist
and mordecai as he is called a villainous-looking scamp going
about with his cups and balls in a side pocket diverts the court with
his jugglery these idle rascals receive no fixed salary being
altogether dependent upon the casual bounty of their master now and
then they run up a score at the dance houses in honolulu where the
illustrious tammahammaha iii afterwards calls and settles the bill

a few years since an auctioneer to his majesty came near being added
to the retinue of state it seems that he was the first man who had
practised his vocation in the sandwich islands and delighted with
the sport of bidding upon his wares the king was one of his best
customers at last he besought the man to leave all and follow him
and he should be handsomely provided for at court but the auctioneer
refused and so the ivory hammer lost the chance of being borne
before him on a velvet cushion when the next king went to be crowned

but it was not as strolling players nor as footmen out of employ
that the doctor and myself looked forward to our approaching
introduction to the court of the queen of tahiti on the contrary as
before hinted we expected to swell the appropriations of bread-fruit
and cocoa-nuts on the civil list by filling some honourable office in
her gift

we were told that to resist the usurpation of the french the queen
was rallying about her person all the foreigners she could her
partiality for the english and americans was well known and this was
an additional ground for our anticipating a favourable reception
zeke had informed us moreover that by the queen's counsellors at
partoowye a war of aggression against the invaders of papeetee had
been seriously thought of should this prove true a surgeon's
commission for the doctor and a lieutenancy for myself were
certainly counted upon in our sanguine expectations

such then were our views and such our hopes in projecting a trip to
taloo but in our most lofty aspirations we by no means lost sight of
any minor matters which might help us to promotion the doctor had
informed me that he excelled in playing the fiddle i now suggested
that as soon as we arrived at partoowye we should endeavour to
borrow a violin for him or if this could not be done that he should
manufacture some kind of a substitute and thus equipped apply for
an audience of the queen her well-known passion for music would at
once secure his admittance and so under the most favourable
auspices bring about our introduction to her notice

and who knows said my waggish comrade throwing his head back and
performing an imaginary air by briskly drawing one arm across the
other who knows that i may not fiddle myself into her majesty's
good graces so as to became a sort of rizzio to the tahitian
princess



chapter lxvi

how we were to get to taloo

the inglorious circumstances of our somewhat premature departure from
tamai filled the sagacious doctor and myself with sundry misgivings
for the future

under zeke's protection we were secure from all impertinent
interference in our concerns on the part of the natives but as
friendless wanderers over the island we ran the risk of being
apprehended as runaways and as such sent back to tahiti the
truth is that the rewards constantly offered for the apprehension of
deserters from ships induce some of the natives to eye all strangers
suspiciously

a passport was therefore desirable but such a thing had never been
heard of in imeeo at last long ghost suggested that as the yankee
was well known and much respected all over the island we should
endeavour to obtain from him some sort of paper not only certifying
to our having been in his employ but also to our not being
highwaymen kidnappers nor yet runaway seamen even written in
english a paper like this would answer every purpose for the
unlettered natives standing in great awe of the document would not
dare to molest us until acquainted with its purport then if it
came to the worst we might repair to the nearest missionary and have
the passport explained

upon informing zeke of these matters he seemed highly flattered with
the opinion we entertained of his reputation abroad and he agreed to
oblige us the doctor at once offered to furnish him with a draught
of the paper but he refused saying he would write it himself with
a rooster's quill therefore a bit of soiled paper and a stout
heart he set to work evidently he was not accustomed to composition
for his literary throes were so violent that the doctor suggested
that some sort of a caesarian operation might be necessary

the precious paper was at last finished and a great curiosity it was
we were much diverted with his reasons for not dating it

in this here dummed eliminate he observed a feller can't keep the
run of the months nohow cause there's no seasons no summer and
winter to go by one's etarnally thinkin it's always july it's so
pesky hot

a passport provided we cast about for some means of getting to
taloo

the island of imeeo is very nearly surrounded by a regular breakwater
of coral extending within a mile or less of the shore the smooth
canal within furnishes the best means of communication with the
different settlements all of which with the exception of tamai are
right upon the water and so indolent are the imeeose that they think
nothing of going twenty or thirty miles round the island in a canoe in
order to reach a place not a quarter of that distance by land but as
hinted before the fear of the bullocks has something to do with
this

the idea of journeying in a canoe struck our fancy quite pleasantly
and we at once set about chartering one if possible but none could
we obtain for not only did we have nothing to pay for hiring one
but we could not expect to have it loaned inasmuch as the
good-natured owner would in all probability have to walk along the
beach as we paddled in order to bring back his property when we had no
further use for it

at last it was decided to commence our journey on foot trusting that
we would soon fall in with a canoe going our way in which we might
take passage

the planters said we would find no beaten path all we had to do was
to follow the beach and however inviting it might look inland on no
account must we stray from it in short the longest way round was
the nearest way to taloo at intervals there were little hamlets
along the shore besides lonely fishermen's huts here and there
where we could get plenty to eat without pay so there was no
necessity to lay in any store

intending to be off before sunrise the next morning so as to have the
benefit of the coolest part of the day we bade our kind hosts
farewell overnight and then repairing to the beach we launched our
floating pallet and slept away merrily till dawn



chapter lxvii

the journey round the beach

it was on the fourth day of the first month of the hegira or flight
from tamai we now reckoned our time thus that rising bright and
early we were up and away out of the valley of hartair before the
fishermen even were stirring

it was the earliest dawn the morning only showed itself along the
lower edge of a bank of purple clouds pierced by the misty peaks of
tahiti the tropical day seemed too languid to rise sometimes
starting fitfully it decked the clouds with faint edgings of pink
and gray which fading away left all dim again anon it threw out
thin pale rays growing lighter and lighter until at last the
golden morning sprang out of the east with a bound darting its
bright beams hither and thither higher and higher and sending them
broadcast over the face of the heavens

all balmy from the groves of tahiti came an indolent air cooled by
its transit over the waters and grateful underfoot was the damp and
slightly yielding beach from which the waves seemed just retired

the doctor was in famous spirits removing his koora he went
splashing into the sea and after swimming a few yards waded
ashore hopping skipping and jumping along the beach but very
careful to cut all his capers in the direction of our journey

say what they will of the glowing independence one feels in the
saddle give me the first morning flush of your cheery pedestrian

thus exhilarated we went on as light-hearted and care-free as we
could wish

and here i cannot refrain from lauding the very superior inducements
which most intertropical countries afford not only to mere rovers
like ourselves but to penniless people generally in these genial
regions one's wants are naturally diminished and those which remain
are easily gratified fuel house-shelter and if you please
clothing may be entirely dispensed with

how different our hard northern latitudes alas the lot of a poor
devil twenty degrees north of the tropic of cancer is indeed
pitiable

at last the beach contracted to hardly a yard's width and the dense
thicket almost dipped into the sea in place of the smooth sand too
we had sharp fragments of broken coral which made travelling
exceedingly unpleasant lord my foot roared the doctor fetching
it up for inspection with a galvanic fling of the limb a sharp
splinter had thrust itself into the flesh through a hole in his boot
my sandals were worse yet their soles taking a sort of fossil
impression of everything trod upon

turning round a bold sweep of the beach we came upon a piece of fine
open ground with a fisherman's dwelling in the distance crowning a
knoll which rolled off into the water

the hut proved to be a low rude erection very recently thrown up
for the bamboos were still green as grass and the thatching fresh
and fragrant as meadow hay it was open upon three sides so that
upon drawing near the domestic arrangements within were in plain
sight no one was stirring and nothing was to be seen but a clumsy
old chest of native workmanship a few calabashes and bundles of
tappa hanging against a post and a heap of something we knew not
what in a dark corner upon close inspection the doctor discovered
it to be a loving old couple locked in each other's arms and rolled
together in a tappa mantle

halloa darby he cried shaking the one with a beard but darby
heeded him not though joan a wrinkled old body started up in
affright and yelled aloud neither of us attempting to gag her she
presently became quiet and after staring hard and asking some
unintelligible questions she proceeded to rouse her still slumbering
mate

what ailed him we could not tell but there was no waking him equally
in vain were all his dear spouse's cuffs pinches and other
endearments he lay like a log face up snoring away like a cavalry
trumpeter

here my good woman said long ghost just let me try and taking
the patient right by his nose he so lifted him bodily into a sitting
position and held him there until his eyes opened when this event
came to pass darby looked round like one stupefied and then
springing to his feet backed away into a corner from which place we
became the objects of his earnest and respectful attention

permit me my dear darby to introduce to you my esteemed friend and
comrade paul said the doctor gallanting me up with all the
grimace and flourish imaginable upon this darby began to recover
his faculties and surprised us not a little by talking a few words
of english so far as could be understood they were expressive of
his having been aware that there were two karhowrees in the
neighbourhood that he was glad to see us and would have something
for us to eat in no time

how he came by his english was explained to us before we left some
time previous he had been a denizen of papeetee where the native
language is broidered over with the most classic sailor phrases he
seemed to be quite proud of his residence there and alluded to it in
the same significant way in which a provincial informs you that in
his time he has resided in the capital the old fellow was disposed to
be garrulous but being sharp-set we told him to get breakfast
after which we would hear his anecdotes while employed among the
calabashes the strange antiquated fondness between these old
semi-savages was really amusing i made no doubt that they were
saying to each other yes my love no my life just in the same
way that some young couples do at home

they gave us a hearty meal and while we were discussing its merits
they assured us over and over again that they expected nothing in
return for their attentions more we were at liberty to stay as long
as we pleased and as long as we did stay their house and everything
they had was no longer theirs but ours still more they themselves
were our slaves the old lady to a degree that was altogether
superfluous this now is tahitian hospitality self-immolation upon
one's own hearthstone for the benefit of the guest

the polynesians carry their hospitality to an amazing extent let a
native of waiurar the westernmost part of tahiti make his
appearance as a traveller at partoowye the most easterly village of
imeeo though a perfect stranger the inhabitants on all sides accost
him at their doorways inviting him to enter and make himself at
home but the traveller passes on examining every house attentively
until at last he pauses before one which suits him and then
exclaiming ah eda maitai this one will do i think he steps
in and makes himself perfectly at ease flinging himself upon the
mats and very probably calling for a nice young cocoa-nut and a
piece of toasted breadfruit sliced thin and done brown

curious to relate however should a stranger carrying it thus bravely
be afterwards discovered to be without a house of his own why he
may thenceforth go a-begging for his lodgings the karhowrees or
white men are exceptions to this rule thus it is precisely as in
civilized countries where those who have houses and lands are
incessantly bored to death with invitations to come and live in other
people's houses while many a poor gentleman who inks the seams of
his coat and to whom the like invitation would be really acceptable
may go and sue for it but to the credit of the ancient tahitians it
should here be observed that this blemish upon their hospitality is
only of recent origin and was wholly unknown in old times so told
me captain bob

in polynesia it is esteemed a great hit if a man succeed in marrying
into a family to which the best part of the community is related
heaven knows it is otherwise with us the reason is that when he
goes a-travelling the greater number of houses are the more
completely at his service

receiving a paternal benediction from old darby and joan we continued
our journey resolved to stop at the very next place of attraction
which offered

nor did we long stroll for it a fine walk along a beach of shells
and we came to a spot where trees here and there the land was all
meadow sloping away to the water which stirred a sedgy growth of
reeds bordering its margin close by was a little cove walled in
with coral where a fleet of canoes was dancing up and down a few
paces distant on a natural terrace overlooking the sea were several
native dwellings newly thatched and peeping into view out of the
foliage like summer-houses

as we drew near forth came a burst of voices and presently three
gay girls overflowing with life health and youth and full of
spirits and mischief one was arrayed in a flaunting robe of calico
and her long black hair was braided behind in two immense tresses
joined together at the ends and wreathed with the green tendrils of
a vine from her self-possessed and forward air i fancied she might
be some young lady from papeetee on a visit to her country relations
her companions wore mere slips of cotton cloth their hair was
dishevelled and though very pretty they betrayed the reserve and
embarrassment characteristic of the provinces

the little gipsy first mentioned ran up to me with great cordiality
and giving the tahitian salutation opened upon me such a fire of
questions that there was no understanding much less answering them
but our hearty welcome to loohooloo as she called the hamlet was
made plain enough meanwhile doctor long ghost gallantly presented
an arm to each of the other young ladies which at first they knew
not what to make of but at last taking it for some kind of joke
accepted the civility

the names of these three damsels were at once made known by
themselves and being so exceedingly romantic i cannot forbear
particularizing them upon my comrade's arms then were hanging
night and morning in the persons of farnowar or the day-born and
earnoopoo or the night-born she with the tresses was very
appropriately styled marhar-rarrar the wakeful or bright-eyed

by this time the houses were emptied of the rest of their inmates a
few old men and women and several strapping young fellows rubbing
their eyes and yawning all crowded round putting questions as to
whence we came upon being informed of our acquaintance with zeke
they were delighted and one of them recognized the boots worn by the
doctor keekee zeke maitai they cried nuee nuee hanna hanna
portarto makes plenty of potatoes

there was now a little friendly altercation as to who should have the
honour of entertaining the strangers at last a tall old gentleman
by name marharvai with a bald head and white beard took us each by
the hand and led us into his dwelling once inside marharvai
pointing about with his staff was so obsequious in assuring us that
his house was ours that long ghost suggested he might as well hand
over the deed

it was drawing near noon so after a light lunch of roasted
breadfruit a few whiffs of a pipe and some lively chatting our
host admonished the company to lie down and take the everlasting
siesta we complied and had a social nap all round



chapter lxviii

a dinner-party in imeeo

it was just in the middle of the merry mellow afternoon that they
ushered us to dinner underneath a green shelter of palm boughs open
all round and so low at the eaves that we stooped to enter

within the ground was strewn over with aromatic ferns called
nahee freshly gathered which stirred underfoot diffused the
sweetest odour on one side was a row of yellow mats inwrought with
fibres of bark stained a bright red here seated after the fashion
of the turk we looked out over a verdant bank upon the mild blue
endless pacific so far round had we skirted the island that the view
of tahiti was now intercepted

upon the ferns before us were laid several layers of broad thick
pooroo leaves lapping over one upon the other and upon these
were placed side by side newly-plucked banana leaves at least two
yards in length and very wide the stalks were withdrawn so as to
make them lie flat this green cloth was set out and garnished in the
manner following 

first a number of pooroo leaves by way of plates were ranged
along on one side and by each was a rustic nut-bowl half-filled
with sea-water and a tahitian roll or small bread-fruit roasted
brown an immense flat calabash placed in the centre was heaped up
with numberless small packages of moist steaming leaves in each was
a small fish baked in the earth and done to a turn this pyramid of
a dish was flanked on either side by an ornamental calabash one was
brimming with the golden-hued poee or pudding made from the red
plantain of the mountains the other was stacked up with cakes of the
indian turnip previously macerated in a mortar kneaded with the
milk of the cocoa-nut and then baked in the spaces between the
three dishes were piled young cocoa-nuts stripped of their husks
their eyes had been opened and enlarged so that each was a
ready-charged goblet

there was a sort of side-cloth in one corner upon which in bright
buff jackets lay the fattest of bananas avees red-ripe guavas
with the shadows of their crimson pulp flushing through a transparent
skin and almost coming and going there like blushes oranges
tinged here and there berry-brown and great jolly melons which
rolled about in very portliness such a heap all ruddy ripe and
round bursting with the good cheer of the tropical soil from which
they sprang

a land of orchards cried the doctor in a rapture and he snatched
a morsel from a sort of fruit of which gentlemen of the sanguine
temperament are remarkably fond namely the ripe cherry lips of misa
day-born who stood looking on

marharvai allotted seats to his guests and the meal began thinking
that his hospitality needed some acknowledgment i rose and pledged
him in the vegetable wine of the cocoa-nut merely repeating the
ordinary salutation yar onor boyoee sensible that some
compliment after the fashion of white men was paid him with a
smile and a courteous flourish of the hand he bade me be seated no
people however refined are more easy and graceful in their manners
than the imeeose

the doctor sitting next our host now came under his special
protection laying before his guest one of the packages of fish
marharvai opened it and commended its contents to his particular
regards but my comrade was one of those who on convivial occasions
can always take care of themselves he ate an indefinite number of
pee-hee lee lees small fish his own and next neighbour's
bread-fruit and helped himself to right and left with all the ease
of an accomplished diner-out

paul said he at last you don't seem to be getting along why
don't you try the pepper sauce and by way of example he steeped a
morsel of food into his nutful of sea-water on following suit i
found it quite piquant though rather bitter but on the whole a
capital substitute for salt the imeeose invariably use sea-water in
this way deeming it quite a treat and considering that their
country is surrounded by an ocean of catsup the luxury cannot be
deemed an expensive one

the fish were delicious the manner of cooking them in the ground
preserving all the juices and rendering them exceedingly sweet and
tender the plantain pudding was almost cloying the cakes of indian
turnip quite palatable and the roasted bread-fruit crisp as toast

during the meal a native lad walked round and round the party
carrying a long staff of bamboo this he occasionally tapped upon the
cloth before each guest when a white clotted substance dropped
forth with a savour not unlike that of a curd this proved to be
lownee an excellent relish prepared from the grated meat of ripe
cocoa-nuts moistened with cocoa-nut milk and salt water and kept
perfectly tight until a little past the saccharine stage of
fermentation

throughout the repast there was much lively chatting among the
islanders in which their conversational powers quite exceeded ours
the young ladies too showed themselves very expert in the use of
their tongues and contributed much to the gaiety which prevailed

nor did these lively nymphs suffer the meal to languish for upon the
doctor's throwing himself back with an air of much satisfaction
they sprang to their feet and pelted him with oranges and guavas
this at last put an end to the entertainment

by a hundred whimsical oddities my long friend became a great
favourite with these people and they bestowed upon him a long
comical title expressive of his lank figure and koora combined the
latter by the bye never failed to excite the remark of everybody we
encountered

the giving of nicknames is quite a passion with the people of tahiti
and imeeo no one with any peculiarity whether of person or temper
is exempt not even strangers

a pompous captain of a man-of-war visiting tahiti for the second
time discovered that among the natives he went by the dignified
title of atee poee literally poee head or pudding head nor is
the highest rank among themselves any protection the first husband
of the present queen was commonly known in the court circles as pot
belly he carried the greater part of his person before him to be
sure and so did the gentlemanly george iv but what a title for a
king consort

even pomaree itself the royal patronymic was originally a mere
nickname and literally signifies one talking through his nose the
first monarch of that name being on a war party and sleeping
overnight among the mountains awoke one morning with a cold in his
head and some wag of a courtier had no more manners than to
vulgarize him thus

how different from the volatile polynesian in this as in all other
respects is our grave and decorous north american indian while the
former bestows a name in accordance with some humorous or ignoble
trait the latter seizes upon what is deemed the most exalted or
warlike and hence among the red tribes we have the truly patrician
appellations of white eagles young oaks fiery eyes and
bended bows



chapter lxix

the cocoa-palm

while the doctor and the natives were taking a digestive nap after
dinner i strolled forth to have a peep at the country which could
produce so generous a meal

to my surprise a fine strip of land in the vicinity of the hamlet
and protected seaward by a grove of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees
was under high cultivation sweet potatoes indian turnips and yams
were growing also melons a few pine-apples and other fruits still
more pleasing was the sight of young bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees
set out with great care as if for once the improvident polynesian
had thought of his posterity but this was the only instance of native
thrift which ever came under my observation for in all my rambles
over tahiti and imeeo nothing so much struck me as the comparative
scarcity of these trees in many places where they ought to abound
entire valleys like martair of inexhaustible fertility are
abandoned to all the rankness of untamed vegetation alluvial flats
bordering the sea and watered by streams from the mountains are
over-grown with a wild scrub guava-bush introduced by foreigners
and which spreads with such fatal rapidity that the natives standing
still while it grows anticipate its covering the entire island even
tracts of clear land which with so little pains might be made to
wave with orchards lie wholly neglected

when i considered their unequalled soil and climate thus
unaccountably slighted i often turned in amazement upon the natives
about papeetee some of whom all but starve in their gardens run to
waste upon other islands which i have visited of similar fertility
and wholly unreclaimed from their first-discovered condition no
spectacle of this sort was presented

the high estimation in which many of their fruit-trees are held by the
tahitians and imeeose their beauty in the landscape their manifold
uses and the facility with which they are propagated are
considerations which render the remissness alluded to still more
unaccountable the cocoa-palm is as an example a tree by far the
most important production of nature in the tropics to the
polynesians it is emphatically the tree of life transcending even
the bread-fruit in the multifarious uses to which it is applied

its very aspect is imposing asserting its supremacy by an erect and
lofty bearing it may be said to compare with other trees as man with
inferior creatures

the blessings it confers are incalculable tear after year the
islander reposes beneath its shade both eating and drinking of its
fruit he thatches his hut with its boughs and weaves them into
baskets to carry his food he cools himself with a fan platted from
the young leaflets and shields his head from the sun by a bonnet of
the leaves sometimes he clothes himself with the cloth-like
substance which wraps round the base of the stalks whose elastic
rods strung with filberts are used as a taper the larger nuts
thinned and polished furnish him with a beautiful goblet the
smaller ones with bowls for his pipes the dry husks kindle his
fires their fibres are twisted into fishing-lines and cords for his
canoes he heals his wounds with a balsam compounded from the juice
of the nut and with the oil extracted from its meat embalms the
bodies of the dead

the noble trunk itself is far from being valueless sawn into posts
it upholds the islander's dwelling converted into charcoal it cooks
his food and supported on blocks of stone rails in his lands he
impels his canoe through the water with a paddle of the wood and
goes to battle with clubs and spears of the same hard material

in pagan tahiti a cocoa-nut branch was the symbol of regal authority
laid upon the sacrifice in the temple it made the offering sacred
and with it the priests chastised and put to flight the evil spirits
which assailed them the supreme majesty of oro the great god of
their mythology was declared in the cocoa-nut log from which his
image was rudely carved upon one of the tonga islands there stands
a living tree revered itself as a deity even upon the sandwich
islands the cocoa-palm retains all its ancient reputation the
people there having thought of adopting it as the national emblem

the cocoa-nut is planted as follows selecting a suitable place you
drop into the ground a fully ripe nut and leave it in a few days a
thin lance-like shoot forces itself through a minute hole in the
shell pierces the husk and soon unfolds three pale-green leaves in
the air while originating in the same soft white sponge which now
completely fills the nut a pair of fibrous roots pushing away the
stoppers which close two holes in an opposite direction penetrate
the shell and strike vertically into the ground a day or two more
and the shell and husk which in the last and germinating stage of
the nut are so hard that a knife will scarcely make any impression
spontaneously burst by some force within and henceforth the hardy
young plant thrives apace and needing no culture pruning or
attention of any sort rapidly advances to maturity in four or five
years it bears in twice as many more it begins to lift its head
among the groves where waxing strong it flourishes for near a
century

thus as some voyager has said the man who but drops one of these
nuts into the ground may be said to confer a greater and more certain
benefit upon himself and posterity than many a life's toil in less
genial climes

the fruitfulness of the tree is remarkable as long as it lives it
bears and without intermission two hundred nuts besides
innumerable white blossoms of others may be seen upon it at one
time and though a whole year is required to bring any one of them to
the germinating point no two perhaps are at one time in precisely
the same stage of growth

the tree delights in a maritime situation in its greatest perfection
it is perhaps found right on the seashore where its roots are
actually washed but such instances are only met with upon islands
where the swell of the sea is prevented from breaking on the beach by
an encircling reef no saline flavour is perceptible in the nut
produced in such a place although it bears in any soil whether
upland or bottom it does not flourish vigorously inland and i have
frequently observed that when met with far up the valley its tall
stem inclines seaward as if pining after a more genial region

it is a curious fact that if you deprive the cocoa-nut tree of the
verdant tuft at its head it dies at once and if allowed to stand
thus the trunk which when alive is encased in so hard a bark as
to be almost impervious to a bullet moulders away and in an
incredibly short period becomes dust this is perhaps partly owing
to the peculiar constitution of the trunk a mere cylinder of minute
hollow reeds closely packed and very hard but when exposed at
top peculiarly fitted to convey moisture and decay through the
entire stem

the finest orchard of cocoa-palms i know and the only plantation of
them i ever saw at the islands is one that stands right upon the
southern shore of papeetee bay they were set out by the first
pomaree almost half a century ago and the soil being especially
adapted to their growth the noble trees now form a magnificent
grove nearly a mile in extent no other plant scarcely a bush is
to be seen within its precincts the broom road passes through its
entire length

at noonday this grove is one of the most beautiful serene witching
places that ever was seen high overhead are ranges of green rustling
arches through which the sun's rays come down to you in sparkles
you seem to be wandering through illimitable halls of pillars
everywhere you catch glimpses of stately aisles intersecting each
other at all points a strange silence too reigns far and near the
air flushed with the mellow stillness of a sunset

but after the long morning calms the sea-breeze comes in and
creeping over the tops of these thousand trees they nod their
plumes soon the breeze freshens and you hear the branches brushing
against each other and the flexible trunks begin to sway toward
evening the whole grove is rocking to and fro and the traveller on
the broom road is startled by the frequent falling of the nuts
snapped from their brittle stems they come flying through the air
ringing like jugglers balls and often bound along the ground for
many rods



chapter lxx

life at loohooloo

finding the society at loohooloo very pleasant the young ladies in
particular being extremely sociable and moreover in love with the
famous good cheer of old marharvai we acquiesced in an invitation of
his to tarry a few days longer we might then he said join a small
canoe party which was going to a place a league or two distant so
averse to all exertion are these people that they really thought the
prospect of thus getting rid of a few miles walking would prevail
with us even if there were no other inducement

the people of the hamlet as we soon discovered formed a snug little
community of cousins of which our host seemed the head marharvai
in truth was a petty chief who owned the neighbouring lands and as
the wealthy in most cases rejoice in a numerous kindred the family
footing upon which everybody visited him was perhaps ascribable to
the fact of his being the lord of the manor like captain bob he was
in some things a gentleman of the old school a stickler for the
customs of a past and pagan age

nowhere else except in tamai did we find the manners of the natives
less vitiated by recent changes the old-fashioned tahitian dinner
they gave us on the day of our arrival was a fair sample of their
general mode of living

our time passed delightfully the doctor went his way and i mine
with a pleasant companion he was forever strolling inland
ostensibly to collect botanical specimens while i for the most
part kept near the sea sometimes taking the girls on an aquatic
excursion in a canoe

often we went fishing not dozing over stupid hooks and lines but
leaping right into the water and chasing our prey over the coral
rocks spear in hand

spearing fish is glorious sport the imeeose all round the island
catch them in no other way the smooth shallows between the reef and
the shore and at low water the reef itself being admirably
adapted to this mode of capturing them at almost any time of the
day save ever the sacred hour of noon you may see the fish-hunters
pursuing their sport with loud halloos brandishing their spears and
splashing through the water in all directions sometimes a solitary
native is seen far out upon a lonely shallow wading slowly along
with eye intent and poised spear

but the best sport of all is going out upon the great reef itself by
torch-light the natives follow this recreation with as much spirit
as a gentleman of england does the chase and take full as much
delight in it

the torch is nothing more than a bunch of dry reeds bound firmly
together the spear a long light pole with an iron head on one
side barbed

i shall never forget the night that old marharvai and the rest of us
paddling off to the reef leaped at midnight upon the coral ledges
with waving torches and spears we were more than a mile from the
land the sullen ocean thundering upon the outside of the rocks
dashed the spray in our faces almost extinguishing the flambeaux
and far as the eye could reach the darkness of sky and water was
streaked with a long misty line of foam marking the course of the
coral barrier the wild fishermen flourishing their weapons and
yelling like so many demons to scare their prey sprang from ledge to
ledge and sometimes darted their spears in the very midst of the
breakers

but fish-spearing was not the only sport we had at loohooloo right on
the beach was a mighty old cocoa-nut tree the roots of which had
been underwashed by the waves so that the trunk inclined far over its
base from the tuft of the tree a stout cord of bark depended the
end of which swept the water several yards from the shore this was a
tahitian swing a native lad seizes hold of the cord and after
swinging to and fro quite leisurely all at once sends himself fifty
or sixty feet from the water rushing through the air like a rocket
i doubt whether any of our rope-dancers would attempt the feat for
my own part i had neither head nor heart for it so after sending a
lad aloft with an additional cord by way of security i constructed a
large basket of green boughs in which i and some particular friends
of mine used to swing over sea and land by the hour



chapter lxxi

we start for taloo

bright was the morning and brighter still the smiles of the young
ladies who accompanied us when we sprang into a sort of family
canoe wide and roomy and bade adieu to the hospitable marharvai and
his tenantry as we paddled away they stood upon the beach waving their
hands and crying out aroha aroha farewell farewell as long
as we were within hearing

very sad at parting with them we endeavoured nevertheless to
console ourselves in the society of our fellow-passengers among
these were two old ladies but as they said nothing to us we will
say nothing about them nor anything about the old men who managed
the canoe but of the three mischievous dark-eyed young witches who
lounged in the stern of that comfortable old island gondola i have a
great deal to say

in the first place one of them was marhar-rarrar the bright-eyed
and in the second place neither she nor the romps her companions
ever dreamed of taking the voyage until the doctor and myself
announced our intention their going along was nothing more than a
madcap frolic in short they were a parcel of wicked hoydens bent
on mischief who laughed in your face when you looked sentimental and
only tolerated your company when making merry at your expense

something or other about us was perpetually awaking their mirth
attributing this to his own remarkable figure the doctor increased
their enjoyment by assuming the part of a merry andrew yet his cap
and bells never jingled but to some tune and while playing the
tom-fool i more than suspected that he was trying to play the rake
at home it is deemed auspicious to go a-wooing in epaulets but
among the polynesians your best dress in courting is motley

a fresh breeze springing up we set our sail of matting and glided
along as tranquilly as if floating upon an inland stream the white
reef on one hand and the green shore on the other

soon as we turned a headland we encountered another canoe paddling
with might and main in an opposite direction the strangers shouting
to each other and a tall fellow in the bow dancing up and down like
a crazy man they shot by us like an arrow though our fellow-voyagers
shouted again and again for them to cease paddling

according to the natives this was a kind of royal mail-canoe
carrying a message from the queen to her friends in a distant part of
the island

passing several shady bowers which looked quite inviting we proposed
touching and diversifying the monotony of a sea-voyage by a stroll
ashore so forcing our canoe among the bushes behind a decayed palm
lying partly in the water we left the old folks to take a nap in the
shade and gallanted the others among the trees which were here
trellised with vines and creeping shrubs

in the early part of the afternoon we drew near the place to which
the party were going it was a solitary house inhabited by four or
five old women who when we entered were gathered in a circle about
the mats eating poee from a cracked calabash they seemed delighted
at seeing our companions but rather drew up when introduced to
ourselves eyeing us distrustfully they whispered to know who we
were the answers they received were not satisfactory for they
treated us with marked coolness and reserve and seemed desirous of
breaking off our acquaintance with the girls unwilling therefore
to stay where our company was disagreeable we resolved to depart
without even eating a meal

informed of this marhar-rarrar and her companions evinced the most
lively concern and equally unmindful of their former spirits and
the remonstrances of the old ladies broke forth into sobs and
lamentations which were not to be withstood we agreed therefore to
tarry until they left for home which would be at the aheharar or
falling of the sun in other words at sunset

when the hour arrived after much leave-taking we saw them safely
embarked as the canoe turned a bluff they seized the paddles from
the hands of the old men and waved them silently in the air this
was meant for a touching farewell as the paddle is only waved thus
when the parties separating never more expect to meet

we now continued our journey and following the beach soon came to a
level and lofty overhanging bank which planted here and there with
trees took a broad sweep round a considerable part of the island

a fine pathway skirted the edge of the bank and often we paused to
admire the scenery the evening was still and fair even for so
heavenly a climate and all round as far as the eye could reach was
the blending blue sky and ocean

as we went on the reef-belt still accompanied us turning as we
turned and thundering its distant bass upon the ear like the
unbroken roar of a cataract dashing forever against their coral
rampart the breakers looked in the distance like a line of rearing
white chargers reined in tossing their white manes and bridling
with foam

these great natural breakwaters are admirably designed for the
protection of the land nearly all the society islands are defended
by them were the vast swells of the pacific to break against the
soft alluvial bottoms which in many places border the sea the soil
would soon be washed away and the natives be thus deprived of their
most productive lands as it is the banks of no rivulet are firmer

but the coral barriers answer another purpose they form all the
harbours of this group including the twenty-four round about the
shores of tahiti curiously enough the openings in the reefs by
which alone vessels enter to their anchorage are invariably opposite
the mouths of running streams an advantage fully appreciated by the
mariner who touches for the purpose of watering his ship

it is said that the fresh water of the land mixing with the salts
held in solution by the sea so acts upon the latter as to resist the
formation of the coral and hence the breaks here and there these
openings are sentinelled as it were by little fairy islets green
as emerald and waving with palms strangely and beautifully
diversifying the long line of breakers no objects can strike the
fancy more vividly pomaree ii with a taste in watering-places
truly tahitian selected one of them as a royal retreat we passed it
on our journey

omitting several further adventures which befell us after leaving the
party from loohooloo we must now hurry on to relate what happened
just before reaching the place of our destination



chapter lxxii

a dealer in the contraband

it must have been at least the tenth day reckoning from the hegira
that we found ourselves the guests of varvy an old hermit of an
islander who kept house by himself perhaps a couple of leagues from
taloo

a stone's-cast from the beach there was a fantastic rock moss-grown
and deep in a dell it was insulated by a shallow brook which
dividing its waters flowed on both sides until united below
twisting its roots round the rock a gnarled aoa spread itself
overhead in a wilderness of foliage the elastic branch-roots
depending from the larger boughs insinuating themselves into every
cleft thus forming supports to the parent stem in some places these
pendulous branches half-grown had not yet reached the rock
swinging their loose fibrous ends in the air like whiplashes

varvy's hut a mere coop of bamboos was perched upon a level part of
the rock the ridge-pole resting at one end in a crotch of the aoa
and the other propped by a forked bough planted in a fissure

notwithstanding our cries as we drew near the first hint the old
hermit received of our approach was the doctor's stepping up and
touching his shoulder as he was kneeling over on a stone cleaning
fish in the brook he leaped up and stared at us but with a variety
of uncouth gestures he soon made us welcome informing us by the
same means that he was both deaf and dumb he then motioned us into
his dwelling

going in we threw ourselves upon an old mat and peered round the
soiled bamboos and calabashes looked so uninviting that the doctor
was for pushing on to taloo that night notwithstanding it was near
sunset but at length we concluded to stay where we were

after a good deal of bustling outside under a decrepit shed the old
man made his appearance with our supper in one hand he held a
flickering taper and in the other a huge flat calabash scantily
filled with viands his eyes were dancing in his head and he looked
from the calabash to us and from us to the calabash as much as to
say ah my lads what do ye think of this eh pretty good cheer
eh but the fish and indian turnip being none of the best we made
but a sorry meal while discussing it the old man tried hard to make
himself understood by signs most of which were so excessively
ludicrous that we made no doubt he was perpetrating a series of
pantomimic jokes

the remnants of the feast removed our host left us for a moment
returning with a calabash of portly dimensions and furnished with a
long hooked neck the mouth of which was stopped with a wooden plug
it was covered with particles of earth and looked as if just taken
from some place underground

with sundry winks and horrible giggles peculiar to the dumb the
vegetable demijohn was now tapped the old fellow looking round
cautiously and pointing at it as much as to intimate that it
contained something which was taboo or forbidden

aware that intoxicating liquors were strictly prohibited to the
natives we now watched our entertainer with much interest charging
a cocoa-nut shell he tossed it off and then filling up again
presented the goblet to me disliking the smell i made faces at it
upon which he became highly excited so much so that a miracle was
wrought upon the spot snatching the cup from my hands he shouted
out ah karhowree sabbee lee-lee ena arva tee maitai in other
words what a blockhead of a white man this is the real stuff

we could not have been more startled had a frog leaped from his mouth
for an instant he looked confused enough himself and then placing a
finger mysteriously upon his mouth he contrived to make us
understand that at times he was subject to a suspension of the powers
of speech

deeming the phenomenon a remarkable one every way the doctor desired
him to open his mouth so that he might have a look down but he
refused

this occurrence made us rather suspicious of our host nor could we
afterward account for his conduct except by supposing that his
feigning dumbness might in some way or other assist him in the
nefarious pursuits in which it afterwards turned out that he was
engaged this conclusion however was not altogether satisfactory

to oblige him we at last took a sip of his arva tee and found it
very crude and strong as lucifer curious to know whence it was
obtained we questioned him when lighting up with pleasure he
seized the taper and led us outside the hut bidding us follow

after going some distance through the woods we came to a dismantled
old shed of boughs apparently abandoned to decay underneath
nothing was to be seen but heaps of decaying leaves and an immense
clumsy jar wide-mouthed and by some means rudely hollowed out from
a ponderous stone

here for a while we were left to ourselves the old man placing the
light in the jar and then disappearing he returned carrying a
long large bamboo and a crotched stick throwing these down he
poked under a pile of rubbish and brought out a rough block of wood
pierced through and through with a hole which was immediately
clapped on the top of the jar then planting the crotched stick
upright about two yards distant and making it sustain one end of the
bamboo he inserted the other end of the latter into the hole in the
block concluding these arrangements by placing an old calabash under
the farther end of the bamboo

coming up to us now with a sly significant look and pointing
admiringly at his apparatus he exclaimed ah karhowree ena
hannahanna arva tee as much as to say this you see is the way
it's done

his contrivance was nothing less than a native still where he
manufactured his island poteen the disarray in which we found it
was probably intentional as a security against detection before we
left the shed the old fellow toppled the whole concern over and
dragged it away piecemeal

his disclosing his secret to us thus was characteristic of the tootai
owrees or contemners of the missionaries among the natives who
presuming that all foreigners are opposed to the ascendancy of the
missionaries take pleasure in making them confidants whenever the
enactments of their rulers are secretly set at nought

the substance from which the liquor is produced is called tee which
is a large fibrous root something like yam but smaller in its
green state it is exceedingly acrid but boiled or baked has the
sweetness of the sugar-cane after being subjected to the fire
macerated and reduced to a certain stage of fermentation the tee
is stirred up with water and is then ready for distillation

on returning to the hut pipes were introduced and after a while
long ghost who at first had relished the arva tee as little as
myself to my surprise began to wax sociable over it with varvy
and before long absolutely got mellow the old toper keeping him
company

it was a curious sight everyone knows that so long as the occasion
lasts there is no stronger bond of sympathy and good feeling among
men than getting tipsy together and how earnestly nay movingly a
brace of worthies thus employed will endeavour to shed light upon
and elucidate their mystical ideas

fancy varvy and the doctor then lovingly tippling and brimming over
with a desire to become better acquainted the doctor politely bent
upon carrying on the conversation in the language of his host and
the old hermit persisting in trying to talk english the result was
that between the two they made such a fricassee of vowels and
consonants that it was enough to turn one's brain

the next morning on waking i heard a voice from the tombs it was
the doctor solemnly pronouncing himself a dead man he was sitting
up with both hands clasped over his forehead and his pale face a
thousand times paler than ever

that infernal stuff has murdered me he cried heavens my head's
all wheels and springs like the automaton chess-player what's to be
done paul i'm poisoned

but after drinking a herbal draught concocted by our host and eating
a light meal at noon he felt much better so much so that he
declared himself ready to continue our journey

when we came to start the yankee's boots were missing and after a
diligent search were not to be found enraged beyond measure their
proprietor said that varvy must have stolen them but considering
his hospitality i thought this extremely improbable though to whom
else to impute the theft i knew not the doctor maintained however
that one who was capable of drugging an innocent traveller with arva
tee was capable of anything

but it was in vain that he stormed and varvy and i searched the
boots were gone

were it not for this mysterious occurrence and varvy's detestable
liquors i would here recommend all travellers going round by the
beach to partoowye to stop at the rock and patronize the old
gentleman the more especially as he entertains gratis



chapter lxxiii

our reception in partoowye

upon starting at last i flung away my sandals by this time quite
worn out with the view of keeping company with the doctor now
forced to go barefooted recovering his spirits in good time he
protested that boots were a bore after all and going without them
decidedly manly

this was said be it observed while strolling along over a soft
carpet of grass a little moist even at midday from the shade of
the wood through which we were passing

emerging from this we entered upon a blank sandy tract upon which
the sun's rays fairly flashed making the loose gravel under foot
well nigh as hot as the floor of an oven such yelling and leaping as
there was in getting over this ground would be hard to surpass we
could not have crossed at all until toward sunset had it not been
for a few small wiry bushes growing here and there into which we
every now and then thrust our feet to cool there was no little
judgment necessary in selecting your bush for if not chosen
judiciously the chances were that on springing forward again and
finding the next bush so far off that an intermediate cooling was
indispensable you would have to run hack to your old place again

safely passing the sahara or fiery desert we soothed our
half-blistered feet by a pleasant walk through a meadow of long
grass which soon brought us in sight of a few straggling houses
sheltered by a grove on the outskirts of the village of partoowye

my comrade was for entering the first one we came to but on drawing
near they had so much of an air of pretension at least for native
dwellings that i hesitated thinking they might be the residences of
the higher chiefs from whom no very extravagant welcome was to be
anticipated

while standing irresolute a voice from the nearest house hailed us
aramai aramai karhowree come in come in strangers

we at once entered and were warmly greeted the master of the house
was an aristocratic-looking islander dressed in loose linen drawers
a fine white shirt and a sash of red silk tied about the waist
after the fashion of the spaniards in chili he came up to us with a
free frank air and striking his chest with his hand introduced
himself as ereemear po-po or to render the christian name back again
into english jeremiah po-po

these curious combinations of names among the people of the society
islands originate in the following way when a native is baptized
his patronymic often gives offence to the missionaries and they
insist upon changing to something else whatever is objectionable
therein so when jeremiah came to the font and gave his name as
narmo-nana po-po something equivalent to the-darer-of-devils-by-night
the reverend gentleman officiating told him that such a heathenish
appellation would never do and a substitute must be had at least
for the devil part of it some highly respectable christian
appellations were then submitted from which the candidate for
admission into the church was at liberty to choose there was adamo
adam nooar noah daveedar david earcobar james eorna john
patoora peter ereemear jeremiah etc and thus did he come to
be named jeremiah po-po or jeremiah-in-the-dark which he certainly
was i fancy as to the ridiculousness of his new cognomen

we gave our names in return upon which he bade us be seated and
sitting down himself asked us a great many questions in mixed
english and tahitian after giving some directions to an old man to
prepare food our host's wife a large benevolent-looking woman
upwards of forty also sat down by us in our soiled and
travel-stained appearance the good lady seemed to find abundant
matter for commiseration and all the while kept looking at us
piteously and making mournful exclamations

but jeremiah and his spouse were not the only inmates of the mansion

in one corner upon a large native couch elevated upon posts
reclined a nymph who half-veiled in her own long hair had yet to
make her toilet for the day she was the daughter of po-po and a
very beautiful little daughter she was not more than fourteen with
the most delightful shape like a bud just blown and large hazel
eyes they called her loo a name rather pretty and genteel and
therefore quite appropriate for a more genteel and lady-like little
damsel there was not in all imeeo

she was a cold and haughty young beauty though this same little loo
and never deigned to notice us further than now and then to let her
eyes float over our persons with an expression of indolent
indifference with the tears of the loohooloo girls hardly dry from
their sobbing upon our shoulders this contemptuous treatment stung
us not a little

when we first entered po-po was raking smooth the carpet of dried
ferns which had that morning been newly laid and now that our meal
was ready it was spread on a banana leaf right upon this fragrant
floor here we lounged at our ease eating baked pig and breadfruit
off earthen plates and using for the first time in many a long
month real knives and forks

these as well as other symptoms of refinement somewhat abated our
surprise at the reserve of the little loo her parents doubtless
were magnates in partoowye and she herself was an heiress

after being informed of our stay in the vale of martair they were
very curious to know on what errand we came to taloo we merely
hinted that the ship lying in the harbour was the reason of our
coming

arfretee po-po's wife was a right motherly body the meal over she
recommended a nap and upon our waking much refreshed she led us to
the doorway and pointed down among the trees through which we saw
the gleam of water taking the hint we repaired thither and finding
a deep shaded pool bathed and returned to the house our hostess
now sat down by us and after looking with great interest at the
doctor's cloak felt of my own soiled and tattered garments for the
hundredth time and exclaimed plaintively ah nuee nuee olee manee
olee manee alas they are very very old very old

when arfretee good soul thus addressed us she thought she was
talking very respectable english the word nuee is so familiar to
foreigners throughout polynesia and is so often used by them in
their intercourse with the natives that the latter suppose it to be
common to all mankind olee manee is the native pronunciation of
old man which by society islanders talking saxon is applied
indiscriminately to all aged things and persons whatsoever

going to a chest filled with various european articles she took out
two suits of new sailor frocks and trousers and presenting them with
a gracious smile pushed us behind a calico screen and left us
without any fastidious scruples we donned the garments and what
with the meal the nap and the bath we now came forth like a couple
of bridegrooms

evening drawing on lamps were lighted they were very simple the
half of a green melon about one third full of cocoa-nut oil and a
wick of twisted tappa floating on the surface as a night lamp this
contrivance cannot be excelled a soft dreamy light being shed
through the transparent rind

as the evening advanced other members of the household whom as yet
we had not seen began to drop in there was a slender young dandy in
a gay striped shirt and whole fathoms of bright figured calico
tucked about his waist and falling to the ground he wore a new
straw hat also with three distinct ribbons tied about the crown one
black one green and one pink shoes or stockings however he had
none

there were a couple of delicate olive-cheeked little
girls twins with mild eyes and beautiful hair who ran about the
house half-naked like a couple of gazelles they had a brother
somewhat younger a fine dark boy with an eye like a woman's all
these were the children of po-po begotten in lawful wedlock

then there were two or three queer-looking old ladies who wore shabby
mantles of soiled sheeting which fitted so badly and withal had
such a second-hand look that i at once put their wearers down as
domestic paupers poor relations supported by the bounty of my lady
arfretee they were sad meek old bodies said little and ate less
and either kept their eyes on the ground or lifted them up
deferentially the semi-civilization of the island must have had
something to do with making them what they were

i had almost forgotten monee the grinning old man who prepared our
meal his head was a shining bald globe he had a round little
paunch and legs like a cat he was po-po's factotum cook butler
and climber of the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees and added to all
else a mighty favourite with his mistress with whom he would sit
smoking and gossiping by the hour

often you saw the indefatigable monee working away at a great rate
then dropping his employment all at once never mind what run off to
a little distance and after rolling himself away in a corner and
taking a nap jump up again and fall to with fresh vigour

from a certain something in the behaviour of po-po and his household
i was led to believe that he was a pillar of the church though from
what i had seen in tahiti i could hardly reconcile such a
supposition with his frank cordial unembarrassed air but i was
not wrong in my conjecture po-po turned out to be a sort of elder
or deacon he was also accounted a man of wealth and was nearly
related to a high chief

before retiring the entire household gathered upon the floor and in
their midst he read aloud a chapter from a tahitian bible then
kneeling with the rest of us he offered up a prayer upon its
conclusion all separated without speaking these devotions took
place regularly every night and morning grace too was invariably
said by this family both before and after eating

after becoming familiarized with the almost utter destitution of
anything like practical piety upon these islands what i observed in
our host's house astonished me much but whatever others might have
been po-po was in truth a christian the only one arfretee
excepted whom i personally knew to be such among all the natives of
polynesia



chapter lxxiv

retiring for the night the doctor grows devout

they put us to bed very pleasantly

lying across the foot of po-po's nuptial couch was a smaller one made
of koar-wood a thin strong cord twisted from the fibres of the
husk of the cocoa-nut and woven into an exceedingly light sort of
network forming its elastic body spread upon this was a single
fine mat with a roll of dried ferns for a pillow and a strip of
white tappa for a sheet this couch was mine the doctor was provided
for in another corner

loo reposed alone on a little settee with a taper burning by her side
the dandy her brother swinging overhead in a sailor's hammock the
two gazelles frisked upon a mat near by and the indigent relations
borrowed a scant corner of the old butler's pallet who snored away
by the open door after all had retired po-po placed the illuminated
melon in the middle of the apartment and so we all slumbered till
morning

upon awaking the sun was streaming brightly through the open bamboos
but no one was stirring after surveying the fine attitudes into
which forgetfulness had thrown at least one of the sleepers my
attention was called off to the general aspect of the dwelling which
was quite significant of the superior circumstances of our host

the house itself was built in the simple but tasteful native style
it was a long regular oval some fifty feet in length with low
sides of cane-work and a roof thatched with palmetto-leaves the
ridgepole was perhaps twenty feet from the ground there was no
foundation whatever the bare earth being merely covered with ferns a
kind of carpeting which serves very well if frequently renewed
otherwise it becomes dusty and the haunt of vermin as in the huts
of the poorer natives

besides the couches the furniture consisted of three or four sailor
chests in which were stored the fine wearing-apparel of the
household the ruffled linen shirts of po-po the calico dresses of
his wife and children and divers odds and ends of european
articles strings of beads ribbons dutch looking-glasses knives
coarse prints bunches of keys bits of crockery and metal buttons
one of these chests used as a bandbox by arfretee contained
several of the native hats coal-scuttles all of the same pattern
but trimmed with variously-coloured ribbons of nothing was our good
hostess more proud than of these hats and her dresses on sundays
she went abroad a dozen times and every time like queen elizabeth
in a different robe

po-po for some reason or other always gave us our meals before the
rest of the family were served and the doctor who was very
discerning in such matters declared that we fared much better than
they certain it was that had ereemear's guests travelled with
purses portmanteau and letters of introduction to the queen they
could not have been better cared for

the day after our arrival monee the old butler brought us in for
dinner a small pig baked in the ground all savoury it lay in a
wooden trencher surrounded by roasted hemispheres of the breadfruit
a large calabash filled with taro pudding or poee followed and
the young dandy overcoming his customary languor threw down our
cocoa-nuts from an adjoining tree

when all was ready and the household looking on long ghost devoutly
clasping his hands over the fated pig implored a blessing hereupon
everybody present looked exceedingly pleased po-po coming up and
addressing the doctor with much warmth and arfretee regarding him
with almost maternal affection exclaimed delightedly ah
mickonaree tata matai in other words what a pious young man

it was just after this meal that she brought me a roll of grass
sinnate of the kind which sailors sew into the frame of their
tarpaulins and then handing me needle and thread bade me begin at
once and make myself the hat which i so much needed an accomplished
hand at the business i finished it that day merely stitching the
braid together and arfretee by way of rewarding my industry with
her own olive hands ornamented the crown with a band of
flame-coloured ribbon the two long ends of which streaming behind
sailor-fashion still preserved for me the eastern title bestowed by
long ghost



chapter lxxv

a ramble through the settlement

the following morning making our toilets carefully we donned our
sombreros and sallied out on a tour without meaning to reveal our
designs upon the court our principal object was to learn what
chances there were for white men to obtain employment under the
queen on this head it is true we had questioned po-po but his
answers had been very discouraging so we determined to obtain
further information elsewhere

but first to give some little description of the village

the settlement of partoowye is nothing more than some eighty houses
scattered here and there in the midst of an immense grove where the
trees have been thinned out and the underbrush cleared away through
the grove flows a stream and the principal avenue crosses it over
an elastic bridge of cocoa-nut trunks laid together side by side
the avenue is broad and serpentine well shaded from one end to the
other and as pretty a place for a morning promenade as any lounger
could wish the houses constructed without the slightest regard to
the road peep into view from among the trees on either side some
looking you right in the face as you pass and others without any
manners turning their backs occasionally you observe a rural
retreat inclosed by a picket of bamboos or with a solitary pane of
glass massively framed in the broadside of the dwelling or with a
rude strange-looking door swinging upon dislocated wooden hinges
otherwise the dwellings are built in the original style of the
natives and never mind how mean and filthy some of them may appear
within they all look picturesque enough without

as we sauntered along the people we met saluted us pleasantly and
invited us into their houses and in this way we made a good many
brief morning calls but the hour could not have been the fashionable
one in partoowye since the ladies were invariably in dishabille but
they always gave us a cordial reception and were particularly polite
to the doctor caressing him and amorously hanging about his neck
wonderfully taken up in short with a gay handkerchief he wore there
arfretee had that morning bestowed it upon the pious youth

with some exceptions the general appearance of the natives of
partoowye was far better than that of the inhabitants of papeetee a
circumstance only to be imputed to their restricted intercourse with
foreigners

strolling on we turned a sweep of the road when the doctor gave a
start and no wonder right before us in the grove was a block of
houses regular square frames boarded over furnished with windows
and doorways and two stories high we ran up and found them fast
going to decay very dingy and here and there covered with moss no
sashes no doors and on one side the entire block had settled down
nearly a foot on going into the basement we looked clean up through
the unbearded timbers to the roof where rays of light glimmering
through many a chink illuminated the cobwebs which swung all round

the whole interior was dark and close burrowing among some old mats
in one corner like a parcel of gipsies in a ruin were a few
vagabond natives they had their dwelling here

curious to know who on earth could have been thus trying to improve
the value of real estate in partoowye we made inquiries and learned
that some years previous the block had been thrown up by a veritable
yankee one might have known that a house-carpenter by trade and a
bold enterprising fellow by nature

put ashore from his ship sick he first went to work and got well
then sallied out with chisel and plane and made himself generally
useful a sober steady man it seems he at last obtained the
confidence of several chiefs and soon filled them with all sorts of
ideas concerning the alarming want of public spirit in the people of
imeeo more especially did he dwell upon the humiliating fact of
their living in paltry huts of bamboo when magnificent palaces of
boards might so easily be mortised together

in the end these representations so far prevailed with one old chief
that the carpenter was engaged to build a batch of these wonderful
palaces provided with plenty of men he at once set to work built a
saw-mill among the mountains felled trees and sent over to papeetee
for nails

presto the castle rose but alas the roof was hardly on when the
yankee's patron having speculated beyond his means broke all to
pieces and was absolutely unable to pay one plug of tobacco in the
pound his failure involved the carpenter who sailed away from his
creditors in the very next ship that touched at the harbour

the natives despised the rickety palace of boards and often lounged
by wagging their heads and jeering

we were told that the queen's residence was at the extreme end of the
village so without waiting for the doctor to procure a fiddle we
suddenly resolved upon going thither at once and learning whether
any privy counsellorships were vacant

now although there was a good deal of my waggish comrade's nonsense
about what has been said concerning our expectations of court
preferment we nevertheless really thought that something to our
advantage might turn up in that quarter

on approaching the palace grounds we found them rather peculiar a
broad pier of hewn coral rocks was built right out into the water
and upon this and extending into a grove adjoining were some eight
or ten very large native houses constructed in the handsomest style
and inclosed together by a low picket of bamboos which embraced a
considerable area

throughout the society islands the residences of the chiefs are
mostly found in the immediate vicinity of the sea a site which gives
them the full benefit of a cooling breeze nor are they so liable to
the annoyance of insects besides enjoying when they please the
fine shade afforded by the neighbouring groves always most luxuriant
near the water

lounging about the grounds were some sixty or eighty
handsomely-dressed natives men and women some reclining on the
shady side of the houses others under the trees and a small group
conversing close by the railing facing us

we went up to the latter and giving the usual salutation were on the
point of vaulting over the bamboos when they turned upon us angrily
and said we could not enter we stated our earnest desire to see the
queen hinting that we were bearers of important dispatches but it
was to no purpose and not a little vexed we were obliged to return
to po-po's without effecting anything



chapter lxxvi

an island jilt we visit the ship

upon arriving home we fully laid open to po-po our motives in visiting
taloo and begged his friendly advice in his broken english he
cheerfully gave us all the information we needed

it was true he said that the queen entertained some idea of making a
stand against the french and it was currently reported also that
several chiefs from borabora huwyenee raiatair and tahar the
leeward islands of the group were at that very time taking counsel
with her as to the expediency of organizing a general movement
throughout the entire cluster with a view of anticipating any further
encroachments on the part of the invaders should warlike measures be
actually decided upon it was quite certain that pomaree would be
glad to enlist all the foreigners she could but as to her making
officers of either the doctor or me that was out of the question
because already a number of europeans well known to her had
volunteered as such concerning our getting immediate access to the
queen po-po told us it was rather doubtful she living at that time
very retired in poor health and spirits and averse to receiving
calls previous to her misfortunes however no one however humble
was denied admittance to her presence sailors even attended her
levees

not at all disheartened by these things we concluded to kill time in
partoowye until some event turned up more favourable to our projects
so that very day we sallied out on an excursion to the ship which
lying land-locked far up the bay yet remained to be visited

passing on our route a long low shed a voice hailed us white men
ahoy turning round who should we see but a rosy-cheeked englishman
you could tell his country at a glance up to his knees in
shavings and planing away at a bench he turned out to be a runaway
ship's carpenter recently from tahiti and now doing a profitable
business in imeeo by fitting up the dwellings of opulent chiefs with
cupboards and other conveniences and once in a while trying his hand
at a lady's work-box he had been in the settlement but a few months
and already possessed houses and lands

but though blessed with prosperity and high health there was one
thing wanting a wife and when he came to speak of the matter his
countenance fell and he leaned dejectedly upon his plane

it's too bad he sighed to wait three long years and all the
while dear little lullee living in the same house with that infernal
chief from tahar

our curiosity was piqued the poor carpenter then had been falling
in love with some island coquette who was going to jilt him

but such was not the case there was a law prohibiting under a heavy
penalty the marriage of a native with a foreigner unless the
latter after being three years a resident on the island was willing
to affirm his settled intention of remaining for life

william was therefore in a sad way he told us that he might have
married the girl half-a-dozen times had it not been for this odious
law but latterly she had become less loving and more giddy
particularly with the strangers from tahar desperately smitten and
desirous of securing her at all hazards he had proposed to the
damsel's friends a nice little arrangement introductory to marriage
but they would not hear of it besides if the pair were discovered
living together upon such a footing they would be liable to a
degrading punishment sent to work making stone walls and opening
roads for the queen

doctor long ghost was all sympathy bill my good fellow said he
tremulously let me go and talk to her but bill declining the
offer would not even inform us where his charmer lived

leaving the disconsolate willie planing a plank of new zealand pine
an importation from the bay of islands and thinking the while of
lullee we went on our way how his suit prospered in the end we
never learned

going from po-po's house toward the anchorage of the harbour of taloo
you catch no glimpse of the water until coming out from deep groves
you all at once find yourself upon the beach a bay considered by
many voyagers the most beautiful in the south seas then lies before
you you stand upon one side of what seems a deep green river
flowing through mountain passes to the sea right opposite a majestic
promontory divides the inlet from another called after its
discoverer captain cook the face of this promontory toward taloo
is one verdant wall and at its base the waters lie still and
fathomless on the left hand you just catch a peep of the widening
mouth of the bay the break in the reef by which ships enter and
beyond the sea to the right the inlet sweeping boldly round the
promontory runs far away into the land where save in one
direction the hills close in on every side knee-deep in verdure and
shooting aloft in grotesque peaks the open space lies at the head of
the bay in the distance it extends into a broad hazy plain lying at
the foot of an amphitheatre of hills here is the large sugar
plantation previously alluded to beyond the first range of hills
you descry the sharp pinnacles of the interior and among these the
same silent marling-spike which we so often admired from the other
side of the island

all alone in the harbour lay the good ship leviathan we jumped into
the canoe and paddled off to her though early in the afternoon
everything was quiet but upon mounting the side we found four or
five sailors lounging about the forecastle under an awning they
gave us no very cordial reception and though otherwise quite hearty
in appearance seemed to assume a look of ill-humour on purpose to
honour our arrival there was much eagerness to learn whether we
wanted to ship and by the unpleasant accounts they gave of the
vessel they seemed desirous to prevent such a thing if possible

we asked where the rest of the ship's company were a gruff old fellow
made answer one boat's crew of em is gone to davy jones's
locker went off after a whale last cruise and never come back
agin all the starboard watch ran away last night and the skipper's
ashore kitching em

and it's shipping yer after my jewels is it cried a curly-pated
little belfast sailor coming up to us thin arrah my livelies
jist be after sailing ashore in a jiffy the divil of a skipper will
carry yees both to sea whether or no be off wid ye thin darlints
and steer clear of the likes of this ballyhoo of blazes as long as ye
live they murther us here every day and starve us into the bargain
here dick lad har the poor divil's canow alongside and paddle
away wid yees for dear life

but we loitered awhile listening to more inducements to ship and at
last concluded to stay to supper my sheath-knife never cut into
better sea-beef than that which we found lying in the kid in the
forecastle the bread too was hard dry and brittle as glass and
there was plenty of both

while we were below the mate of the vessel called out for someone to
come on deck i liked his voice hearing it was as good as a look at
his face it betokened a true sailor and no taskmaster

the appearance of the leviathan herself was quite pleasing like all
large comfortable old whalers she had a sort of motherly
look broad in the beam flush decks and four chubby boats hanging
at the breast her sails were furled loosely upon the yards as if
they had been worn long and fitted easy her shrouds swung
negligently slack and as for the running rigging it never worked
hard as it does in some of your dandy ships jamming in the sheaves
of blocks like chinese slippers too small to be useful on the
contrary the ropes ran glibly through as if they had many a time
travelled the same road and were used to it

when evening came we dropped into our canoe and paddled ashore
fully convinced that the good ship never deserved the name which they
gave her



chapter lxxvii

a party of rovers little loo and the doctor

while in partoowye we fell in with a band of six veteran rovers
prowling about the village and harbour who had just come overland
from another part of the island

a few weeks previous they had been paid off at papeetee from a
whaling vessel on board of which they had six months before
shipped for a single cruise that is to say to be discharged at the
next port their cruise was a famous one and each man stepped upon
the beach at tahiti jingling his dollars in a sock

weary at last of the shore and having some money left they clubbed
and purchased a sail-boat proposing a visit to a certain uninhabited
island concerning which they had heard strange and golden stories
of course they never could think of going to sea without a
medicine-chest filled with flasks of spirits and a small cask of the
same in the hold in case the chest should give out

away they sailed hoisted a flag of their own and gave three times
three as they staggered out of the bay of papeetee with a strong
breeze and under all the muslin they could carry

evening coming on and feeling in high spirits and no ways disposed to
sleep they concluded to make a night of it which they did all
hands getting tipsy and the two masts going over the side about
midnight to the tune of

 sailing down sailing down on the coast of barbaree

fortunately one worthy could stand by holding on to the tiller and
the rest managed to crawl about and hack away the lanyards of the
rigging so as to break clear from the fallen spars while thus
employed two sailors got tranquilly over the side and went plumb to
the bottom under the erroneous impression that they were stepping
upon an imaginary wharf to get at their work better

after this it blew quite a gale and the commodore at the helm
instinctively kept the boat before the wind and by so doing ran
over for the opposite island of imeeo crossing the channel by
almost a miracle they went straight through an opening in the reef
and shot upon a ledge of coral where the waters were tolerably
smooth here they lay until morning when the natives came off to
them in their canoes by the help of the islanders the schooner was
hove over on her beam-ends when finding the bottom knocked to
pieces the adventurers sold the boat for a trifle to the chief of
the district and went ashore rolling before them their precious cask
of spirits its contents soon evaporated and they came to partoowye

the day after encountering these fellows we were strolling among the
groves in the neighbourhood when we came across several parties of
natives armed with clumsy muskets rusty cutlasses and outlandish
clubs they were beating the bushes shouting aloud and apparently
trying to scare somebody they were in pursuit of the strangers who
having in a single night set at nought all the laws of the place had
thought best to decamp

in the daytime po-po's house was as pleasant a lounge as one could
wish so after strolling about and seeing all there was to be seen
we spent the greater part of our mornings there breakfasting late
and dining about two hours after noon sometimes we lounged on the
floor of ferns smoking and telling stories of which the doctor had
as many as a half-pay captain in the army sometimes we chatted as
well as we could with the natives and one day joy to us po-po
brought in three volumes of smollett's novels which had been found
in the chest of a sailor who some time previous had died on the
island

amelia peregrine you hero of rogues count fathom what a debt do
we owe you

i know not whether it was the reading of these romances or the want
of some sentimental pastime which led the doctor about this period
to lay siege to the heart of the little loo

now as i have said before the daughter of po-po was most cruelly
reserved and never deigned to notice us frequently i addressed her
with a long face and an air of the profoundest and most distant
respect but in vain she wouldn't even turn up her pretty olive
nose ah it's quite plain thought i she knows very well what
graceless dogs sailors are and won't have anything to do with us

but thus thought not my comrade bent he was upon firing the cold
glitter of loo's passionless eyes

he opened the campaign with admirable tact making cautious
approaches and content for three days with ogling the nymph for
about five minutes after every meal on the fourth day he asked her
a question on the fifth she dropped a nut of ointment and he
picked it up and gave it to her on the sixth he went over and sat
down within three yards of the couch where she lay and on the
memorable morn of the seventh he proceeded to open his batteries in
form

the damsel was reclining on the ferns one hand supporting her cheek
and the other listlessly turning over the leaves of a tahitian bible
the doctor approached

now the chief disadvantage under which he laboured was his almost
complete ignorance of the love vocabulary of the island but french
counts they say make love delightfully in broken english and what
hindered the doctor from doing the same in dulcet tahitian so at it
he went

ah said he smiling bewitchingly oee mickonaree oee ready
biblee

no answer not even a look

ah i matai very goody ready biblee mickonaree

loo without stirring began reading in a low tone to herself

mickonaree biblee ready goody maitai once more observed the doctor
ingeniously transposing his words for the third time

but all to no purpose loo gave no sign

he paused despairingly but it would never do to give up so he threw
himself at full length beside her and audaciously commenced turning
over the leaves

loo gave a start just one little start barely perceptible and then
fumbling something in her hand lay perfectly motionless the doctor
rather frightened at his own temerity and knowing not what to do
next at last he placed one arm cautiously about her waist almost
in the same instant he bounded to his feet with a cry the little
witch had pierced him with a thorn but there she lay just as
quietly as ever turning over the leaves and reading to herself

my long friend raised the siege incontinently and made a disorderly
retreat to the place where i reclined looking on

i am pretty sure that loo must have related this occurrence to her
father who came in shortly afterward for he looked queerly at the
doctor but he said nothing and in ten minutes was quite as
affable as ever as for loo there was not the slightest change in
her and the doctor of course for ever afterwards held his peace



chapter lxxviii

mrs bell

one day taking a pensive afternoon stroll along one of the many
bridle-paths which wind among the shady groves in the neighbourhood
of taloo i was startled by a sunny apparition it was that of a
beautiful young englishwoman charmingly dressed and mounted upon a
spirited little white pony switching a green branch she came
cantering toward me

i looked round to see whether i could possibly be in polynesia there
were the palm-trees but how to account for the lady

stepping to one side as the apparition drew near i made a polite
obeisance it gave me a bold rosy look and then with a gay air
patted its palfrey crying out fly away willie and galloped
among the trees

i would have followed but willie's heels were making such a pattering
among the dry leaves that pursuit would have been useless

so i went straight home to po-po's and related my adventure to the
doctor

the next day our inquiries resulted in finding out that the stranger
had been on the island about two years that she came from sydney
and was the wife of mr bell happy dog the proprietor of the
sugar plantation to which i have previously referred

to the sugar plantation we went the same day

the country round about was very beautiful a level basin of verdure
surrounded by sloping hillsides the sugar-cane of which there was
about one hundred acres in various stages of cultivation looked
thrifty a considerable tract of land however which seemed to have
been formerly tilled was now abandoned

the place where they extracted the saccharine matter was under an
immense shed of bamboos here we saw several clumsy pieces of
machinery for breaking the cane also great kettles for boiling the
sugar but at present nothing was going on two or three natives
were lounging in one of the kettles smoking the other was occupied
by three sailors from the leviathan playing cards

while we were conversing with these worthies a stranger approached
he was a sun-burnt romantic-looking european dressed in a loose
suit of nankeen his fine throat and chest were exposed and he
sported a guayaquil hat with a brim like a chinese umbrella this was
mr bell he was very civil showed us the grounds and taking us
into a sort of arbour to our surprise offered to treat us to some
wine people often do the like but mr bell did more he produced
the bottle it was spicy sherry and we drank out of the halves of
fresh citron melons delectable goblets

the wine was a purchase from the french in tahiti

now all this was extremely polite in mr bell still we came to see
mrs bell but she proved to be a phantom indeed having left the
same morning for papeetee on a visit to one of the missionaries
wives there

i went home much chagrined

to be frank my curiosity had been wonderfully piqued concerning the
lady in the first place she was the most beautiful white woman i
ever saw in polynesia but this is saying nothing she had such eyes
such moss-roses in her cheeks such a divine air in the saddle that
to my dying day i shall never forget mrs bell

the sugar-planter himself was young robust and handsome so merrily
may the little bells increase and multiply and make music in the
land of imeeo



chapter lxxix

taloo chapel holding court in polynesia

in partoowye is to be seen one of the best-constructed and handsomest
chapels in the south seas like the buildings of the palace it
stands upon an artificial pier presenting a semicircular sweep to
the bay the chapel is built of hewn blocks of coral a substance
which although extremely friable is said to harden by exposure to
the atmosphere to a stranger these blocks look extremely curious
their surface is covered with strange fossil-like impressions the
seal of which must have been set before the flood very nearly white
when hewn from the reefs the coral darkens with age so that several
churches in polynesia now look almost as sooty and venerable as famed
st paul's

in shape the chapel is an octagon with galleries all round it will
seat perhaps four hundred people everything within is stained a
tawny red and there being but few windows or rather embrasures the
dusky benches and galleries and the tall spectre of a pulpit look
anything but cheerful

on sundays we always went to worship here going in the family suite
of po-po we of course maintained a most decorous exterior and
hence by all the elderly people of the village were doubtless
regarded as pattern young men

po-po's seat was in a snug corner and it being particularly snug in
the immediate vicinity of one of the palm pillars supporting the
gallery i invariably leaned against it po-po and his lady on one
side the doctor and the dandy on the other and the children and
poor relations seated behind

as for loo instead of sitting as she ought to have done by her good
father and mother she must needs run up into the gallery and sit
with a parcel of giddy creatures of her own age who all through the
sermon did nothing but look down on the congregation pointing out
and giggling at the queer-looking old ladies in dowdy bonnets and
scant tunics but loo herself was never guilty of these
improprieties

occasionally during the week they have afternoon service in the
chapel when the natives themselves have something to say although
their auditors are but few an introductory prayer being offered by
the missionary and a hymn sung communicants rise in their places
and exhort in pure tahitian and with wonderful tone and gesture
and among them all deacon po-po though he talked most was the one
whom you would have liked best to hear much would i have given to
have understood some of his impassioned bursts when he tossed his
arms overhead stamped scowled and glared till he looked like the
very angel of vengeance

deluded man sighed the doctor on one of these occasions i fear
he takes the fanatical view of the subject one thing was certain
when po-po spoke all listened a great deal more than could be said
for the rest for under the discipline of two or three i could
mention some of the audience napped others fidgeted a few yawned
and one irritable old gentleman in a nightcap of cocoa-nut leaves
used to clutch his long staff in a state of excessive nervousness
and stride out of the church making all the noise he could to
emphasize his disgust

right adjoining the chapel is an immense rickety building with
windows and shutters and a half-decayed board flooring laid upon
trunks of palm-trees they called it a school-house but as such we
never saw it occupied it was often used as a court-room however
and here we attended several trials among others that of a decayed
naval officer and a young girl of fourteen the latter charged with
having been very naughty on a particular occasion set forth in the
pleadings and the former with having aided and abetted her in her
naughtiness and with other misdemeanours

the foreigner was a tall military-looking fellow with a dark cheek
and black whiskers according to his own account he had lost a
colonial armed brig on the coast of new zealand and since then had
been leading the life of a man about town among the islands of the
pacific

the doctor wanted to know why he did not go home and report the loss
of his brig but captain crash as they called him had some
incomprehensible reasons for not doing so about which he could talk
by the hour and no one be any the wiser probably he was a discreet
man and thought it best to waive an interview with the lords of the
admiralty

for some time past this extremely suspicious character had been
carrying on the illicit trade in french wines and brandies smuggled
over from the men-of-war lately touching at tahiti in a grove near
the anchorage he had a rustic shanty and arbour where in quiet
times when no ships were in taloo a stray native once in a while
got boozy and staggered home catching at the cocoa-nut trees as he
went the captain himself lounged under a tree during the warm
afternoons pipe in mouth thinking perhaps over old times and
occasionally feeling his shoulders for his lost epaulets

but sail ho a ship is descried coming into the bay soon she drops
her anchor in its waters and the next day captain crash entertains
the sailors in his grove and rare times they have of it drinking
and quarrelling together as sociably as you please

upon one of these occasions the crew of the leviathan made so
prodigious a tumult that the natives indignant at the insult offered
their laws plucked up a heart and made a dash at the rioters one
hundred strong the sailors fought like tigers but were at last
overcome and carried before a native tribunal which after a mighty
clamour dismissed everybody but captain crash who was asserted to be
the author of the disorders

upon this charge then he had been placed in confinement against the
coming on of the assizes the judge being expected to lounge along in
the course of the afternoon while waiting his honour's arrival
numerous additional offences were preferred against the culprit
mostly by the old women among others was the bit of a slip in
which he stood implicated along with the young lady thus in
polynesia as elsewhere charge a man with one misdemeanour and all
his peccadilloes are raked up and assorted before him

going to the school-house for the purpose of witnessing the trial the
din of it assailed our ears a long way off and upon entering the
building we were almost stunned about five hundred natives were
present each apparently having something to say and determined to
say it his honour a handsome benevolent-looking old man sat
cross-legged on a little platform seemingly resigned with all
christian submission to the uproar he was an hereditary chief in
this quarter of the island and judge for life in the district of
partoowye

there were several cases coming on but the captain and girl were
first tried together they were mixing freely with the crowd and as
it afterwards turned out that everyone no matter who had a right to
address the court for aught we knew they might have been arguing
their own case at what precise moment the trial began it would be
hard to say there was no swearing of witnesses and no regular jury
now and then somebody leaped up and shouted out something which might
have been evidence the rest meanwhile keeping up an incessant
jabbering presently the old judge himself began to get excited and
springing to his feet ran in among the crowd wagging his tongue as
hard as anybody

the tumult lasted about twenty minutes and toward the end of it
captain crash might have been seen tranquilly regarding from his
honour's platform the judicial uproar in which his fate was about
being decided

the result of all this was that both he and the girl were found
guilty the latter was adjudged to make six mats for the queen and
the former in consideration of his manifold offences being deemed
incorrigible was sentenced to eternal banishment from the island
both these decrees seemed to originate in the general hubbub his
honour however appeared to have considerable authority and it was
quite plain that the decision received his approval

the above penalties were by no means indiscriminately inflicted the
missionaries have prepared a sort of penal tariff to facilitate
judicial proceedings it costs so many days labour on the broom road
to indulge in the pleasures of the calabash so many fathoms of stone
wall to steal a musket and so on to the end of the catalogue the
judge being provided with a book in which all these matters are
cunningly arranged the thing is vastly convenient for instance a
crime is proved say bigamy turn to letter b and there you have
it bigamy forty days on the broom road and twenty mats for the
queen read the passage aloud and sentence is pronounced

after taking part in the first trial the other delinquents present
were put upon their own in which also the convicted culprits
seemed to have quite as much to say as the rest a rather strange
proceeding but strictly in accordance with the glorious english
principle that every man should be tried by his peers they were all
found guilty



chapter lxxx

queen pomaree

it is well to learn something about people before being introduced to
them and so we will here give some account of pomaree and her
family

every reader of cook's voyages must remember otto who in that
navigator's time was king of the larger peninsula of tahiti
subsequently assisted by the muskets of the bounty's men he
extended his rule over the entire island this otto before his
death had his name changed into pomaree which has ever since been
the royal patronymic

he was succeeded by his son pomaree ii the most famous prince in
the annals of tahiti though a sad debauchee and drunkard and even
charged with unnatural crimes he was a great friend of the
missionaries and one of their very first proselytes during the
religious wars into which he was hurried by his zeal for the new
faith he was defeated and expelled from the island after a short
exile he returned from imeeo with an army of eight hundred warriors
and in the battle of narii routed the rebellious pagans with great
slaughter and reestablished himself upon the throne thus by force
of arms was christianity finally triumphant in tahiti

pomaree ii dying in was succeeded by his infant son under the
title of pomaree iii this young prince survived his father but six
years and the government then descended to his elder sister aimata
the present queen who is commonly called pomaree vahinee i or the
first female pomaree her majesty must be now upwards of thirty years
of age she has been twice married her first husband was a son of
the old king of tahar an island about one hundred miles from tahiti
this proving an unhappy alliance the pair were soon afterwards
divorced the present husband of the queen is a chief of imeeo

the reputation of pomaree is not what it ought to be she and also
her mother were for a long time excommunicated members of the
church and the former i believe still is among other things her
conjugal fidelity is far from being unquestioned indeed it was upon
this ground chiefly that she was excluded from the communion of the
church

previous to her misfortunes she spent the greater portion of her time
sailing about from one island to another attended by a licentious
court and wherever she went all manner of games and festivities
celebrated her arrival

she was always given to display for several years the maintenance of
a regiment of household troops drew largely upon the royal exchequer
they were trouserless fellows in a uniform of calico shirts and
pasteboard hats armed with muskets of all shapes and calibres and
commanded by a great noisy chief strutting it in a coat of fiery
red these heroes escorted their mistress whenever she went abroad

some time ago the queen received from her english sister victoria a
very showy though uneasy head-dress a crown probably made to
order at some tinman's in london having no idea of reserving so
pretty a bauble for coronation days which come so seldom her
majesty sported it whenever she appeared in public and to show her
familiarity with european customs politely touched it to all
foreigners of distinction whaling captains and the like whom she
happened to meet in her evening walk on the broom road

the arrival and departure of royalty were always announced at the
palace by the court artilleryman a fat old gentleman who in a
prodigious hurry and perspiration discharged minute fowling-pieces
as fast as he could load and fire the same

the tahitian princess leads her husband a hard life poor fellow he
not only caught a queen but a tartar when he married her the style
by which he is addressed is rather significant pomaree-tanee
pomaree's man all things considered as appropriate a title for a
king-consort as could be hit upon

if ever there were a henpecked husband that man is the prince one
day his carasposa giving audience to a deputation from the captains
of the vessels lying in papeetee he ventured to make a suggestion
which was very displeasing to her she turned round and boxing his
ears told him to go over to his beggarly island of imeeo if he
wanted to give himself airs

cuffed and contemned poor tanee flies to the bottle or rather to the
calabash for solace like his wife and mistress he drinks more than
he ought

six or seven years ago when an american man-of-war was lying at
papeetee the town was thrown into the greatest commotion by a
conjugal assault and battery made upon the sacred person of pomaree
by her intoxicated tanee

captain bob once told me the story and by way of throwing more spirit
into the description as well as to make up for his oral
deficiencies the old man went through the accompanying action
myself being proxy for the queen of tahiti

it seems that on a sunday morning being dismissed contemptuously
from the royal presence tanee was accosted by certain good fellows
friends and boon companions who condoled with him on his
misfortunes railed against the queen and finally dragged him away
to an illicit vendor of spirits in whose house the party got
gloriously mellow in this state pomaree vahinee i was the topic
upon which all dilated a vixen of a queen probably suggested one
it's infamous said another and i'd have satisfaction cried a
third and so i will tanee must have hiccoughed for off he went
and ascertaining that his royal half was out riding he mounted his
horse and galloped after her

near the outskirts of the town a cavalcade of women came cantering
toward him in the centre of which was the object of his fury
smiting his beast right and left he dashed in among them completely
overturning one of the party leaving her on the field and
dispersing everybody else except pomaree backing her horse
dexterously the incensed queen heaped upon him every scandalous
epithet she could think of until at last the enraged tanee leaped
out of his saddle caught pomaree by her dress and dragging her to
the earth struck her repeatedly in the face holding on meanwhile by
the hair of her head he was proceeding to strangle her on the spot
when the cries of the frightened attendants brought a crowd of natives
to the rescue who bore the nearly insensible queen away

but his frantic rage was not yet sated he ran to the palace and
before it could be prevented demolished a valuable supply of
crockery a recent present from abroad in the act of perpetrating
some other atrocity he was seized from behind and carried off with
rolling eyes and foaming at the mouth

this is a fair example of a tahitian in a passion though the mildest
of mortals in general and hard to be roused when once fairly up he
is possessed with a thousand devils

the day following tanee was privately paddled over to imeeo in a
canoe where after remaining in banishment for a couple of weeks he
was allowed to return and once more give in his domestic adhesion

though pomaree vahinee i be something of a jezebel in private life
in her public rule she is said to have been quite lenient and
forbearing this was her true policy for an hereditary hostility to
her family had always lurked in the hearts of many powerful chiefs
the descendants of the old kings of taiarboo dethroned by her
grandfather otoo chief among these and in fact the leader of his
party was poofai a bold able man who made no secret of his enmity
to the missionaries and the government which they controlled but
while events were occurring calculated to favour the hopes of the
disaffected and turbulent the arrival of the french gave a most
unexpected turn to affairs

during my sojourn in tahiti a report was rife which i knew to
originate with what is generally called the missionary party that
poofai and some other chiefs of note had actually agreed for a
stipulated bribe to acquiesce in the appropriation of their country
but subsequent events have rebutted the calumny several of these
very men have recently died in battle against the french

under the sovereignty of the pomarees the great chiefs of tahiti were
something like the barons of king john holding feudal sway over
their patrimonial valleys and on account of their descent warmly
beloved by the people they frequently cut off the royal revenues by
refusing to pay the customary tribute due from them as vassals

the truth is that with the ascendancy of the missionaries the regal
office in tahiti lost much of its dignity and influence in the days
of paganism it was supported by all the power of a numerous
priesthood and was solemnly connected with the entire superstitious
idolatry of the land the monarch claimed to be a sort of bye-blow of
tararroa the saturn of the polynesian mythology and cousin-german to
inferior deities his person was thrice holy if he entered an
ordinary dwelling never mind for how short a time it was demolished
when he left no common mortal being thought worthy to inhabit it
afterward

i'm a greater man than king george said the incorrigible young otoo
to the first missionaries he rides on a horse and i on a man
such was the case he travelled post through his dominions on the
shoulders of his subjects and relays of mortal beings were provided
in all the valleys

but alas how times have changed how transient human greatness some
years since pomaree vahinee i the granddaughter of the proud otoo
went into the laundry business publicly soliciting by her agents
the washing of the linen belonging to the officers of ships touching
in her harbours

it is a significant fact and one worthy of record that while the
influence of the english missionaries at tahiti has tended to so
great a diminution of the regal dignity there that of the american
missionaries at the sandwich islands has been purposely exerted to
bring about a contrary result



chapter lxxxi

we visit the court

it was about the middle of the second month of the hegira and
therefore some five weeks after our arrival in partoowye that we at
last obtained admittance to the residence of the queen

it happened thus there was a marquesan in the train of pomaree who
officiated as nurse to her children according to the tahitian
custom the royal youngsters are carried about until it requires no
small degree of strength to stand up under them but marbonna was
just the man for this large and muscular well made as a statue and
with an arm like a degenerate tahitian's thigh

embarking at his native island as a sailor on board of a french
whaler he afterward ran away from the ship at tahiti where being
seen and admired by pomaree he had been prevailed upon to enlist in
her service

often when visiting the grounds we saw him walking about in the
shade carrying two handsome boys who encircled his neck with their
arms marbonna's face tattooed as it was in the ornate style of his
tribe was as good as a picture-book to these young pomarees they
delighted to trace with their fingers the outlines of the strange
shapes there delineated

the first time my eyes lighted upon the marquesan i knew his country
in a moment and hailing him in his own language he turned round
surprised that a person so speaking should be a stranger he proved
to be a native of tior a glen of nukuheva i had visited the place
more than once and so on the island of imeeo we met like old
friends

in my frequent conversations with him over the bamboo picket i found
this islander a philosopher of nature a wild heathen moralizing
upon the vices and follies of the christian court of tahiti a
savage scorning the degeneracy of the people among whom fortune had
thrown him

i was amazed at the national feelings of the man no european when
abroad could speak of his country with more pride than marbonna he
assured me again and again that so soon as he had obtained
sufficient money to purchase twenty muskets and as many bags of
powder he was going to return to a place with which imeeo was not
worthy to be compared

it was marbonna who after one or two unsuccessful attempts at last
brought about our admission into the queen's grounds through a
considerable crowd he conducted us along the pier to where an old man
was sitting to whom he introduced us as a couple of karhowrees of
his acquaintance anxious to see the sights of the palace the
venerable chamberlain stared at us and shook his head the doctor
thinking he wanted a fee placed a plug of tobacco in his hand this
was ingratiating and we were permitted to pass on upon the point of
entering one of the houses marbonna's name was shouted in
half-a-dozen different directions and he was obliged to withdraw

thus left at the very threshold to shift for ourselves my companion's
assurance stood us in good stead he stalked right in and i
followed the place was full of women who instead of exhibiting the
surprise we expected accosted us as cordially as if we had called to
take our souchong with them by express invitation in the first
place nothing would do but we must each devour a calabash of poee
and several roasted bananas pipes were then lighted and a brisk
conversation ensued

these ladies of the court if not very polished were surprisingly
free and easy in their manners quite as much so as king charles's
beauties there was one of them an arch little miss who could
converse with us pretty fluently to whom we strove to make ourselves
particularly agreeable with the view of engaging her services as
cicerone

as such she turned out to be everything we could desire no one
disputing her will every place was entered without ceremony
curtains brushed aside mats lifted and each nook and corner
explored whether the little damsel carried her mistress signet
that everything opened to her thus i know not but marbonna himself
the bearer of infants could not have been half so serviceable

among other houses which we visited was one of large size and fine
exterior the special residence of a european formerly the mate of a
merchant vessel who had done himself the honour of marrying into
the pomaree family the lady he wedded being a near kinswoman of the
queen he became a permanent member of her majesty's household this
adventurer rose late dressed theatrically in calico and trinkets
assumed a dictatorial tone in conversation and was evidently upon
excellent terms with himself

we found him reclining on a mat smoking a reed-pipe of tobacco in
the midst of an admiring circle of chiefs and ladies he must have
noticed our approach but instead of rising and offering civilities
he went on talking and smoking without even condescending to look at
us

his highness feels his poee carelessly observed the doctor the
rest of the company gave us the ordinary salutation our guide
announcing us beforehand

in answer to our earnest requests to see the queen we were now
conducted to an edifice by far the most spacious in the inclosure
it was at least one hundred and fifty feet in length very wide with
low eaves and an exceedingly steep roof of pandannas leaves there
were neither doors nor windows nothing along the sides but the
slight posts supporting the rafters between these posts curtains of
fine matting and tappa were rustling all round some of them were
festooned or partly withdrawn so as to admit light and air and
afford a glimpse now and then of what was going on within

pushing aside one of the screens we entered the apartment was one
immense hall the long and lofty ridge-pole fluttering with fringed
matting and tassels full forty feet from the ground lounges of
mats piled one upon another extended on either side while here
and there were slight screens forming as many recesses where groups
of natives all females were reclining at their evening meal

as we advanced these various parties ceased their buzzing and in
explanation of our appearance among them listened to a few
cabalistic words from our guide

the whole scene was a strange one but what most excited our surprise
was the incongruous assemblage of the most costly objects from all
quarters of the globe cheek by jowl they lay beside the rudest
native articles without the slightest attempt at order superb
writing-desks of rosewood inlaid with silver and mother-of-pearl
decanters and goblets of cut glass embossed volumes of plates gilded
candelabra sets of globes and mathematical instruments the finest
porcelain richly-mounted sabres and fowling-pieces laced hats and
sumptuous garments of all sorts with numerous other matters of
european manufacture were strewn about among greasy calabashes
half-filled with poee rolls of old tappa and matting paddles and
fish-spears and the ordinary furniture of a tahitian dwelling

all the articles first mentioned were doubtless presents from
foreign powers they were more or less injured the fowling-pieces
and swords were rusted the finest woods were scratched and a folio
volume of hogarth lay open with a cocoa-nut shell of some musty
preparation capsized among the miscellaneous furniture of the rake's
apartment where that inconsiderate young gentleman is being measured
for a coat

while we were amusing ourselves in this museum of curiosities our
conductor plucked us by the sleeve and whispered pomaree pomaree
armai kow kow

she is coming to sup then said the doctor staring in the
direction indicated what say you paul suppose we step up just
then a curtain near by lifted and from a private building a few
yards distant the queen entered unattended

she wore a loose gown of blue silk with two rich shawls one red and
the other yellow tied about her neck her royal majesty was
barefooted

she was about the ordinary size rather matronly her features not
very handsome her mouth voluptuous but there was a care-worn
expression in her face probably attributable to her late
misfortunes from her appearance one would judge her about forty
but she is not so old

as the queen approached one of the recesses her attendants hurried
up escorted her in and smoothed the mats on which she at last
reclined two girls soon appeared carrying their mistress repast
and then surrounded by cut-glass and porcelain and jars of
sweetmeats and confections pomaree vahinee i the titular queen of
tahiti ate fish and poee out of her native calabashes disdaining
either knife or spoon

come on whispered long ghost let's have an audience at once and
he was on the point of introducing himself when our guide quite
alarmed held him back and implored silence the other natives also
interfered and as he was pressing forward raised such an outcry
that pomaree lifted her eyes and saw us for the first

she seemed surprised and offended and issuing an order in a
commanding tone to several of her women waved us out of the house
summary as the dismissal was court etiquette no doubt required our
compliance we withdrew making a profound inclination as we
disappeared behind the tappa arras

we departed the ground without seeing marbonna and previous to
vaulting over the picket feed our pretty guide after a fashion of
our own looking round a few moments after we saw the damsel
escorted back by two men who seemed to have been sent after her i
trust she received nothing more than a reprimand

the next day po-po informed us that strict orders had been issued to
admit no strangers within the palace precincts



chapter lxxxii

which ends the book

disappointed in going to court we determined upon going to sea it
would never do longer to trespass on po-po's hospitality and then
weary somewhat of life in imeeo like all sailors ashore i at last
pined for the billows

now if her crew were to be credited the leviathan was not the craft
to our mind but i had seen the captain and liked him he was an
uncommonly tall robust fine-looking man in the prime of life
there was a deep crimson spot in the middle of each sunburnt cheek
doubtless the effect of his sea-potations he was a vineyarder or
native of the island of martha's vineyard adjoining nantucket
and i would have sworn it a sailor and no tyrant

previous to this we had rather avoided the leviathan's men when they
came ashore but now we purposely threw ourselves in their way in
order to learn more of the vessel

we became acquainted with the third mate a prussian and an old
merchant-seaman a right jolly fellow with a face like a ruby we
took him to po-po's and gave him a dinner of baked pig and
breadfruit with pipes and tobacco for dessert the account he gave
us of the ship agreed with my own surmises a cosier old craft never
floated and the captain was the finest man in the world there was
plenty to eat too and at sea nothing to do but sit on the windlass
and sail the only bad trait about the vessel was this she had been
launched under some baleful star and so was a luckless ship in the
fishery she dropped her boats into the brine often enough and they
frequently got fast to the whales but lance and harpoon almost
invariably drew when darted by the men of the leviathan but what of
that we would have all the sport of chasing the monsters with none
of the detestable work which follows their capture so hurrah for
the coast of japan thither the ship was bound

a word now about the hard stories we heard the first time we visited
the ship they were nothing but idle fictions got up by the sailors
for the purpose of frightening us away so as to oblige the captain
who was in want of more hands to lie the longer in a pleasant
harbour

the next time the vineyarder came ashore we flung ourselves in his
path when informed of our desire to sail with him he wanted to know
our history and above all what countrymen we were we said that we
had left a whaler in tahiti some time previous and since then had
been in the most praiseworthy manner employed upon a plantation as
for our country sailors belong to no nation in particular we were
on this occasion both yankees upon this he looked decidedly
incredulous and freely told us that he verily believed we were both
from sydney

be it known here that american sea captains in the pacific are
mortally afraid of these sydney gentry who to tell the truth
wherever known are in excessively bad odour is there a mutiny on
board a ship in the south seas ten to one a sydney man is the
ringleader ashore these fellows are equally riotous

it was on this account that we were anxious to conceal the fact of our
having belonged to the julia though it annoyed me much thus to deny
the dashing little craft for the same reason also the doctor
fibbed about his birthplace

unfortunately one part of our raiment arfretee's blue frocks we
deemed a sort of collateral evidence against us for curiously
enough an american sailor is generally distinguished by his red
frock and an english tar by his blue one thus reversing the
national colours the circumstance was pointed out by the captain and
we quickly explained the anomaly but in vain he seemed
inveterately prejudiced against us and in particular eyed the
doctor most distrustfully

by way of propping the tatter's pretensions i was throwing out a hint
concerning kentucky as a land of tall men when our vine-yarder
turned away abruptly and desired to hear nothing more it was
evident that he took long ghost for an exceedingly problematical
character

perceiving this i resolved to see what a private interview would do
so one afternoon i found the captain smoking a pipe in the dwelling
of a portly old native one mai-mai who for a reasonable
compensation did the honours of partoowye to illustrious strangers

his guest had just risen from a sumptuous meal of baked pig and taro
pudding and the remnants of the repast were still visible two
reeking bottles also with their necks wrenched off lay upon the
mat all this was encouraging for after a good dinner one feels
affluent and amiable and peculiarly open to conviction so at all
events i found the noble vineyarder

i began by saying that i called for the purpose of setting him right
touching certain opinions of his concerning the place of my
nativity i was an american thank heaven and wanted to convince
him of the fact

after looking me in the eye for some time and by so doing revealing
an obvious unsteadiness in his own visual organs he begged me to
reach forth my arm i did so wondering what upon earth that useful
member had to do with the matter in hand

he placed his fingers upon my wrist and holding them there for a
moment sprang to his feet and with much enthusiasm pronounced me
a yankee every beat of my pulse

here mai-mai he cried another bottle and when it came with
one stroke of a knife he summarily beheaded it and commanded me to
drain it to the bottom he then told me that if i would come on board
his vessel the following morning i would find the ship's articles on
the cabin transom

this was getting along famously but what was to become of the
doctor

i forthwith made an adroit allusion to my long friend but it was
worse than useless the vineyarder swore he would have nothing to do
with him he my long friend was a bird from sydney and nothing
would make him the man of little faith believe otherwise

i could not help loving the free-hearted captain but indignant at
this most unaccountable prejudice against my comrade i abruptly took
leave

upon informing the doctor of the result of the interview he was
greatly amused and laughingly declared that the vineyarder must be a
penetrating fellow he then insisted upon my going to sea in the
ship since he well knew how anxious i was to leave as for himself
on second thoughts he was no sailor and although lands  men
very often compose part of a whaler's crew he did not quite relish
the idea of occupying a position so humble in short he had made up
his mind to tarry awhile in imeeo

i turned the matter over and at last decided upon quitting the
island the impulse urging me to sea once more and the prospect of
eventually reaching home were too much to be resisted especially as
the leviathan so comfortable a craft was now bound on her last
whaling cruise and in little more than a year's time would be
going round cape horn

i did not however covenant to remain in the vessel for the residue
of the voyage which would have been needlessly binding myself i
merely stipulated for the coming cruise leaving my subsequent
movements unrestrained for there was no knowing that i might not
change my mind and prefer journeying home by short and easy stages

the next day i paddled off to the ship signed and sealed and stepped
ashore with my advance fifteen spanish dollars tasseling the ends
of my neck-handkerchief

i forced half of the silver on long ghost and having little use for
the remainder would have given it to po-po as some small return for
his kindness but although he well knew the value of the coin not a
dollar would he accept

in three days time the prussian came to po-po's and told us that the
captain having made good the number of his crew by shipping several
islanders had determined upon sailing with the land breeze at dawn
the following morning these tidings were received in the afternoon
the doctor immediately disappeared returning soon after with a
couple of flasks of wine concealed in the folds of his frock through
the agency of the marquesan he had purchased them from an
understrapper of the court

i prevailed upon po-po to drink a parting shell and even little loo
actually looking conscious that one of her hopeless admirers was
about leaving partoowye for ever sipped a few drops from a folded
leaf as for the warm-hearted arfretee her grief was unbounded she
even besought me to spend my last night under her own palm-thatch
and then in the morning she would herself paddle me off to the
ship

but this i would not consent to and so as something to remember her
by she presented me with a roll of fine matting and another of
tappa these gifts placed in my hammock i afterward found very
agreeable in the warm latitudes to which we were bound nor did they
fail to awaken most grateful remembrances

about nightfall we broke away from this generous-hearted household
and hurried down to the water

it was a mad merry night among the sailors they had on tap a small
cask of wine procured in the same way as the doctor's flasks

an hour or two after midnight everything was noiseless but when the
first streak of the dawn showed itself over the mountains a sharp
voice hailed the forecastle and ordered the ship unmoored

the anchors came up cheerily the sails were soon set and with the
early breath of the tropical morning fresh and fragrant from the
hillsides we slowly glided down the bay and were swept through the
opening in the reef presently we hove to and the canoes came
alongside to take off the islanders who had accompanied us thus far
as he stepped over the side i shook the doctor long and heartily by
the hand i have never seen or heard of him since

crowding all sail we braced the yards square and the breeze
freshening bowled straight away from the land once more the
sailor's cradle rocked under me and i found myself rolling in my
gait

by noon the island had gone down in the horizon and all before us
was the wide pacific

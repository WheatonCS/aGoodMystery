addressed to parents
these volumes are intended for young
people from the age ten to fourteen
they complete the series early lessons
 an humble work from which no
literary fame can be acquired but which i
have been most desirous to complete from
the belief that it will be more useful than
any other in my power i have had another
motive for finishing it one which
though it may be no concern the public
 may be permitted to name harry and
lucy was begun by my father above fifty
vil 
years ago for the use his own family
and published at a time when no one 
any literary character excepting dr watts
and mrs barbauld had ever condescended
to write for children that little 
was i believe the very first attempt to
give any correct elementary knowledge or
taste for science in a narrative suited to
the comprehension children and calculated
to amuse and interest as well as
to instruct finding from experience that
it answered the intended purpose my father
continued the at intervals and in
the last part published in i had the
pleasure assisting him he then communicated
many ideas for the completion
 his plan which i thought too valuable
to be abandoned i considered that a full
knowledge his views and long habits
 acquaintance with his mode teaching
might enable me to do justice to his
 
plan though i was aware the difficulty
 combining ingenious with practicable
illustrations and still more sensible the
accuracy requisite for elementary instruction
the want his mind working along
with my own i knew must be in this attempt
peculiarly felt but i have been
encouraged to persevere by the assistance
afforded me by his and my own scientific
friends to name these kind and able
friends would gratify my vanity and might
ensure the confidence parents but it
would perhaps have more the appearance
 ostentation than candour and mightleave
others responsible for errors which
have escaped the most careful revisal
i have endeavoured to pursue in this
conclusion early lessons my father's
object in their commencement to exercise
the powers attention observation reasoning
and invention rather than to teach

any one science or to make any advance
beyond first principles the essential point
is to excite a thirst for knowledge without
which it is in vain to pour the full tide
even to the lips as dr johnson said to
boswell when he was describing the pains
his preceptors had taken to give him learning

sir anybody can bring a horse to the
water but who can make him drink
consistently with the sort instruction
to be conveyed it was impossible to give
as much the amusement arising from
incident and story in this as in some
others but the varying occurrences 
domestic life the frequent changes scene
and the different characters the children
with all their hopes and fears in the pursuit
 their own little schemes and experiments
will i hope produce sufficient
action to create interest and to keep awake

attention no pernicious stimulus has been
driven no deception or cajolery employed
to effect our purpose all attempts to cheat
children by the false promise that they
can obtain knowledge without labour are
vain and hurtful the gods sell everything
to labour and mortals young or
old must pay that price the wages 
industry should however be rendered ascertain
as possible for the pupils will exert
themselves in proportion to their hopes
that their efforts will be recompensed by the
pleasure success i have taken all the
precautions in my power to secure to each
effort attention its just reward
much that would be tiresome and insufferable
to young people if offered by
preceptors in a didactic tone weill be
eagerly accepted when suggested in conversation
especially in conversations bell

tween themselves in these there is always
a certain proportion nonsense an alloy
which is necessary to make sense work
well children can go on talking to one
another much longer than they can bear to
hear the address however wise or eloquent
 any grown person young people 
good disposition learn with peculiar ease
from each other because the young teacher
has not forgotten his own difficulties 
knowing exactly where they lay he sees
how to remove them or to assist another
over the obstacles the great preceptor
standing on the top the ladder learning
can hardly stretch his hand down to
the poor urchin at the bottom looking upto
him in despair but an intermediate
companion who is only a few steps above
can assist him with a helping hand can
show him where to put his foot safely 

and now urging now encouraging can
draw him up to any height within his own
attainment
the system mutual instruction can
be still more advantageously pursued in
teaching the rudiments science than
those literature and may be extended
even to higher branches intellectual
education upon this principle in the
following volumes the young brother is
employed to teach his sister what he has
learned either from his father or from
books
harry's abilities and knowledge will
perhaps appear a little above his age but
this the reader must excuse and attribute
as he pleases to education or to accident
or to natural genius harry will not be
disliked because he is not pedantic and
he has some redeeming faults and foibles
which save him from the odium attached

to a perfect character and from the danger
 being thought too good to be natural
lucy on the other hand may at times
seem too childish and volatile her respect
for accuracy not being at first much
greater than that the sailor who said
we'll not quarrel for a handful degrees
but these faults produce the nonsense
and the action necessary to relieve 
the reader's attention as to the danger
and the penalties her becoming an
affected scientific lady it is left to her
mother's and her own good sense and good
taste to guard against that evil all that
can be said or thought upon the subject by
the other sex is comprised in the edinburgh
wit's declaration 
 i do not care how blue a lady's stockings
may be if her petticoats are but long
enough
my father long ago foresaw what everypreface

body now feels that the taste for scientific
as well as literary knowledge which has
risen rapidly and has spread widely would
render it necessary to make some provision
for the early instruction youth in science
in addition to the oreat and successful
attention paid to classical literature in
public establishments alterations even
when felt to be requisite must for many
reasons be tardy much in the mean time
may be prepared by private instruction
it has been feared by some that the
general diffusion knowledge will tend
to damp the energy genius and that
original invention will decline in consequence
 increased cultivation this
might perhaps be the consequence injudicious
cultivation if the acquisition
 a great quantity learning all kinds
or any kind were made the sole and
ultimate object the mind would be opxvi

pressed and invention extinguished under
the mass but this there is no danger if
the faculties be proportionably exercised
and if the pupil be enabled to arrange
and above all to employ his knowledge
in science the hope future discoveries
and the ambition to invent are great natural
and neverfailing excitements to
young and old
that very ingenious and very mysterious
philosopher dr hooke speaks somewhere
in his works an algebraic formula by
which he could determine what things are
possible or impossible to perform or to
invent without perfectly crediting or
perfectly understanding this veiled prophet
we may hope and believe that the inventive
power may be assisted and improved by
exercise by reasoning and by judicious
experiments many admirable observations
on the nature and conduct the

understanding on the causes which have
prevented our advancement in knowledge
and on the habits false reasoning prepossessions
and prejudices which enslave
and disable our faculties are to be found
in the works bacon and hooke 
locke stewart and mayfair these observations
should not be suffered to lie
dormant in books the admiration only 
the learned nor should we be content with
merely citing them occasionally to adorn
our writings or to point our conversation
metaphysics after being too much in
fashion have been thrown aside too disdainfully
and their use and abuse have
been confounded surely it would be
doing good service to bring into popular
form all that metaphysicians have discovered
which can be applied to practice
in education this was early and long my
father's object the art teaching to inr
vent i dare not say but awakening
and assisting the inventive power by daily
exercise and excitement and by the application
 philosophic principles to trivial
occurrences he believed might be pursued
sith infinite advantage to the rising generation

i have now stated all the objects this
 how far they have been accomplished
must be left to time and parents
and above all to children to decide
maria edgeworth
mayest 
mamma do you recollect two years
ago when my father was explaining tous
the barometer and thermometer and
when he showed us several little experiments
said lucy and she sighed
yes my dear i remember that time
very well said her mother but why
do you sigh
 because i was very happy then said
lucy
and are not you happy now my
dear 
yes mamma but not so very happy
as i was then because now i do not goon
with harry as i used to do

how so i hope that you have not
had any quarrel with your brother
quarrel i oh no mamma it would
be impossible to quarrel with harry he
is so goodnatured and he is as fond 
me as ever i believe but yet i do not
know how it is we do not suit each other
quite so well as we did we are not so
much together i do not know all he is
doing nor go on with all he is thinking
 as i used to do
my dear lucy you and your brother
have been learning different things for
some time past and as you grow older
this must be your different employments
must separate you during a great part 
the day and so much the better you will
be the more glad to be together in your
hours amusement do not you find
this
yes i do mamma said lucy but 
and after this but she sighed again but
now we are not amused always in the
same way harry has grown so excessively
fond mechanics and all those
scientific things which he is always
learning from my uncle and papa
i thought lucy that you were fond 
those things too said her mother
so i am mamma only i am not
nearly so fond them as i was formerly 
i do not exactly know why but in the
first place i suppose because i do not
understand them now nearly so well as
harry does he has got very far before
me
true answered her mother you
have been learning other things which it
is more necessary for a girl to know
yes mamma i remember your saying
just after that happy barometer time
that i thought nothing but experiments 
papa said that must not be then i was
not allowed to go into his room with
harry in the mornings however i learned
more arithmetic and drawings and dancing
and music and work
and you grew fond these so much
the better said her mother this does
not make you less happy does it

no no mamma but then came the
time when harry and i sere quite separated
that long long ltng time
when you were ill mamma and when i
was at my aunt pierrepoint's while i was
with her i read nothing but stories and
poetry and i heard my aunt and people
who were there reading plays she used
to praise me for understanding wit and for
repeating poetry then i grew very fond
 them but harry is so grave always
about wit he never understands it at
first and at last he says is that all 
as to similes they always interrupt
him
thei interrupt him said her mother
 perhaps lucy sou interrupt him
sometimes perhaps i do mamma 
but he always finds out that similies are
not exact this is very provoking i
wonder why he is so much fonder exactness
than i am
probably because in science which
he has been learning he finds at every
step the use the necessity exactness
he could not go on without it in measuring
or in reasoningmamma
i understand the use exactness
in some things in drawing in
perspective and in proportion by a scale
as you taught me harry came to me the
other day and asked me to draw a cart
for him and i was glad to find that i
could help him in something
 and i dare say he will be glad to
help you in his turn you each know
different things which you can learn from
one another and in which you can be 
mutual assistance this is just as it should
be between friends
thank you mamma you make me
feel happy again i will ask harry to
bring me up to him in all he has been
learning as fast as possible that we may
go on together as we used to do if you
have no objection mamma
do so my dear lucy but i warn
you that you should not expect to go
fast you must be content to go slowly
and you must submit to be inferior to
your brother for some time this may
mortify you my dear but it cannot be
avoided you must bear it
every well mamma i can bear it but
mother said lucy hesitating a little
there is one other thing i want to say
before i can be quite happy
 say it then my dear what are you
afraid not me i hope
 oh no mamma not afraid you 
but i am not sure that the person who
said what i want to tell sou would like
that you should know that he said it
you can tell me what was said then
without telling me from whom you heard
it cannot you lucy 
ican and i will said lucy then
you must know mamma that one day
when i was at my aunt pierrepoint's she
was telling somebody that papa used to
teach me scientific things along with
harry but that since i had come to her
i had not learned any thing that sort
and now it comes mamma the gentleman
who is not to be named laughed
v
well there was no great harm in
that
no mamma only that he laughed ina
particular sort way scornfully and
he said that it was well for me i had left
off such learning that i should be a
much more agreeable woman without it
that ladies had nothing to do with science
or ought to have nothing to do with it
he said that scientific ladies are always
displaying what they know or what they
do not know those were his very words
he said that scientific ladies were his abhorrence
and he looked as if he abhorred
them terribly i was very sorry at the
time that he knew papa had taught meany
thing along with harry i was ashamed
and frightened and i thought it was all
wrong but now that i am come home
i think that it was all right for i see
how much papa likes that you should
know the scientific things that he is busy
about and how happy it makes you and
i want to go on again with harry only
i wish mamma that all people were 
the same opinions about this
her mother smiled and said that
can never be my dear lucy you will find
many people have different opinions upon
this subject but all will agree with your
nameless gentleman that when women
pretend to understand what they do not
whether about science or any thing else
they are absurd and ridiculous and if they
talk even what they understand merely
to display their knowledge they must be
troublesome and disagreeable therefore
they should take care not to do so they
should be particularly cautious talking
on scientific subjects because they seldom
obtain accurate knowledge they are
therefore likely to make mistakes and to
be either troublesome in asking questions
or ridiculous in showing ignorance and
conceit
that is said lucy if they set up
for being scientific ladies
yes if they do that they must take
the consequences they will be disliked
said her mother
but then mamma i am so much
afraid being abhorred even if they
are not conceited will they be abhorred
mamma 
not by persons sense my dear
said her mother as far as i can judge
i think that sensible men would be ready
to assist any unaffected unassuming woman
who really wished to inform herself
and would like her the better for being
interested in their conversation their writings
and their pursuits
i hope then mamma that i shall bean
unaffected unassuming woman
i hope so my dear child said her
mother if your father did not hope so
too he would never teach you any more
on these subjects
i should be very sorry for that said
lucy
yes i think you would my dear
for even with your little experience you
b 
feel that there is a real pleasure in going
on as you say with your brother
 that i do indeed mamma
ras you grow older continued her
mother you will perceive that by acquiring
knowledge women not only increase
their power being agreeable
companions to their fathers brothers
husbands or friends if they are so
happy as to be connected with sensible
men but they increase their own pleasure
in reading and hearing scientific experiments
and discoveries they acquire a
greater variety means employing
themselves independently and at home
but above all the acquisition knowledge
not only enlarges but elevates the
mind by filling it with admiration and
gratitude towards that bountiful providence
who has established such wise laws
for the welfare and preservation the
world
yes mother said lucy and after a
pause in which she reconsidered all her
mother had been saying she returned to
what still a little alarmed her imagination
but yet mamma i feel afraid being
abhorred and if the acquiring knowledge
should make me vain there is the
danger
there is the danger to be sure
said her mother but as far as i have
observed ignorant women are as vain
and often more so than those who are
well informed and now when almost
all are so educated that they have a
taste for literature and some acquaintance
with scientific subjects there is less danger
that any should be vain what is no peculiar
distinction
 oh mother i will take the greatest
care said lucy you shall see as i
grow up and thank you for explaining
this to me
perhaps my dear part what i
have been saying is rather above your
comprehension
no mamma not at all if it is not
conceited to say so i think i understand
it all perfectly well and now i know what
is right and wrong and my mind is settled 
and i am happy gain and very glad
that i may have the pleasure learning
again from papa and above all glad
that i may go on again with harry and
here he comes mamma i see him from
this window coming along the path from
my uncle's oh mamma he has a great
walking stick in his hand and he is hobbling
like an old man an hundred and
ten
 i hope he has not hurt himself
said her mother coming to the window

 no mamma i believe he is only in
play there the old man is running as
well as ever he did in his life and i will
run and meet him
as soon as lucy was near enough to
make her voice heard she asked her
brother why he walked with his uncle's
walking stick as she supposed it to be
it is not his said harry it is mine 
my uncle has given it to me
yours and it is quite new i never
saw it before how beautifully varnished 
and what a pretty head but why did my
uncle give it to you harry it would be
 use to him and it will be none to
you said tilly
there you are mistaken i beg your
pardon lucy it will be as much use
to me as it would be to him and the
same sort use said harry
 same sort use said lucy but
 what sort
guess said harry
i suppose you mean in play to act an
old man as you did just now 
no in earnest useful said harry
what can you do with it said lucy
for you are too young to walk with it
and too old to ride upon it
too old to be sure i am said
harry indignantly i have not ridden
upon a stick these hundred years guess
again
lucy now wanted to examine this wonderful
stick more closely in hopes discovering
what its merits might be but
harry seemed unwilling to let it out his
hands
oh i know what it is it is full 
money it is like the staff which the
man had in the trial in don quixote
which sancho panza found out was full 
money because he would not let it out 
his hands
i do not in the least know what you
mean said harry for there is no
money in this
then let me look at it i will not runaway
with it how heavy it is observed
lucy what wood can it be made
 this outside seems to be mahogany
but i never felt any so heavy it cannot
be all wood it must be hollow and there
must be something with inside it
stop stop do not shake it do not
turn it upside down you will spoil it
cried harry
ho ho then there is something withinside
 it i have found that much out
said lucy and you say do not turn
it upside down like the words on the box
 glass that came last week keep this
side uppermost so i guess that there is
glass within your stick you smile there
is glass then perhaps it is a spyglass
 a telescope a magnifying
glass a microscope no none 
these what can it be what use
can glass be in a walking stick harry
 a great deal as you will acknowledge
when you find it out guess again
said harry it is a thing that you have
seen
but i have seen so many things said
lucy
and which you know the use
said harry
but i know the use many things 
tell me a little more said lucy what
is it used for 
for weighing something said harry 
 stay i am not sure that it is quite fair
to say it is used for weighing a thing and
yet it is something
 i know now said lucy that motion
you made with your hand up and
down against the air told me the something
that it is used for weighing is air
and it is a barometer
now you have found it out said
harry
and now i know what makes your
stick so heavy said lucy the quicksilver
 the mercury i remember feeling
the weight mercury when papa put
into my hands two cups the same
size one full water and the other full 
mercury how stupid i was not to think
 this at first and not to guess it was a
barometer 
harry now showed where his walking
stick opened and he showed her withinside
 it a barometer and thermometer 
he explained to her how the quicksilver
was screwed up tight so as to prevent it
from shaking he told her this was called
a portable barometer
yes it is portable said lucy it
can easily be carried from place to place
it must be convenient to travellers but
is it in any other way better than the barometer
which hangs up in papa's room or
than that which stands upon three legs in
my uncle's library
harry said that he was not sure that it
was better for common use to show the
changes the weather but this said
he is not merely a weatherglass as barometers
are sometimes called this is
intended for another purpose
what other purpose said lucy
 first let me tell you why my uncle
gave it to me said harry becatr
he was pleased with my having taken pains
two years ago to understand the barometer
and with my remembering it now
then he bid me try to find out the particular
use this portable barometer
 and did you harry
 yes but i was helped my father
who was present put me in the right
road i was very stupid at first my
head went quite off the wrong way but
my father was very patient and brought
it back again and set it upon the right
road still i was very slow my uncle
thought i should never find it out he
said it was too difficult and that my father
had better tell rne but papa said
he was almost sure that i should find it
out myself this encouraged me and i
tried and thought again and my uncle
left off walking up and down the room
fretting he was so good as to be patient
too
 that was kind him said lucy 
i know it is very difficult to be patient
with people if they are slow in
finding a thing out when one knows it
all the time one longs to tell or to
push them on to it
papa did not push me said harry
that would have thrown me down but
he pulled he helped me on gently step
by step as he does so nicely and he let
me find it out at last quite by myself
well then you can do the same forme
harry
i will try said harry
 thank you but first let me tell you
all that i have been saying to mamma and
all that mamma has said to me
she repeated it all as well as she could
ending with mamma tells me that i
may go on with you harry as we used
to do and she said she thought that
you would be so kind as to bring me upto
you in all you have been learning
i will try said harry
i hope i shall not be very stupid
said lucy
no no lucy dare say you will
not do not begin by thinking you will
that is a very bad way because then
you go on thinking you are afraid you
will be stupid instead attending to
what is asked and said to you now
lucy suppose you were at the bottom
 a deep well
if i were at the bottom a well
then i should find out the truth because
you know the common proverb as mr
cranbourne said that truth is at the bottom
 a well
nonsense my dear lucy cried harry
now if you go to your wit and what
mr cranbourne says i cannot attempt
to talk to you about the barometer
well i will be very attentive said
lucy suppose then i was at the
bottom a well but should not i be
drowned added she in a low voice
very true i should not have said the
bottom a well but the bottom a deep
pit said harry
oh that is another affair said lucy
i like that better now then i am at
the bottom a deep pit
now then which do you think would
weigh the heaviest the air at the bottom
 this pit or the air at the top a high
house
i think it would weigh heaviest at
the bottom the pit said lucy
why asked harry
oh my dear such an easy question
said lucy
well answer it at any rate said
harry
 because in the bottom the pit
the air in the pit is added to the air that
is above the pit and also you must add
all the air that reaches to the top the
house
 i believe you understand it suppose
you took this barometer to the bottom 
the pit do you think that the mercury
would rise or fall my dear lucy pray
think before you answer
lucy thought and answered i think
it would rise at the bottom the pit
 right now if you took it to the top
 a high house would it rise or fall
i think it would fall replied lucy
why said harry
because then there would be less
weight pressing upon the quicksilver in
the cup and therefore less quicksilver
would be pressed up into the tube
very well indeed lucy i see you
remember all papa taught us about the
barometer now suppose the pit was
sixty feet deep and that the house was
forty feet high forty and sixty make a
hundred you know
to be sure said lucy well 
well said harry i must go
slowly suppose that you observe exactly
how much the quicksilver falls when you
take it from the bottom the pit to the
top the house you would have a measure
by which you could judge the
whole height and depth
i see i should said lucy i see i
i see the use your barometer and it is
very useful
but you do not see all yet said
harry by marking this you would not
only know how much the quicksilver falls
in that hundred feet but by dividing it
and making a scale you might know the
same thing afterwards in any number 
feet in any height to which you might
take the barometer and by this you
would have an easy way measuring
the height mountains
very ingenious very convenient 
said lucy now i understand the use
 your portable barometer perfectly
not perfectly said harry there
is a great deal more to be learned about
heat at different heights and rarefaction
 the air but i will not puzzle you
with that especially as i am not clear
about it yet myself but this is the
general notion which papa says is quit
enough at first
quite enough for me said lucy
thank you harry for telling me no
more
i wish oh how i wish cried
harry that we had a mountain to measure
with my portable barometer 
but said lucy a mountain w
not come to you for wishing for it anymore
than to mahomet
mahomet repeated harry what
do you mean
do not you know harry the common
saying since the mountain will
not come to mahomet mahomet must
go to the mountain you were by
harry when i read this in our universal
history to mamma do not you remember
it
no i forget it how much better
you lucy remember some sorts things
than i do
and how much worse i understand
other sorts things than you do therefore
as mamma says we can help one
another and then in time we shall know
twice as much between us my dear
harry how convenient that will be and
how happy we shall be
very happy but we cannot be always
together said harry so we must
learn to remember what we want for ourselves
or it will be rather inconvenient
when we are separate
we shall not be separated for a great
while said lucy papa said yesterday
to mamma i heard him that you are not
to go to school yet
 i am very glad that said harry
for i shall be so happy going on at home
learning from my father and with you
lucy but my dear to go back to mahomet
for i do not like to let that go
without in the least understanding what
it means
never mind only a bit wit said
lucy
 but cannot you explain it to me
said harry
no it is so easy that if you do not
see it at first i cannot make it plainer
said lucy
do try said harry
it means only that mahomet was
foolish for commanding the mountain ina
braggadocio way to come to him and
when all the people standing by expected
perhaps that the mountain should obey
him and come at his bidding and when
it did not stir he came off in a shabby
way by saying that since the mountain
did not come to him he must go to the
mountain
ais that all said harry but you
told me it was a common saying
yes afterwards it came to be a com
vol i c
mon saying whenever a person proposes
something which seems fine and grand
and which they cannot really do and
when they come off with doing something
common and easy then comes the
saying about mahomet and the mountain

thank you said harry in a tone as
if he had said thank you for nothing
but still i do not understand how this
applied to my wishing for a mountain to
measure with my portable barometer
oh my dear harry do not be so
grave about it said lucy
i only look grave because i am trying
to understand said harry how the
story applied
i suppose it did not apply as you
call it said lucy after considering for a
few moments but do not let us talk
any more it
only tell me how it came into your
head said harry
i cannot tell said lucy when you
said something about wishing the mountain
would come to you 
no no interrupted harry that
was not what i said exactly
well never mind exactly about such
a thing as this my dear harry said
lucy i only know that whatever it was
that you said the sound the words
about mountain brought the mountain
and mahomet into my head
the sound the words said harry 
so after all the words only came
jingling into your head from the sound
and had nothing to do with the business 
and i have been all this while trying to
make sense nonsense
i told you it was nonsense at first
said lucy
you told me it was wit said harry
well my dear if one tries to explain
wit it often turns into nonsense
 then what great good is there in
wit 
if you understand it at first it is very
diverting that is good said lucy
c
but if i cannot understand it at first
said harry
why then i cannot help it said
lucy
 that is rather provoking said harry
 more provoking for me said lucy
this time i have been trying and trying
to explain but in explaining the wit
is lost the pleasure at least is all gone
but that was not my fault said
harry
yes but it was my dear for not
understanding it at first
that is the same thing you said before
my dear lucy
because it is the truth my dear and
i have nothing else to say harry
and i have only to make the same
answer i made before lucy that if i
cannot understand it i cannot
and i come round again to i cannot
help it harry 
that is arguing in a circle as papa
says observed harry
i do not know what is meant by
arguing in a circle said lucy suppose
it is something in euclid
no my dear euclid never argues ina
circle he only argues about a circle or
circles
 and about said lucy oh let
us say no more about it i hate saying
so much about one thing
i like to stick to one thing till i understand
it said harry
but when you can't said lucy 
you really are so slow harry about
wit
perhaps i am a little slow said
harry but recollect lucy that you
acknowledged yourself at last that the
story did not apply so how could i understand
it
well i acknowledge said lucy 
 but that excuse will do only for this
once
i dare say i shall find another next
time said harry but now look
lucy at those two men carrying that
long ladder across the lawn what are
they going to do with it i want to know 
they were going to carry it to a church
in the village the steeple which wanted
some repair his father followed the men
and harry asked if lucy and he might
go with him his father gave him leave
and harry carried his portable barometer
with him saying that he thought he could
try it at the top the church
in the church there were stairs which
led up to the gallery but there was noway
 going up to the top the tower
but by means a ladder the men
fixed it steadily and harry's father went
up harry wanted to follow but his father
said he must not come yet because he
had not time to think him till their
business was finished
 my dear harry said lucy i think
it is very dangerous you will never be
able to go to such a height i am almost
afraid to look at papa going up it makes
my head giddy
and when his father called him she
held the flap his coat and said indeed
harry you had better give it up
 give it up no that he would not
he began to run up the ladder with
he barometer in his hand but his father
called to him and bid him stop and ordered
him to give the barometer to one
 the masons who was behind him whom
he requested to carry it for him and to
follow him up the ladder
oh papa i am used you know to
mounting ladders and i am safe without
any body to take care rae
do as you are desired or you shall
not come up at all said his father
harry obeyed and when he got high
up on the ladder he felt that his father
was right for though he had been used
to go up ladders he had never gone up
one that was nearly so high he felt an
unusual sensation giddiness in his head
he was glad the man was close behind
him he held fast to the sides the ladder
stepped up very carefully and seized
his father's hand who was waiting for
him at the top when landed safely on
the roof the tower he looked about
him when he looked down his head still
felt a little giddy and it was some moments
before he recovered himself sufficiently
to think even his portable barometer
then he recollected that in his
hurry to come up he had forgotten to mark
how high the mercury stood when he was
on the ground he did not like the
thoughts immediately going down the
ladder again it occurred to him that it
would do exactly as well to mark the
height at which the quicksilver now stood
at the top the tower and afterwards to
see how much it would rise when he got
to the bottom but lucy had his pencil
and paper below he wrote the figures
on a bit slate which one the men had
in his hand after being a little used toit
he grew quite at ease at this height
and could think as well as when on the
firm ground when he was to go down
the ladder he was a little startled by hearing
lucy cry out oh harry take

care
his father stopped him told lucy she
was very foolish to call out desired her
to go into the church and wait there till
they should come which she did and
very glad she was when she saw harry
and her father come down safely
upon examining the bit slate on
which he had written his figures and
which he had put into his bosom while
he came down the ladder he found that
they were so rubbed that it was impossible
to make them out
lucy who was afraid his going up
again was by turns sure that one figure
was an eight a nine or a nought
this would not do for harry he must
go up again his father said he was
right and this time he wrote down what
the barometer was before he went up and
carried paper and pencil with him his
father was so good as to accompany him
it was all done rightly and this time lucy
did not say a word till harry's foot was
c 
off the last rung the ladder and safe on
the ground
now they knew exactly how much the
quicksilver had fallen in going up to the
top the tower and at what it had stood
at the bottom harry said that this must
be compared with a table measures
which he had at home which would tell
the height in feet and inches
and here be it noted that on this
and many other occasions lucy's readiness
in arithmetic was use to her brother
when he came to his calculations the
habit writing her figures exactly underneath
each other in the right rows and
 drawing straight lines and making neat
little figures all proved advantage when
she was called upon to write down totals
for him in a great hurry or to go over
and copy clearly his scrawled sums in
addition multiplication subtraction and
division
on the present occasion difficulties occurred
and lucy sat beside harry for a
quarter an hour writing down and rubbing
out figures upon a slate and complying
by turns with contrary orders
lucy my dear write down and
subtract it from have you done it
stay a bit presently yes
my dear i meant to say add did 
say subtract no add add
swell i have added
now multiply that by no stay 
first it must be divided stop i do not
understand this table there is something
about height above the level the sea
here that i cannot make out then what
is this about expansion continued he
reading oh my dear lucy we are
all wrong i do not know how to allow
for the thermometer and here is a calculation
about expansion and proportion
and heaven knows what oh it is all
wrongs i do not know what i am about
this lucy had suspected but she had
the good nature not to say so and as
all she had done was right she found it
easy to be patient harry ran to look
for the article ore barometer no barometer
portable in a cyclopedia but
there opened to harry's eyes such a quarto
scene tables and fractions and algebraic
signs as quite dismayed hiniand
lucy stood in stupefied silence beside him
at length he observed
there is a great difference between
having a general notion any thing and
knovsing it thoroughly i thought i understood
the use this barometer perfectly
but when i come to try i cannot make it
out well
it is too difficult said lucy you
will only puzzle yourself she offered
to shut the 
no no will try and puzzle it out
and when papa comes in he will help
me and show me my mistake
when his father came in he did help
harry and with his assistance and patience
it was all made clear
but after all said lucy though
you have found out the height the
church it was a difficult way doing
it with all these calculations would not
it have been easier to have measured it
by letting down from the top a string and
a freight a plumb line as it is called i believes
then you could have measured the
string and you would have had no difficulty

very true said harry that would
have been the easiest way in this instance
because we could get to the top the
church at once and let down a plumb
line but consider lucy when we want to
measure high crooked mountains miles
high with ins and outs and ups and
downs how difficult that would be besides
this puzzle with the portable barometer
would not plague me again it was
only because it was my first time trial 
and i am glad that we have conquered
the difficulty
it is very good you to say we for
i did nothing but write down the figures
and do the sums said lucy
but that helped me very much and
thank you for doing it so patiently you
did not yawn above six times and now
my dear lucy if we had but a mountain
to measure 
 how happy we should be going to
the top it together at any rate said
lucy
lccy your hair is hanging into your
eyes this morning said her mother
yes mother said lucy because
it is quite out curl
 did you curl it last night lucy 
said her mother
yes mamma i did indeed and it
curled very nicely this morning early 
but i went out in hopes meeting my
uncle who was to have come to breakfast
 and by the time that i came in
again my hair was all as you see the
breakfast bell rang and i had not time to
curl it again
her mother was satisfied since lucy
had not neglected to curl it at night
which had sometimes been the case her
father asked if she knew what had uncurled
her hair when she went out
 the damp the morning papa
said she my hair always goes out 
curl in damp weather
so does mine lucy said her mother
 it is not peculiar to your hair to
go out curl in damp weather
 but lucy what do you mean by your
hair going out curl said her father
just what you see papa that it hangs
straight
 you told me the moisture the morning
uncurled it do you know how or why
it does so said her father
no papa not in the least i wish
you would tell me
 when your hair is curled the parts
 one side each hair are pressed close
together and the parts on the other side
are stretched out give me that piece 
packthread
it was loosely twisted he coiled up
a bit it and showed her that in the
inner circle the parts are pressed together
and in the outer they are stretched
now i see said lucy and you
mean that it is just the same with my
hair when i curl it but still i do not
understand how the damp straightens it
that you shall see directly said her
father and he dipped the curled packthread
into a cup water when it was
all wet it became straight
yes it has uncurled like my hair
said lucy but how 
look and you will see that the water
has filled all the interstices or vacancies
which you observed between the different
parts the cord now there are in your
hair and in all hair pores or small vacancies
which can be filled with moisture
like the interstices in this packthread and
which imbibe moisture from the air as
this packthread imbibed the water and
you see it filled the pores on the inside
as well as on the outside
thank you papa said lucy that
is very nice to know why my hair uncurls
is at least a comfort now i understand
it all
not all said her father there is
a property hair which you do not yet
know that when it is wet that is when
its pores are filled with moisture 
 i see papa you mean it swells out
and becomes thicker like this cord
not exactly like that cord lucy that
cord shortens as it swells out in breadth 
but hair lengthens when it is moist all
human hair is easily affected by moisture
very easily indeed said lucy dividing
her uncurled locks on her forehead
and trying to put them out her way
i was not in the damp above ten minutes
and yet you see how straight my
hair has become indeed papa as you
say human hair is very easily affected by
moisture
yes fortunately said harry
fortunately repeated lucy unfortunately
you mean why do you say
fortunately 
i have a reason and a good one
said harry it is fortunate that hair has
that property for one reason for one
purpose useful to all men and women but
especially to men science
fortunate and useful said lucy
brother how can it possibly be fortunate
or useful to you or to men 
science in particular or to any body that
my hair should so easily go out curl in
damp weather
not your hair in particular lucy
but hair in general said harry
what use said lucy if everybody's
hair in the whole world was to
go out curl like this every damp day 
what use could it be but to make them all
look very deplorable as mamma says i
do when my hair is in this condition
what good would this do to men 
science or any men
 you do not understand me said
harry smiling did you never hear 
an hygrometer
hygrometer said lucy eyes i
have often heard an hygrometer i
heard papa talking to you about hygrometers
very lately and reading a great deal
last wednesday no last thursday
 no matter my dear interrupted her
father what day you heard me reading
about it do you know or do you not
know what an hygrometer is
lucy confessed she did not know
exactly what it was but she thought it
had something to do with a barometer
and a thermometer because it ends in
meter and she remembered long ago
her father had told her that meter meant
measure and comes from some greek
word that means to measure therefore
she supposed an hygrometer must be a
machine or an instrument for measuring
something but what she did not know 
she guessed it was something about the
air
her father said that she was so far
right in thinking that it is an instrument
used to measure something he told her
that it measures moisture in the air and
that the name hygrometer is composed 
two greek words hugros moist or moisture
and matron measure
lucy liked this name which contains
as she observed the history the thing 
and now she knew this she thought she
could never forget it
their uncle had not yet come in to
breakfast and their father beginning to
read the newspaper to their mother
harry and lucy went on at the farther
 the room talking to each other
now you can guess said harry
why i said that it was very lucky that
your hair uncurls so easily in the damp
you observed yourself that you could
always know by your hair whether it is
a damp day or not whether air is moist
or not
so hair is an hygrometer said lucy
 for it measures moisture i am sure my
hair might say if it could speak greek
hygrometer or in plain english inoist
i measures
very true said harry but still
you do not know the measure exactly 
how moist how damp the day may be 
do you 
yes on very very damp days my
hair comes quite out curl as you see
it now said lucy and hangs quite
straight but it only comes a little out
 curl on days that are only a little damp
or dampwish
a little damp dampish repeated
harry that is very well for
common talking but it does not describe
exactly how damp i do not know what
degree moisture you mean to express
by dampi
pish echoed lucy harry would
not smile
you have not yet told me lucy
said he gravely how the hygrometer
is made to show the measure moisture
exactly
i do not know exactly brother but
suppose for instance you knew how long
my hair is when it is quite dry then in
damp weather when it is moist and hangs
straight you could measure how long it
has grown i mean how much it has
lengthened by the damp
i could measure said harry but
how 
you could see whether my hair comes
down as far as to my eyebrows or only
this far or this far said lucy touching
different points on her forehead if i
had a lookingglass i would measure this
for myself
this might do said harry but at
best it would do only for yourself and
but badly for yourself because you must
to mark your points have disagreeable
spots on your forehead always
 should not like that said lucy
nor would mamma i am sure
besides continued harry it
would be rather inconvenient to me to
run in search you with a pair 
compasses and my ruler to measure your
hair and your scale on your forehead
this would be rather an inconvenient
hygrometer
rather i acknowledge said lucy
you would twitch all the hair off my
head too in measuring each hair i suppose
 and i should be afraid that you
would put out my eyes with the points
 your compasses when you came to
measure the scale on my forehead i
should not like to be your hygrometer
i would much rather have one that
would always stand or hang in my room
said harry or one that i could carry
about in my pocket better still could
you manage that for me could you
find out how to do that i found out
how to do it
did you indeed brother and do you
think i can
yes if you think well and if you
go on thinking said harry
 i will then but tell me exactly what
i am to think about and what is to be
done said lucy
harry pulled a hair out his own
head and laid it on a piece white
paper before her there said he
stretching it out you see its length we
will suppose this hair is as dry as it can
be now i will dip it into this bason 
water now that it has been wet it is
longer than it was when it was dry
yes but we want to know how much
longer said lucy well it is easy to
lay it on this sheet paper and measure
as exactly as you please how much
longer it is when it is wet than it was
when it was quite dry
very well said harry and i can
tell you that you would find it to be one
fortieth its length longer then you
have the utmost lenoth between extreme
moisture and extreme dryness
and continued lucy i could
divide this line on the paper between the
two black dots by which you marked the
points to which it stretched when it was
dry and when it was damp and if divided
exactly it would be what you calla
scale you could measure how much
in different degrees damp or dry it
stretches or shortens
very well indeed said harry and
the scale on paper would be better than on
your forehead you see that's one point
fixed
that's one point gained said lucy
now what is to be done next
next you are to find out how without
the trouble continually plucking
hairs out my head or yours and wetting
or drying and measuring them you might
know every day or hour or at any time
you please how damp the air is or how
much moisture it contains
 if i could but make the hair measure
itself said lucy and mark or show
how far it shrinks or lengthens on this
paper in any time
aye if you could said harry that
is the question
suppose i had a very very very little
weight said lucy so little that this
hair could support it without breaking
then i could tie it to one the hair
and hang the hair by the other to
something suppose a piece wire stuck
into the wall and i would put this paper
vol d
with our scale upon it against the wall
just behind the weight and when you look
at it you would see how much the hair
had shrunk or lengthened at any time in
damp or dry
there papa cried harry lucy
has made out as far as i did the first
time i thought making an hygrometer 
lucy looked much pleased with herself
and with her brother for being pleased with
her
and have i really invented an hygrometer
harry cried she
yes but not a perfect one my dear
said harry there is a great deal more
to be done
what more said lucy 
to come to breakfast in the first place
said her father
this lucy was ready to do for she was
a little tired but by the time she had
refreshed herself by eating half her breakfast
she returned to the question 
what more is to be done brother about
the hygrometer 
to make it more convenient said
harry in your way it must always be
stuck up against a wall and besides
your divisions are so very very small
that you can hardly see how much the
hair lengthens or shortens
you might take a magnifying glass
said lucy
well that would help but cannot
you think another way 
lucy thought for a little while and went
on eating her breakfast and presently answered
 no brother i can think only
 taking a larger magnifying glass a glass
that magnifies more will that do
still there is an easier method put
the magnifying glass out your head
it must be a more difficult instead 
an easier way for i cannot find it out
said lucy
but it is easier i assure you when
you have found it out said harry
come i will help you a little continued
he after she had considered for
some time look at the hand that
d 
 
clock and he pointed to the dialplate 
a pendule which was on the chimneypiece
opposite to the breakfasttable
look the hand now points at ten do
you see how far it is from ten to eleven 
suppose that hand was to move frol
ten to eleven 
well suppose said lucy i can
easily suppose this
 then which would have moved the
farthest which would have gone over the
most space the point the hand which
is at the outside the dialplate or that
part the hand which is closest to the
centre 
the point the hand which is at the
outermost part the circle would have
gone the farthest i mean would have
moved over the most space the part
nearest to the centre would have moved
so little that i suppose i should hardly
be able to see or measure by my eye how
much
 true said harry you could not
but you could see and you could measure
the space from ten to eleven easily could
not you
certainly said lucy
you could guess the measure even by
your eye without taking compasses or
magnifying glass said harry
 now i see what you are about said
lucy i must have a little beetle hand
and dial plate for my hygrometer to
show and to measure the least motion 
the hair in shortening or lengthening
right said harry so far right
do not tell me any more said lucy 
i can do it all for myself now and in a
minute
do not be in such a hurry my dear
said harry or you will never do it
hurry i am not in the least hurry
said lucy only i like to be quick
well i would fasten the the hair to
the axle so as to make every the smallest
motion the hair move the hand
she paused she was not quite clear
 the manner in which this was to be
done
i will help you said harry suppose
 
suppose said his mother that you
were to let lucy finish her breakfast
i will and welcome said harry 
for now she has the principle an hygrometer
which papa was explaining tome
the other day and which i will
show her a plate after breakfast
plate said lucy i may as well
have the plate at breakfast may not i 
by a plate i mean an engraving
said harry did not you know that 
oh yes to be sure said lucy 
i was only in play
breakfast finished harry went to the
library to look for the and lucy
followed eager to see the drawing and
description what she had been trying
to invent he showed her in trees's cyclopedia
two engravings different hygrometers

this said he pointing to one was
invented by a great english engineer 
the name smeaton and this other by
monsieur de saussure the famous swiss
traveller yours lucy my dear is not
exactly either these it is most like
smeaton's but he uses a cord with a
weight hung to it instead a hair it
is said however that a hair is better thana
cord for our purpose
and how does the other man m de
saussure manage with the hair said
lucy
harry pointed to the engraving and
showed her that one the hair is
fastened as she had proposed to the axle
 the hand and the hair wound round
the axle but the other instead 
having a weight hung to it is strained
tight and fastened to a frame wood
below then when the hair shortens or
lengthens with dryness oi moisture it
turns the axle the hand a lite or much
according to the shortening the hair
turns the axle the hand repeated
lucy i see it would turn when the
hair shortens because that would pull it
round but i do not see how when the
hair lengthens that it would turn back the
axle and the hand i think that the hair
would only loosen round the axle
true lucy and accurate cried harry
with pleasure in his eyes but look
again at this engraving see here a weight
hanging to this little cord which is wound
round the axle in a contrary direction to
the hair the weight is just enough to
keep the hair constantly strained so as to
prevent it from loosening as you rightly
said it would round the axle if there was
not any thing to prevent it when the hair
lengthens from moisture then as it
is kept stretched it turns the axle and
hand
yes now i see no difficulty said
lucy i understand it quite and i am
glad i told you the difficulty for you
have cleared it away i hate to feel that
i have only half understood and to leave
off in a puzzle but harry here are
prints a great many more hygrometers
yes made different substances
said harry many things beside hair
you know can be used to show the
changes moisture and dryness all
things which show these easily some 
them we have observed ourselves often
oh yes said lucy salt and sugar
for instance and some kinds wood
which warp with the changes the weather
from wet to dry the wood this
window frame i remember was swelled
so much during the rain last week that
we could not open the sash
yes that sash is made deal the
wood fir tree you know said harry
and this sort wood shrinks and expands
quickly with dryness and moisture
i recollect interrupted lucy i
read something about a creeping wooden
hygrometer in the notes to the botanic
garden my dear i remember it perfectly
because it was entertaining there was a
wooden automaton a machine that moved
 itself
i know no such machine inter

rusted harry if it moved it must have
been moved by some cause
 well the damp i suppose was the
cause now let me go on harry it was
a wooden automaton with a long back
and four feet with ironpointed shoes
which clawed on little by little so that it
walked or crept or clawed quite across
the floor its master's room in a month's
time from the changes damp and dry
i do not know how but it was very entertaining
and it will entertain me now much
more if you can show me how it was contrived
there was i remember something
about pflueino the bits wood that
made the back i do not rightly know
how said lucy crossways
crossgrain i suppose you mean
said harry we will look for it by and
by and i will try if i can understand and
explain it to you but now go on and
guess some other substances which hygrometers
are made
 i do not recollect any more help mea
little said lucy
harry pointed to his mother's harp
i see mamma's harp said lucy but
that only puts me in mind the last tune
she played
do not you recollect that a string
broke yesterday
yes i do and how troublesome it
was said lucy i remember that
mrs 
 stay now do not go to mrs anybody
but think the cause that string
breaking
mamma said that it was cracked bv
the sudden change the weather
what change 
 from dry to damp i believe said
lucy oh now i understand it and i
know what you mean in damp weather
the moisture from the air gets into the
strings and swells them out and so shortens
them that if they are held tight at each
 they crack those strings are made
 catgut catgut then would be a good
thing for an hygrometer
yes said harry but now i will
tell you another thing used for hygrometers
which i do not think you could guess
ivory
ivory no i never should have thought
 that said lucy i never knew that
ivory lengthens and shortens in damp or
dry weather
 it does though said harry there
are a great many pores in ivory we cannot
see them without a magnifying glass but
the moisture gets into these pores and
swells it out but now lucy there is another
common thing which you see everyday
which you might guess when you
dip it in water you may see its great pores
swelling without any magnifying glass
and then when you squeeze the water out
and dry it it shrinks so that you could
hold in your shut hand what when full
 water was as large as my head
a spunge a spunge cried lucy
but if a spunge is left in a room by
itself would it suck up water from the
air
yes whether it is left in a room by
itself or not said harry it will absorb
do not say suck up moisture from the air 
and it grows heavier when it is filling
moisture or lighter as it dries the
spunge hygrometer is measured or measures
by weight not by lengthening or
shortening expanding or contracting
you do not look as if you understand
this lucy
i do said lucy but i am growing
tired i think i have had enough
about hygrometers
no no you cannot be tired so soon 
 guess once more said harry you
may easily guess this because it is a thing
used in your dress
lucy had observed she said that her
gloves often grew damp in wet weather
she guessed leather it was not what
harry meant but he said that he thought
leather would do and he did not know
why it had not been used perhaps as it
takes in moisture so easily it may not expand
or contract equally
encouraged by harry's approbation 
her good guess leather lucy was willing
to try and guess again but help mes
said she
harry told her that the thing he meant
is stiff and yet not so stiff but that it can
be bent it is springy and elastic
she thought several things which can
be bent but she could not guess right
and then yawning and stretching herself
she repeated that she was tired and that
she could not guess any more harry
must tell her
then i will tell you whalebone my
dear come have done yawning said
harry i will not make you guess anymore
 now i will show you something
entertaining i will show you a nice little
hygrometer made an arabian oats
beard
show it me said lucy stopping in
the midst a full stretch
 here in this print said harry
only a print i thought you had the
real beard said lucy
you might make an hygrometer yourself
i dare say a common english oat
beard said harry
well that i should like said lucy 
you were right after all harry when
you said it was lucky that my hair uncurled
so easily how odd it is harry
that i have been carrying all my life on
my head without ever thinking it till
this morning one the best hygrometers
 my having an hygrometer without
knowing it is like the man who talked
prose all his life without knowing it
i do not know what man you mean
said harry come now look at it this
arabian oat hygrometer lucy it is the
great doctor hook's
 i do not care about the great doctor
hook said lucy but let me tell you
about the man who talked prose without
knowing it he was a man in a play a
very entertaining play papa was reading
one evening when you were not listening
there was a maidservant teachings her
old master his letters and asking him
what he does when he says the letter u
now you shall be the old man and i
will be the maid and i will teach you
say u
nonsense my dear said harry
not at all nonsense said lucy 
you may ask papa
well but i have not time now said
harry
and the maid taught him to fence
continued lucy if i had but a stick i
would show you
now your head is gone quite off to
the play i shall have no more good 
you said harry looking mournfully
but here comes my uncle continued
he as his uncle at this moment entered
the room uncle will you look at this
hygrometer for me
i will harry with pleasure said his
obliging uncle
and so will i harry said lucy to
oblige you my head is come back from
the play now
for about three minutes she was attentive
and she understood and admired to
harry's hearts content the arabian oat
hygrometer
then now lucy i will show you a
much better cried harry one which is
made a kind indian grass which grass
is extremely sensible
extremely sensible grass interrupted
lucy laughing uncle i never heard
 extremely sensible grass before did
you
i think iou are not extremely sensible
now my little niece said her uncle to
begin punning instead minding what
your brother is telling you surely you
know that sensible means sensitive that is
having quick or great sensibility you
know these words are applied to plants
for you have heard the sensitive plant
oh yes to be sure uncle said
lucy i was only playing i know the
two meanings the word sensible as well
as any body and i have not only heard
 the sensitive plant but seen it at aunt
pierrepoint's and not only seen it and
its leaves closing up and shrinking back
from my touch but what is more uncle i
have learned by heart dr darwin's lines on
the sensitive plant the mimosa
she repeated them and her uncle said
that they were pretty lines and that she
repeated them well
and would not they make a good
motto for an hygrometer uncle said
she
 very good said her uncle 
and now resumed harry let me
show you this hygrometer
one other motto my dear uncle i
have thought for the barometer continued
lucy without considering how
much she was trying her brother's patience
she went on repeating while she
held her uncle by the flap his coat
you charmed indulgent sylphs their learned toil
and crown'd with fame your torricel and boyle
a torricel cried harry i suppose
you mean torricelli
 no it is torricel in the lines i assure
you said lucy
 it is torricelli out the lines i assure
you said harry there never was
such a man as torricel was there uncle
their uncle whispered to lucy that
harry was right
well never miid it must be torricel
here for the sake the line said lucy
else it would be too long let me oro
on i will tell you what the indulgent
sylphs taught these people she went
on repeating
 beautiful lines lucy said her uncle 
but i am sure you cannot understand
them as you are not yet acquainted with
the air pump
but harry is said lucy and he will
explain it to me will not you harry
harry looked very serious sighed and
said nothing
why do you sigh harry
because said her uncle he is afraid
that he shall never be able to make you
understand the air pump or any thing
else if you are not more attentive
harry i beg your pardon said lucy
but you know i was very attentive at
first
and will be very attentive at last i
hope said her uncle come we will
both be serious added he sitting down
at the table and drawing lucy towards
him he seated her on half his chair put
one arm round her and leaned his other
on the table in an attitude attention
now harry explain your hygrometer
and spare the remains that poor pen
but lucy looks tired said harry
have you a mind to see the hygrometer
or not 
i have a little mind said lucy that
is i have a great mind to please you
brother only we need not go through
them all said she as he placed the plates
before her
no do not be frightened said harry 
i am not going to show them all to you 
i am going to show you only the very
best
stay said his uncle putting his handover
the engraving to which harry was
pointing do not show her that show
her any other she must not yet see that
why not i wonder why said lucy
i have a reason said her uncle
but never mind or think about that
which i hide under my hand my dear
attend to what your brother is going to
show you
which shall i show her uncle said
harry shall i show her de luc's ivory
or whalebone hygrometer
the whalebone for that is the most
simple i think replied his uncle
harry with the article hygrometer before
him began 
look here lucy do you see little 
and little b this represents a small thin
bit whalebone cut across the grain you
know what is meant by the grain the
whalebone but do you see little a and
little
no lucy instead looking at little
a b was peeping at the back the
page and reading something about a little
man and a little woman and a weatherglass

here is something very entertaining
brother said she i must read it to you
 in the dutch toys called weather glasses
one the index supports a small
image a man and the other a woman
the former appears or is brought out in
bad weather the latter in fair weather
i remember said lucy that once
at our widow green's farm i saw a weather
glass this sort but i was not then
wise enough to know that it was called
an hygrometer
there is no great wisdom in knowing
that names said her uncle
 i wish you would show me how to
make this thing brother said lucy that
would be something indeed
i can answered harry and i will
another day lucy but i can show you
but one thing at a time now pray mind
what you are about because i have other
things to do
yes lucy consider your brother's
time said her uncle he wants to goto
his own affairs pray mind what you
are about
i will i will indeed uncle i will
harry cried lucy
harry began again with
little z is a thin piece whalebone
cut across the grain he was
going on with his explanation and went
through c d and e confident that lucy
was following him but by that time he
heard the sound an illsuppressed laugh
and looking up he saw lucy with both
her hands pressed against her mouth to
prevent her laughter from bursting forth
what can you be laughing at lucy
said he
only at the odd figures the little
old man and woman in the weather glass
which i never can think without laughing
 the woman with her cap and red
ribbons all awry and her eyes crooked
too and her arm akimbo and her pipe in
her mouth doubled back against her snub
nose flattening it this way look harry
look uncle 
her uncle instead joining in lucy's
merriment said gravely that she was wrong
to waste her brother's time and that he
was afraid she would never learn any thing
 science if she were not more attentive
her mother came into the room while
her uncle was speaking and lucy looked
ashamed and mortified writhing as if with
bodily pain she said i did attend as
long as ever i could but i could not any
longer i was so shockingly tired
it was my fault said harry i
kept you too long and told you too much
at a time but i did that because you told
me you wanted to get on and to learn all
i had learned as quickly as possible
that is true said lucy i was
wrong there i confess
and since we are all confessing said
her uncle i suppose i should confess i
was wrong in praising you lucy for repeating
those lines
 yes indeed my dear uncle i think
you were said lucy for that encouraged
me to repeat more though i knew
my brother did not like that i should
 i was wrong i suppose not to like
it said harry but i will try to like
poetry better
and i will not repeat it at the wrong
time said lucy but harry another
day you must not tell me such a quantity
and keep me so long at it
 i will not said harry i know it
was wrong but i was so eager and happy
myself and besides you said you wanted
to get on fast
well but will be content to go a
little slower and not to do so much at
once
 right my dear lucy said her uncle 
the only way to be quick at last in
science at least is to be content to go
slowly at first
you may remember lucy said her
mother that was the way you began in
arithmetic you used to tell me every day
vol i e
mamma this is very slow work but
now you can go on with it quickly
a great deal more quickly than i can
i am sure said harry
well harry i will be as slow as you
please in scientific things said lucy
and i will never tire you again so
sadly said harry if i can help it
i will never be tired again said lucy
if i can help it
 if i can help it repeated their mother
 is a wise and safe addition
the next day harry and lucy having
finished their morning's business were
anxious to return to the hygrometer and
to try their resolution mutual forbearance
but they had taken no exercise
this day their uncle advised them to
run out to their gardens and divert themselves
for an hour or two
remember said he aesop's good
old fable and excellent principle unbending
the bow
t
j
yes said lucy the strings mamma's
harp never crack when she remembers
to let them down to loosen them in
time
after having refreshed themselves ban
hour that voluntary hard bodily
work which children all aoes aoree
to call play and after they had rested and
cooled themselves while they gathered a
basket full their own strawberries 
which course they ate a proper proportion
to determine whether they were or
were not ripe they returned to the house
intending to offer these their first strawberries
to their uncle but not in the
library nor in the breakfast room senor
up the lawn nor at the wood was he 
and it was concluded that he was gone
home to his own house which was about
a quarter a mile's walk from theirs
we had better run after him with our
basket said lucy
no he will come back before dinner
i am sure said harry for mamma said
he was to dine here and there is his great
e 
coat still in the hall now let us go to the
hygrometer
lucy set down her basket strawberries
at the farthest the room
lest the smell should disturb her and
harry took down and opened his large
volume but their hands were in no condition
to touch delicate engravings his
were brown with garden mould and hers
pink with the juice strawberries the
dressing bell had rung and their mother
strongly advised their dressing before they
began to read
this advice to dress firsts and then you
are ready to do whatever you please afterwards
so often given by age to youth
and so seldom taken or well taken was
in this instance acted upon instantly without
one murmur the tongue or one
writhing the body
in all the selfcomplacency and safety
 being ready half an hour before dinner
time they met again in the library where
they found their uncle
oh uncle i am glad you are heres
cried lucy and after presenting to him
their strawberries they went to their 
harry asked whether he should go on
with old whakhojie or not
go on with old whalebone said his
uncle lucy should not leave that
without understandings it not that it signifies
whether she understands that particular
thing or not but this will be a trial
 her attention
i well be very attentive said lucy
but observing that her uncle placed
his arm as before so as to cover one 
the hygrometers in the engraving her curiosity
a little disturbed her her uncle
remarking the turn her eye said
 i advise you lucy to repress your
curiosity do not think what is under
my elbow but what sour brother is
showing you
lucy repressed her curiosity and commanded
her attention harry explained
slowly and she followed step by step
patiently undisturbed by the fear being
too slow or the hope showing that lie
was very quick and without one glance
at her uncle's arm or one thought 
what might be his reason for keeping it
in that position she went regularly through
the a h c r de luc's whalebone hygrometer
and understood it to her own
and to her brother's complete satisfaction
her uncle was as he said glad to perceive
that lucy had so far kept her resolution
 and he told her that if she steadily
went on in the same manner she would
find it in time easy to do what she now
felt so difficult to fix her attention
and now said he removing his arm
from the print you shall know my
reason for covering this and i will show
you what i went home for
he took from his pocket and placed
between harry and lucy a small cylindrical
case about three inches high
covered with morocco leather
 it is like the case mamma's opera
glass cried lucy is there an opera
glass in it
 no harry smiled for he knew what
was in it immediately le knew that it
was his favourite hygrometer his uncle
took it out the case and placed it beside
the engraving which he had covered
with his arm telling lucy that he had
wished only to delay showing her the
engraving till she could compare it with
the original which he had walked home
to bring for them it was so simple that
upon looking at it and examining the
plate lucy understood it directly it is
composed a kind indian grass
which like the beard the arabian and
 the english oat twists and untwists
with dryness or moisture but in a much
greater degree making it is said from
ten to sixteen revolutions from the extreme
 moisture to the extreme dryness
harry told lucy that in the
description which he had read this
hygrometer it is said that it shows more
easily and quickly than any other the
changes moisture in the atmosphere
 it is so sensible continued harry
as to be affected by the shutting and
opening a door or window and is
sure to feel the approach any person
and to indicate it by the motion its
hands
let us try now if it will indicate my
approach said lucy
as she approached the hands began
to move and when as her brother bid
her she took it up and held it nearer to
her the motion increased and when ashe
desired she breathed through the holes
in the sides one hand affected by her
breath seemed to fly round the circle
while the other numbered the revolutions
lucy was pleased full as much even asher
brother could expect she stood
watching its quick variations as she
breathed upon it or withdrew her breath
but brother said she did not
you tell me that this has been but lately
invented how comes that why did
not people think it before was not
the grass always there wherever this was
found in india
i suppose it was said harry but
nobody had observed it aw i know
about it is that in trees's cyclopedia it
says that this kind grass was discovered
in india about the year i
think was not it uncle by captain
eater who was employed in making
some survey or some observations and
who wanted a very accurate hygrometer
to measure the smallest quantities 
moisture and he tried this grass and
found it succeed and found that it lasts
better and is more sensible than the english
oat
accurately remembered harry said
his uncle but pray does the cyclopedia
tell you how it happened that captain
eater took notice this grass 
no uncle said harry how was
itr
he told a friend mine that one
evenings as he was walking without boots
in that grass he was annoyed by its frequent
catching in his stockings and when
he took them off at night he found them
full this grass which had twisted itself
e 
into them when he pulled it out he
observed it particularly then his attention
being fixed he remarked the sensibility
 this grass to moisture and he
thought using it for his scientific purposes
as an hygrometer
 how very lucky that it plagued him
that day said lucy by sticking in his
stockings
how well it was that he observed its
properties when he took it out said
harry and that he thought applying
it to some good use i am afraid i
should have thrown it away without observing
it at night particularly i might
have been sleepy and tired and then
uncle the world would never have had
this nice little convenient instrument
 would you harry and would you
lucy said their uncle like to have this
nice little convenient instrument for your
own
their eyes brightening with pleasure
they answered that they should like it
very much
then it is yours my dears said their
uncle i give it you in the hope that it
will teach you accuracy and patience
they said that they would try to keep
a register it regularly but lucy added
that if it was only to teach her patience
she should not like it so well as if she
thought it would be also some use to
her uncle or for some other purpose
her uncle assured her that it would
be useful to him he said that he had
two friends one living in ireland the
other in america they wished to keep
a register the damp or dryness the
atmosphere in those countries to be compared
with england
 then cried lucy we will keep
the register for england with pleasure 
that will be something grand and worth
while
 but said her uncle if you attempt
this it must be done with accuracy
or it will be no use remember
i tell you it will be a trial 
your patience do not begin it unless
you think you can keep it regularly for
six months
half a year said lucy that is a
very long time harry however was
not afraid to undertake it because he
had tried and had kept a register a
barometer for a whole year he said
his register was not neat though it was
accurate his figures were too large and
straggling often out their proper columns
 but now he could use lucy as
his secretary and she could make nice
even figures
their uncle wrote for them some necessary
directions he said that it would
be requisite to do every time they registered
their hygrometer a sum in division
 a certain large number figures
this did not alarm lucy for she was
expert in division and she rejoiced that
she should be able to do this sum readily
for her brother and that she should be
wanted and useful every day or may be
twice a day they were eager to show
their hygrometer to their father but he
had gone from home for a few days
it was settled that the first thing they
should do every morning their lives
must be to examine and write down their
hygrometer registry harry was always
to xad off and lucy to write down
whoever has tried to keep a daily register
or to do any thing regularly everyday
and at a certain hour must know
that it is not a very easy task and where
two persons are concerned the difficulty
is more than doubled with the chances
 one or the other failing in punctuality
and quarrelling about whose fault it might
be harry and lucy therefore by the
experienced and the candid will be allowed
some credit for keeping their register
accurately every day for a month
without having complained each other
lucy repeated that she was very glad it
was to be some great use to her uncle
at the the time for that without
this motive and the pleasure helping
her brother and making nice figures
for him she confessed that she should not
have patience to go on with it
thank you again and again mamma
for allowing me to learn with harry as i
used to do i am much happier already
but mamma if i knew ever so much if
harry was not fond me and i him
we could not be really happy could we
do you think mamma
in truth my dear child i do not think
you could said her mother
 i am sure quite sure we could not
continued lucy suppose i knew all
the histories and all the poems and all
the stories in the whole world and that i
could draw and play on the pianoforte
and dance better than any body in the
universe i am sure mother i could never
be happy unless i loved my brother and
he loved me nor could he be happy
even if he knew all the scientific dialogues
and all the mechanics and hydrostatics
and optics 
 but oh cried lucy interrupting
herself in this enumeration the ics
 there is papa come home i could not
think mamma what made you start up so
quickly in the middle my optics
lucy had too much discretion to produce
their hygrometer the very moment her father
came home she waited till he had
finished what he was saying to her mother
 comprehending that this might be
 more consequence to him and more
interesting than even their new possession
and their new arrangements as
soon however as he had leisure to attend
to her when he turned to lucy and holding
out his hand to her said have you
any thing new to tell me my little girl 
she answered eagerly yes papa a great
deal he made room for her on one side
 him and for harry on the other and
then they showed him their hygrometer 
and lucy told him how much she wished
to understand what her brother had been
learning the preceding years and she told
him harry's intention to bring her up to
him in science she promising to go as
slowly and he as fast as he could and to
tire her as little as possible her father
was glad that harry had learned by his
first attempt that he should not on any
subject tell all he knew to his sister at
once nor expect that she could at once
take as great an interest as he did on subjects
 which she was ignorant particularly
when she had to endure all the labour
and mortification which a beginner must
go through before learning any new
science can be easy or entertaining his
father advised harry not to attempt to
describe all the small parts and detail 
machines not to go over all the a b cs
 descriptions in engravings which however
requisite for those who are to make
them would be unnecessary to lucy he
advised harry to try to give his sister a
clear knowledge the principles some
 the most useful inventions and discoveries
he promised to assist whenever
he came to any difficulty but he desired
him to try first how he could go on
by himself in explaining to his sister
and he repeated to lucy what her mother
and uncle had said to her about attention
he told her that whenever he
had attempted lately to teach her he had
observed that she did not attend as well
as formerly
i know it papa i try all lean but i
cannot i do not know how it is i cannot
said lucy every word that is said
seems as it were to awaken some other
words and every thing i see and hear
makes me recollect something else and
my thoughts are flying off backwards and
forwards and sideways and every way
while harry's can go on straight forward
always thinking what he is about or 
the very thing that is said to him i used
to be able to do the same said lucy
sighing
 sigh no more lucy said her father
smiling no great harm is done your
habits attention have been spoiled and
your power attending is consequently
diminished but with your own good will
and good sense we shall soon set all this
to rights again your perceiving and reflecting
upon what passes in your own
mind will assist you very much
papa said lucy i know how it all
happened aunt pierrepoint did not think
it signified much whether i attended strictly
as my uncle says or not she said i was
quick enough and i will tell you papa
what made a great impression upon m
once i heard a gentleman talking about
genius and he said me that he wondered
how i learned every thing with so
little attention that i was always looking
about and listening to all that people said
and yet that i was so quick i am ashamed
papa to tell you any more said lucy
stopping
 you have said quite enough my dear
little girl to prove to me that you are not
quite a goose as long as any person is
ashamed being flattered there is hope
that they will learn to despise and dislike
flattery i give up only those who get
over the pain the shame and who then
like it shamelessly and swallow down more
and more it till at last they by being
fools to flattery without knowing their
wretched state
 i hope i shall never be in that wretched
state mamma said lucy with a look 
much apprehension harry will you take
care me 
and myself said harry
 well now to business said their
father what do you wish to learn
first lucy
she said that she wished to be made perfectly
acquainted with the air pump because
harry had reproached her with not
having understood that fine poetic description
 it which she had learned by
heart and repeated he said that to be
sure he could easily make her understand
his uncle's air pump because she already
knew the principle a common water
pump
do i said lucy smiling i did
not know that i knew it and here she
again thought the man who had talked
prose all his life without knowing it but
she refrained from making an allusion to
him though it was ready on her lips
harry recalled to her mind the experiments
which their father had shown them
two years ago
do not you remember aid he the
experiment he showed us with a roll 
tape that was put under a wine glass
which was turned down and plunged into
a bason water and then the tape was
pulled out and unrolled by degrees
lucy remembered all this
 and what happened said harry
when the tape was pulled from under the
glass 
lucy answered that the water rose
in the glass
 and why said harry
because when the tape was taken out
there was left in its place a vacancy a
vacuum you call it then the water which
was in the bason rose into that vacant
place
 and why did it rise pursued harry
 because it was pressed by the weight
 the air pressing on all the water in the
basin and it was forced up into the glass
where there was no air nothing to prevent
or resist it
very well now i am satisfied said
harry you remember it clearly
because i understood it clearly at ths
time it was first shown to me said lucy 
 my father was so patient and explained
it to me so slowly and clearly
well said harry you have proved
to me that you understand the first principle
on which pumps are made for all
depends on making a vacuum into which
the water rises or is raised the first
thing to be done is to make a vacuum
now lucy in a common pump such
as there is in the yard for pumping up
water where do you think the vacuum
must be before the water can rise 
lucy said she supposed that it must be
in the inside the body or tube the
pump
yes we call it the bore said harry
now tell me how you would make a
vacuum within it
oh my dear harry that is too difficult
a question for me said lucy how
can i tell how to make a vacuum in the
byre as you call it a great pump 
where is the difficulty said harry
 do not be frightened by the word bore 
or if you are alarmed by the idea a great
pump suppose a little one as small as you
please as small suppose as the glass tube
 the barometer
 that would be easy to suppose but
could there be so small a pump said
lucy
to be sure as well as the largest
size only it would raise less water but
now go on straight forward lucy my
dear do not ask me any your starting
off questions you must let me ask you
questions and you are to answer 
if i can said lucy
you can i assure yon my dear said
harry in his most persuasive tone if you
will only believe that you can and keep
steady i ask you how you would make a
vacuum in this tube
 let me consider let me recollect
what did my father do when he made a
vacuum in the wine glass said lucy to
herself he put in a roll tape which
filled up the whole glass and then drew
it out little by little so as not to let any
air into the glass while he was pulling it
out again but i cannot get a roll tape
into the small tube said lucy
no not a roll tape said harry 
but if you consider what was the purpose
or use putting the roll tape into
the glass and drawing it out again you
will perceive that putting in and drawing
out any thing else in the same manner
would do as well
the purpose was first to force the
air that was in the glass out it said
lucy and to prevent any more afterwards
from getting into the place which
the tape took up and which remained vacant
as it was drawn out leaving a vacuum
at last
 now you are coming on very well
lucy said harry
 if i can put in any thing any sort
into the little tube which forces the air
out and then if i could keep the air out
there would be a vacuum for you harry
very well you will now quite understand
a pump and you will soon know
how to use it lucy
as to that said lucy i know how
to pump already only i am not strong
enough
 stay stay lucy knowing how to
pull a handle up and down which i suppose
is all you mean is not understanding
what i mean by knowing what pumping
is or how it is done
 i have seen men and maids often
pumping at the pump in the yard said
lucy
what happens when they pump said
harry
 the water comes out the spout after
they have pumped a little while said lucy
what do you mean by pumping
persisted harry
i cannot tell you exactly harry because
i never saw the inside the pump
i only know that they move the handle up
and down and i believe there is something
fastened to it which i suppose
brings up the water but i do not know
how exactly
i believe not indeed said harry 
 then you see mrs quickquick you
did not understand what i meant by pumping
now come with me and i will
show you in my room the nice glass pump
which my father made for me you cannot
see into the inside the pump in the
yard but when once you have seen my
glass pump you will understand the inside
 all others
he showed her in the first place a glass
tube in which there was a spout near the
top the tube was open at the top and
at the bottom there was a little door or
vol i f
 
valve which opened upwards only he
poured water into this tube to shove her
that the water would rest upon this valve
without its letting any it through he
then emptied out the water now said
he you know there is nothing but air
in this tube look at this which is called
the piston a pump the piston was
a cylinder which fitted tight into the
tube at the top it there was a valve
like that at the bottom the tube which
also opened one way and that was upwards
harry pushed it up several times
with his finger to show lucy that it
opened easily and he made her feel that it
did so he then put the tube into a tub
 water the tube resting on two blocks 
wood which raised it from the bottom 
the tub so that there was room for the
water to flow in through the lowest valve
lucy as he desired held the glass tube
upright while he pushed down the piston
to which there was a long handle
now lucy what happens within 
side the tube said harry
nothing that i know said she
but that you have pressed the air in the
tube closer together
 very true do you see the valve at
the bottom is it shut or open
lucy said it was shut
and what keeps it shut 
the air that you are pressing down
upon it said lucy
he pressed the piston down farther
now look again said he and tell
me what happens 
 i see the little door at the top the
piston open said she
harry asked her what she thought had
opened it
the air said she underneath it
which i suppose you could not compress
any more and which has forced its way
up
he now drew up the piston and again
asked what happened lucy saw the
valve at the top the piston shut and she
saw the water rush through the valve at
the bottom the glass pump and rise in
f 
its tube and when harry again plunged
down the piston the water came through
the valve in the piston and when he drew
it up again it carried up all the water to
the top the tube where it flowed out
 the spout
just as it does in the great real pump
said lucy
and now you do know what i mean
by pumping said harry
he pumped on for some time and then
let her take the handle and work for herself
he questioned her and made her
repeat her explanation till he was satisfied
and she was satisfied that she clearly
understood that the thing to be done in
pumping and by pumping is to force the
air out a certain space to produce a vacancy
or vacuum into which the ester
rushes and rises or rather said harry
to speak more accurately is pressed and
supported by the surrounding air and
water perhaps i ought to tell you that
there is no perfect vacuum but i will not
be too exact with you at first lest i should
tire you therefore i will not tell you all
the differences between a lifting pump
and a sucking pump and a forcing pump 
besides i am not sure that i know them
all myself i weill not tell you even about
water always finding its own level
i am very much obliged to you said
lucy
nor will i tell you continued harry
about the weight the column water
which a certain quantity air can sustain

 i think i do know something about
that said lucy or i did know it once
however thank you for not telling me too
much at a time especially about all the
different pumps you talked leave my
head quite clear with the vacuum that
i understand now and the use which is
made it and i understand all that happens
when the piston the pump is pulled
up and pushed down
 and now that you know said harry
what pumping is i will ask mamma tolet
us go to the great pump in the yard
that you may see lucy the same sort 
thing in large that you have seen in
small
their mother went with them to look at
the pump in the yard the handle was
so high that harry could not well manage
to use it but his mother called for one 
the servants who pumped for them
the servant filled a tub with the water
which he had pumped up and as he
lifted it to carry it away he said that he
and all the servants in the house were very
glad that the pump which had been out
 order was now well repaired because
it had been great labour to them to go to
the windlasswell in the garden for water
whenever it was wanted and to bring
heavy tubs it many times aday this
observation made lucy the more sensible
as she said the great convenience a
pump
this is a really and truly useful machine
continued she useful to great
great numbers people for the commonest
business that must be done everyday
and almost every hour and it is as
easy for ignorant people to use as for the
most learned what an excellent contrivance
 how happy the man must have
been who made the first pump when he
found it would do and felt the water coming
and saw it pouring out at the spout 
 delightful said harry
now harry my dear tell me something
about the air pump
 no no my dear that would be too
much said harry looking very prudent
one pump aday is enough for you i
will keep the air pump till tomorrow
after all this wisdom what did they do
next how did harry and lucy spend
the remainder this morning two whole
hours
if we tell we shall not be believed except
by those who are themselves children
or by those who know children right welland
their sudden falls from the heights 
wisdom to the depths folly
harry and lucy spent all that remained
 this morning in pumping up through
the little glass pump the water a puddle
in harry's garden they could have ladled
it all out in three minutes and two moderate
sized tubs would have held it and
have carried it all away but this would
have been too obvious too easy a way 
going to work it must all pass through
the glass pump and so they worked on
till their backs ached and till the dirty puddle
water had so soaked into the leather 
the piston and so clogged the valve with
mud that it would move no more
during this pumping and draining 
the puddle many misadventures befel
harry's trowsers and lucy's clean frock 
clean no more it may be recorded for
the advantage little washerwomen who
with hands unskilled may unadvisedly
attempt to wash out fresh spots that the
more lucy tried to get rid hers the
more they appeared what seemed quite
out while it was wet came in again as
soon as it dried and the spots spread
into blotches with obstinate edges yellow
so that altogether the frock instead
 looking better for these operations was
worse than ever 
before it was half dry oh how unlucky
 before it had half dried after dip
and scrub the fifth the sound carriagewheels
was heard morning visitors
their garden was full in sight the
house up jumped harry upon what he
called his throne a heap stones from
whence he had a full view the carriage
it was one he had never seen before
lucy clambered after him to share the
exalted view from his throne and to assist
his judgment with her eyes and her imagination
a lady was getting out the
carriage lucy did not know who it was
she confessed but she imagined that it
must be a certain mrs hanbury who
owed her mother a visit
 i am sure it is mrs hanbury and i
dare say that her daughter is with her
therefore i will not go in for miss hanbury
is always very fine and i should not
like that she should see me in this frock
in this sad condition and oh harry
f
they must not see you in those trowsers
i will show you how mrs hanbury and
miss hanbury would look at us we will
not go in
go in upon no account said harry
as to my trowsers i do not care what
your fine miss hanbury or mrs hanbury
think or how they look at them or at me
but i hate going into a room where there
are strangers
harry observed however that notwithstanding
lucy's certainty that the visitors
were mrs and miss hanbury no girl got
out the carriage and there was a gentleman

how can that be said lucy for
there is no mr hanbury let them be
who they may we will not go in repeated
she
to this harry heartily assented he
disliked morning visitors particularly
 so do i so does every body said
lucy i hope they will not see us
from the house i hope mamma will not
send for us harry we had better sit up
in your observatory in the great sycamore
tree
come up then this instant cried
harry give me your hand and i will
pull you up
in harry's observatory in the great sycamore
tree they both sat snugly for sometime
till he saw through the branches
some people standing at the drawingroom
window that they might not be seen by
these people harry advised leaving the
observatory and removing a step higher
into what he called his dark attics where
the branches were so thick that he was
sure no morning visitors could see them
or think looking for them he had sat
there many a time he said while ladies
had passed under the tree chattering without
ever spying him scarcely however
had they mounted and safely lodged themselves
in the attics which to say the
truth were ill able to hold two lodgers at
a time when harry exclaimed
 it is all over with us there is mamma
herself at the window beckoning to us
but she cannot see us said lucy
certainly not said harry unless
she saw my white trowsers when i was
clambering up here into the attics
 white trowsers oh no i am sure
she did not said lucy
 but there she is said harry waving
her handkerchief lucy
 do not go do not go in for now i
have a green streak worse than all the
rest said lucy i am sure mamma
does not see us and i dare say she does not
want us really herself but perhaps mrs
hanbury asked for me and mamma just
beckoned
the signal was repeated at intervals
two or three times lucy had some doubts
but the fear mrs hanbury s seeing her
dirty gown prevailed the handkerchief
ceased to wave and they remained in
their tree nearly an hour a much longer
time than they had expected harry had
been resolute from the first and had no
wavering during this hour as he sat
quite at ease in his tree he said now
is a good time to think the puzzle my
uncle gave me about a three gallon a
five gallon and an eight gallon vessel
lucy interrupted him several times by
scrambling up and down to see if the carriage
vas gone or whether mamma waved
her handkerchief again at length having
succeeded in solving his problem he
held her fast by the gown insisting upon
her sitting still and thinking it which
as he assured her would make the time
appear to go much faster there was a
gentleman who had two haymakers one
hot day they worked very hard making hay
and when they had finished the hay rick
late in the evening the gentleman called
them to his hall door and said my
good men you must be very thirsty i will
give you some beer to drink here are
eight gallons for you but you must divide
this beer so that each you may have
exactly half and this you must do before
you drink a drop it
that was very easily done said
no
lucy each was to have four what
puzzle is there in this 
stay stay mrs quickquick you will
be puzzled yet before you have done
the gentleman had only three vessels in
his house it is said the first held eight
gallons the beer was in this the second
held five gallons and the third three gallons
and these two were empty now
manage it as you will lucy and with
these vessels divide the beer so that you
can prove to me that each man has four
gallons exactly you may pour the beer
backwards and forwards as often as you
please from one these vessels to another

lucy began and poured from one to
another in imagination for some time
without success pour how she would
there was at the her measures
always five gallons in the eight gallon
vessel and three in the five at last she
perceived how it could be done and
showed how she could prove to harry
ill
that she had divided it equally four
gallons harry in the eight gallon vessel
and four gallons in the five gallon
vessel
so completely had her attention been
absorbed by this puzzle that she had not
heard the sound the departing wheels
 the visitors carriage and when she
again peeped out their hiding place
they were surprised to see that the
carriage was qone
when they went in their mother told
them that she was sorry they had not
sooner made their appearance because
the lady and gentleman who had been
with her were remarkably agreeable people
and had told many things that were
entertaining and interesting
then mamma it was not mrs and
miss hanbury said lucy how very
provoking i am sorry mamma we have
missed hearing entertaining things who
were the people
sir rupert and lady digby friends
 your father's
i never lizard them before said
lucy
 very likely my dear
mamma what sort entertaining
things did they tell said lucy
they gave us an account a shipwreck
which happened lately on part 
the sea shore near the place where they
ive
 oh mamma tell it me cried
harry
 yes pray mamma said lucy
 first tell me did not you see me
beckoning and making signals to you to
come in my dears said their mother
 yes mamma we saw you said
harry but we thought that it would
be tiresome and we did not like to go
in i liked better to go on with what i
was about
his mother told harry that she would
not have beckoned to him unless she had
til ought it was worth his while to come
in and added she smiling you
must now abide by your own choice
for i will never tell you the shipwreck

 pray at least mamma tell it to
harry said lucy because it was all
my fault that we did not come in i
did not like to come because look at
my frock mamma
it is very much soiled indeed said
her mother
with the water from my puddle and
my glass pump mamma said harry 
 that was my fault
her mother asked lucy why she could
not put on another frock have not you
any other lucy 
yes mamma said lucy colouring
 i have but i could not put on any 
them because one is so short it comes
up to here and i forgot to let down the
tucks and another has a great tear in
it i intended to have given it to be
mended this morning and one sleeve is
half out the third mamma i tore it
last night as i was reaching down a 
from the uppermost shelf
her mother said that there must be no
more experiments any kind till lucy
should have these things mended
i know that is quite right mamma
said lucy i expected you would say
so i will go up to my room directly
and let down the tucks but mamma
while i am away could you be so
kind as to tell harry the story the
shipwreck 
i could said her mother smiling
but i will not in the first place i
should be sorry to tell it when you were
not present but i do not intend to tell
it to him at all for if i were to repeat
to him every thing entertaining which i
heard this morning he would depend
upon my doing the same another time
and he would not exert himself to conquer
that feeling bashfulness which
prevents his coming into a room where
there are strangers and which makes him
always say i would rather stay out
 the room and go on with my own
affairs 
now brother for the air pump cried
lucy as you used to say now papa
for the barometer
 my uncle said harry has been so
good as to lend me his portable air pump
to show you was not it good him to
lend it
very good indeed said lucy and
how convenient to have so many things
portable portable barometer portable hygrometer
portable air pump
now lucy recollect what was the
great thing to be done in pumping said
harry
was not it to make a vacuum said
lucy hesitating as if she was afraid 
making a mistake
yes to be sure my dear said harry
be quite certain about that
i am quite certain said she i was
only afraid to say it at first lest i should
not be riorht
but do not be afraid when you
know a thing know it very firmly the
truth cannot alter between yesterday and
to day nor can the truth ever alter you
know
that is a great comfort said lucy
 was not it boyle who invented the air
pump or was it torricelli 
neither said harry it was that
poetry you repeated which put that mistake
into your headand when once
one has got any thing wrong into one's
head there is no getting it out again
but you are partly right boyle improved
the airpump very much and it
is sometimes called the boileau vacuum
that is boyle's vacuum but boyle was
too honest a man to claim for his own
the first vacuum i mean the first making
use it for the air pump he knew
and always said it was otto garrick's
invention
 well i dare say it was said lucy 
you need not say any more about it
i do not care much who made the first
vacuum nor who first made use it for
the air pump
you do not lucy my dear consider
what you say suppose i had invented
the air pump or something as
great would you my sister like that
somebody else should take from me the
honour and glory the invention
no i should not said lucy but
you are my brother and alive and to be
sure i should be anxious that you were
not robbed the glory but those other
people mr otto guerick and mr boyle
are nothing to me besides they have
been dead and buried long ago and
what signifies it now to any body
 it signifies a great deal said harry
 suppose it was my father or my grandfather
or my great grandfather should
not i care would not you then so
would otto guerick's or boyle's children
or grandchildren or great grandchildren
if there are any living and there is a
great family boyle i know and do
you think that for the world they would
give up the boileau vacuui
i suppose not said lucy but
now let us go on to the air pump itself
and the vacuum let it be whose it will
so we will said harry but before
i show it to you remember that what
you are going to see is a pump for pumping
out air not for pumping up water so
put water quite out your head
 i have put water quite out my head
i understand that the air pump is to pump
out air but brother before you begin
let me say one thing
say it then if it is not poetry
no it is only that i think a pair 
bellows is a sort air pump hey
harry 
 well that is not foolish lucy you
may call a pair bellows a sort air
pump only that bellows never could be a
right air pump without two valves but
do not go on thinking them all the time
i am explaining to you now look at my
uncle's air pump you see this glass
continued harry and he pointed to a
lai'de glass bell which stood over a sort
 frame or stand lucy what do you
think is in this glass
air i suppose said lucy
 it is full air and nothing else
said harry the thing to be done is
to get all the air that is in the bell out
 it and that is to be done by means
 these pumps continued he pointing
to two tall cylinders brass which stood
upon the stand with the glass bell they
communicated at the bottom with a pipe
which opened into the bell there was
a handle by which as he told lucy she
could move the pistons these pumps up
and down
 just in the way in which the piston
moved up and down in the water pump
yesterday said she i see i see it
is all nearly the same thing only that
this pumps air out as you said and
the other water i understand it all perfectly

 stay stay mrs quickquick you do
not understand it all perfectly yet you
see only the likenesses but there are differences
which you do not see yet and
cannot my dear mrs quickquick because
it takes a great deal more time to
see the differences than to catch the likenesses
mrs quick 
she put her hand upon his mouth before
he could repeat the offensive words
brother do not call me mrs quickquick
and i will be as slow as you
please and i will not tell you any 
the likenesses i see i will be quite silent
and only nod my head when i understand
ever so perfectly
 then look at the air pump which is
before you said harry and observe
what i do i am going to move the
handle which you see at the top which
will raise up one the pistons what is
underneath the piston
nothing said lucy at first but
afterwards she added i believe there is
a vacuum
true and what happens directly
said harry
air comes in directly to fill it i suppose
said she
where does it come from said
harry
it must come from the bell through
this pipe said lucy which leads from
the bell to the bottoms the pumps
then when that happens there is
less air in the bell than there was before
is not there said harry now move
the piston down again and what happens

 you would press the air that is under
the piston back again up the pipe into the
bell said lucy if there is not a valve at
the bottom the pump that shuts against
it and prevents it from going back but
though i do not see it i suppose there is
such a valve because you told me that it
was necessary in all pumps
 you suppose rightly and you remember
very well said harry there
is such a valve and it prevents the air
from going back into the bell when i
vol i g
push the piston down but what becomes
 the air
 it comes out into the open air through
the valve in the piston i suppose
very true now i will move the
handle again and repeat the operation
i should have told you that we are assisted
in pumping by the expansive force
 the air
i do not understand that said lucy
yes you do my dear if you will only
recollect the experiments papa showed you
with a bladder said harry
ages ago said lucy
yes you remember seeing the bladder
swell out with the expansive force
 the air and you may recollect that
after blowing in air for some time when
we tried to force in more air we could
not the bladder swelled out so that we
could hardly hold its mouth together to
tie it
i remember it said lucy
 if we had let go the string said
harry and the mouth the bladder
had opened what would have happened

 the air would have forced its way
out said lucy
yes air you know will expand and
fill every empty place now i have
pumped out all the air that i can from
the bell and now that it is as empty as
we can make it we call it a vacuum
though very accurate people would tell
you lucy that it is not a perfect vacuum

it will do for me said lucy and
i think i understand the air pump really
now is there any other difference between
it and the water pump brother
you said there was a difference
i did say so and i will explain to
you what it is if you will answer my
questions patiently what was it in the
glass water pump that you saw yesterday
that pressed up the water into the vacuum
below the piston said harry
it was the outer air the weight 
g 
the outer air pressing upon the surface
 the water that was in the tub forced
the water up into the tube
true the same in all water pumps
said harry but here is no water for
it to press upon how then is this vacuum
filled 
by the weight or force the air
itself only i believe said she
 what air said harry
it must be the air in the bell said
she for i see no other but that is so
little that there cannot be weight enough
in that
no said he it is not by weight
that this pump acts but by the spring'wess
 the air itself this is the difference
which i wanted you to observe between
the air pump and water pumps
by the springiness the air said
lucy
yes said harry you felt the force
 that springiness in the bladder when it
was full air
lucy said she should like to feel it
acrain she had almost forgotten it harry
blew into a bladder and filled it with air
and when it was full bid her try to press it
together when she tried to do it she perceived
the sort resistance that it made
and she felt the force with which after she
had squeezed it it returned to its former
place and form
the same springiness said harry
 or what is called the elasticity the air
in the bell is what fills the vacuum below
the piston each time it is drawn up nowhere
is the description and plate it in
scientific dialogues and this is all that
you need know about it at present stay
i will just look at the print the air pump
in trees's cyclopedia and see if i have
left out any thing that i ought to tell you
as he opened the and as lucy
saw the engravings she looked a little
alarmed
there seem to be as many different
air pumps as hygrometers said she
sighing
 do not be afraid i am not going to
show them to you all said harry but
now that you know the general principle
you would soon feel it easy as i did to
understand them
 oh no said lucy there seem to
be such a number pipes and valves and
little as and s and p's and s
they only relate to the contrivances to
prevent the outer air from coming in while
we are pumping the air out the vessel
that is to be emptied which it is constantly
trying to do one pump is better than another
only as it does this most effectually
and most easily and as it more perfectly
empties or exhausts the vessel by the
bye i should tell you that this glass vessel
is called a receiver and when it is
emptied it is called an exhausted receiver
i was puzzled at first by those words exhausted
receiver
thank you harry for remembering
that for me
now my dear lucy you shall work a
little at the air pump yourself as you did
at the water pump yesterday
oh thank you thank you said she
joyfully there is nothing like working
oneself it fixes a thing so well in my
memory i remember the look and touch
 the things much better afterwards
while harry was placing the machine
so that it should be convenient to lucy
she turned to look at the engravings
that lay open on the table
 how well this air pump is done
said she it is very like my uncle's 
not quite perhaps i will take care to
mind about the differences
this is very like it said harry
there is no difference any consequence

if we had not had my uncle's said
lucy i think you could have made me
understand the air pump quite well from
this engraving that is after my having
seen the glass pump yesterday and its
valve and the piston but without that i
could not have understood it from this
representation because i see here only
the outside a pump even though you
had described the valves and explained
them to me ever so clearly i should not
have understood them so well as by having
seen and touched them and moved them
myself
certainly said harry but next to
seeing the real thing these engravings
or drawings help one very much look
though you see only the outside the
pump in that perspective view here is the
inside an air pump all laid open for
you you know what is meant by a section
 
soh yes said lucy suppose anything
to be cut in two what you see inside
 each part when they are separated
is a section papa explained that and
showed it to me when he cut a lemon in
two for me i remember this minute as
well as if i saw it before my eyes the
look the lemon with the pippins cut in
half each in their little cells the cells cut
open too and i remember 
very well my dear interrupted
harry you remember very well what
is meant by a section therefore you will
understand this plate and this figure
but lucy never be ashamed to tell me
if you do not understand you know
i have but just learnt these things myself
and i remember the odd mistakes i used
to make and the puzzles i was in when
papa was teaching me
lucy looked at the engravings now
without alarm because as she knew what
they represented they did not puzzle her
and she was not afraid being tired
after having looked at the section she
said it made the whole as plain to her eye
as if it had been made glass something
farther she said to herself about a
man's having a window in his breast but
either she did not say it loud enough for
harry to hear or he did not think it much
to the purpose for without attending to it
he shut the saying now we have
had enough the prints i thought just
now you were very eager to work the air
pump yourself lucy
 so i am still said lucy only it
g 
was not quite ready and i looked at
the prints between times now let me
pump
pump away this way said he showing
her how to hold the handle and how
to move it backwards and forwards and
how she worked two pistons at the same
time
she worked it but not without difficulty
after she had pumped for some minutes
she found the difficulty increasing and
asked from what this arose
harry said from the resistance made by
the pressure the outward air which becomes
greater as the receiver is more and
more exhausted he took off the receiver
and put her hand over the hole at the top
 the pipe which communicates with the
pumps and bid her move the pistons
with her other hand gently she did so
and felt that part the palm her hand
which was over the pipe drawn in her
brother repeated gently gently as she
moved the handle indeed soon there
was no occasion to say so to her for she
felt the palm drawn in so as to be quite
painful and she grew red with fright
 oh brother it hurts me very much
i cannot take my hand away what shall
i do
stop pumping said he and do not
be frightened there is no danger
she stopped pumping and her brother
turned a screw so as to let the air into the
receiver this relieved her hand she
held it up to show him a purple circle all
round the inside the hand
he pitied it a little a very little lucy
thought not quite enough
 i know said he exactly how much
it hurts you because i have done the same
a hundred times to my own hand my
dear i wanted you to feel as i did myself
there is as you said nothing like feeling
to make one remember well what do
you think caused this 
at first lucy answered that she did not
know
because you are thinking the pain
in your hand said he
that is true said lucy but it is
pretty well over now what did you ask
me
 i asked you what caused that kind 
sucking in your hand into the exhausted
receiver f
she thought for an instant and answered

i believe it was the pressure the
outer air which was trying to get in at
that hole to fill the vacuum and which
was prevented by the palm my hand
which it then drove in as much as it could
well now i am sure i have felt the
pressure the viewless air and now
you must let me repeat the line
the spring and pressure the viewless air
harry repeated it after her declaring it
was a very pretty line besides it had some
common sense in it lucy had said it
quite at the right time when it did not
interrupt him or any thing that was going
on he was so much pleased with it that
he begged her to repeat all those lines
j
again for him and when they went out to
their garden soon afterwards instead 
beginning to dig he desired her to say
the lines once more for that he must learn
them by heart thus he learnt from her
some her taste for poetry while she
acquired from him some his love 
science
in repeating these lines lucy observed
which them alluded to the barometer
and which to the air pump yhen she
had first learned them by rote barometer
and air pump had been so jumbled in her
head that she could not understand them
c
how up exhausted tubes bright currents flow
 liquid silver from the lake below
weigh the long column th incumbent skies
and with the changeful moment fall or rise 
she now knew described the barometer
and the succeeding lines the air pump 
how as in brazen pumps the pistons move
the membrane valve sustains the weight above 
stroke follows stroke the gelid vapour falls
and misty dewdrops dim the chrystal walls 
rare and more rare expands the fluid thin
and silence dwells with vacancy within
while harry was learning these lines
by heart lucy stopped as she prompted
the couplet concerning gelid vapour
and misty dewdrops and objected i
do not understand about misty dewdrops
on the chrystal walls i did not perceive
any vapour on the glass bell
her brother told her that these lines
alluded to a fact which he had not yet
mentioned to her which his father had
but very lately told him and he was not
clear enough yet about it to attempt to
explain it to her
lucy said she was satisfied to wait
that it was best not to know every thing
at once and pleasant to have something
to look forward to but altogether she
confessed that though the air pump was
curious and ingenious to use the air to
drive itself out yet the water pump she
thought a much grander and a much more
useful machine she thought the air
pump was not any use
harry smiled and answered so i
thought at first but my dear that was
owing to my ignorance and when you
know more you will find that the air pump
is great use there are many experiments
in natural history as papa showed
me that could never have been tried and
discoveries that could never have been
made without it for instance to give
you a little peep into the matter we could
never without an air pump have known
that a guinea and a feather would fall to
the ground in the same time if there was
no air to resist the fall either them
a guinea and a feather a heavy
guinea and a light feather i oh brother t
very true i assure you as you will
see one these days
 harry now i think i recollect i heard
this about the guinea and the feather before
or read it somewhere and something
else too about the guinea's making no
more noise than the feather when it falls
you will show me this too will you
i am not sure that i can lucy said
harry i tried in this air pump and i
did not find it was so the guinea fell
on the metal plate here at the bottom and
this plate touches the outer air and rings
makes a noise
i do not clearly understand why it
should make a noise when it falls or why
it should not said lucy
i cannot explain it yet said harry
 and i must try the experiment about the
noise over again to make myself sure
whether i am right or wrong i am certain
that the feather and guinea come to the
ground in the same time for that experiment
i have tried often and it always succeeded

show it to me now said lucy
no not now but you shall see all
this and a great deal more in time said
harry but lucy how could you say
that the air pump is no use when
you know more about it you will see
how much you were mistaken you will
find that all we know about the specific
gravities the different weights bodies
and a great many curious facts about
sound and i cannot tell you how many
delightful experiments and discoveries
about the air that comes out vegetables
and about the growing seeds and 
plants and other experiments about different
kinds gases as they are called 
i say my dear lucy as my father told
me none these could have been known
without the air pump and then as to the
gases oh my dear i cannot explain
to you yet what amazing consequence
the erases are
lucy opened her eyes and stood looking
as if she thought she could never admire
enough after a reverend pause she
simply repeated the word gases i
my dear do not ask me about them
yet you are a great great way yet from
the gases but if you are good i will put
you into boiling water tonight at tea and
get you on to steam and the steam engine

thank you said lucy without knowing
clearly what was to happen to her
now let us finish the new road to my
garden said harry but before we
go i hope you will acknowledge the air
pump besides being very ingenious is as
useful as the water pump at least hey
mrs lucy you look as if you were not
convinced yet
i must wait till i have seen and till i
can understand all these things before i
can decide said lucy
very provokingly prudent and slow
all at once muttered harry striking the
stones the new road with his pounder
why brother how can i possibly say
more when you tell me i am so far from
the gases and i am sure i did not understand
a word you said about specific gravities
 as to the experiment about the
feather and the guinea i long to see that
with all my heart and i dare say i shall
like the others about sound and seeds
and vegetables particularly but these
are all curious experiments for grand philosophers
with your airpump they maybe
useful to your men science brother 
but what i say is that the common pump
is more useful to common people everyday
and i do say that i like those machines
best which are most useful
all the rest harry heard patiently or
passively as he went on pounding his
road but when she came to the last words
and i do say that i like those machines
best which are most useful he threw down
his pounder exclaiming you are very
ungrateful lucy and he wiped his forehead
for he was very hot but checking
himself he added ungrateful to the air
pump i mean
my dear i did not mean to be ungrateful
to the air pump said lucy surprised
that he could grow so warm about
it i did not mean to affront the air
pump or you i am sure i did not know
you cared which i preferred what can
make you care so much about the pumps 
i do not know said harry but i
was vexed because you would not do justice
to the air pump and you gave your
opinion against it without knowing all i
thought that you were like that foolish
woman who said to the great chemist
 what use is all your chemistry if it
cannot teach you to tell me how to take
the ironmoulds out my gown lucy
i hope you will never be so foolish
never i hope said lucy and i
hope you do not think i ever shall
no i hope not said harry but
now i must say for the air pump there is
a use that may be made it in common
every day in hot weather to make something
that is exceedingly agreeable
what can it be said lucy
particularly with sweetmeats and
creams continued harry very good
 pine apple and pleasant tea mamma
told me not bad even water
do you mean ice said lucy
yes said he the air pump can
make ice
oh harry i cannot believe that how
can that possibly be done 
go to conversations on chemistry
my dear and you will be answered
very well i will go to conversations
on chemistry said lucy but not till i
have dug this bed in my garden and tied
up all my carnations and fed my white
rabbit and finished drawing the last snake
 my head medusa and put by the sulphur
in the cabinet and practised the
rising the lark
very little chance indeed through all
that jumble things your remembering
on chemistry and the air
pump said harry
you shall see said lucy i have
always a good memory for what i wish
to do
harry i have done all that i said i
would i have duo the bed in mv garden
tied up my carnations fed my white
rabbit finished my medusa's snakes put
the sulphur into their cabinet practised
my rising the lark and read and understood
all that you marked forme in conversations
on chemistry
eighth edition vol i from page to 
really you have done a great deal
said harry much more than i expected
i thought the white rabbit would have
made you forget every thing else and
do you quite understand all you have
read
i do said lucy for it is very
clear as i was reading i thought i saw
every thing that was described and after
i had finished i was more anxious than
before to see the experiment you promised
to show me will you let me see
it now before i forget what i understand
and while my head is it as you say 
i will show it to you as soon as ever
i can said harry with my father's
assistance he says that i must not attempt
to try this experiment by ourselves
because sulphuric acid which must be
used in it is very dangerous to meddle
with if we dropped any it on our 
clothes it would burn holes in them and
if we were to let a drop fall on ourselves
it would hurt us exceedingly so take
care lucy not to meddle with it
i will take great care said lucy i
will look but not touch
while harry went out the room to
his father who was preparing for their
experiment lucy talked to her mother
about the entertaining account which she
had just been reading the method 
making ice in india even in the hottest
nights
 how glad they must be mamma
said lucy when in the morning they
see the ice in the shallow pans which
they leave out doors during the night 
mamma continued she i think that
the emily and caroline in this must
have been very happy seeing all the nice
experiments mentioned here and talking
to their mother about them and learning
from her this mrs b seems to be a
very good kind mother i should like to
know her if she is really a live person
is there such a real person as mrs b
mamma
 yes there is lucy
there is and are you acquainted with
her mamma lucy asked eagerly
i am my dear
you are and what sort person is
she do you like her oh yes mamma
i see by your look before you speak you
like her very much
i do indeed lucy
i am glad she is an acquaintance 
yours mamma i hope i shall see her
some time
she is more than an acquaintance 
mine she is my friend and if you deserve
it my dear daughter i hope that she will
some time be yours
oh brother what do you think mamma
has just told me cried lucy running
to meet harry who at this instant opened
the door and came in followed by his
father
oh papa do you know 
but observing that her father's hands
were full and that he and harry were
intent upon bringing in the air pump
she wisely ceased her exclamations and
stopped short in what she was going to say
right to be silent my dear said her
father as she stood by without uttering a
words all the time they were preparing to
show her the experiment it is very
troublesome and disagreeable to have little
girls or little any bodies or great any
bodies talking all the time we are busy
preparing experiments
 busy and anxious too you know
papa for some experiments are dangerous
said harry
lucy had learned from what she had
just read that sudden evaporation produces
cold sufficient to freeze in a vacuum
even when the outer air is much
above the freezing point a thermometer
was near the air pump and lucy
looked at it as harry desired she would
she saw that the mercury stood at 
degrees and she felt that the room was
warm
her father placed under the receiver a
large shallow saucer filled with sulphuric
vol i h
acid and in it a small cup water
raised on a little stand with a thermometer
in it as described in conversations on
chemistry
he asked lucy if she knew for what
purpose the sulphuric acid was put there
she said that the had told her that
the use the sulphuric acid was to attract
and absorb what was evaporated from
the water before it is frozen
and why should it be absorbed
said her father
because we want to freeze the water
said lucy
true but you have not explained tome
why we desire that the sulphuric acid
should absorb this vapour
because papa that vapour fills up
part the vacuum and it must be taken
away and the sulphuric acid does this as
it absorbs it
 she understands it said harry now
we may go on look lucy at what happens
 keep your eyes fixed upon the
water
she did so and she soon saw little
bubbles appearing on its surface
it is beginning to do something said
she but it looks more as if it were going
to boil than to freeze
you know said he that before
water can freeze it must appear to boil
yes appear i understand why you
say appear that was explained to me in
the 
now it begins to freeze said harry
look at the little spikes ice
lucy saw this and said it was very
curious but still she did not look quite so
much surprised and pleased as harry had
expected because els she said she saw
only such tiny spikes ice she had imagined
that all the remaining water in
the cup would have been turned at once
into a solid lump
harry had talked to her about pineapple
ice and various other kinds ice
which were so pleasant to eat in hot weather
and which he boasted that the air
pump was so useful in assisting people to
h 
make but from the tiny spikes she had
seen she could scarcely conceive that a
sufficient quantity could be made for this
good purpose harry asked his mother if
she would give them some cream and some
sweetmeat to make sweet icecream he
wished exceedingly to show lucy that it
could really be done in the air pump
their kind mother provided them with all
that harry desired but she doubted that
they would be able to succeed as it was
difficult even to freeze water harry was
determined to try for he had heard that it
was a common practice in london to make
use an air pump in making icecream
his father warned him that he was mistaken
but that he mighty and that he
would then find out what his mistake had
been
harry put the cream into a small teacup
and lucy mixed with it their raspberry
jelly they put the tea cup into a
larger cup filled with water and this they
placed on a little stand which rested on a
saucer filled with sulphuric acid within
the glass bell the air pump it happened
as it too often happens to young
experimenters and to old ones also that
their experiment did not succeed they
could not freeze the cream
they tried to console themselves by eating
the cream and sweetmeat this was
however but an imperfect consolation to
harry the honour the air pump and
his own were at stake and he recurred to
the subject immediately
i suppose my mistake was in putting
the cream and sweetmeat into the air
pump i was only told that the air pump
was useful in making ice how they make
the ice cream with it i cannot guess said
harry
i can tell you that said lucy for i
once saw the housekeeper make raspberry
icecream
have you said harry and how
did she do it
she put some cream and sweetmeat
into a tin cylinder tin i believe it was or
pewter and this she surrounded with
a great deal pounded ice and salt
then she kept turning and turning the
cylinder round with the cream in it till at
last it was all frozen
oh oh said harry then now i see
how it is the air pump produces ice
enough to freeze the cream that must bethe
way it is useful
 but how can it produce it in such
quantities as would be necessary it would
be a year at the rate i saw it going on with
a little cupful water said lucy
harry acknowledged this and they appealed
to their father
he told them that for this purpose
much larger air pumps than they had ever
seen would be necessary that consequently
a greater vacuum was produced
and more water frozen
then it is true lucy you see the air
pump does make the ice that makes the ice
cream and it is used for this purpose in
london is not it papa 
not in london answered their father
it is too expensive a process to be 
much advantage in this country but i believe
it has been found useful in india
ein india there lucy you see how
useful it is and how far its fame goes
said harry
did they really send an air pump
made in england to india for this purpose

yes said her father and when
we go to london i will show you mr
carey's apparatus for making ice
oh thank you father and i shall
really see it made not in little spikes butin
quantities said lucy
now lucy you will acknowledge
said harry that the air pump is useful
for common purposes
i will i do said lucy
and you will have much more to
acknowledge on this subject by and by
said her father you will see other purposes
for common life to which it is applied

oh what father cried harry
that i will not tell you now harry
in the evening before tea time harry
and lucy played at spilling and afterwards
a game chess in which harry was
beaten because he was thinking something
he was going to tell lucy about the
steam engine and he missed seeing a rogue
 a knight that had got so close to his
king that he could not stir without being
checkmated
now for the steam engine which you
promised to explain to me said lucy
harry was afraid that he could not and
turning to his father asked him to explain
it but his father desired that he would
first thy what he could do
this will be service to you harry
for you will be then certain whether you
comprehend it yourself or not people
are never sure they understand any thing
perfectly till they have explained it to another
if lucy is puzzled i will help you
out your difficulty whatever it may be
harry said he would try and began
with these words 
in the first place a steam engine is a

machine there he stopped and began
aofain with
in the first place lucy you must know
that the machine called a steam engine was
invented he stopped short again and
a third time he attempted it but he hesitated
and blushed and turning again to his
father he said i cannot explain it before
you father i am so anxious it is very
odd i am not the least afraid you you
know but i feel so ashamed and anxious
i think i should do it a great deal better if
you were not by
very well said his father laughing 
then either you or i must go out the
room it seems luckily for you i am just
going into the next room ls that far
enough off though the folding doors are
o o o
open i assure you i shall not hear you
that will do perfectly said harry
 but what will you do about mamma 
she must stay to make tea said lucy
look here is the urn coming in had
not you better come out into the hall with
me harry 
h 
 no no said harry i do not mind
mamma and now i think it i want
the urn lucy look at the steam coming
from the top that urn do you recollect
a great while ago my father's holding a
cold plate over the steam coming from the
urn
yes lucy said she remembered it
well though it was a great while ago
she remembered that the cold the plate
had turned the steam into water again condensed
it she recollected the drops on
the plate which afterwards ran into each
other and down into little streams when
the plate was sloped
 yes interrupted harry you have
recollected enough that you are clear
then that cold can condense steam that is
can turn it back again into water
 perfectly clear said lucy
now recollect another thing said
harry which took up most room the
steam when it was steam or when it was
turned into water 
it took up much the most room when
it was steam said lucy i am sure
that cloud steam which you see rising
from the tea urn and which takes up so
much room in the air might if you held a
cold plate over it this minute be condensed
into a few drops which would not half
fill a tea spoon
very true said harry now do not
think any more about that but do you recollect
our talking a great while ago
about the tea kettle's boiling over as it is
called and do you remember my saying
that if the top the tea kettle was
screwed down tight and if the spout was
stopped so that no steam could get out
that i thought the tea kettle would burst
i remember it all said lucy and
papa said you were very right and i
remember afterwards the bursting and explosion
 my chesnuts and the story papa
told us his pouring the hot lead into the
damp elder to make a pencil and the
fact i read about the bursting a little
scientific dialogues
hollow brass ball in which there was water
that turned to steam and which caused
an explosion that blew a whole founder
to pieces
 then you have some idea the power
 steam when it expands said harry
to be sure i have said lucy i
know it is terribly great bursting and
killing people and tearing away how
frightened i should have been if i had
been papa when he was a little boy when
the lead bounced up to the top the
ceiling i am sure i was frightened enough
when my own horse chesnuts bounced
but if this terribly great power said
harry is carefully used and cleverly
used it will do as you shall see the most
surprising and the most useful things it
would raise water high as the house and
higher from the bottom the deepest
mine it could raise the weight this
room and all that is in it as high as the
top the highest tree and higher
 oh brother brother said lucy
it is quite tie it can do more in an
hour than two hundred horses and fourteen
hundred men it can drag loaded
waggons full coal such as you have
seen going step by step the horses pulling
hard it can pull these waggons up as
easily as i can pull your little cart
my dear brother how can i believe
it said lucy
it can drive across the sea against the
power the wind and the tide a great
ship with all the people in it and all their
horses and carriages and all that they
have in the world
is it really possible said lucy i
have heard people talking steam boats
and the working steam engines and
i remember papa's asking a gentleman who
was here the other day whether his steam
engine was an hundred horse power but
i never knew how this was nor could i
conceive that steam could do all this by
itself only steam like that said she
fixing her eyes upon the steam that still
came from the tea urn
yes only steam like that repeated
harry think what we men can make
it do at our bidding
really and truly harry said lucy
 it does more at men's bidding than any
 the genii in the arabian tales more
than any the slaves aladdin's lamp
for the hardest working them could only
be made to carry one house
very true indeed said harry and
for once he was pleased with an allusion
but continued lucy i should be
very much afraid its doing some great
mischief some day like the african magician
do you remember 
 but my dear interrupted harry
 do not tell me any thing more about
the african magician
only this one thing harry if you
would let me get it out my head i
should attend so much better
no my dear lucy is it not very
hard upon me that you are to say everything
that comes into your head and that
puts out mine all that i want to remember
about the steam engine for you 
i beg your pardon said lucy i
will not say a word more the african
magician go on
but poor harry could not go on immediately
 where was i said he to
himself what was i going to say
as he spoke he rubbed his forehead first
and then ran his fingers through his hair
from the roots upwards till it was all
pushed up and stood erect like quills
upon the fretful porcupine
now i recollect what i was going to
say cried harry look at the tea urn
lucy ah but now it is too late there
is not steam enough it is not strong
enough to do what i wanted you to see
but at first when the water was boiling
and the steam rushing out at top you
might have seen it pushing up the lid 
the urn till the steam got out then the
lid fell and lay still till more steam was
formed and pushed it up again i wish
you had seen it going up and down
 i have often seen it said lucy and
watched it moving because sometimes i
was afraid the top would be quite lifted
up and blown off
and so it would said harry if it
were not for these little holes look here
through which the steam escapes and
which were made on purpose to let it
escape without blowing off the top or
doing any mischief
that is very prudent i am glad the
holes are there said lucy
 but suppose they were not there
said harry and the top left loose as
it is now if the water boiled well as
people say if a great deal steam came
rushing up and pushing out through this
place where the top goes on you know
the top would be lifted up and suppose
i lay on the top this weight continued
he taking up from the table a small weight
which was used for keeping down papers 
 and suppose i put a lamp under the urn
so as to keep the water boiling and sending
up fresh steam what do you think
would happen then 
i am not sure said lucy it would
either burst the urn or lift up the top with
that weight upon it it would i am
sure lift up the top and weight because
that would be the easiest way for the steam
to get out
to be sure it would require much
less force said harry to lift this little
weight than to burst the urn the expansive
force steam you know i told
you would lift the house now suppose
that instead that urn with a little lamp
under it there was a great fire as large
as a kitchen fire and larger and a great
iron boiler as large as the boiler you have
seen in the kitchen and larger with water
boiling in it and over the mouth that
boiler suppose we put a cylinder like the
body a pump as large as that in the
yard and closed well round at the place
where it is put in so that the steam the
boiling water can get out no way but up
the cylinder
then said lucy how the steam
would rush up through the valve in the
piston what a cloud steam would come
out at the top 
stay stay lucy i was going to have
told you that in this piston there is to be
no valve it is to be a tight stopper now
suppose before i let the steam in that i
have the piston down at the bottom the
pump
 why then before you let in the steam
you must put a great weight to keep the
piston down or it would be thrown up to
the ceiling as the lead in papa's pencil
case was
and i believe said harry your
great weight would be thrown through
the ceiling and would break it to pieces
consider my dear if the small quantity
 water that was in papa's elder pencil
case could when turned into steam force
the lead up to the ceiling and if the
small quantity water that was left in
the little brass ball could burst and blowup
a whole founder such a quantity 
steam as this would be able to lift up
and blow up this room and all that is
in it
but if that is your only way lifting
gi'eat weights and lifting the house i
do not see how it can be useful
patience lucy suppose that we
know beforehand the weight whatever
we wish to lift we can calculate and
lessen the fire and lessen the steam till
it is just enough and no more than enough
to lift the weight gently up to whatever
height we please suppose now to the
top the pump then you do no mischief
you see
very well said lucy if you can
calculate exactly and make no mistake
that is very nice
but now suppose you want to do this
more than once to lift several weights
one after another could you do it you
have the piston and the weight up at the
top and the steam in the cylinder the
pump
i do not know said lucy for i
dare not take the weight off the piston i
dare not touch it
i would not advise you to touch it
indeed said harry
then what can i do said lucy
think said harry
but the idea the steam going oncoming
up through the pump frightens
me i will tell you what i would do 
i would put out the fire directly throw
water upon it
very well thought said harry
but then there is steam in the boiler
i would throw water into that if i
could but i cannot get at it i would
throw cold water all over the outside and
that would cool the steam
 but still there would be the steam in
the body the pump said harry
 and i cannot throw water into it because
 the stopper said lucy well
i will throw cold water over it all down
the sides and over the piston at top and
cool it and make it as cold as the plate
papa held over the urn and colder then
it would condense the steam within and
turn it into a very small quantity water
then what would happen said
harry
the piston would fall down there
would be nothing to hold it up the
steam would be all gone
and what would there be or would
there be any thing in the place the
steam asked harry
there would be nothing but a little
water there would be a vacuum all but
those drops water said lucy
very well indeed said harry now
you have the piston down how will you
raise it again i want to have another
weight brought up
then you know i must light the fire
and boil the water again said lucy
aye and wait till the cylinder is
heated too for till that is heated it will
condense the steam said harry
certainly said lucy you must wait
till it is hot
 but it would be very inconvenient
said harry to wait while you light the
fire and boil the water and so on cannot
you find any better way condensing
the steam without putting out the fire
every time 
lucy thought for a few moments and
answered perhaps without putting out
the fire it would do as well if i could but
let cold water into the boiler and into the
cylinder the pump
but why into the boiler said harry
because the fresh steam would come
up continually if i did not prevent it
said lucy
but suppose said harry you have
condensed the steam in the cylinder and
you only want the vacuum for an instant
or two just to let the piston fall and suppose
that for that little time the steam
from the boiler could be prevented from
coming in i need not tell you how but
it can
then i need not put out the fire
but i may condense the steam in the
cylinder said lucy that will be
much more convenient because afterwards
the steam will be ready to be let
in again under the bottom the piston
if you want another weight to be sent up
but still i do not know how to get the
cold water into the body the pump i
mean into the cylinder to condense the
steam
the steam said harry is let off
into a separate vessel called from its use
a condenser this vessel is surrounded by
cold water so that the steam is condensed
as soon as it comes into it
 and is this all the steam engine
said lucy
no my dear lucy it is only the
general principle i cannot explain all
to you i should only puzzle you there
are different sorts steam engines in
that invented by mr watt the expansive
force the steam is used in different
degrees to raise the piston and to force
it down
i did not know that the steam was
ever let in above the piston said lucy
yes it is i did not tell you that at
first lest i should puzzle you and i will
not now tell you exactly how it is done
and there is a great deal more to be explained
about the ways making the
steam engine raise weights or water or
work machinery in different directions
ours was but an awkward way raising
weights by putting them on the top the
piston suppose i want to raise water
from a pond you must put a beam out
from the top the piston like a scale
beam and with this you might work the
piston a pump fastened at the other 
 this beam
very convenient said lucy and
very simple
there are a great many other contrivances
said harry and ways 
making it turn wheels and pull and push
sideways or in any direction in which
you want to have work done or force
 
applied but i should tire and puzzle you
to death if i were to tell you all at once
papa took several days to explain to me
the parallel motion and the fly wheel
and the sun and planet motion and the
excentric
oh my dear brother cried lucy
stopping her ears this would puzzle me
to death indeed
therefore my dear i tell you i will
not say one word about any these
things today but i will leave your head
quite clear as i hope it is in the general
principle as papa calls it and here he
comes with his letter in his hand
mamma is beginning to pour out tea 
said lucy let us go to her
stay one minute lucy said harry
 now pray when you are called upon
to explain to papa be quite steady do
not be a coward and fancy that you do
not know what you do and do not be
too quick neither above all do not go
the least beyond what you really know
do not put in any your its like this 
vol i i
or it's like that when you have no
more to say stop
i will said lucy i will not say
one word more than is necessary nor make
one allusion or quotation i will be like
your own dear menelaus i'll say no more
than just the thing i ought
now papa will you ask lucy to explain
to you what she knows the
principle the steam engine said
harry walking up with her to the tea
table with a composed countenance
first harry said his father i
must ask your mother to read this letter
for me and i have a great deal to say to
her about it
harry sat down with a resigned look
and swallowed tea and eat bread and
butter without hearing one word 
what was going on till at last his
father turned to lucy and said now
my dear i am ready for you and the
steam engine
lucy who had been listening to the
letter declared she was afraid that the
whole the steam engine had gone out
 her head
in astonishment harry stared at her
and in a tone indignation exclaimed
is it possible lucy 
 stay do not frighten me said lucy
and perhaps i may get it back again
she did and she recollected all harry
had said to her she distinctly said no
more than just the thing she ought her
father was doubly pleased by the clearness
with which she made her explanation because
it showed that harry had understood
well what had been taught him
i promise you both said he that
the first time i have an opportunity i
will show you a steam engine
harry was delighted with this promise
and lucy clapped her hands and added
i know harry that the opportunity will
come soon
harry was going to ask her how she
knew this but his attention was taken
i 
off by his father's observing to him that
he had done well to refrain from describing
to his sister any the lesser
parts the machinery
lucy said it was not at all difficult
to me papa for he brought me up to the
steam engine by degrees and i was quite
surprised when i found i was at it i did
not know what he was about when he
began with your cold plate and the tea
urn and the expansive force the steam
and the condensing the water but i saw
plainly afterwards when i found out
where i was it was just like his way 
leading me blindfold on the gravel walk
and taking me to this place and that and
i do not know where i am or where he is
leading me till he takes the bandage off
my eyes then i am quite surprised at
what i see before me
ha ha lucy i thought you could
not get through without an allusion said
harry but he was well enough pleased
with this his spirits were so much raised
by this commendation and by the promise
 seeing a steam engine and a steamboat
and by lucy's success and his own
that he could not refrain from saying a
little more than just the thing he ought
he would now go on to tell her the names
 the first second third and fourth inventors
and improvers the steam engine
but he was fortunately stopped by his father's
getting up to look for a in
which he said he could find a poetic description
 the wonders performed by the
expansive force steam
oh i know that said lucy 
it is the same harry in which there
are the lines on the barometer and air
pump
the description the steam engine
said their father begins by doing honour
due to him who
bade with cold streams the quick expansion stop
and sunk the immense vapour to a drop
who was that lucy 
the inventor the steam engine
the man who first thought throwing
cold water upon it to condense the steam
said lucy
salary or the marquis worcester
i do not know which said harry you
know father there have been many disputes
for the honour this great invention

yes but let these rest for the present
harry said his father salary
is the person alluded to in these lines
do go on reading papa said lucy
i like those lines so much
her father continued 
pressed by the ponderous air the piston falls
resistless sliding through its iron walls
quick moves the balanc'd beam giant birth
wields its large limbs and nodding shakes the
earth 
the giant power from earth's remotest caves
lifts with strong arm her dark reluctant waves
each cavern'd rock and hidden depth explores
drags her dark coals and digs her shining ores
 yes i understand said lucy that
describes the steam engine bringing up
water from the bottom mines and dragging
the coal waggons as harry told me it
could
her father went on reading 
 next in close cells ribbed oak confined
gale after gale he crowds the struggling wind
th imprisoned storms through brazen nostrils roar
fan the white flame and fuse the sparkling ore
 the great bellows in forges and founders
which are moved by the steam engine
said harry i never should have
thought they could have roared so well in
poetry pray go on papa
here high in air the rising steam he pours
to claybuilt cisterns and to leadlin'd towers 
fresh through a thousand pipes the waves distils
and thirsty cities drink th exuberant rills 
these the vast millstone with inebriate whirl
on trembling floors his forceful fingers twirl
whose flinty teeth the golden harvests grind
feast without blood and nourish humankind
do you understand lucy said harry
i forget my dear whether i told you
that the steam engine keeps com mills
and all sorts mills going
lucy nodded do not let us interrupt
papa i will tell when i do not understand
said lucy but i understand
all as far as he has gone
now his hard hands on mona's rifted c'est
bosomed in rock her azure ores arrest 
with iron lips the rapid rollers seize
the lengthening bars iu their expansion squeeze 
descending screws with ponderous flywheels wound
the tawny plates the new medallions round
hard dies steel the cupreous circles cramp
and with quick fall his massy hammers stamp
the harp the lily and the lion join
and george and britain guard the sterling coin
 lucy i am sure you cannot understand
this said harry
no i was just going to say so harry 
i waited only till papa came to a full stop
but i know that mona means anglesey
her father said that she was right that
the azure ores allude to copper mines in the
isle anglesey or mona which are
worked by the steam engine cupreous
means coppers and the ores copper
being blueish the poet calls them mona's
azure ores the succeeding lines describe
machinery for coining copper first rolling
out thick bars it into plates thin as halfpence
then cutting those plates into circular
forms and stamping them with the arms
 ireland france and england the harp
the lily and the lion all which is done
by machinery without the hands men
and that machinery is kept at work by the
motion and power a steam engine
harry looked triumphant while his father
spoke these wonders performed by steam 
lucy could not conceive how it could do
all this her father repeated his promise
that whenever he had an opportunity he
would show her how it is done and lucy
whispered again to harry every soon too
perhaps
 is there no more father is there
nothing about the steam boat asked
any
 there is said his father and it
is curious that these lines were written
several years before steam boats had been
brought into use and at a time when it was
scarcely believed by any but a few courageously
ingenious persons that the steam
engine could ever be successfully or safely
i 
employed in driving forward vessels on the
water this prophecy at the time it was
made most people thought merely poetical 
and instead expecting that it would be
soon accomplished it was thought that it
would never be effected 
soon shall thy arm unconquer'd steam afar
drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car 
the slow barge now goes as fast as
you please said harry the rapid caris
to come and i dare say that will be accomplished
soon papa do not you think it
will and oh father read this here is
something about a flying chariot which we
did not hear 
or on idewaving winds expanded bear
the flying chariot through the fields air 
his father had purposely omitted to read
these and prudently declined giving his
opinion
harry became silent and thoughtful for
some minutes but occupied himself with
burning a lump sugar whose amber
drops as fast as they fell and cooled he
put into lucy's mouth and when the
sugar bason was taken from him he found
new recreation for his fingers and thoughts
in his mother's tambour needle which he
pushed and pulled up and down through
silk and through paper till she took that
from his hand and then he had no resource
but to lean with both his elbows on her
frame and to watch her plying the needle
lucy whispered from time to time 
will not you come and play at travellers
with me 
but in vain she twitched his elbow it
remained fixed
my mother's work is like a chain said
harry link within link loop within
loop
yes said lucy it is called chain
stitch
he watched the lengthening chain
which with the quick noise successful
pricks advanced towards him forming
a line from one the frame to the
other which was accomplished in two minutes
counted by the watch then scallops
and leaves pointed and round grew
under her hand nothing too difficult for
the dexterous hooked needle
it goes on so easily said harry it
seems to do it itself
 and do you think you could do it
harry as mamma does mamma pray
let mm have the needle and try
harry had little doubt that he should
succeed if he might be allowed to try because
he had most carefully observed all
his mother did he had watched her hand
under the frame and had seen as he said
how by a little quick motion she hung
the cotton or silk whichever it was over
the hook the needle and then pulled
both up together through the muslin exactly
through the middle the last link
and then dragged on a new loop with a
little twitch and twist and down again
with the needle
well observed and accurately described
i grant said his mother you are perfect
in the theory but now for the practice
she put the tambour needle into his
hand the feeling which he liked particularly
because its ivory handle was as
large as a pencil case and something fit
for a man to hold
now we shall see how the man will
work tambour work said lucy aye
down goes the needle pop through the
muslin easily enough but now get it up
again and the silk with it if you please
and can
harry turned the ivory handle to this
side and to that and leaned it this way
and that way and twisted and doubletwisted
the silk on the hook beneath and
twitched and plucked and pulled in vain
and came to pooh and pshaw and
 do not look at me pray i cannot do it
if you look at me
nor if we do not look at you said
lucy
i have done it said he dragging up
the needle by main force and making a
hole in the muslin through which he
hauled it
 oh harry what a hole 
i do not know how it happened said
harry but the needle is up at any rate
and the loop with it and i have one link
 the chain what you call one stitch and
now for the next which you see i will do
better
he tried again but the hole made it impossible
 he pulled out his first his only
stitch and tried again in a fresh corner
nothing ever did try his patience or ashe
thought nothing ever did try human
patience so much but by taking thought
he did get the needle and the loop safe
through this time without tearing the
muslin he persevered and in a quarter
 an hour had really worked a quarter
 an inch chain all crooked
dragged out short and long links various
sizes sad chainstitch as lucy
called it but still she could not deny that he
had done it his fingers were so hot that
he spread them out to cool and groaned
and took breath as his father said a coal
porter might do after setting down the
heaviest load
his father next took the needle in hand
with a theory as perfect with somewhat
more diffidence but with little better success
there was a knack in it which could
be learned only by practice but the gentlemen
talked very learnedly to each other
about it and agreed that their perfect theory
had helped would help or should have
helped them very much
but how wonderfully quickly my mother
does it said harry do it again
mamma pray how can you go on so
quickly with the work 
you think i go on quickly said his
mother but all that i could do in a daw
could be done by a machine harry in an
hour and by what machine do you think 
by your dear steam engine this is a use
for it which you never thought
 is it possible cried harry
 can these ms and outs and all this
delicate work and these pointed leaves
be all done by a steam engine said lucy
 a huge steam engine said harry
mamma how i should like to see it at
work doing the tambour work said lucy
perhaps i shall be able to show it to
you my dear said their father
 and soon whispered lucy to her
brother
what can you mean said harry i
heard you say ail soon over and over
again
my dear did not you hear the letter
and all papa and mamma were saying
about it said lucy
not i said harry
 you were sitting at the teatable all
the time beside me said lucy
very likely said harry i did not
hear a word that was said
what could you be thinking said
lucy
i do not know answered harry 
a bell crank i believe when i saw mamma
pull the bell cord i thought i would
show you the bell crank in the passage tomorrow
and explain by that the crank
motion in the steam engine
how full your head must be this
steam engine said lucy
 and you lucy my dear i was
thinking something to show to you
 thank you said lucy then i will
now tell you all that i heard that you did
not hear the letter was papa's answer to
sir something somebody the man the
gentleman husband to the lady dio told
 the shipwreck when she called here the
morning that i spotted my gown with the
dirty water from the pump and pond
but never mind that now said harry
get on my dear i want to hear what is
to come
papa's letter was to thank that gentleman
for the trouble he has taken in lookingfor
a house somewhere a great way off by
the seashore
and why did papa thank him for
that said harry
my dear any you are so slow in
understanding said lucy the house
is to be for papa and mamma and if there
is but room enough in it for us we are
to go with them
you do not say so cried harry starting
upright with joy
i do say so i heard it with these ears
and very good ears they are said lucy 
and papa told me i might hear his
letter said towards the it i hope
there may be two little rooms for harry
and lucy their mother and i wish to have
them with us
how kind oh any sort little
rooms any little dens would do said
harry i could sleep in a drawer ina
nutshell could not you lucy
to be sure said lucy but if they
cannot in any way find room for us we are
to be left with my uncle
oh cried harry uttering something
like a groan i hope we shall not be left
with my uncle though in general i like to
be with him very much but i never went
a journey a long journey and with papa
and mamma lucy think how delightful
it would be to see mountains and go
up them with my portable barometer
and to be by the sea side said lucy
i never saw the sea and i shall pick up
shells by the sea shore beautiful shells
and seaweed and sea urchins and we
shall live in a cottage oh think 
living in a cottage
and we shall see a steam boat and a
steam engine cried harry now i understand
it all but remember it is not
certain yet that we are to go lucy i will
not think it any more lest we should be
disappointed at last
 joy joy joy for you harry joy for
botvof us cried lucy the great black
trunk and the little black trunk and the
seatboxes and the carpet bag are coming
down from the garret to mamma s dressingroom
packing up is beginning and weare
to go
we but are you certain lucy how
do you know said harry i should not
like to be disappointed my dear
who would said lucy but no
danger my dear harry i heard the answer
to papa s letter and it says that there is
room for us only that one us must be
put in a very little closet which can just
hold a bed and a chair
i do not care how small it is if i can
but be crammed into it cried harry
nor do i said lucy i can sleep
on a sofa or anywhere so that we may
both go
 if we do not both go there will be no
joy said harry
but i tell you we shall both go mamma
says she can manage it they are to
set out the day after tomorrow at six o'clock
in the morning and i asked mamma
continued lucy if i might pack up your
things and mine today in the little black
trunk she says i may if i can only she
is afraid i cannot do it well enough but i
think i can bring me directly harry to
the dressing room all the things you want
to take with you and i will get all mine ina
minute
presently two great heaps appeared on
the dressingroom floor
there are all my goods said harry
pointing to one heap all these must go
and here are mine i hope they will
all go in said lucy looking doubtfully at
the little black trunk which stood between
them
harry pressing his hand down on lucy's
heap observed that they could be
squeezed almost to nothing cram my
things in any way said he i do not
care how so that they go only make
haste i will go and finish my latin lessons
and be back by the time you are
ready to lock the trunk ram my things
any way my dear repeated he as he left
the room
mamma is to see how the trunk is
packed when it is finished said lucy
and i must do it well
she packed and packed and squeezed
and crammed and rammed but in vain
she could not get in above half these
things
then she took out the trunk all she
had put in and by her mother's advice
began to sort her brother's and her own
into two classes necessaries and necessaries
by this operations her brother's
heap was diminished above twothirds and
her own nearly half when harry returned
he was not at all contented with her arrangement
and to satisfy him she gave up
several her books and reduced her portion
to exactly the same size as his
harry left her to pack the think and this
time having listened to her mother's advice
to lay each thing as she put it in as flat as
possible and to leave no holes or hollows
she succeeded in putting in all things
necessary there was one luxury her
own which she much desired to carry it
was a pasteboard tray that was made for
holding shells she emptied out all its
contents that she might fill it with a new
collection from the sea shore to her
great satisfaction there appeared just room
for it at the top in the arched lid the
trunk
her mother was called to see how easily
it locked and she examined the packing
and pronounced that it was as well done
as could be expected from so young a
packer she ran to report her success to
harry and to summon him to see how
nicely her shell tray lay at the top all the
things fitting under the arched roof the
trunk she met him coming up stairs with
a huge as she thought under his
arm he asked eagerly if she had finished
packing the trunk
 quite finished said she come and
look at it and you shall lock it yourself
harry looked disappointed and said that
he was very sorry the trunk was quite full
because he had found something else to put
in which he wished particularly to carry
with him and his father had just told him
that it must not go loose in the carriage
what is it said lucy fetch it if
it is not very large perhaps i can squeeze
it m
harry half ashamed to ask the question
said could you get in what i have
here under my arm 
this immense quarto harry
impossible cried lucy it is as large
as half the whole trunk
it is only a false my dear said
harry
false or true that does not make it
less said lucy
but as it opens said harry and has
an almost empty inside it will hold a great
quantity it will take up scarcely any
room in the trunk only the thickness its
own sides and they are very thin wood
covered with paper do my dear lucy
try if you can get it in it is a camera
obscura which my uncle has just given tome

 indeed said lucy well my dear
i will try my very best
but on opening the false she observed
that it was not nearly empty that
there was some apparatus with inside it
which took up a gieat deal room she
saw especially a glass which she was
afraid would be broken if she put anything
with inside he urged her however
to try if it were packed with soft things
such as her frocks all would be safe if
we can but carry the camera obscura with
us said he when we get to any pretty
country and to the cottage by the sea side
we shall see such beautiful landscapes in
it and the boats and ships sailing oh do
lucy contrive to carry it
i will give up my shell tray cried
lucy sand then i can make room for it
perhaps
there is a dear good girl said harry
she ran and he followed her to the
trunk he saw how nicely the tray fitted
and he saw her take it out and put it
quite away he heard a little sigh as she
locked the closet door upon it after putting
it out sight
my dear lucy said he i cannot
bear that you should give up your tray i
dare say you wish to carry that and your
shells as much as i wish for my camera
obscura
never mind said lucy
but i do mind and the more because
you do not said harry
but i will tell you why you need not
care so much harry said lucy i can
vol i k
make another tray pasteboard easily
when we get to our journey's and that
will be time enough for my shells at the
sea shore but you harry could not make
a camera obscura
every true said harry thank you
but you have all to unpack which you
had packed so neatly
never mind repeated lucy if i
can but get it in
you need not unpack to the bottom
stop my dear said harry the camera
obscura is only about onethird the depth
 the trunk
in it went and there was a little space
at its ends and beyond its breadth into
which things could be crammed and should
be crammed as harry observed to keep it
tight the greatest trial lucy's patience
was his standing by all the time she
was repacking advising all the while and
saying as she put in each thing that
will not go there or this would fit
better c after she had to the best 
her skill repacked the trunk there remained
on the floor a new jacket and
trowsers harry's the jacket too was
covered in front with innumerable hard
sugarloved shaped buttons which took
up a terrible quantity room and which
could not be compressed harry would
have found an easy remedy by leaving
jacket and trowsers and all behind he
thought he could do perfectly well without
them so did not his mother upon appeal
to her she decided that they must
go what was to be done harry though
it would give lucy a great deal trouble
thought he saw how it could be managed
i do not mind the trouble said lucy
if i can succeed at last but i think it is
really downright impossible to get more
into that trunk without breaking the hinges
in squeezing it down
harry suggested that if lucy would
unpack the whole trunk and put the
camera obscura at the bottom perhaps she
could get in more because his jacket with
its hard buttons might then lie at the top
as her tray had lain under the curve the
k
top the trunk by having the flat box
uppermost some that space he thought
was lost
lucy was not quite clear that he was
right but however she in a most obliging
manner began to unpack the trunk
again and said she would try it his way
all any age who have a good opinion
 their own powers packing and who
has not will give lucy more credit for
this than for all the rest she gave up her
own opinion and repacked upon her brother's
suggestion with as much zeal and
alacrity as if it had been an idea her
own we are happy to state that this
time she succeeded in putting in what was
required camera obscura jacket trowsers
and all to harry's joy and admiration
her mother was pleased
 my dear little girl said she i am
glad to see not only that you are goodnatured
to your brother that i did not
doubt but i am glad to perceive that
you are goodhumoured too good temper
is necessary even to the most goodnatured
people i have often seen goodnatured
people more ready to make great
sacrifices than little ones for their friends 
but the little ones are most frequently
wanted especially from women almost
every day their lives and if they
make these in a good humoured obliging
manner as you lucy did just now
they will be beloved and as far as they
can will make the friends they live with
happy
yes mamma said lucy as you do
you came into my head when i was unpacking
the trunk for harry i recollected
your unpacking the great trunk one night
at coventry when the maid was out and
you were tired to death and aunt pierrepoint
wanted something which she said
was at the bottom the tank and it was
not there after all mamma i recollect
another thing one day when you gave up
going to warwick castle which i know you
wished very much to see well mamma
on this journey which we are going to take
you shall see that if i have any trials i
will be as good i mean in proportion
said lucy
harry at this moment returned to the
room with their hygrometer and its register
in his hand he told lucy that he
thought it would be useless for them to
keep the register while they were travelling
as they should change every day to
different parts england and it was a
register the weather in one place that
was required lucy was glad he had
found out that it would be useless she was
sure that it would have been impossible for
them to keep it while on their journey 
and she felt relieved from a great responsibility
when harry determined to leave it
with their uncle till their return lucy
further observed that it would also be impossible
she feared to go on regularly
with harry in his course scientific lessons
for which she was really sorry though
the pleasures travelling she acknowledged
might make up for this interruption

yes said harry that is true we
must give up our regular lessons till we
come back but as papa has just been
telling me it will do us both a great deal
 good and me in particular to see new
things
delightful said lucy and thank
you papa and thank you mamma for
thinking such a pleasant way doing
us good
at six o'clock in the morning harry and
lucy were seated opposite to their father
and mother in an open carriage bags
books parcels nicely packed in and harry's
portable barometer snug beside him
drive on
the young travellers stood holding by
something no doubt according to the ever
repeated and nevertobe toooftenrepeated
counsel they looked from side to side
as they passed bidding goodbye to each
well known object half sorry to leave home
yet glad to go on to something new it
was a fine morning the sun shining the
air fresh and
tt
herb tree fruit and flower
glittering with dew
their way led through a lane the hedges
on each side full honeysuckles with
white and pink bind weed straggling above
about and underneath the ground under
the hedges was covered with wild flowers
 many colours abundance that most
delicate weed if weed it should be called
which paints the banks with blue well
known to all the world by one name or
other to the unlearned as speedwell to the
learned as veronica chancery there was
also abundance that erect plant with its
spire crimson bells spotted or plain by
peasants foxgloves by botanists digitalis
called valued by the old as a cure for the
dropsy and loved by the young for the
loud pop pop pop which in skilful
hands can be made by its flowers harry
asked lucy if she knew why the foxglove
is called digitalis
no said lucy why
because digit ale is the latin for a
finger a glove said harry
and the shape these bells is very
like the finger a glove said lucy but
whybglove foxes do not wear gloves
their father said that perhaps it might
have been called so from growing in the
haunts foxes
when they came to the the lane
and the road opened to the view freshly
mown meadows and extensive com fields
lucy exclaimed
look look harry at the gossamer
glittering in the sun all over that field as
far as we can see do you see it weaving
up and down with every breath wind
pray mamma look at this immense cobweb
net all spangled with dew is it not
beautiful most beautiful harry
harry answered eyes but it was ayes
uttered in a cold tone which did not satisfy
lucy yet he looked at the gossamer
earnestly but he was always more curious
about the causes whatever he saw
than pleased by their appearance while
k 
lucy had been admiring the glittering
floating waving net harry had been considering
how or by what this net was
made lucy said that in her favourite
 insects and in other books she
had read something about gossamer he
begged she would tell him all she knew
 it directly
and as fast as she could she told him
that all these shining threads are made
by a very small insect the garden spider
who like other spiders can throw out from
their bodies a sort glutinous substance
which hardens in the air some say that
the spider leaves the threads behind him
as he darts through the air in search 
food others say that he has the power
 throwing it out before him and that it
catches upon the blades grass or on the
rough edges leaves and bushes and then
being pulled tight by the animal forms as
it were a bridge or road in the air for
him to pass from place to place he has
been called by some people the flying
dialogues on entomology trees cyclopedia
spider and the threads are called air
threads and sometimes these are seen
floating over head and sometimes they are
borne down by the weight the dew and
then caught on the bushes harry asked if
lucy ever saw the spider throw out or leave
behind him these air threads
she had not seen it herself but she
remembered that one man in particular
who wrote about the flying spider declared
that he one day saw him throw
out from his body this substance and saw
him afterwards mount and ride away
upon it
exact harry was preparing to question
whether the flying spider flew or crept or
rode walked or darted upon the gossamer
or whether he moved his own free will
or was blown or borne away by the wind
but lucy too quick for his questions
hastened to tell him something more that
she had read another insect called the
silk spider who spins silk which is almost
as fine some say finer than that the
silk worm a pair stockings were actually
made the spidersilk they were
presented as lucy assured him to the
french academy sciences and were
much admired harry's attention became
more respectful when he heard the
academy sciences
i was thinking said he that great
use might be made all that gossamer if
it could be spun and woven
that has been thought often said
lucy people at the time the stockings
were made hoped that the spider would
do as well as the silkworm and they set
the spiders at work in paper cases made
on purpose but after they had been kept
many months spinning in their paper cells
their work was measured and it was
found that nearly three hundred pf the
hardest working spiders cannot produce
as much silk in the same time as one good
active silk worm
still harry contended that since there
are so many spiders the great numbers
might make up for the little they do and
as we have them always ready how much
better it would be to set them properly to
work than to brush them and their
cobwebs away or to crush them to
death
to this lucy replied that the common
house spider who is or ought to be
brushed away is not the silk spinner that
the silk spinners were not as common as
harry imagined besides many faults
continued she are found with their way
 working they break their threads or
spin them only in short pieces so that
their silk cannot be wound it can only be
spun and the reeling takes off its lustre
this want lustre was complained in
the famous pair spidersilk stockings
presented to the french academy on
the contrary the silk worm spins her silk
without breaking she winds it round and
round into cocoons which can be easily
unwound by a careful person what
length harry do you think the silk worm
can spin without breaking 
harry was no judge spinning but
since he must guess he would say about
as long as the field over which the gossamer
spread perhaps about a quarter
 a mile
he did not think it possible but he said
it on purpose to guess something provokingly
beyond what he supposed any silkworm
could do
a quarter a mile repeated lucy
that is a good large guess but you must
know that a silkworm can spin without
breaking as much as when unwound is six
miles long and if she is not lazy can do
this in nine days believe it or not
harry as you please but i assure you it
is true and what spider ever did as
much
harry looked as if he wished to urge
something more in favour the spiders
but had nothing else to say except that
still he did not doubt that some way
would be invented making them useful
oh my dear exclaimed lucy i
forget my very best argument spiders
can never work together like good silkworms
because they quarrel and fight
and eat up one another my insect 
says that i do not know how many
above forty or fifty that were shut up
together in one room with plenty flies
and pith quills and all the delicacies
they like only two them were at the
 some days found alive and you
know it would be impossible to give each
 them a separate house so there is an
 the matter
an the matter indeed said
harry i should never have thought 
having any thing to do with them if you
had told me at first that they eat one another
well lucy continued harry
thanks to you and your insect books
we have had a great deal diversion out
 that field gossamer
i feel much more pleasure in looking
at things said lucy when i know
something about them even if it is ever
so little
and then there is the hope tjw
grand thing that we are to see by and by
said harry papa when do you think
we shall see a steam engine 
very soon my dear said his father
we are now in lancashire where there
are many manufactories in which the machinery
is worked by steam engines i
hope that in the town in which we are to
breakfast i shall be able to show you
the grand thing as you call it harry
to day this morning exclaimed
lucy
harry in grave delight rose from his
seat to return his very best thanks and
in an uncommonly emphatic tone began
with 
i am very much obliged to you in
deed father
but while he was pronouncing this in
his sober manner a branch a tree under
which they were going caught his hat
and candied it off a little thing could
make lucy laugh before breakfast when
she was weak and hungry and long after
the hat had been regained and replaced
and after the accident was forgotten by
their father and mother who were quietly
reading lucy shook with inextinguishable
laughter even till they came in sight
 the town where they were to breakfast
after breakfast they walked with their
father and mother through the town to
the place where they were to see a steam
engine a variety objects caught lucy's
attention as they walked through the busy
streets but harry was so intent upon
what he expected to see at the his
walk that he did not look either to the
right or the left as he passed
much as his expectations had been
raised he was not disappointed when he
came to the reality the ease and silence
with which the huge beam the steam
engine moved up and down struck him
with admiration and he stood for sometime
satisfied with watching its uniform
motion next he enjoyed the pleasure
 recognizing each part the great machinery
that he had seen in the engravings
which he had studied and which
he had understood the descriptions
lucy could not immediately comprehend
what she saw she could not extend
her ideas from the small scale the
engravings to the great size the machine
which she now beheld another
difficulty occurred she could not at one
view take in all the parts she did not
know where to look for the boiler and the
cylinder and all the innumerable small
pipes puzzled her however with her
father's assistance she by degrees made
out the principal parts as they were seen
in different stages the building for all
could not be seen at once
goodnatured harry delayed to gratify
his own curiosity till lucy was quite clear
in every thing she wished to understand 
then he began to question his father he
wanted to know what work this steamengine
was doing he heard some sounds
like the working machinery and he
wished to see what was doing the
guide who had admitted them now
threw open a door and they saw a verylarge
apartment full whirling whirring
machinery rows spindles full 
cotton like the spindles a spinningwheel
standing upright in frames which
reached nearly across the room each
spindle being supplied by a long line 
untwisted cotton from spools or bobbins
above between each row stood a woman
or child watching the work and
keeping the machinery clean
this is one arkwright's cotton
mills said the guide all this machinery
is kept at work by this steam
engine and two other rooms full 
cottonframes which you may see if you
please above and below stairs
lucy uttered an exclamation surprise
harry was silent with admiration
turning back towards the steam engine
he looked about to find where and how
the motion was communicated from the
engine to the spinning machinery his
father who guessed what he was looking
for showed him where the shaft was carried
through the wall
harry had once seen a cotton manufactory
long ago but he had only a
confused remembrance whirling spools
and noise and dust here as he observed
there was scarcely any dust and
but little noise he was easier to examine
and anxious to understand all he saw
but while he was watching them the
quick motion the spinning spindles
suddenly ceased and looking back to
the steam engine he saw the huge beam
descending with a soft seemingly expiring
motion
what is the matter cried harry
nothing master answered the guide
smiling at his alarm nothing but that
it is our dinner time we stop the engine
and all the machines leave off working
for an hour till we come back and
set the engine going again
and is it possible that the steamengine
and all these machines can be
stopped so soon and so easily cried
harry
the man pleased by the great interest
which he saw that harry felt showed
him how the whole was stopped by
closing the valves the cylinder and
how the steam was let off after the engine
had been stopped
the women and children were now
clearing out the large room to go to
their dinners and in a few minutes the
apartment was emptied human creatures
and all was rest and silence harry
looked blank he was afraid that he
should not see hear or learn any thing
more and he told lucy he thought it
very unlucky that they had come at the
workmen's hour dinner but on the
contrary this proved a happy circumstance
 for their father asked and obtained
permission to stay during this
quiet hour in the cotton mill and he
made use this time to explain it and
to give them some account the beginning
and progress the invention and 
its improvement
probably all spinning said he was
originally done as it is now in the east
and in some the southern parts 
europe by holding in the left hand something
like a distaff with the material to
be spun wrapped round it with the right
hand the spinner draws out the fibres 
this material whatever it may be from
the distaff as in common spinning it is
twisted by a spool or spindle hanging at
the the thread the spool being
previously twirled by the finger and thumb
when the motion ceases or diminishes so
as not to be sufficient to twist the thread
what is spun is wound upon the spool and
the twirling is renewed this is a simple
but tedious mode spinning by degrees
it was improved and that ingenious contrivance
the spinningwheel such as that
with which you are well acquainted lucy
was brought into use in england for spinning
flax for spinning wool you know a
different sort machine is used
yes said lacy i recollect the large
high wheel with which i saw a woman
spinning wool
 now let us go on to the spinning 
cotton said her father and the machinery
for that purpose to understand and
follow the history any invention the first
thing necessary is to have a clear idea 
what is required to be done and the
difficulties that are to be conquered when
cotton is taken out the bale or large
parcel in which it is brought from the indies
it is generally in hard lumps sometimes
stringy to prepare it for carding
it is beaten with sticks to loosen it otherwise
it would break or spoil the teeth
 the cards it is then carded the sole
object which is to separate all the fibres
from each other cards something like those
you have seen used in carding common
wool are employed for this purpose the
cotton is taken from the card in the form
 a roll or tail about a foot long formerly
in the old way spinning the next
operation was to attach the this roll
to a wooden spindle placed horizontally
which could be turned round by a large
wheel the spinner gave the wheel a
twirl and immediately carrying back her
hand in which she held the other 
the roll the cotton was lengthened suppose
from one foot to five and at the
same time it was twisted the direction in
which the hand moved had always a certain
inclination to the spindle so that the
thread might slip off over the the
spindle at every revolution by this
means it is twisted
 yes said lucy i understand this 
i have seen it in spinning common wool
very well this is called longwheel
spinning continued her father but it
occurred to a poor weaver the name 
hargrave that he could improve this method
as but little strength was employed
in drawing out the cotton thread or in
turning the spindle which twisted it he
perceived that if one woman had ten pair
 hands and ten spindles and could move
them at once in the proper direction in
drawing out the cotton thread she could
spin ten times as much in the same
time
 papa interrupted lucy if the woman
had had a hundred spindles and a
hundred hands like briareus she might
have spun a hundred times as much
 not unless she had known how to use
her hundred hands said her father hands
without head would do little but now
without talking briareus how do you
think one head contrived to supply the
place many hands hargrave's difficulty
was to hold fast and draw out many threads
at once keeping them separate and pulling
them evenly while the spindles were
twisting them to accomplish this purpose
he took two slips wood and cut
their edges so that they could lie close together

like the edges a parallel ruler
said lucy
 yes said her father and between
the edges these he held fast the ends 
the several rolls cotton wool which
vol i li

 
were to be drawn out and twisted the
other ends the rolls course you know
were fastened on the spindles one on each 
and after they had been drawn out and
twisted the motion the spindles continuing
the thread was wound round upon
them now suppose the spindles to beset
in motion and that while they are turning
he draws his ruler back then you see
each roll cotton would be drawn out
and twisted at once as if each were spun
by a separate hand
i see said lucy at least i understand

 there are some contrivances necessary
in doing this which i will not
describe to you all the particulars lest i
should puzzle you added her father
 thank you papa said lucy but
how did the man set the spindles in motion
you said suppose they were turning
but you did not tell us how
he placed the spindles perpendicularly
side by side in a row eight i
think he tried at first and he set them in
motion by means the large wheel or
loig wheel as they call it which his wife
used in spinning wool so that they should
all move at once the wheel had a handle
which was turned by his wife whilst the
ruler which held the cotton roving was
drawn back and they were as he had expected
pulled out and twisted at the same
time
 how happy he must have been cried
harry when he first saw it do when
he saw the eight threads drawn out and
the spindles spinning them all at once 
how i should like to have been him at that
instant 
 i should have liked to have been in
his wife's place at that instant said lucy
how happy she must have been and his
children if they were standing by looking
at it so it succeeded perfectly
 not so fast lucy my dear it succeeded
for so much but far from perfectly
said her father his first was but a
very rude machine and he had much difficulty
in bringing it to a state fit for work

ing then he advanced from eight to ten
twenty eighty spindles and he improved
his machine so that it was brought into
common use and he called it a spinning
jenny
a spinning jenny very right
cried lucy i suppose his vsife's name
was jenny i hope he made a great deal
 money poor man to support his family
 i wonder how he came first to think
 this invention said harry
it is said answered his father but
i am not sure that it is true that the first
idea it was suggested to hargrave by
an accident a number young people
were one day assembled at his house at
the hour usually allotted for dinner they
were at play and they by chance overturned
the wheel at which hargrave's wife
was spinning wool the thread remained
in her hand and the spindle was then perpendicular
and the wheel horizontal the
wheel being prevented by the frame work
from touching the ground it continued to
turn round with the motion which had been
given to it and kept the spindle in motion
hargrave's attention was fixed upon it and
it is said that he uttered exclamations 
delight and again and again set the wheel
in motion while it lay on the floor and
stood looking at it a long time the bystanders
thinking that he did so only from
idleness
 aye but he was not idle said harry 
he was at work inventing at that moment
 but how did the overturning the
wheel help him 
 that part the story i am not
clear answered harry's father it is said
that hargrave had made attempts to spin
with two spindles with the common wheel
for spinning wool and that he had tried to
use his left hand as well as his right in
drawing out the thread but that he had
always found this attempt ineffectual on
account the horizontal position the
spindles but when he observed them
standing perpendicularly in the overturned
wheel he saw this difficulty obviated and
he thought so placing his spindles
so then cried lucy his invention
was made by accident by the lucky accident
 the overturning that spinning wheel
how often and how many inventions are
made by accident
no said her father inventions are
never made by accident to invent is to
combine or put things together for a particular
purpose this which requires
thought cannot be done by mere chance 
though accident may and often does suggest
the first hint an invention to an
observing mind or to a mind intent upon
accomplishing a particular purpose and
discovers the means that may be used 
as in this instance was the case with
hargrave how many people have seen
spinning wheels overturned without ever
inventing a spinning jenny but now
let me go on to tell you the next improvement
that was made in cotton spinning

 what did not the spinning jennies
do it all perfectly said lucy
 no no lucy said her father you
must not be in such a hurry we cannot
come to perfection so soon the spinning
jennies did only part what was wanted
the cottonthread spun by the jenny was
found to be rough spongy and weak it
could be used only for the woof in weaving
cotton the warp could not be made 
it the warp was then made linenthreads
which were strong and smooth
from what did this defect in the cotton
spun by the spinning jenny arise
from the fibres the cotton not being
laid smooth and parallel to each otherwhile
it was drawn out and twisting in
spinning by hand lucy you recollect seeing
the spinner not only draw the thread
out but press and move it at the same time
between her finger and thumb this
smoothed the fibres the cotton and
kept them parallel with each other now
this was wanting in the spinning jenny
the motion the hand in drawing out
the thread was well imitated by the rulers
or clasps which holding it fast when
drawn back answered the same purpose 
but the motion the spinner's finger and
thumb and the effect produced by it was
to be supplied
how did hargrave do that said
harry
he did not do it answered harry s
father it was accomplished by another
person mr arkwright who like hargrave
was originally a poor and illiterate
man but who had the habit observation
and the power invention
well how did arkwright do it said
harry eagerly
 by passing the cotton between rollers
said his father by passing it successively
between three pair rollers placed
near each other the upper roller each
pair is pressed down with different weights
the first pair rollers through which the
cotton is pressed and passed turns slowly 
the second faster and the third more
quickly each with a steady motion now
suppose harry that the last pair rollers
moved eight times as fast as the first pair
then eight times more length cotton
would pass between that pair rollers
than what had passed between the first
pair consequently the same quantity would
be drawn out to eight times the length and
eight times the fineness
very ingenious said harry i wonder
how arkwright came to think passing
the cotton between rollers
it is said harry replied his father
that arkwright had had frequent opportunities
 seeing in iron works iron bars
drawn out by being passed between rollers
and he afterwards applied this idea to
the drawing out cotton
i am surprised he ever thought it
said harry because the fine fibres 
cotton wool and iron bars are so different
still there is some likeness said
lucy in the motion drawing out the
thread thinner and thinner and smoother
and smoother so you see harry there
is good sometimes in observing likenesses
what i have said continued their
father may give you some idea the
effect the action the rollers i should
l
further tell you that in the undermost 
each pair rollers were cut fine little
grooves or furrows along the whole its
surface to roughen it so as to prevent the
cotton from slipping the upper rollers
were covered with leather the passing
the cotton iovings between these rollers
pressed together as i have described to
you with different weights and moving
with different velocities had the same
effect upon the cotton as that which is produced
by the pressure and motion the
spinner's finger and thumb smoothing
down the loose fibres laying and keeping
them parallel with each other and at the
same time drawing them out so as to make
a finer thread
so at last said lucy arkwright did
by the use rollers what a woman did
at first by the motion her finger and
thumb
yes said harry but consider how
much more was done in the same time in
one day perhaps by the rollers than a woman
could do in her whole life spinning
and how difficult and how very ingenious
it was to imitate by machinery that motion
 the finger and thumb and this
was mr arkwright's great invention
it was said his father
but what became the spinning
jennies said harry were they laid
aside when arkwright made these improvements
and erected these mills
the spinning jennies are very much
laid aside i believe said his father inconsequence
 the defects which i mentioned
but for some purposes the cotton
they spin is preferable and for these the
jennies are still used
 since arkwright's time have any
great improvements been made father
said harry
no improvement has been made in
the principle his mode spinning but
many in the simplicity and the perfecting
 the machinery the use steam and
steam engines instead water and waterwheels
for keeping these mills in motion
is in many places great importance
 the various improvements in the detail
 the machinery i will only mention one
to you an invention made by a mr samuel
crompton
that's right said harry i am glad
papa always remembers and tells the name
 the inventors
mr crompton observed and joined
together much that was essentially useful
in hargrave's spinning jenny and in arkwright's
rollers or twist frame and he made
a third machine which combined many 
the advantages the former two and
which is preferred for spinning fine cotton
but is inferior in spinning coarse this
machine is called the mule
 should like to see the mule said
harry
but you cannot see and understand
every thing at once said his father
 hear the workmen coming from dinner
said lucy
now we shall see this cottonmill 
arkwright's at work said harry
the guide coming in at this moment
and hearing the last words harry said and
the name arkwright began to speak 
the immense fortune which sir richard had
made by his inventions and improvements
sir richard interrupted hairy
how did he grow into sir richard
the king conferred upon him the honour
 knighthood answered the workman
and he went on speaking the fine
houses and estates sir richard arkwright
and his descendants have purchased
did you ever hear sir said he 
the birthday present which sir richardson
made to each his six sons each
found on his table on the morning his
birthday twenty thousand pounds
twenty thousand pounds six times
twenty said lucy that is one hundred
and twenty thousand pounds what a
sum 
and all the consequence one man's
invention said harry
and industry and perseverance said
his father arkwright had great difficulties
to struggle with not only in perfecting
his contrivance but in reducing it
to practice and in establishing his right to
the invention
the workmen were by this time pouring
into the room men women and children
and the machinery was set agoing again ina
minute or two and all were busy even
lucy as well as harry had some idea 
what was doing they knew the use 
the spindles and the cylinders without
being perplexed by the smaller parts
 the machinery they had a complete
view each process that the cottonwool
undergoes after it is taken out its
pod till it is manufactured into the finest
cotton
as they were leaving one the rooms
the guide showed them a heap hanks or
skeins cotton yarn all which as he told
them had been spun by the mule from a
single pound fine cotton
there are here three hundred and
fifty hanks said he and each hank
would measure eight hundred and forty
yards and the whole if stretched out
would make a thread one hundred and
sixtyseven miles in length
 one hundred and sixty seven miles
repeated lucy what would your flying
spiders say to this harry
or your silkworms lucy said
harry i think your good active best 
silkworms never spun more than a silk
the length six miles
at any rate said lucy men and
women beat spiders and silkworms both
in spinning
her father observed that the proper
object comparison between rival spinners
is not the length the thread but
the fineness and i apprehend said
he that either a silkworm or spiders
thread is as fine as one fibre cotton
wool and the finest thread cotton must
be composed many fibres so that
notwithstanding lucy's exultation in the
superiority men and women spinners
over worms and spiders harry was compelled
to give judgment in favour the
animals
 but their superiority is owing only to
instinct and ours to ingenuity and reason
you know harry said lucy it is no
merit theirs that they have their materials
prepared for them better than we
have
here the debate about the spiders and
silkworms was interrupted by the entrance
 a gentleman who was the principal
proprietor the cotton manufactory
and the conversation turned upon the prodigious
sale cotton goods and muslin
in different parts the world especially
in england
you are aware madam said he
turning to lucy's mother that muslin
were formerly all made in india and that
it is only thirty or forty years since we
first attempted to make them in england
and not till within these few years that we
have brought them to their present perfection

lucy's mother was well aware this 
she said she remembered when she was a
child seeing some the first muslin made
in england and that it was coarse and
rough and looked ill and wore ill and
that no one then thought english could
ever equal indian muslin but now it is
difficult for the nicest eye to detect the difference
in the appearance and in the wearing
 they are as good if not better
harry's father turned to him and whispered
 if you put me in mind i will tell
you some other time by what ingenious and
bold contrivance that roughness in the
first english muslin which your mother
complained was afterwards prevented
the gentleman continued speaking and
when harry heard his voice again he was
telling the immense quantity and value
 the muslin now made in england and
scotland
all this we owe said he to our
using ingenious machinery in these countries
instead doing all by the labour
 men's hands as in india perhaps you
are not yet aware sir said he turning
to harry's father the magnitude 
the cotton manufacture ita machinery
earns for england one thousand pounds
every working hour forty thousand
pounds weight cotton wool is spun and
in three minutes the length the thread
spun would more than circumscribe the
whole earth
as this was said they were passing
through an apartment where lucy saw a
machine for winding the pretty little balls
 cotton she wished to stay to look at it
 oh papa may i not look at this
but her father answered no my
dear you have seen and heard enough 
quite enough if you were to see more
you would confuse what i hope is now
clear in your heads come away
in the evening lucy acknowledged that
she was rather tired and was glad to rest
and to stay with her mother who did not
wish to go out again but harry boasting
that he was as fresh as ever was proud
to be allowed to accompany his father who
was going to walk out to see the town
after passing through several streets
they came to a broad public walk on a
high terrace shaded with trees from
whence looking back they had a fine
view the town by the red light the
setting sun which beautifully illuminated
several windows especially those a
gothic church as harry was returning
through the streets he regretted that lucy
had not been with them and he asked his
father whether they were to go avvay from
this town early in the morning or if he
would stay another day his father who
perhaps was thinking something else
answered in an absent manner i do not
know my dear that will depend upon
circumstances
harry was considering as he trudged
on what could be meant by that will
depend upon circumstances when on
turning the corner the street his thoughts
were stopped and his eyes struck with a
sudden blaze lights gas lights harry's
admiration lasted in silence the whole
length the street when turning into
another still more bright he exclaimed
it is almost as light as day father
what kind lights are these and what
are they made 
his father told him that they were
called gas lights and that they were made
 gas obtained from coal
harry asked how is gas different
from other flame candle or fire 
his father told him that all flame is gas
set on fire in a common fire in a candle
or lamp what you see and call flame is
gas which when set on fire continues to
flame when exposed to the air
harry asked how is gas got out 
coal
his father told him by the coal
being strongly heated in iron vessels called
retorts which have but one opening for the
gas to escape from into the reservoir where
it is preserved
harry next inquired how the gas gets
from the reservoir to the small pipes so
as to light all the houses in the street
where he saw gas flaming at the windows
suppose a tumbler to be inverted in a
bason water said his father you
know that as there is air with inside the
tumbler that air will prevent it from sinking
in the water
certainly said harry
but you may put weight upon the
tumbler till you compress the air in the
inside and then the water will first rise to
supply the place the compressed air and
what will happen afterwards harry 
i think nothing would happen father
but that the water in the bason would continue
pressing up the air till it had forced
it into the smallest space possible
very true to the smallest space to
which it is possible for the water to compress
it but the air being compressed its
elasticity continually increases till it not
only resists the pressure the water but
drives out the water from the tumbler and
raises it in the surrounding bason now
suppose one a small pipe were
introduced under the edge the tumbler
what would happen
the compressed air would be forced
into the pipe to be sure said harry
and if the pipe were open at the
other said his father
the air would go out at the other
 said harry
and what would happen to the
tumbler said his father
the tumbler would continue descending
till all the air was driven through the
pipe answered harry
it would so now instead common
air suppose your tumbler filled with
gas exactly the same thing would take
place this is called a gas holder and
this is the manner in which the gas is continually
forced from the reservoir through
the pipes
i understand it said harry and
i hope you will some time or other show
this experiment to lucy it would be
very easily done with a glass and
bason
 you may show it to her yourself
said his father
does the gas light immediately 
itself when it comes into the air
no when a person wants to light it
he holds a candle to it and it flames as
you see in the open air
suppose it was to rain or suppose
the wind blew strong said harry what
would become these lights look at
these flaring without any glass round
them in the open window in this butcher's
shop would not they be extinguished
 
not by slight rain or wind said his
father one great advantage gaslights
is that they are not easily extinguished
by rain or wind
harry's admiration increasing the more
he heard their advantages and considered
their convenience and beautiful
brightness he wondered why people had
not thought using them sooner and
he asked if this gas had never been known
to exist till now
his father told him that it had been
long known as what we see in the flame
 fire and candles but that till lately
no one had thought obtaining it in
quantities and bringing it into common
use in the manner in which he now saw
it i could tell you harry two curious
anecdotes which i heard from a friend
can you father said harry then
pray do will you be so good as to tell
them to me now 
if you will mind where you are going
and not run into the gutter said his
father
about forty years ago a certain lord
dundonald had a patent for making what
is called coat from coal coat is halfburnt
coal such as you have seen used
in forges to obtain the coat he halfburned
the coal and the tar and gas which
were in the coal were by this process separated
the coat being his only object the
gas was conducted under water many hundred
yards in large tunnels in order to
condense the tar and the gas escaped out
 a high chimney how it became lighted
my friend said he did not know but once
lighted it continued to burn and the
flame illuminated the country for twenty
miles round
i wish i had seen it said harry
how grand and beautiful it must have
looked but when people saw this i wonder
no one thought directly making use
 the gas and obtaining it in the same
way for lamps
it is the more surprising said his
father because it was in fact a gas apparatus
like that at present used only the
gas was suffered to escape and waste itself

but father said harry what was
the other anecdote 
long before this lord dundonald s
time there was a chemist whose name i
do not recollect who made gas from coal
and stored it in bladders and frequently
vol i m
amused his friends by pricking a hole in
the bladder and then applying a light toit
this was portable gas such as people
are now beginning to use only in a different
case
well this is more extraordinary still
said harry because that gas in the bladder
was in such a convenient form for
carrying about it is wonderful that neither
he nor any his friends who saw it ever
thought making use it for lamps i
wish i had been by when he showed the
bladder and pricked it and set fire to
the gas father even such a boy as
i might have thought it might not
i
 you might harry said his father
but how few men to say nothing boys
observe what they see any day or everyday
or think what use can be made it 
but so striking a thing and so obvious
a use said harry what seems
so easy and natural now that it is done 
true harry the thing was there
before their eyes but useless because they
did not think making use it
and for forty years and more said
harry
after a long silence during which
harry stumbled sundry times he exclaimed

father i am thinking 
not where you are going said
his father
but i am thinking father that there
are a gieat many other little things which
people have not yet observed that may
lead to great things if people think 
putting them to use
undoubtedly said his father in
this you are very right
 and father do you think that if i
try to observe and consider what use i
could put things to i shall ever discover
or invent any thing new
harry was here interrupted by stumbling
over a walking stick with which
a man whom they met was feeling his
way and which harry had not observed
 
i wish that man would not poke out
his stick so said harry it nearly threw
me down
the man begged his pardon said he
was blind and was forced to grope his
way with his stick harry now begged
his pardon for running against his stick
and guided him across to the next street
and the old man wished him a good night
and said
 may you never be blind as i am and
whenever you are old may you meet with
help as i have from you
as soon as the blind man had left them
harry began to recollect what he was saying
when he first met him and he would
have resumed the conversation but his father
told him that he could not talk to him
any more now and that he must walk fast
for it was getting late harry trudged on
as quickly as he could his father thought
he must be tired and so he was but he
scorned to complain
it was late when they reached the inn
tea had been waiting some time and
lucy after struggling to keep herself
awake had fairly given up the point and
had fallen asleep her head resting on her
arms which were crossed on the table
she was so fast asleep that she could
hardly be wakened sufficiently when harry
came in to ask whether he had had a pleasant
walk after swallowing a cup tea
with her eyes half shut she submissively
obeyed the signal the chambermaid with
bedchamber candles and retired to that
rest which she much wanted
harry would stay up to listen to a conversation
between his father and a postillion
from which he hoped to discover
what would be done in the morning and
what was meant by that will depend
upon circumstances but before he had
made this out he fell fast asleep across the
great black trunk where he lay unobserved
till the waiter tumbled over his legs and
let fall a spoon upon his head harry
started up he had dreamt as he said
that he had been struck by the beam a
steam engine his mother exhorted him
to go and dream in bed she took up a
candle to light him on his way but he
turned and stood looking at the postillion
astonished to see him still standing there
and his father still talking to him
mother what an immense time this
man has been standing talking said
harry
 not above five minutes my dear
replied his mother
five minutes only cried harry i
have been in that time all the way to germany
and back again at a palace magnificently
lighted up with flaming crocuses
 gas i asked whose house it was do
not you know said the man it is your
friend the great otto guerick's i was not
surprised that he was living still i only said
i would go and see him but the inside
 the palace was like a cottonmill and
there was a great steam engine going on
working away through all the workmen
and women and children i went on
asking for otto guerick till at last one
guideman said he would show me the
s
ay to otto's laboratory where he was
trying experiments always in his silk nightgown
but the man said the laboratory
was at the top the house and asked if
i could follow him up high ladders oh
yes i said as high as ever he pleased so
i went scrambling on after him and if my
foot had slipped i should have gone down
down down i do not know where but i
reached the top and a door opened and
i heard the rustling otto guerick's
silk nightgown and i was just going in
when that spoon which i thought was the
beam a steam engine fell upon my
head oh mother i wish it had not
fallen it was so provoking to be wakened
at that moment just when i was going into
see otto guerick i wish that i could
dream it over again
you had best sleep again harry my
dear said his mother and this time
sleep in your bed come said she
showing him the way through the passage
to his bedroom where she put into his
hands his nightcap which lucy even in
the depth her own sleepiness had remembered
to leave ready for him
harry slept nine hours without intermission
but he saw no more otto
guerick or his gas illuminated mansion
he was still fast asleep when his
mother called him during breakfast his
father and mother talked about the various
noises they had heard in this inn all night
and by which they had been so much disturbed
that they could not sleep his
mother said that a coach had arrived or
set out every half hour that she had heard
bells and calls hostlers and chambermaids
and waiters running to and fro in
the passages continually and people calling
perpetually for their trunks and portmanteaus
and parcels and bills harry's
father said that the partition between their
room and the next was so thin that they
could hear every sound and there was a
man in that room who seemed to be pulling
off his boots and throwing them down
and throwing wooden legs after them all
night
harry and lucy looked at each other
when their father and mother talked 
all these noises they were surprised for
they had slept so soundly that they had
not heard them
during breakfast harry told lucy that
it depended upon circumstances whether
they were to go on with their journey today
or to stay in this town lucy said
she was not at all the wiser as she did
not know what circumstances he meant
their mother told them that it depended
upon a letter which his father expected to
receive by the post to tell him whether
his friend would return home this
day or not harry's only reason for wishing
to stay was that lucy might see the
pretty walk he had taken the preceding
evening but as it was now raining they
could not walk and he was glad that they
were not to spend the day at the inn
where they had nothing to do
what shall we see next said lucy
as she got into the carriage i like sfo
ino on to something new
m 
o
 if you had your choice harry what
would you wish to see next said lucy
a mountain said harry who was
faithful to his old wish for a mountain to measure
with his portable barometer while
he had been taken up with the cotton manufactory
and the steamengine and the gaslights
this wish had slept in his mind but
it was now awakened with fresh eagerness
as they journeyed on he eyed the outline
 every hill on the horizon but he observed
a discreet silence upon the subject
even when lucy exclaimed here's a
mountain coming for you harry he replied
soberly so i see my dear but it
is not near enough yet i will speak when
i think it is time
at last when they came into derbyshire
and into the hilly parts that county
harry spoke for he thought it was time
 father here are plenty mountains 
will you be so good as to stop the carriage
and to let me get out that i may measure
this one which is almost close to us i will
not detain you above twenty minutes mother
if you could be so good as to wait 
in ten minutes i would run up in ten minutes
i would be down again may i
father
no harry said his father we cannot
stop for you now it would detain
us much longer than you imagine your
eye deceives you in judging distances
and heights to which it is unaccustomed

for your comfort harry added his
mother we are going to matlock a
place where you will find yourself surrounded
by fine mountains upon which
you may try your own and your barometer's
measuring powers at leisure for we
shall stay there two or three days
delightful thought harry thank
you mother said he
presently they entered a narrow but
beautiful valley a stream ran through it
and there were hills on each side their
banks were covered to a great height with
trees the softest foliage and various
shades green tinged here and there with
the brown and yellow colours autumn
above high above the young feathery
plantations and the scrubby brushwood
rose bare whitish rocks sometimes
stretching in perpendicular smooth masses 
sometimes broken in abrupt craggy summits
huge fragments from which had fallen
into the river below the river flowed
tranquil and placid till when opposed by
these massy fragments it foamed and
frothed against their immoveable sides 
then separating the waters whirled round
them in different currents and joining
again the stream ran on its course sparkling
in the sunshine the road now lying
beside this river brought them soon to
the pretty straggling village matlock
the morning after their arrival they
went out to walk at a lite distance from
the hotel where they lodged was a walk
up masonhill it was a zigzag path cut
through a wood fir trees reaching to
the summit called the heights abraham
they went part the way up this path
and harry was eager to go to the very top
but his mother was not able she said to
go quite to the heights abraham she
and his father and lucy went to see a
cave in this hill but his father told harry
that he might go on by himself if he liked
it to the top masonhill and take its
height with his barometer and compare
this with the reputed height which is said
to be about feet
harry to lucy's surprise stood hesitating
with his barometer in his hand instead
 going on with the alacrity she expected

 what is the matter would you rather
come with us to see the cave said lucy
no said harry that is not the
thing
what then said lucy ado you
want me to go with you i should like it 
but you know mamma said that i must not
go running about everywhere with you
here as i do at home i must stay with
mamma but you look afraid to go by
yourself added lucy laughing
afraid my dear i am not the least
afraid to go by myself anywhere in the
world said harry proudly am not
going to do any thing wrong what should
i be afraid 
i do not know said lucy that is
what i want you to tell me i am sure
there is something you do not like or else
why do not you set off
there is something i do not like
said harry that i acknowledge i do
not like to meet those people who are
there farther up on the walk
 what harm will they do you harry
said his father
no harm father only i do not like to
meet them because they are strangers
but since as you observed harry you
are not going to do any thing wrong you
need not be ashamed i will not say
afraid to meet them said his mother
that is very true mother said harry
i know it is very foolish well i will
conquer it i will go on by myself added
he resolutely
go on and prosper then said his father
 i dare say that those people will
never think about you unless you do something
to attract their attention
harry walked off as fast as he could 
nor stopped till he reached the heights 
abraham then he took out his barometer
and noted down the height at which
the mercury stood both in the barometer
and thermometer then he went down
the hill and as soon as he had reached
the bottom he looked at the mercury
again in each noting down carefully
these heights also finding a retired
nook away from the public path he sat
down to work at his calculations resolved
not to stir till he had completed
them on his barometer there was engraved
a table the heights at which
the mercury stands at different elevations
calculated when the atmosphere is at the
freezing point besides this he had taken
care to bring with him a certain little 
 an expeditious method determining alti
containing an expeditious method 
calculating altitudes the want which
had in his first attempt to measure the
church prevented his succeeding to his satisfaction
now understanding and following
the directions contained in this
little trusty companion to his dear portable
barometer he made his calculations
sufficiently accurate to satisfy his conscience
he brought his answer within two
feet the height which his father had
told him had been determined by previous
measurement
he next went to look for the cave
it was a large deep dark cavern at the
farther which he perceived light 
and as he advanced he saw the forms 
men the guides who held torches
and he heard lucy's voice and the voices
 his father and mother and soon disquietudes
with the new portable mountain barometer 
with a description that instrument by sir harry
englefield bart
a little tract which is or ought to be sold with
every portable barometer
gushed their figures they were all
looking up at the roof on which the
guides with raised torches threw a strong
light from the roof which appeared encrusted
all over with yellow earth hung
multitudes what seemed like earthy
icicles the same colour and enormous
bulk
my dear harry are you there cried
lucy i am glad you are come i was
so afraid you would not come in time to
see these are not they beautiful do you
know what they are they are stalactites

and how came they there said
harry and what are they you tell me
they are stalactites but that tells me nothing
but their name
it is a good thing in the first place
said lucy to know the name because
then we can ask people questions and
then they will know what we are talking
about she told him all she had just
learned from what she had heard the
guides and her father say that these
s
stalactites were formed by the water
oozing through the roof the cavern
and depositing as it trickled downs some
calcareous earth which it had dissolved
in its course through the soil and rocks
along and down which it had passed
she believed that these rocks were calcareous
or limestone she had further
heard one the guides say that some
stalactites found in this country became
almost as hard as stones were various
colours and had been polished and made
into necklaces and different ornaments
the tides had broken off from the sides
 the cave some the stalactites and
had given pieces them to lucy some
 these which had been newly formed
were softish and crumbled easily when
pressed between the fingers some were
a little harder and crisp cracking rather
than mouldering when pressed others
were as hard harry observed as some
petrifaction which he had seen in his
uncle's collection his father told him
that those petrifaction had been formed
in the same manner in which these stalactites
were formed and the guides
said that they would show him plenty 
petrifaction and crystals and beautiful
spars different colours for which derbyshire
is famous
while all this was saying lucy's mother
who did not like standing still long
in this damp cavern had by gentle
degrees alternately drawing lucy on by
the hand and urging harry forward by
the shoulder kept moving onwards till
they found themselves again at the entrance
or the exit the cave they were
glad to see the daylight to feel the fresh
warm air and to tread again on dry
ground
several boys and girls met them in
their way to the hotel with baskets
 crystals spars and petrifaction in
one basket lucy saw a petrified wig
the guides told her that the people 
matlock amuse themselves by putting
wigs and different things in these calcareous
springs to have them as they say
converted into stone such they seem
to turn into as no appearance the
original substance is left except the form
but as harry observed it is not that the
substance turns into stone but that the
calcareous deposition covers it all over
and the original substance in time decaying
nothing afterwards is left but calcareous
stone in another basket lucy saw
spars various colours some purple
and some amber different shades
in rainbow stripes or cloudlike streaks
some these spars were made into
hearts and necklaces and boxes and
urns and eggs and various trinkets
lucy's mother told her that she might
choose any one these things she liked
lucy chose a polished shaded
purple spar it seemed transparent and
looked as if you could see into it to a
great depth but when lucy tried to open
it she found that it did not open
 what use then can it be 
it had a little gold ring at the top it
and was intended to be used as a netting
weight lucy had been long making a
purse for her father she was sure that
the pleasure using this pretty weight
would encourage her to go on netting it
as soon as ever they should come to the
 their journey but how was the
egg to be carried her father said he
could not have it rolling about the carriage
and the pockets were already filly
occupied lucy would have been reduced
to take a flat heart instead her
beautiful egg if harry good at need
had not stepped forward and opening
wide as he could stretch the mouth 
his waistcoat pocket bid her put her egg
in there where there is plenty and
plenty room added he shrinking in
his stomach to show the ample space
my dear harry you are very good
said lucy
not the least said harry i
should be very bad if i did not recollect
how good you were about my camera
obscura which you crammed into the
trunk come drop your egg in here at
once and say no more about it
she dropped it into the pocket
 but my dear harry it looks as if you
had a great swelling people will stare
i do not care said harry let them
stare
this was indeed as lucy knew a great
proof harry's affection for in general
he disliked excessively to be stared at
and avoided every thing that could bring
upon him such a misfortune
besides added he patting down the
egg in his pocket it does not stick out
now more than my ball which i have
often carried here and nobody ever
noticed it except my mother indeed
now i have got it into the corner you see
it is not a greater lump than my pocket
handkerchief which sticks out as much
on the other side so all's right
but if you were to tumble down the
hard egg might hurt you harry
i might hurt it said harry for i
should break it i suppose but my dear
i never that is hardly ever tumble down 
and now i have this egg it will make me
more careful so say no more about it
now i want to tell you about the heights
 abraham
he had prudently forborne to speak
 his operations while her head had
been full stalactites and spars and
wigs she now listened to him with due
sympathy and was delighted when he
informed her that his barometer measurement
came right within two feet his
father congratulated him upon his success
with which he was particularly pleased
because it was the consequence perseverance
he was glad to see that his
son would not be satisfied till he had
rectified his errors and had been as exact
as he possibly could this promised
well for his future progress all the rest
was mere child's play very few
uncles said he would have given a
portable barometer to a boy your age
i am glad you can prove to him that you
have been able to use his present and
that it has been service to you
harry
it was lucky for me said harry
 that there was nobody by on those
heights abraham when i was at my
work and lucky too when i came to
the bottom the hill that i found a snug
place out the way every body where
i made my calculations or else i am sure
they would have been all wrong
 that would have been a pity said
lucy after all your pains
therefore it would be a oreat advantage
to you harry said his father
 if you could learn to calculate and to
be able to go on with whatever you are
doing when people are looking at you
as well as when you are by yourself
because you cannot hope always to be
alone when you want to think nor can
you always hope to find snug solitary
places for your calculations every common
schoolboy is forced to learn his
lesson and to cast up sums without being
disturbed by strangers all this is easily
learned by practice
aye by practice i dare say said
harry
and i will tell you what you can da
by your own sense added his father 
upon every opportunity try to conquer
your dislike to going among strangers and
then you will get over your bashfulness
father then if you please i will go
with you to day and dine at the public
table instead staying with my mother
and lucy
right my boy so you shall
when dinner time came harry went
along with his father and as he walked
into the public room said to himself
i am doing nothing wrong i need not
be ashamed i will not be bashful
still a mist confusion came before his
eyes when seated beside his father at a
very long table he saw opposite to him
a line strangers and on all sides 
him strangers he scarcely ventured to
look up at their faces he was seized
vol i n
with one his fits the cramp bashfulness
under which he sat suffering and
stiffened blushing and conscious that he
was blushing scarcely able to answer
yes or no thank you when he was
asked what he would have he thought
that every body must take him for a fool
and this made him feel more uneasy and
awkward he scarcely saw or knew what
he was doing he threw down first one
thing then another first his fork then his
bread in reaching for the fork then the
salt cellar and at last a glass water
into his father's plate it was weh it was
no worse his father set the glass up
again sent away his plate and said nothing
about it harry wished he was in his
mother's room or under the table or anywhere
but where he was his blunders
and disasters had more and more provoked
him with himself and he thought
he had disgraced himself for ever and
that people must think he was a vulgar
creature or a child not fit to dine with
men or gentlemen nor used to dine anywhere
but in the nursery his face was
by this time all burning with shame and
scarlet up to the roots his hair
while he was in this condition the lady
who was sitting beside him asked him if
she should help him to some oysters he
happened to dislike oysters and he answered
 no thank you in rather a surly
tone and then thinking he had done
wrong to answer so gruffly held his plate
out and said if you please ma'am
but you have not finished your sweetmeat
i did not observe that said the
lady you do not like sweetmeats and
oysters together do you my dear
 i do not care ma'am thank your said
harry
you are not the young gentleman
are you said the lady whom met
this morning with a barometer in his
hand 
i do not remember meeting you
ma am said harry but i had a barometer
in my hand
really i should not have thought you
n
were the same may i ask what you were
doing with that barometer
i cannot explain it to you ma'am
now said harry
a gentleman luckily asked her at this
moment to drink a glass wine and she
turned away from harry and thought no
more about him or her question still his
father took no notice him but left him
to recover himself by degrees and to find
out the truth that people were thinking 
themselves much more than him gradually
he came to the use his senses and
understanding so far as to hear and comprehend
something entertaining which a
gentleman who sat opposite was relating
as soon as harry became interested in listening
to what this gentleman was saying
he stiffened looked up moved forward
on his chair forgot his blushes and his
blunders and all his fears having disgraced
himself in short he forgot himself
altogether
the gentleman was giving an account
 the plundering a vessel which had
been stranded on the coast south wales
in st bride's bay it was a transport
laden with ordnance stores from america
harry made out that ordnance stores
here meant gunpowder and guns some
 the people on the coast saw the signals
 distress which were made by the persons
on board the vessel but instead 
putting out boats and going to their assistance
these wicked people thought only 
plundering the vessel and carrying away
every thing they could for themselves
they assembled on the beach and waited
there till the ship was driven on shore
and wrecked while the poor people onboard
were trying to save their lives these
plunderers were busy carrying off all they
could from the wreck they boarded her
as soon as possible because they knew that
as soon as ever the gentlemen the country
should hear that a vessel had been
wrecked they would come to assist the
sufferers and to prevent the plunder
the mob made such haste that they got
possession their prey and landed a considerable
quantity gunpowder from the
stranded vessel many the plunderers
were loaded with as much as they could
carry while others were struggling for
their share the booty as their confederates
were dragging it on the shore
in this scene confusion and in these
struggles a quantity the gunpowder
was scattered on the shore and on the
rocks one the ringleaders the mob
quarrelling with another who had got possession
 a musket which he wanted to
have for himself seized it and threw it
from him with violence what happened
none could exactly see as it all passed so
quickly but probably the musket had
struck against a flint a single spark was
enough set fire to the gunpowder which
was scattered over the rock one explosion
after another was heard one
train communicated to another and in a
few seconds the whole strand and rocks
seemed wrapped in fire and smoke many
 the plunderers were killed on the spot
others were dreadfully maimed and died
lingering deaths the man who threw the
musket absconded and was never heard
 afterwards
while harry listened to this dreadful but
true story pity for the shipwrecked people
who perished for want timely assistance
indignation against the wretches who
thought only plundering the wreck
wretches such as he could hardly believe
to exist horror at the catastrophe an awful
sense the justice the punishment
which they immediately brought upon
themselves and satisfaction that they
gained nothing by their crime altogether
filled his mind and these successive sentiments
and reflections so absorbed hin
that he completely forgot every thing else
forgot where he was and who was by
and all his own little foolish feelings
what was become his bashfulness it
was all gone gone off with that superfluous
anxiety which he had felt about the
opinions the surrounding people might
form him
after they left matlock the road appeared
uninteresting to our travellers
but they had books in the carriage and
lucy's mother began to read at first to
herself and afterwards to her companions
when she found any thing that she thought
would entertain them
 here is an account said she the
various stinging insects which infest parts
 south america where the inhabitants
pass their lives complaining the insufferable
torment the moschettoes
will you be so good as to read it tous
now said lucy i am so very comfortably
settled with your dressing box
under my feet
 persons who have not navigated the
great rivers south america for instance
the oroonoko and the rio magdalena can
scarcely conceive how at every instant 
life you may be tormented by insects flying
in the air and how the multitude 
these little animals may render vast regions
almost uninhabitable they cover
your face and hands pierce clothes with
their long sucker in the form a needle
get into your mouth and nostrils and set
you coughing and sneezing whenever you
attempt to speak in the open air in the
villages on the banks the oroonoko
which are surrounded by immense forests
the plague flies affords an inexhaustible
subject conversation when two persons
meet in the morning the first questions
they address to each other are how did
you find the zancudoes during the night
how are we today as to moschettoes 
at new barcelona the wretched inhabitants
generally stretch themselves on the
ground and pass the night buried in sand
three or four inches deep leaving out their
heads only which they cover with handkerchiefs
farther on the traveller fares
worse for he comes to the region the
sorrowful people as they are called who are
doomed to be for ever tortured by these in
humboldt personal narrative vol v
n 
sects one poor monk who had spent
as he said his twenty years moschet
toes in that country desired humboldt and
his companions to tell the people in europe
what the poor monks suffer m the
forests south america when an inferior
monk commits any fault his superior
exiles him to this country and they call it
being condemned to the moschettoes
lucy said she was glad she was not condemned
to the moschettoes and she asked
her mother if there was any more that was
entertaining about them her mother read
to her an account the different kinds 
stinging insects which mount guard at
different hours the day and night just
at the time when one party are flying
away and when the next have not fixed
or as soldiers would say at the time 
relieving guard there is an interval repose
the different hours the day and
night are marked and known to the inhabitants
by the different stinging flies so
that as they say they could tell blindfold
what hour it is by the sting the last or
the hum the coming torment
horrible creatures said lucy i
am very glad we have none them in our
country
horrible repeated harry in an absent
tone he seemed to be heartily glad
to have this history the moschettoes
finished and to get rid them they
had prevented him from fixing his attention
upon something which he wanted to
think 
the moment his mother's closing tone
announced that she had finished he threw
himself half over his side the carriage
and beoan to watch the hind wheel
is there anv think the matter with the
wheel brother said lucy
 nothing my dear i am only thinking
 something
take care harry said his mother
i think you will fall out
 no thank you mamma there is no danger
 that i am holding by the holders
said harry
there was nothing more to be said about
the safety the position he had chosen 
something might perhaps have been said
about its unsociability but his mother went
on reading and his father and lucy were
listening to her
oh harry cried lucy listen to
this here are the termites the great ants
will not you hear about them
thank you said harry i have
heard enough about them
she left him to his wheel for some time
but presently returned again with 
 oh harry did you hear that about
the jaguar that came bounding to the
shore to play with the little girl and tore
the skin her forehead and she drove
him away with the bough a tree only
think the jaguar 
 my dear lucy you jogged me and put
me out in my count now i must begin
all over again said harry
she drew back but after some little time
exclaimed again 
harry oh harry hear this i shirt
tret i my dear harry a real name a real
tree fifty feet high shirts ready made grow
upon them without a seam 
one hundred and fiftyfive i am very
glad it one hundred and fiftyseven
said harry continuing to count on
if the shirttree won't do nothing
will thought lucy and she sat down
and sat still during many pages then starting
up again she threw her arm round him
 oh harry harry the most beautiful
story you ever heard a mother in
search her children who went through
such difficulties and such places as no person
had ever the courage to go through
before and lived for four days on nothing
but black ants and was stretched upon the
rack at last and tortured oh harry
won't you listen to the it
two hundred and twentyone my
dear another time you will tell it to me 
two hundred and twentytwo
lucy gave it up left him to himself and
listened to the the story sorry
however that he could not or would not
enjoy the pleasure with her
after this story the piedra del la
madre or rock the mother was finished
lucy's mother was tired reading aloud
her father took up a to read to himself
and lucy who had the happy power
either travelling or at home being able
to amuse herself began to point out to her
mother every thing or animal she saw on
the road which she thought would look
pretty in drawing
 look mamma at that woman who is
crossing the field with a basket hay on
her back and the cow following without
her perceiving it and eating the hay is it
not like one the vignettes in bewick
mamma as you are not busy now whenever
i see what i think would be a good
bewick on the road i will tell you and
you will tell me whether you think it
would be pretty or not
look at this old tired soldier stopping
beside the well and the little girl holding
up a tin can that she has just filled now
he is stooping to drink and she is putting
back her hair off her forehead and the
setting sun full on her face would not
this be a pretty bewick
her father who had now finished what
he was reading and who was always
cheerful and sociable put away his 
and looked out the window joining with
lucy and her mother in their diversion
presently he saw an old man and woman
trudging together down a lane that led to
a wood and he began to sing a favourite
song lucy's in which she immediately
joined 
 there was an old man who lived in a wood
as you may plainly see
he said he could do more work in a day
than his wife could do in three

with all my heart the old woman said
if you will me allow
you shall stay at home to day
and i'll go follow the plough
harry turned about and looked much
discomfited by the singing and lucy
said 
join us harry oh join us you know
it
but harry replied only by stopping both
his ears and hanging again out the
carriage window further than before the
singing in full glee was continuing when
harry drew in his head and rubbing his
hands exclaimed as he threw himself back
in his corner 
 i have it i have found it out papa 
his father did not ask what he had
found out but went on singing
father said harry will you explain
to me now what is meant by a patent
or by taking out a patent for an invention

i am singing do not you hear said
his father go on lucy go on singing
with me
when they had finished the song harry
asked his question again about the patent
for an invention but his father did not
listen to him
 papa cried harry after eagerlywaiting
for the moment when as he thought
he could fix his attention i want to
tell you what i have been thinking all
this time
i do not want to hear it harry said
his father i cannot turn my mind to what
you are thinking i will go on with my
own thoughts
so saying his father put himself into
harry's late position hanging over the
side the carriage
well said he at last turning to
harry who looked doleful you feel how
unpleasant it is not to have people ready
to sympathize with you you feel how disagreeable
it would be to you if we could
not turn our thoughts to what you are
thinking when you wish for our attention

harry looking ashamed said that is
true papa i believe i have been all day
very disagreeable but i did not mean it 
i was thinking something that i hoped
you would be pleased with and i did not
like to leave off till i had quite invented it
or at least made it as good as could
oh papa said lucy may i speak 
you ought to be pleased with his going on
persevering through all the noises we made
and every interruption i am sure i could
not so have fixed my attention
 lou and your brother my dear lucy
said her father have two opposite faults
and i wish you both to know them that
you may take care and use your power
over your own minds to cure them your
attention lucy passes too quickly from
one thing to another you are what isis
vulgarly called bird witted you should
endeavour to prevent your mind from flying
off from one subject to another i encourage
you to fix it as steadily and as
long at a time as you can you are 
such an affectionate sympathizing temper
that there is no danger that you should
not be ready enough to turn your thoughts
to the pursuits and amusements others
whenever it is necessary or agreeable
you harry have acquired the power and
habit fixing your attention steadily on
your own pursuits but you cannot easily
turn your mind from your own thoughts to
what is going on near you or to what
other people wish you to think now
consider that your sister and your mother
and i and every body like syrnpalliiy as
well as you do probably and if you acquired
this unsociable habit never joining
in what we are donor or beings interested
in what we are saying or hearing
you would become a very disagreeable
companion
i hope i shall not said harry with a
look serious alarm
 you have perseverance and laudable
ambition enough continued his father
 but the danger for you is that you should
confine your attention too much to one small
circle objects and not enlarge your mind
by general observation and knowledge
 
you perceive that i speak to you not
as to a foolish child but as to a reasonable
creature who is desirous to improve
himself on this journey you will have
opportunities curing yourself this
fault when you are going through a
new country look about you observe everything
when you are with people who
are talking on subjects that are new to you
listen to what they say much knowledge
and amusement can be gained by the ear
as well as by the eye ears and no ears 
might make a good tale as well as eyes
and no eyes 
he did listen the other day papa
said lucy and heard what the gentleman
told about the wreck and the gunpowder
 harry repeated it to me afterwards

as he was so well rewarded by hearing
what was entertaining and by your
remembering it so kindly said her father
 i hope he will continue to attend to conversation

 if people did not talk so much nonsense
generally in company sir said
harry i should listen oftener
pick out the sense if you try to do
so you will always find some golden
grains sense even in an ocean nonsense
and suppose you should not it
will be use to your own mind to interrupt
even by nonsense the course your
thoughts the mind becomes stupefied
when it has thought too long on any one
point
true said harry so i found today
when i was thinking about my measuring
wheel when i had thought and thought
for a great while i grew quite tired and
stupid i could not tell what was the matter
with me i could not invent what i wanted
 and listening even to the moschettoes
which i hated at the time did me good
harry is so candid said his mother
that there is really some pleasure in finding
fault with him
he was not like those foolish boys who
when they are told any fault think only
how soon the person who is speaking will
have done that they may get rid the immediate
pain nor was he one those who
think only what excuse they can make
nor yet was he one those the most foolish
who grow sulky and sit or stand like
statues feeling all the time as if the nightmare
prevented them from stirring it is
true that harry was acquainted with this
disagreeable sensation arising partly from
shame and partly from pride but he
struggled against it and threw it off as
soon as possible
 lucy what were you doing before all
this began asked harry
 we were singing the old man in
the wood said lucy and then she
added in a whisper should you like to
sing it again if you would i will begin
it
i should said he begin
she began harry followed and their
father immediately joined them they
sung but badly but they were all well
pleased with each other and lucy said she
was now quite happy
there must be some nonsense mixed
with wisdom now and then must not there
papa said she or else one is apt to
grow terribly tired
o our travellers next arrived at franklin
hall in staffordshire where they were to
 spend three days sith their friends mr
nw and mrs franklin
 the first day at dinner an old gentleman
observed that the pie dishes wedges
wood's ware were good contrivances for
j keeping vegetables hot and remarked
 how very like real pie crust one them
looked
mr frankland who had been an intimate
friend the late mr westwood said
that he was present the first day when one
 these imitations pie crust appeared
at dinner the children the family did not

mistake it for a real pie and mr wedgwood
had new ones made repeatedly
till at last one appeared so perfect that at
a little distance it could not be known
from pie crust when i took off the
cover said mr frankland the child
next me was agreeably surprised to hear it
jingle on the dish
besides this said the old gentleman
mr wedgwood made a number little
everyday useful contrivances that dish
in which there is a well for the gravy
in the olden times unhappy carvers were
obliged to poke under the heavy sirloin
for gravy or to raise and slope the dish
at the imminent hazard overturning the
sirloin and splashing the spectators
knife fork spoon slipping all the while
one after another into the dish and ten
to one no gravy to be had after all nothing
but cakes cold grease but now
without poking sloping splashing the
happy carver free from these miseries 
life has only to dip his spoon into a well
 pure gravy thanks to the invention
 one man all men women and children
may now have gravy without stooping
the dish so i give you gentlemen and
ladies for a toast the late mr wedgwood
and the comforts life 
after he had drank his glass wine
the old gentleman continued speaking 
i remember that mr come the traveller
was pleased by meeting with a beautiful
service wedgwood ware in russia i
dare say he might find one now in siberia
last year when i was in holland i learnt
that even the town delft which for
many years used to furnish all europe
with crockery is now supplied from england
with our staffordshire ware
the conversation next turned on china
and chinese artists
 they are very exact said mr frankland
 in imitating whatever is bespoken
from them but sometimes they carry this
to a degree provoking stupidity
 this he gave an instance a lady
wanted to match some the plates a

remarkably handsome service china
which had been given to her husband by
the east india company she sent a
pattern to china and bespoke some dozens
to be made exactly the same in due
time they arrived were unpacked but
to her surprise and mortification the lady
found that every one the new plates had
the appearance a crack across it and
on examining the plate which had been
sent as a pattern it was found that there
was a crack in it which had been exactly
imitated
even harry though he loved exactness
thought this was too much
lucy observed the beauty the china
on her plate there lay or there seemed to
lie a convolvulus it looked so natural that
she thought she could take it up on her
mother's was a celia a geranium on another
and on harry's a honeysuckle 
which she could almost fancy that she
smelt the perfume even as she eat her
ripe cherries she paused to examine these
flowers she thought it the most beautiful
china she had ever seen when she
went into the drawingroom she saw on
the chimneypiece flowerpots the most
delicate blue with white figures on them
embossed like ivory and exquisitely carved
the drapery on the figures was so light that
it seemed as if blown by the wind and so
transparent that she could see the blue
ground through it
mrs frankland came to lucy as she
was looking at these flowerpots and told
her that they were wedgwood's ware as
well as the plates which she had admired
at the dessert
wedgwood's ware repeated lucy
i thought that wedgwood's ware was
always black or creamcoloured such as
the common yellowish plates
mrs frankland told her there was a great
variety wedgwood's wares she took
her into a cabinet at the the 
where she showed her several
vases made in imitation antiques which
had been dug up from the ruins etruria
in italy and thence called etruscan some
had red grounds with black figures others
red figures on black grounds others which
were called jasper were very valuable
after lucy had examined and admired all
these mrs frankland said she would show
her another which was more valuable than
all the rest the original from which it
was exquisitely imitated cost the present
possessor four thousand guineas as she
spoke she opened the case which contained
the vase and carefully raised it from its
crimsoncushioned bed
i know it i have seen it before mamma
exclaimed lucy
seen it before lucy said her mother
where
in a when i was reading to you
mamma
you mean that you have seen an engraving
 it said her mother
yes mamma you remember the three
views in the botanic garden a vase just
like this with a dark ground and white
figures i cannot recollect the name it
but i know it was dug up out ruins
her mother told her it was called the
bartering or portland vase bartering
from the name the italian family to whom
it had belonged and portland from the
duchess portland by whom it had been
purchased and brought to england
lucy whose memory was now awakened
recollected dr darwin's beautiful lines
addressed to mr wedgwood oh friend
 art but she refrained from repeating
them for which harry gave her credit
due
mr frankland who now came into the
room told her that the ancient etruscan
or greek vases were produced by a different
process from that which mr wedgwood
used in making his they appear
to have been made by covering the parts
representing the figures and ornaments
after their outlines had been traced and
then dipping the red ware in a black paint
the lines the drapery c were afterwards
traced in the same colour in those
ancient vases the colour which was red
was in the body the ware itself in
mr wedgwood's imitations both the red
and black are painted on the porcelain or
rather on the biscuit the name which is
given to the ware after its first baking in
the furnace he was the first person who
made what are called dry colours or enamel
without lustre without shining
harry thought that the smoothness and
polish these vases was more beautiful
than any glazing
and much safer and more durable
said mr frankland these colours
cannot be injured by damp or fire or air
or acid and will last as long as the substance
itself you may have observed
that the glazing on common earthenware
runs into little cracks
yes said lucy i have often observed
them covering a plate like network
they look very ugly
 but what is much worse continued
he in most kinds glazing lead is employed
which when dissolved in certain
acids is poisonous
lucy observed that glazing looked something
like glass and from the sound the
words too she heqvedi glazing came from
glass it might at first have been called
glassing
yes said mr frankland and there
is as you observe a resemblance between
the outside some porcelain and glass
but the difference between glass and
porcelain is that porcelain is but 
that means half turned to
glass the managing the heat so as
to stop the vitrification or turning to
glass at the right time is one the
most important points in making porcelain

lucy returned to admire the beauty 
the wedgwood's ware repeating that she
thought it much prettier than chinese
china
b
besides the beauty form and colour
and texture continued mr frankland
 the utility is great it is not only
perfectly safe for all culinary purposes but
most durable for some chemical experiments
in which the vessels must be exposed
to great heat
mr frankland showed them a crucible
and a retort made wedgwood's ware
and mrs frankland showed a white pestle
and mortar which looked like marble but
which was wedgwood's ware and used
for pounding medicines
harry asked whether the potteries where
all these were made was near frankland
hall
yes within a few miles us said
mr frankland at a village to which
mr wedgwood gave the name etruria
and where he established a manufactory
whose productions are probably more
known and more useful to a greater number
 people than ever were those the
ancient etruria
mr frankland said that he would the
next day take harry and lucy to see these
works in the mean time as harry seemed
anxious to know more he told him all that
he thought could interest him concerning
the history the staffordshire potteries
the clay this part england being fit
for making some kinds earthen ware
there have been potteries or remains 
potteries in staffordshire ever since the
time when the romans were in britain 
but they had continued in a rude state forages
as no person industry or knowledge
had attempted their improvement
till about a hundred and twenty years ago
when two brothers the name elders
came from holland settled here and manufactured
a red unglazed porcelain afterwards
they made a sort brown glazed
stone ware coarse and heavy yet the glazing
 these such as it was could not
be performed without great inconvenience
they used muriate soda which
they threw into the oven at a certain time
 the baking the vessels the fumes
from this were so odious that the neighbourhood
were alarmed and forced the
strangers to abandon their potteries and
quit the country soon afterwards a
workman who had found out the secret 
their mode glazing for even that was a
secret pursued the same method in a pottery
 his own and this was suffered to goon
in spite the nauseous fumes because
the inhabitants found the jars they
made so useful for holding their butter
they were employed chiefly for this purpose
and the manufactory was called the
butter pottery on glazing days however
the nuisance was terrible the offensive
fumes spread to a distance six or
seven miles thick clouds from these
furnaces rose over the hills and filled the
valleys with their dense vapours
the first great improvement in our potteries
was made in the substance the
ware itself by introducing ground flints into
the composition and then was made what
is still called white stone ware it is used
for many purposes you may have seen
it for instance for seltzer water bottles
i know what you mean said lucy
this was the safest and best ware we
had continued mr frankland before
mr wedgwood's time it is said that the
first idea using powdered flints was
suggested to a poor staffordshire potter
by accident
 by accident i am glad it said
lucy i like to hear discoveries
made by accident especially by poor
people
there was a staffordshire potter
whose name is forgotten or whose name i
forget he stopped on a journey to london
at dunstable in bedfordshire where the
soil is flinty and chalky he consulted
the hostler the inn where he stopped
about some disorder in his horse's eye
the hostler advised that powdered flint
should be put into the eye and for this purpose
he threw a flint into the fire to calcine
that is to burn it that it might be
more easily pulverized the potter who
was standing by observed the great whiteness
 the calcined flint and being an ingenious
as well as an observing man immediately
thought applying this circumstance
to the improvement his pottery
he first tried the experiment mixing
finelypowdered flints with tobacco pipeclay
 he succeeded to his hopes and
made white stone ware which put all the
brown and coloured stone ware out fashion
ugly as you think it lucy it was
much approved till wedgwood came and
gave us something better that creamcoloured
ware which was called queen's
ware because it was first patronized by
queen charlotte it was then and not
many years ago prized in palaces now it
is used in every cottage and known in
every place where plates or dishes are to
be found after this queen's ware he invented
all the varieties which you have
seen and many more
mrs frankland rang the bell and ordered
the servant to bring a plate cream
coloured wedgwood ware another the
white stone ware a crock the dark
glazed kind and a common red garden
pot these she placed in the order in
which they had been made beside wedgwood's
beautiful vases to show harry and
lucy the difference and contrast
and all these improvements or at
least the greatest part them were made
by one man thought harry then
more was done by him during his lifetime
than had been done in hundreds 
years before
lucy asked if any lucky accidents had
happened to mr wedgwood which put
improvements into his head or gave him
the first idea any his inventions she
said she should like very much to know
the story these if mr frankland would
tell it to her
mr frankland said he did not know 
any such and observed that though one
or two fortunate accidents might occur to
the same person it was not possible that
such progressive improvements as mr
wedgwood had made could have been
suggested by accident or accomplished by
any one who had not scientific knowledge
 i should like very much said harry
to know what he did first and what he
did next and how he went on from one
experiment to another
 all this i cannot pretend to give
you a history said mr frankland for
i am not sure that i know it clearly myself
all can tell you is that he improved
the potteries by the introduction 
substances which had not before been employed
in the composition these wares
it had been found that some cornwall
granite is as good for making porcelain
 a certain kind as the clay which the
chinese use mr wedgwood introduced
dorsetshire and cornwall clays
perhaps you could tell me sir said
lucy how the delicate blue the
ground this flowerpot is made
 that is given by a substance called
cobalt said mr frankland but as
you have never seen it the word cobalt
teaches you little
i wish i knew said lucy how the
beautiful colours the flowers on the
dessert plates and how the purple and
rose colours on this cup are produced 
the purple and rose colours are given
by the precipitate gold dissolved in nitromuriatic
acid the oxides iron also produce
many the colours which you admired
but as you are not acquainted with any 
the oxides iron or with nitric or muriatic
acid or with the precipitate gold you
know nothing more from my answer thana
number names which probably you
will not be able to remember an hour and
which unless you learn their properties
could be no use to you even if you
could keep them in your head all your
life
but without telling us all those hard
names sir said lucy could not you
give us some general idea how he did
it all
mr frankland smiled and answered
that he did not exactly know what she
meant by a general idea it all he
could tell her only that mr wedgwood in
the first place learnt the properties different
clays and minerals and what effect
would be produced on these by fire in
short he applied to the study chemistry
and mineralogy to learn all the experiments
which had been made by others and
then he tried new ones for himself but if
he had not read and acquired this knowledge
first he might have wasted his time
and ingenuity in doing what others had
done before him besides genius to invent
new and elegant things he had the
food sense to observe what is wanted
every day by the greatest number people
so that he not only produced what
pleased persons taste but what was useful
to all classes and he continually considered
how he could improve not only what
others made but what he had himself produced
it was by this attention to little
as well as to great objects and by steadily
adhering to one course pursuits that
he succeeded in accomplishing all that he
began no small praise for a man who
undertook so much the consequences 
his success we all know continued mr
frankland turning to harry's father and
we all rejoice in them wedgwood made a
large fortune for himself and his children
with a character a reputation above all
fortune he increased amazingly the industry
wealth and comforts the poor
in his neighbourhood multiplied the conveniences
elegancies and luxuries life
for the rich raised at home and abroad
the fame the arts and manufactures 
his own country extended her commerce
and spread his own name with his productions
to the most remote regions the
civilized world
a pause ensued after these words all
looked with admiration at his works
and those who had known him intimately
sighed for the loss an excellent man and
a kind friend 
the next day mr frankland took harry
and lucy to see the works at etruria
we shall not follow them through all the
processes but shall only mention what
harry and lucy recollected and told their
mother on their return
the first thing i remember said
harry is the improvement in the way 
grinding the flints
 but you must know mother in the
first place said lucy that formerly this
was very unwholesome work such a quantity
 the dust the powdered flint flew
off and as the workmen breathed it went
in at their mouths or up their noses and
it brought on complaints in their lungs
and stomachs and inflamed their eyes
besides
all this was remedied continued
harry by grinding the flints in water
which prevented the dust from flying off
the name the man who made this improvement
and who made the first mill on
this principle was brindled and the mill
is very ingenious
but you had better not stop to describe
that said lucy because perhaps
mamma does not care as much about it
as you do now let me go on harry
and tell a little well mamma the flints
ground in the great cauldron 
mill said harry
mixed with water continued lucy
looked at first like chalk and water
thickish then by mixing with clay and by
stirring and beating and straining through
sieves this became first a sort pulp
and then about as thick as paste or dough
r and then it was ready for the man to carry
vto the potter's wheel you know the 
mamma i remember first
seeing the print it in our trades
but there is an improvement in this the
very common one which i once saw long
ago was only a circular board turning on a
perpendicular stick
axis said harry

a boy whirled it round for the man
you know mamma while he went on
moulding the clay upon it into a bowl and
he called to the boy to make it go slower
or faster but in this potter'swheel no
boy to whirl the board is wanting for it is
turned by a shaft
and that shaft is turned by a steam
engine said harry the steam engine
mother at work again observe mother
yes said lucy papa called it the
great servant all work
but there was an improvement in this
potter's wheel which you have not told
yet lucy said harry
no no but i am coming to it let me
tell it said lucy
if you understand it whispered harry
in a very kind tone as he was only
afraid for her not anxious to show what he
knew
i understand one thing about it and
that is all i want to tell my dear said lucy
there was a sort large roller in the
shape a cone mamma opposite to the
potter's wheel and a strap or band round
it that could slide or be pushed up and
down upon this cone from the narrowest
part to the thickest harry took notice 
this the moment he saw it and asked the
use it papa bid him find out and he
did mamma it was to make the wheel
go slower or quicker whenever the man
who was moulding the clay desired that it
should this was necessary because the
steamengine which keeps the potter'swheel
in motion goes on always at its own
regular rate and would never mind his
calling out faster slower slower 
faster therefore he must have someway
 slackening or quickening the wheel
without interfering with the steam engine
this is done for him by a boy's simply
shifting that strap i described to you
higher or lower to the thicker or thinner
part the cone this was the use
mamma the cone and band and harry
found it out
i am glad you remember this my dear
lucy said her mother
thank you said harry's eyes
lucy went on with raised spirits
mamma i wish you had seen the man
moulding the clay and all the metamorphoses
 the potter'swheel first in
one minute the lump clay turned into
a bowl then the instant after he squeezed
this soft bowl up in his hand dashed it
on the wheel and again he turned and
moulded and in an instant it was a
plate in another instant the plate was
gone and in its stead a cup stood before
us
a cup without a handle said harry
the handle if wanted must be made
separately and stuck on afterwards only
certain shaped things round or flat are
made on the potter'swheel those which
have isis and outs in their shapes are made
in moulds into which the moist clay is
squeezed sometimes two parts a thing
the spout a teapot for instance are
made in separate moulds and the halves
joined together afterwards but i daresay
mother you know all this
 i knew most this myself before
continued lucy from the prints
and descriptions in our dear 
trades and from some others our little
and large books but i liked to see the
real work going on and the real things
there was always some difference between
the description and the reality or something
that i fancied larger or smaller than
it is or some little particular circumstance
which i did not comprehend till i saw it
mamma i did not tell you that we saw
the furnaces and kilns for baking firing
the porcelain as they call it these were
much larger than i expected when the
porcelain has been once baked it is called
fecwiy in which state it is ready for painting
mamma i have not told you how much 
was entertained in the painting room by
seeing how dull the colours look when they
are first laid on and how bright and brilliant
they are after they have been fired 
vol c
what was to be gold was quite dark beforehand

pray lucy said harry did you
observe a man alio was standing beside
one the furnaces whose business seemed
to be to regulate the heat he had some
little bits clay which looked like little
stoppers and he put these into the fire and
measured them did you see how 
no i saw the man said lucy but
i did not know what he was doing well
mamma there is one other thing i remember
and that is all you know the common
kind blue and white cups and saucers
and plates with windmills and houses
and strange chinese looking figures and
all manner things upon them
i do know luckily what you mean
said her mother laughing otherwise i
am not sure that i should know it from
your description
 mamma these were formerly painted
one at a time by hand but now there is a
much quicker way mr frankland showed
it to me first the patterns whatever
you wish houses or churches or geese or
turkies or shepherdesses or elephants or
windmills are printed on paper
engraved on copper first said harry
and the blue colour put upon the copperplate
instead printer's ink
and the blue colour oh let me tell
that harry cried lucy the blue colour
is made cobalt
 oxide cobalt i believe said harry
 which differs from cobalt mr frankland
told us if you recollect lucy as
much as rust differs from iron
 well oxide cobalt it should be i
recollect said lucy and this is mixed
with some earth and 
and linseed oil said harry like
what is used in printer's ink
and when it is altogether about as
thick and soft as paste it is put on the
copperplate you know mamma you
showed me common engraving once and
just like any common engraving this is
done as many copies patterns are
taken off on paper as you want
c
you forgot that the paper was smeared
first with soft soap said harry
 then when you want to use these
patterns said lucy the superfluous
paper is cut off and the printed part is
moistened and laid on the cup or whatever
you wish to put it on
 the cup must be in the state biscuit
remember said harry
biscuit to be sure said lucy the
biscuit instantly sucks in absorbs the colouring
stuff from the moistened pattern 
then the paper is washed off and you seethe
coloured pattern printed on the cup
directly is not that nice and quick 
mamma then the cup must be let to
dry and afterwards it is dipped in some
sort glazing stuff and the cobalt i mean
the oxide cobalt comes out a beautiful
blue and there is the cup finished
painted in this easy expeditious way a
hundred thousand i dare say could be
painted in this manner while a person
could paint one single cup in the old
way
the name the ingenious person as
mr frankland said who discovered this
method transferring engraving from
paper to earthenware has not been preserved
and i am sorry for it added harry
 mr frankland told us that since this
invention this blue and white ware has
been made in such quantities and so cheap
that now almost every body can afford to
buy it and it is in every cottage and the
poor people can have now what only the
rich and grand had formerly are not you
very glad that mamma
yes i am my dear said her mother 
 and i am glad added she smiling
that you give yourself time to take breath
at last and that you allow me time to
thank you for all you have told me you
seem to have been very much entertained
at the potteries and you have entertained
me by your account them
 mamma said lucy do you think
we have remembered enough i know i
cannot recollect half what i saw and heard
but i remember almost all that i understood
clearly
 that is quite enough my dear said
her mother i never wish you to remember
more than you understand what
use could it be 
good morning to you mamma said
lucy i forgot to tell you yesterday
when we were talking about the potteries
that we saw the house in which mr
wedgwood formerly lived and a very
nice house it is
good morning to you father said
harry do you recollect yesterday seeing
a man standing by one the furnaces
measuring some little stoppers baked
clay which he slid in between two pieces
 brass like the two parts a hinged
ruler these pieces brass were fixed
but not parallel to each other they were
closer together at one than at the
other the man took the bits clay or
stoppers out a heated furnace and he
tried each stopper between these rules
and looked at divisions which were marked
on the brass plates what was he doing
papa
he was using a sort thermometer
harry said his father
 a thermometer clay papa said
lucy
yes for measuring higher degrees 
heat than can be shown by that thermometer
which you have seen if that were
exposed to heat beyond the highest degree
marked on its scale the quicksilver would
expand so as to burst the glass and the
glass would melt if put into one those
furnaces which you saw yesterday but
these clay thermometers can bear and can
measure the heat the fire for which
reason it is called a pyrometer that is
measurer fire heat
i am glad i know the name and what
it means said lucy
 father said harry will you be so
good as to explain the pyrometer to me 
 harry will you be so good as to use
your own understanding said his father
 from what you have seen and from what
i have just told you you know enough to
comprehend or invent the rest without
any further explanation from me
harry was silent and considered first
its use he had seen the man put the
stopper into the furnace and then measure
it between the rulers and afterwards say
to another workman the man who was
feeding the furnace this heat will do
now thought harry what change could
have been made in the clay after it had
been put into the furnace and how did he
measure it when he pushed it in between
the two rulers he must have tried whether
it had grown larger or smaller after
having been put into the fire
 i think said harry that perhaps
some sorts clay either shrink or grow
larger when they are put into the fire if
they did so always regularly and if people
found this after a number trials then
they might know the heat the fire by
the quantity which the clay had shrunk or
increased in size if this is the case with
those bits clay that i saw they would
be promoters or measurers fire heat as
you said i mean if you had the degrees
marked upon the ruler to measure them
exactly so said his father you are
right as far as you have gone still there
is a part the pyrometer which you have
not explained to me you observed that
the rulers were not parallel to each other 
do you think that was done by accident or
on purpose v
i think it must have been on purpose
they seem to have been screwed down on
the plate firmly like a ruler partly open
then if they were placed so on purpose
for what purpose asked his father
that the different degrees shrinking
might be measured as the stoppers are
pushed in said harry the person who
first made the pyrometer must have tried
experiments and must have marked the
different degrees which the clay shrinks
c 
with different heats but i do not know
by what parts an inch or by what scale
it is made the rulers seemed to me to
be about two feet long
they are said his father and the
opening at the widest is fivetenths
and at the narrowest threetenths an
inch and so that this proportion is kept
it does not signify what inches or feet maybe
used in the length the rulers the
bits clay which you saw exactly fit into
the widest opening before they have been
used and they shrink according to the
degree heat to which they are exposed
if it is greater than that in which they were
first slightly baked
 then papa they can only show a
greater degree heat not a lesser and if
they do not swell out again to the former
size they are no use after they have
been in a great heat said lucy
 none replied he fresh stoppers
must be continually used
 that is a great inconvenience said
lucy because you must drag about this
weight stoppers not like a nice portable
thermometer in its little case
 but it has so many conveniences
lucy said her father that we may well
pardon that one disadvantage
one great convenience i see said
harry the stopper always remains the
same size after it is taken out the fire
so that there is no danger making mistakes
about it you may measure it over
and over again but the quicksilver varies
so that if you do not write down the degree
accurately you are undone
 this pyrometer continued his father
is chiefly used in manufactories or by
chemists in their laboratories it has been
 great use to mr wedgwood who made
it from feeling the want such a measure
in his potteries it was necessary that he
should know at what heats certain clays
melt or vitrify that is you know turn to
glass the common workmen's expressions
for this such as red heat or white
heat he found so inaccurate that in trying
experiments many things were spoiled for
want that exact measure which his barometer
now gives by it he has ascertained
what heat all kinds porcelains
can bear without breaking or melting or
turning to glass what is still more
use he can ascertain the exact degree 
heat required for baking or as they call
it firing any kinds porcelain or earthenware
 which he could obtain any specimen
whether made in this or in foreign
countries as mr wedgwood said in describing
it it speaks the language all
nations the advantage having an accurate
universal measure in any case
much as it pleases you now will please
you more when your knowledge enlarges
and when you see the further uses to which
it can be applied
 papa i remember seeing said lucy
in scientific dialogues the description
 a pyrometer but i do not think that it
ws made clay
 no that pyrometer is different said
her father that measures by the expansion
 metal bars with different degrees
 heat which is shown by the motion
given to an index
like the hygrometer said lucy
yes and there are several different
kinds promoters which you can read
the description at your leisure continued
her father in any encyclopedia if you
have any curiosity about them
yes said harry i should like to
compare them and see which is best if i
could
that would be a good exercise your
judgment harry said his father but
there are so many they might tire and
puzzle you
the clay which mr wedgwood's
promoters are made continued his father
possesses some properties which fit it
peculiarly for the purpose to which it has
been judiciously applied those halfburnt
bits it which you saw harry
may be dropped at once into intense fire
without cracking ands when they have received
its heat may be plunged into cold
water without the least injury in about
three minutes they acquire all the heat
from any fire which they are capable 
receiving so as to contract as much as
they ever will from that degree heat
they may afterwards be left in that heat
as long as you please for they will not
change take them out and they can as
you have seen be cooled in a few seconds
and are then ready for measuring in the
gauge or scale
how very convenient said harry
but as each promoterbit can be used
but once there ought to be a constant
fresh supply
there are large beds this clay in
cornwall said his father and to ease
your mind harry on this subject i can tell
you that mr wedgwood offered to give
the royal society a sufficient space a
bed that clay to supply the world with
pyrometer pieces for ages
i like that very much cried lucy
i cannot bear that people who discover
scientific things should be covetous 
them or afraid that others should have a
share
 how could you ever think such a
thing said harry
i never should have thought it
said lucy only that i heard a gentleman
once at aunt pierrepoint's say but
i believe i had better not tell it because
it can do no good to any body but
harry i hope and i am sure that if ever
you invent or discover any thing you will
be ready to let others share with you
that i will said harry oh i
wish it was come to that father there
is something else i want to say but i do
not know how to express it it is that
i think that a person who invents any
pyrometer or hygrometer or barometer
or new and exact instrument for measuring
heat or cold or height or quantity
does more service than a person who
invents only a machine which will do
only for some particular purpose because
those measuring instruments will
assist a great many other people in their
experiments for years perhaps for ages
to come do you understand what i
mean papa
yes my dear and i think what you
say is very true but do not twist the
poor button my coat any more or you
will pull it off and let me go now for
there is the breakfastbell
who will be down stairs first cried
lucy letting go her button and running
foremost harry might have overtaken
her perhaps in a race across the hall but
that he stopped to hold open a swingdoor
for mrs frankland she had in her
hand two small packets one which she
gave to him and the other to lucy on
opening the paper in which these were
wrapped they found two cameos 
wedgwood's ware lucy's which was
black on a white ground represented a
negro in chains kneeling with his hands
raised in a supplicating manner with
this motto engraved
 am i not a man and a brother
j
harry's cameo was all one colour
brown it represented three allegorical
figures peace art and labour and it
was made clay which had been brought
from botany bay mr wedgwood made
use this clay as mrs frankland told
harry on purposeto show the settlers
and inhabitants that country what
could be made their materials by industry
and ingenuity and thus he encouraged
them to exert themselves 
these cameos the late mr wedgwood distributed
many hundreds and no doubt
considerable effect was produced by
 the poor fettered slave on bended knee
from britain's sons imploring to be free
lucy you have not seen our garden
yet said mrs frankland we had not
time yesterday but if you are fond a
garden come with us now your mother
and i are going there
 oh thank you ma'am said lucy 
but i must call harry and we will
follow you directly
they followed and a gay garden it
was full a variety brightcoloured
flowers rich beds carnations and roses
in full blow
roses moss roses in full blow in
september cried lucy the day before
she had left home she had searched
their garden for a rose for her mother
but could find only one poor solitary bud
which had a yellow nightcap on she
asked mrs frankland to tell her how
she contrived to make her roses blow so
late in autumn
by pulling off some the buds in
spring said mrs frankland as soon
as they begin to form and by transplanting
some the rose trees early in
the spring so as to prevent them from
flowering at that time then they blow in
autumn
lucy said she would try this next
spring on her own two rose trees
not on both will you said harry
let us pull the buds off one and leave
them on the other then it will be a fair
experiment
 and besides you may then have a
chance said mrs frankland the
first rose spring as well as the last
rose summer
lucy took notice some large clusters
 bright blue flowers aga pant has and
varieties dahlias she thought them
beautiful but she supposed that these
could not be had without a great deal
 trouble and money and a hothouse ora
gardener at least but mrs frankland
said these did not require a hothouse
or even a gardener's skill indeed
said she all the flowers in this garden
excepting perhaps certain carnations
which my gardener prizes highly though
 do not may be had by any body wltk a
little care and exertion their own
by any body repeated lucy but
ma'am do you mean bodies like us like
harry and me with only our own hands 
yes bodies like you said mrs
frankland with your own hands provided
you use your heads as well as your
hands
in what way must we use our heads 
said lucy will it be very difficult
 no consult your gardener's dictionary
and follow its directions only remember
to do so at the right time year
said mrs frankland she told lucy
that she would give her the root an
agapantha and some dahlias and
that she and harry were welcome to
seeds roots cuttings or slipping 
any thing they liked in this garden
write down what you wish and i will
have them ready by the time your mother
brings you here again as i hope she will
on your return homewards
joy sparkled in their eyes and they
thanked mrs frankland with warm gratitude
but an instant afterwards they
looked unusually grave for the embarrassment
 riches came upon them they
were left to make out their list and how
to choose was the difficulty where all
were beautiful and when their little
garden could not hold all harry went
to work prudently he measured out a
space ground that was the size 
their own garden lucy could hardly
believe that it was so small as what he
now showed her but he had often
stepped the boundaries and was sure
 the size their territories rule and
measure soon settled the affair and
brought their wishes into proper compass
they calculated what their garden would
hold and made out their list accordingly
their chief wish was to have a great bed
 pinks and carnations
but the moment they went near these
an old gardener who was at work in the
garden and who had long been eyeing
them approached he began to praise
his carnations which he said were the
finest in the county and he pointed out
his favourites there was the prince
regent and the duke wellington in
full glory these every body knew but
beyond these he had two superlative new
favourites one he called the pride 
holland or the great van tromp the
other the envy the world or the great
panjandrum harry and lucy did not
much admire either these van tromp
they thought was a dull colour and
the great panjandrum had burst and was
falling to pieces in spite his card support
harry preferred some others
that which you are now at master
said the gardener is davy's duchess
 devonshire that little duchess was
thought a great deal some years ago
but she is quite out fashion now
harry did not care for that he liked her
 what does he say asked the deaf
gardener turning to lucy and leaning
down that he might hear the answer
 i say cried harry speaking loud in
his ear that i like my little duchess
better than your great panjandrum
indeed said the gardener smiling
in scorn why master what you have
taken such a fancy to is not a carnation
even it is only a pink
i do not care said hairy what
you call it i like it whether it be called
carnation or pink
the gardener looked at him with contempt

pray what is the difference between
them said lucy my mother has told
me but i forget it
the gardener told her that one chief
difference is in the roundness the
petals carnations and the jagged or
pinked edges the petals pinks
lucy liked these edges and she really
thought some the pinks prettier than
the carnations she told harry so in a
low voice but i am afraid said she
that the gardener would despise me if
he heard me say so
what signifies whether he despises
you or not said harry there is
nothing wrong in liking a pink better
than a carnation
the gardener who did not hear what
was said fancied that they were debating
whether they should ask for one his
grand pan jan drums and he began to say
that he was sorry that he could not offer
this he could not give this to any body
harry assured him that he need not
make any apology because they did
not wish for them piqued by harry's
indifference the gardener named several
lords and ladies who had admired his
panjandrum above all things and who
had tried in vain to obtain it it was a
very great rarity he said only two other
people in england had a real panjandrum

harry liked flowers for being pretty
and did not care whether they were rare
or not
the gardener did not believe him
soon afterwards he offered harry some
pinks a kind which he liked particularly

but master i can let you have them
only upon condition that you promise
not to give any cuttings or layers them
to any one
harry drew back with disdain and said
he would make no such promise
the gardener said that unless he would
he should not have the pinks
then said harry i will do without
them
he turned off abruptly and walked
away but lucy stood still and said
 i believe we may have them
mrs frankland told us we might have
any thing in this garden that we choose 
and here she is coming back from the
orchard
oh that alters the case said the
gardener with a look some mortification
 then master you must choose
what you will to be sure
vol ir d
harry turned back and walked composedly
along the sides the carnation
beds writing down the names those
he chose on a bit paper the
gardener breathed freely when harry
passed by the panjandrum and turned his
back upon the envy the world
lucy whispered to her brother did
you see how much he was afraid that
you should have chosen any those
that are really valuable and why did
not you 
because i did not like them and i
despise his mean reasons for liking them
said harry putting the paper and pencil
into her hands now go lucy and
choose
lucy admiring her brother's independence
followed his example and chose
what she liked without being influenced
by the foolish wish possessing what
other people cannot procure she did not
choose either the pride holland or the
envy the world
harry was quite right to adhere to his
own taste were was no trial complaisance
or generosity
mrs frankland and their mother now
returned from the orchard and harry and
lucy gave mrs frankland their list she
looked it over said she thought they had
chosen well and had been moderate in
their requests she called to her gardener
gave him the paper and desired him to
have the plants in readiness at the time
she mentioned
very well ma'am he answered coolly
looking over the list which he saw was
only common flowers but when she
added that he must also give some dutch
hyacinths and tulip roots the gardener's
whole countenance changed he exclaimed
my dutch tulips and hyacinths and
throwing down a hoe that he had in his
hand he walked off muttering to himself
that it was well his mistress's head was
not loose or she would give it away
mrs frankland laughed goodhumoured
at his anger she bore with him
dr

she said because he was an old and faithful
servant who had been long in the family
before she was married though
you might not think it said she he is
generous to his relations all that belongs
to himself and covetous only what
belongs to the garden which he considers
himself as guardian against his mistress's
extravagance but i cannot bear
this sort petty avarice and rivalship
about flowers in persons whose education
ought to have raised them above such illiberality
i have heard a lady who
when she was asked by a friend for the
roots some particularly fine flower
ashamed to refuse yet unwilling to give
boiled the roots before she sent them to
prevent the possibility their growing
harry expressed the greatest indignation
against this meanness
they now entered the conservatories
and observed the flowers a plant which
hung over the entrance the peachhouse
they looked as if they were cut out 
thick velvet and were covered with honey
their smell which had been pleasant at
first soon became disagreeable and overpowering
mrs frankland told lucy
that this plant is called hoy a carlos hoya
from the name mr hoy the gardener
who introduced it into england and carnose
from the fleshy appearance the
flower she had planted it at the door 
the peachhouse because it is there a useful
guard wasps are so fond its honey that
they will for this leave untouched peaches
and grapes after they had seen the
peachhouse they walked through the
conservatory where mrs frankland pointed
out a tree called the papaw tree carica
papaya which had been brought to her
lately from the west indies the gentleman
who gave it to her told her
that it will grow twenty feet in three
years that its juice has the singular property
 making meat tender if the juice
be rubbed on beef it makes it as tender as
veal and if an old fowl be hung on
the trunk this tree it becomes in a few
hours as tender as a young chicken this
it is affirmed is a fact which has been long
known to those who have resided in the
west indies but mrs frankland said
as she had not yet tried the experiment
she could not assert it to be true
at this moment harry put his hand to
the mouth one the flues or pipes in
the conservatory and perceived that warm
air came through it but mrs frankland
told him that this air was not well heated
and therefore did not heat the building
as it ought she said that a man was
just going to alter and she hoped to improve
them harry heard his father talking
to this man at the other the
conservatory and he went to see what was
doings
his father turned to him and asked
whether if he were to place the pipe he
would put it at the top or the bottom 
the building
harry answered at the bottom because
i know that heated air is lighter than
air that is not heated and therefore if it islet
in at the bottom the building it will
mix with the colder air and gradually
warm the whole house as it rises to the
top
as lucy walked on with harry she
asked him how he knew that hot air is
lighter than cold
 as you might know said harry if
you recollect a diversion we were fond 
when we were children and which i should
like this minute he puffed out his cheeks
and blew through his hand as he turned
his face up towards the sky
 blowing bubbles you mean said
lucy but what then 
 what do you think makes the bubble
go up said harry
it goes up because it is lighter than
the air
and how comes that what is it
filled with
it is filled with air from the mouth
blown through a tobacco pipe
well whether it is blown through a
tobacco pipe or not said harry is the
air from your mouth hotter or colder than
the outer air do you think when the
bubble rises 
oh hotter to be sure now i know
what you mean the bubbles go up because
they are filled with heated air indeed
i might have known from this that
heated air is lighter than cold air but i
did not recollect it at the right moment
i wonder how you came to remember it
so well
harry said that besides the bubbles
another thing fixed it in his mind a
thing which he had seen when she was
away from home a fire balloon which
went up because it was filled with heated
air he was one the persons employed
to hold the great bag the balloon
over a fire made straw it was
all flaccid at first said he as my
father called the bladder which you may
remember he showed us
yes said lucy and if your balloon
were filled with heated air it would expand
i know that
 yes but you do not know how it
pulled said harry i felt it beginning
to pull against my hands as it filled out
and at last when it was quite full it pulled
so hard that i could scarcely hold it but
i was desired to hold fast and i did
though my knuckles were burning the
instant papa cried let go we all loosed it
and up it went to a great height quite into
the clouds oh the pleasure seeing it
go up and the pain my knuckles
which were all blistered fixed the whole
in my mind so that you need not wonder
at my remembering it
while they were talking in this manner
their father was still speaking to the workmen
about the stove the hothouse they
joined him and listened to what he was
saying the man was asking mr frankland
if he had seen the new method 
heating houses used in a neighbouringtown
he had and admired it much
it had been first attempted at the house 
the gentleman by whom it had been invented
which it warmed most comfortably
d
then it was tried at die county infirmary
where it also succeeded to the satisfaction
 the medical men and the patients
it was the invention a gentleman
who has for many years exerted
his great knowledge mechanics for
purposes domestic comfort and who
has in the most liberal manner devoted
his wealth his time and his inventive
genius to public works useful to his native
town in particular and to mankind in
general
at this moment they were interrupted
some visitors had arrived and they returned
to the house when harry went
into the room he saw ladies with no bonnets
on their heads and one with artificial flowers
in her hair though not much skilled in
such matters he thought this looked as if
these people were not merely morning visitors
but would stay to dinner for which
as lucy knew by lies face he was very
sorry
the next time they were alone together
in their mother's dressing room in
othe
evening after the company were gone
lucy asked her brother if he had not been
unhappy all day since the time they were
interrupted at the stove but harry said
that on the contrary he had been very
happy and that he had heard several entertaining
things
at first said he when i saw that
woman with the artificial flowers in her
head i thought it would be a company
day and that it was all over with us
that lady was very goodnatured tome
said lucy in telling me something
about the artificial flower which she wore
did you observe it
not i said harry yes i believe
i did see it it was like a lilac and i was
glad it had no smell for i dislike the
smell lilac in a room but what did she
tell you about it
that she brought it from italy she
asked me to guess what it was made i
looked close and i touched it for she told
me that i might it was not paper nor
silk nor gauze nor cambric i could not
guess what it was though i had an indistinct
recollection having seen something
like it somewhere it was made the
cocoons silk worms in italy you know
they have great quantities these in the
silk worm's own country and it is well to
make use them instead throwing
them away
yes said harry if there must be
artificial flowers and i suppose there must
that lady gave also an entertaining account
 some travellers who were stopped
by banditti between rome and naples

yes said lucy and the little
girl who had her mother's jewels given to her
to take care and who concealed them in
her doll's cradle and who kept rocking the
cradle and talking to her doll all the time
the robbers were searching the carriage so
that they never suspected where the jewels
were and went away without finding them
i do not think i could have had courage or
presence mind to have done that i
wish i could
you do not know till you are tried
whether you could or not said harry
but what was i going to say i cannot
recollect said lucy oh i was
going to ask whether you heard what that
lady told me about straw bonnets 
 not i said harry i heard her
beginning to say something about the price
and the fineness hats women's business
thought i to which i need not listen
yet it was worth hearing said lucy
though it was about bonnets gentlemen
listened as well as ladies
i am ready to listen now said harry
 in the first place harry do you know
what leghorn bonnets are
yes i believe i do a sort straw
hats i know the things when i see them
said harry
very well and you must know too
that ladies think they are much better because
dearer than others said lucy no
i mean much dearer because better
 which is it are you sure said
harry laughing
quite sure said lucy they are
really better they wear much longer and
bear wetting and crumpling they are
infinitely better
you know best i am satisfied said
harry that is settled they are dearer
because they are better go on
and they must be much dearer than
the common straw bonnets which are made
in england you know because they are
brought from a great distance from italy
 aye from leghorn i suppose from
their name said harry
 yes at leghorn first i believe and
for a long long time hundreds years
i dare say ever since such hats have been
worn people never thought its being
possible to make them anywhere but in
italy the straw is plaited differently
and they thought that sort straw could
be got nowhere but there in short they
never thought looking or trying what
they could do till lately but now people
have found out first in america i believe
then in england and at last in ireland 
poor ireland they have found a sort 
grass the straw which will do and they
have learned how to plait it as well as they
plait it in italy that lady showed us
two bonnets her own and her daughter's 
her own she brought from italy and her
daughters was made in ireland and as well
as i could see the irish one was the finest
 the two and much better judges than i
am and people who looked through spectacles
and held magnifying glasses to
them said the same several ladies in
ireland as she told us have taken a great
deal pains to teach poor girls this straw
manufacture one lady who learned how
to do it herself from some directions in a
common newspaper set to work and tried
experiments
sensible woman said harry
and good said lucy for it was to
do good and after a great many trials
she made a bonnet from the very beginning
with her own hands from the first
preparing the straw to the finishing and
she won the prize for this the best that
ever was made i believe
oh now lucy do not go too far
how do you know said harry
i tell you just what was told me my dear
that a person who saw it and compared it
with one which had been sent from italy
to some french princess declared that the
irish hat was full as good as the finest 
fine leghorn hats which cost fifty guineas
and this irish hat was made a very
common grass called crested dogstail
which grows even on bad ground its
flower stalks are so remarkably harsh and
tough that cattle will not touch them
though they will eat the dry stalks many
other sorts grass but these remain all
winter in the fields useless and they are
called in irish trawnyeens when a thing
cynosure cristatus
is worth nothing the irish say it is not worth
a trawnyeen but now trawnyeens are made
good for something and for a great deal
too
would you know the grass if you
were to see it said harry
yes said lucy i know it very
well and i will show it to you the next
time we are in any field where it is
do said harry i like the woman
who stuck to the bonnet till she had succeeded

she succeeded in doing a great deal
more than making one fine bonnet that
would have been no great matter only ingenious
said lucy but i will tell you
much more and much better this kind
lady taught several poor irish girls to make
these hats and two not older than fourteen
working in their own cottages cabins
they called them made in one year
twelve bonnets and besides they did all
the work that was wanted in the house
as usual their twelve bonnets were sold
for a guinea a piece a great many
such have been bespoken and are to be
sent over to london the children 
those poor irish who as you knows we
heard were almost starving last winter
have now one good way by which they may
earn guineas for their fathers and mothers

that is good indeed said harry
i am sure that woman who made the first
bonnet and taught them all must be glad
yes i am sure i should if i were in
her place said lucy and harry
mamma told me that if i can learn to do
this plaiting i may teach it to our poor
widow wilson's daughters today i saw
a little bit it which the lady who told
us all this brought in her workbag she
let me undo a bit it to see how it was
done and she gave us some straw and we
began to try
 now i know said harry why you
were all plaiting straw so eagerly i could
not think what had seized you when
i saw you all so busy with straws when
i came back from playing but now
lucy to go to another thing for we have
said enough about this did you observe
the old gentleman who sat in the armchair
by the fireside 
the same gentleman who the first day
at dinner talked wedgwood's ware and
 vegetable pie dishes said lucy
 yes i saw him indeed he took a
great quantity snuff and i could not
bear
what
it oh horrible harry his pocket
handkerchief 
 i did not see it said harry
 i am glad it said lucy i do
not like him
you do not like him my dear i assure
you said harry he is a very sensible
man for i heard him talking to my
father and mr frankland about stoves
and flues and fire places and hot air
 very likely said lucy but i wish
that he had not had those two great
streaks snuff along the wrinkles his
waistcoat
never mind that said harry i
want to tell you something entertaining he
told me
 well do then i would rather hear it
from you than from him said lucy i
hope harry you will never take snuff
no no my dear no danger
but when you grow old my dear
great danger so many old people do
and young too now i will tell you the
names all the snuff takers i know
no no no my dear lucy said
harry stopping his ears pray do not
but let me tell you about a little bird
a little bird oh that is another
affair i thought you were going only to
tell me about stoves what about a little
bird
it was about stoves too said harry
you must hear that before you come to
the bird do you recollect some one
said that there was a disagreeable smell
from a stove in the passage
yes said lucy and the people began
to debate whether it was a smell 
smoke or burnt air
then it was that my old gentleman
asked if they knew what is meant by burnt
airy and he began and told a doctor
somebody who tried some experiments to
determine whether heated iron gives out
any thing unwholesome to air that passes
over it or whether it takes any thing away
from it so as to make it in short unfit for
our breathing
so he took a bird i suppose said
lucy
stay stay first he took a small cube
 iron and heated it to a great heat i
am sorry i forget the degree said harry
never mind said lucy get on to
the bird
and he put it into an exhausted receiver
said harry
dr defaulters
the bird said lucy
no my dear the cube iron i
wish i had never told you about the
bird
well well i will not be birdwitted
said lucy papa you know told me i
was birdwitted once but harry i beg
your pardon now tell me he took a
small cube iron and he put it into an
exhausted receiver
yes said harry he placed the
cube iron so that whenever he let in
air it should all pass through a hole in the
hot iron
you never told me any hole in the
hot iron said lucy
there i was wrong said harry i
should have told you that he had made a
hole through the iron cube then he let
the air into the receiver and it passed
through and over the heated iron and
when this receiver was filled with this air
he put a little bird into it and it breathed
the air without seeming to be in the least
hurt or showing that he felt any difference
between it and fresh air
but the bird could not speak said
lucy and we are not sure it liked it
not sure certainly said harry but
now listen to the next experiment and you
will find what happened the man made
the same experiment with a cube the
same size heated brass and put the
same bird in the same receiver after it had
been again exhausted and filled with air
which had passed through and over heated
brass
well said lucy and what happened

the bird died said harry in a few
minutes
poor bird said lucy the man
was very cruel i mean the experiment
was cruel
no said harry because he tried
the experiment for a good purpose to save
the lives and health human creatures
that was good said lucy but i
think he might have tried the experiment
as well without killing the bird he should
have taken it out when he saw it gasping
for breath as i am sure he did before it
died and he should have let it recover
in the fresh air
certainly said harry it was cruel
as you say to kill the bird because it was
unnecessary but except that mistake
was not it a good experiment
she admitted that it was a good experiment
but she observed that the lungs 
birds and human creatures are different
and she thought it not quite a certain proof
that because a bird cannot live in such or
such air that therefore it must necessarily
be unwholesome for human creatures her
mother to whom she appealed thought
this was true and so did harry
 how much we have had to say and
think from what passed today said
lucy and how many curious facts and
entertaining stories we heard in conversation
though we were so vexed at being
interrupted when the visitors first came
in
yes said harry i thought that
and thought how right my father was in
telling me that we may often learn as much
from conversation as from books
a boating party was proposed by mr
frankland on the third and last day 
their visit and harry and lucy were invited
to be this party at which they
much rejoiced they had never been in
any boat this had not a sail it was to
be rowed with oars they walked down
to the side the river which ran through
the grounds and they found the boat in a
little creek moored to a post in the bank
lucy thought it a little dangerous to walk
over the board that was laid from the land
to the edge the boat one the boatmen
would have taken her by the arm but
as she saw harry walk on fearlessly she followed
without assistance they were desired
to sit down as soon as they were in
vol e
the boat and something was said about
trimming it how or why a boat was to
be trimmed lucy could not guess and she
was curious to see what would happen
nothing happened but that every body sat
still in their places except one the
men who was to row and who sticking
his oar against the ground pushed off
from the shore then crossing over lucy's
head with his oar and bluntly saying
 by your leave miss he succeeded in
getting the boat out the little creek in
which it had been moored
now they were fairly out in the river
and all the boatmen began to row excepting
one who sat at the the
boat watching the way it was going and
guiding it by means the rudder or helm
 which he held the great handle under
his arm
after they had rowed a little way this
man made one his companions change
places with another who was much
heavier and then seeming satisfied said
 she is well trimmed now lucy perceived
that she meant the boat and now
understood that by trimmed he meant
that the weight on each side the boat
was balanced
all was new and amusing to lucy she
listened to the sound the oars and
watched the sparkling drops hanging
from their edges as the men lifted them
from the water they raised them out 
the water not edgeways but with the flat
part or blade horizontal as you would
raise a spoonful any liquid the use
 this as harry perceived was to diminish
the resistance the air against
the oars as they were moved forward in
order to plunge them in the water
his father told him that this motion is
called feathering the oars
now i understand said lucy that
verse in the song the jolly young waterman
which you used to sing papa 
did you not hear a jolly young waterman
who at blacksmiths used for to ply 
he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexterity
winning each heart and delighting each eye
e 
as they rowed along they saw a pretty
villa on the banks the river lucy suddenly
started up in the boat and asked
harry if he should not like to live in that
beautiful place with the gay veranda
sit still my dear said her mother
 for if you overturn the boat you will
never live anywhere
effectually quieted by this suggestion
lucy sat down instantly and quite still
silently enjoying the fineness the day
and the pretty prospect houses gardens
parks and woods as they rowed on and
observing the reflection the trees and
buildings in the clear river a bird with
white out spread wings was skimming
over the water which lucy wanted harry
to see but he close at his father's elbow
was intent on hearing what mr frankland
was saying some foreigners who
had lately been at his house in the
course a tour they were making
through england he had taken them
out boating and in going down this part
 the river they had been particularly
struck not merely with the picturesque
beauty the scenery but with the appearance
 wealth comfort cheerfulness and
elegance in the residences our english
gentry the great territories and palaces
 they called them our high nobility
did not surprise them so much as the vast
number and variety the lawns and pleasure
grounds and parks our country
gentlemen one these foreigners was
french the other italian in italy there are
fine places and fine gardens belonging to
the nobility but none these comfortable
habitations fit for persons in the middle
ranks life the frenchman said that
these country houses were amazingly different
from the comfortless chateaux in
france they had paid visits to several
 our country gentlemen and liked their
mode living so much that even the
frenchman protested that if he had not had
the honour being born a parisian he
should prefer the lot an english country
gentleman to that any other being in
the universe the italian was further
struck by the liberty enjoyed and the
equal justice done to all as far as he could
see in england he found that many 
our most distinguished men have made
their own fortunes many risen by their
own talents and exertions from the lower
ranks life he found that in this country
though birth has great advantages
education does more and industry and
genius have the road to fame and wealth
and honours open to them he vrould
therefore as he declared rather have been
bon in england even in a lower rank
than in the highest class in any country
where such equal laws and liberty and
such strong motives for exertion are not to
be found
harry understood all this though it
might seem a little above his years and
liked it the better perhaps on that account
besides he enjoyed the praises 
dear old england
there was in the boat a sailor who was
now called upon to sing for them as he
had a good voice and knew many sailor s
songs and there was a boy who played on
the flute this boy was scotch and sang
for them several pretty scotch boat songs
the singing was interrupted by the man
at the helm calling out rather unceremoniously
to the boy with the flute bidding
him have done with his noise for they had
something else to mind now they were
coming as he said fast upon the weir and
the men who had been resting upon their
oars letting the boat float with the current
while they listened to the music
now began to row across the stream which
was carrying them forward with increased
velocity lucy imagined there was some
danger but what it was she did not know
for she had never seen a weir nor had
harry nor if he had known was it anytime
for talking all were silent the
man who steered seemed intent on passing
quickly through the current and all
hands joining in the pull they reached
and brought the boat safely into a little
creek where they moored her by throwing
a rope from her round the stump a
tree
when they were all safely lodged on the
bank and while the boatmen were wiping
their foreheads harry inquired if there
had been any danger and asked what was
meant by the weir mr frankland said
he would show it to him soon but they
could not see it from the place where they
were standing they walked on a little
way on the shore and presently heard a
sound as waters falling but still could
not see from whence the sound came it
became louder and louder as they advanced
till having passed the overhanging
branches a willow which interrupted
the view they saw what caused the noise
 falling waters the stream was rushing
down a step formed by a long ridge or
dam which lay obliquely across the river
this ridge was the weir and there might
have been some danger if the boat had
been carried too near it by the force 
the current
they were now to walk on to a place
where they were to get into another boat
on a canal as they passed along the
bank opposite to the weir they had a full
view it as the waters arching over its
rounding brim formed a length low
white and greenish cascade sparkling in
the sun and by its fall indented with
changing lights and shades while lucy
watched and admired these harry inquired
what was the use this ridge or weir
which he saw was not a natural step in
the bed the river but which seemed to
be built masonwork for some particular
purpose
mr frankland directed his eyes to a
mill on the bank and told him that the
use this weir was to dam up the river
so as to secure a constant supply water
and to give a fall sufficient to keep the
wheel this mill in motion harry
wished exceedingly to have a nearer view 
the waterwheel and the mill windmills
he had seen and examined but he
had seen waterfalls only from the road
mr frankland said it would not take
them above half an hour to walk to the
mill and back again and was willing to
grant harry's request mrs frankland did
not like to refuse him yet she seemed
e
doubtful she looked at her watch fearing
that they should scarcely have time she
said that she was anxious to be home in
good time for dinner because she did not
like to keep an old friend waiting however
if the mill could be seen in half an
hour there would be time she promised to
wait for harry and his mother said that
she would sit down on the stump a tree
and make a sketch the pretty situation
 the mill while he went to look at it
no sooner was permission granted than
harry darted off and was sure he should
be back again in less than half an hour
but time passes quickly when we are
amused and when we are following our
own particular tastes first the great
waterwheel was to be seen with all its
vanes and he stood observing how the
water turned it it was as the millwright
who came out to them said an overshot
wheel then it was to be explained to
harry what is meant by an overshot wheel
and the difference between this and an
undershot wheel this was a mill for
grinding corn he had seen flour mills
turned by wind and as the construction 
the mill work was as his father told him
nearly the same in this as in those which
he had seen there was no occasion to go
over it indeed he would have returned
directly but that he wanted to look at a
crane which was used for lifting up the
sacks corn from out the boats to the
granary in the upper part the mill and
for letting down the sacks meal when
ground harry thought he had been buta
few minutes looking at this and a few
more minutes were spent in seeing a sack
drawn up and five minutes more in examining
the motions a certain bolting
or sifting machine the operation which
when explained by the overseer particularly
delighted him
the overseer showed him that though
the wheat when it had passed through the
mill stones came out crushed or ground
yet that the finer parts were mixed with
the coarse flour as well as with the bran
or outer coat the grain in this state it
was first spread out on a loft in order to
cool and then it was poured down through
a wooden funnel or hopper y into the upper
 the bolting machine this was a
long hollow cylinder surrounded with a
sort net work wire resembling gauze
but three different degrees fineness
it was fixed in a sloping direction and the
overseer having kindly stopped the motion
 the machinery showed harry that within
the cylinder there was a frame work 
brushes attached to a small iron axis which
passed through its whole length the
overseer by pulling a cord set this iron
axis again in motion and harry perceived
that the flour when rapidly whisked round
by the brushes was forced out through the
meshes the wire the finest flour passing
through the upper and closest division 
the gauze and so on till nothing remained
but the bran which fell out at the lowest 
 the cylinder each species flour was
received in separate boxes from whence
they were taken away in sacks according
to the various uses to which they were to
be applied the finest flour being employed
in making the whitest sort bread
or in pastry the coarser in household
bread and the bran in a variety domestic
purposes
highly interested with what he had seen
because the patient overseer had made him
comprehend it thoroughly harry hastened
back to his mother and was not a little
astonished to find that they had been away
an hour instead half an hour
mrs frankland however who always
hoped the best said that they could makeup
for lost time by walking quickly to the
place where they were again to get into a
boat
quick time march said mr frankland
and on they marched in as quick
time as they could till they reached the
canal a long level stripe still water
which as lucy said to harry looked no
better than a broad ditch full water
she saw many large boats on this canal
loaded with coals others with goods 
various sorts and some crowded with
people to her mortification they were
to go on in one the canal boats and
slowly they now went nor was there any
pleasant sound oars instead being
by men this boat was drawn on by
a horse who was fastened to it by a long
rope and who walking on a path on the
bank the trackway as they called it
tugged on with his head down and as
slowly as his feet could step lucy
thought he looked quite stupefied and as
if he was walking in his sleep
why do people make canals papa
said she
he explained to her that canals are
made to supply the want rivers where
they cease to be navigable or in places
where they do not naturally flow he said
that canals are extremely useful for carrying
easily and cheaply heavy goods and
numbers passengers
harry supposed that canals could be
made only through flat countries and in
ground that was quite level but his
father told him that they can be carried
through ground that is not level
and how do they manage said
harry when they come to hills because
water cannot go up hill we could
not i think go safely in a boat down hill
or down steps you know we were obliged
this morning to get out before we came
to that ridge that little step in the river
the weir
 yes said lucy one the boatmen
said and my own sense showed
me that it would have been very dangerous
to attempt it the boat would have
pitched forward and filled with water
and we should all have been drowned
then how do people manage when
they come to uneven ground repeated
harry perhaps they do as we have
done today get out and walk till they
have passed over the hill and then take
to the water again
that was the case formerly said
his father and is still practised in some
places for instance in america and even
in this country in some the fens 
lincolnshire they not only are obliged
to get out their boats harry and walk
but must carry their boats along with
them over land or over marsh from one
place where the canal stops to another
where the ground being nearly level it
can go on but this is inconvenient
harry even to passengers and consider
what it must be where heavy loads are to
be carried
very inconvenient said harry then
i suppose people take great care in the
first place to choose the most level parts
 the country for their canals and to go
round the hills instead going over them
 true said his father but sometimes
they cannot go round them what is
to be done then harry
i see nothing that can be done but
to cut through them as we saw one 
the hills we passed over in our journey
where from the height the banks it
appeared to have been cut doom several
feet to let the road go through the same
must be done i suppose for canals and
where great stones or rocks come in the
way these must be blown up with gunpowder
as we saw men blasting away a
rock where they were making a new
road then the rubbish and stones and
earth must be carried away and a level
bed left for the canal
must is a word easily said harry
observed his father but all this digging
and blasting and carrying away 
stones and earth is extremely tedious
and expensive so much so that it would
be impracticable to have carried canals
across parts the country where they
now go if it had been necessary to make
the whole bottom or bed the canal
upon one level the difficulty is obviated
by means an ingenious contrivance
called a lock we shall come to one
on this canal soon and then you will see
how it is managed that we pass over
inequalities ground without being
obliged to gi out the boat and without
danger its being overset
 that is the best it said lucy
is it quite safe papa
 quite safe my dear if your eyes
and your ears were shut you would not
perhaps know that you were passing
through a lock
harry determined however to keep his
ears and eyes well open presently they
came to two large wooden doors which
would have stopped the way across the
canal had they been shut but they were
open and flung quite back their boat
passed on between the doors without
their feeling any difference in the motion
or perceiving any change in their position
the doors were then closed behind
them and they found themselves in a sort
 box or reservoir filled with water
just large enough to hold their boat without
striking against the stone work on
each side or the wooden doors at each
 there were two doors opposite to
those through which they had entered 
these they found shut but a sluice or
sliding door was immediately after their
entrance drawn up and this gradually
let off the water that was in this basin
or reservoir and the surface the water
gently sunk sunk sunk down with the
boat upon it with an imperceptible motion
lucy could as she said only know
that they had moved by seeing the height
above and observing on the stone sides 
the lock the marks where the vaterhad
been on their entrance the continued
thus gently sinking till they came to the
level the water in the canal at the
other side the gates through which
they were now to pass when it came
to this level the men opened the gates
and the boat was drawn out and went
on without difficulty on the canal his
father bid harry look up to the part 
the canal where they had been before
they entered the lock that he might
see the height from which they had
sunk
now harry said he tell me how
it happened that when we first came into
the lock we found the water in it upon
a level with the water in the canal above
on which we had been going
harry answered that he supposed that
before they had come up to the lock
men had opened the great gates and had
let the water from the canal rush into the
reservoir till it rose to a level
not the great gates harry said his
father the rush the whole body 
water from the canal would be too violent
think again
harry thought again and said he supposed
there were small sluices on the
side the lock next the upper part 
the canal similar to those next the lower
which he had seen opened and he supposed
that these sluices had been opened
before they came up to the lock and had
gradually let the water in
his father told him that this was exactly
what had happened and reminded him
 a whistle which he had heard from
one their boatmen some time before
they came to the lock which was the
signal for the man at the sluice to open
it and get ready the water for the coming
boat
harry was much pleased with this
most ingenious contrivance it seemed
so easy he said that he thought even
he might have invented it
this is the case with almost all good
inventions said his father
how nicely and gently we sunk down
doom in the boat said lucy on the
level water in the lock while it was flowing
out as my father said i am sure if
my eyes had been shut i should not have
perceived that we were going down what
a depth we sunk what a step that would
have been harry for a boat to comedown
 impossible without a lock but if
you can go up and down stairs in canals 
 stairs i do not know that said
harry but one step certainly
her father told lucy that he had
seen in scotland on the caledonian canal
seven or eight locks immediately
following each other and the people
 the country called these neptune's
stairs
mr frankland was glad to see that
harry and lucy had been so much pleased
with the lock as it was for the purpose 
showing it to them that he had come home
by the canal soon after passing through
the lock they landed by the side a road
where their carriage had been appointed to
meet them mrs frankland rejoiced to
see it ready waiting for them and again
she looked at her watch as if afraid they
should be late
late they certainly were and very late 
and cross and very cross was the old gentleman
who had been kept waiting and
starving as he said an hour and a half beyond
the regular dinner time mrs frankland
bore all he said and all he looked
with such gentleness and goodhumour
that lucy wondered how he could continue
angry she thought however that
he must be terribly hungry and that when
dinner came and when he had satisfied
his hunger he would grow goodhumoured
again no at dinner he grew worse
and worse every thing was wrong the
fish was overdone and the venison was
overroasted and some fault he found
with every one the many good things
which mrs frankland with persuasive
words recommended
 try this my dear sir or try that
but nothing he tried would do mrs
frankland looked sorry and still kindly
soothed him but at last he said something
very provoking about ladies never
being punctual and seldom thinking 
their absent friends harry could not bear
this and his natural bashfulness quite
conquered by indignation he called out ina
loud voice
 that is very unjust 
the old gentleman looked up from his
plate at harry whose face was red allover

well done my little turkeycock 
said he half laughing what have you
to say or to do with the business
only that it was all my fault said
harry
he explained and said that he had
staid too long looking at a mill and talking
about an undershot and overshot
wheel
mighty well for you and your mill
said the old gentleman in a tone between
pleasantry and reproach but pray
young gentleman what was that you said
about very unjust 
it was unjust to say that ladies never
think their absent friends sir replied
harry because mrs frankland who is
a lady did think her absent friends and
 you in particular for she was very anxious
to get home in time lest you should
be kept waiting for dinner which she said
sir that you do not like
who does sir said the old gentleman
now joining in a laugh but since
it was all your fault i must be satisfied
and must be obliged to mrs frankland for
her anxiety about me this hare is very
tender and not overroasted which considering
all things is wonderful mrs
frankland let us make up our quarrel by
drinking a glass wine together
mrs frankland's good temper and
sweet smile conquered him his forehead
un wrinkled and he became quite goodhumoured
and talked old neighbours
and his good old friend mr wedgwood
again and the staffordshire
canal the grand trunk as he called it
 which the late mr wedgwood was
the first proposer and which has enriched
so many individuals who had shares in
the original undertaking
after dinner when the ladies left the
room harry followed them for he did
not understand what was saying about
shares in navigation and the interest paid
upon them while the ladies were drinking
coffee the conversation turned upon
the cross old gentleman and bore rather
hardly upon him one lady in company
declaring that she thought mrs frankland
had been too kind to him that for
her part she should not had she been in
mrs frankland's place have thought herself
bound to submit to his rudeness or to
bear his illhumour she went on to laugh
at him for his epicurism
vol f
but mrs frankland stopped her she
said that she was much attached to this
gentleman that he was an old friend 
her husband's and his family and had
long shown them kindness for which she
felt grateful and that the only way in
which she could prove her gratitude was
by trying to make him comfortable and
happy in his declining years which could
not be done without bearing with his
little foibles his real benevolence and
excellent sense and information made
amends for them his pettishness was
soon over and his kindness heart
always remained
lucy admired and liked mrs frankland
for speaking in this manner she resolved
that when she grew up she would
be equally goodtempered and would
bear with the foibles old friends even
if they happened to be a little cross
above all she resolved that she would
be as steady as mrs frankland in defending
them in their absence
in the evening after the old gentleman
had taken his nap and was sitting
in his arm chair by the fire side he
caught hold harry's arm as he was
passing and said to him in a gruff but
goodnatured tone 
 tell me little man why you are so
curious about mills are you to be a
miller or a millwright pray or what
are you to be 
harry who generally understood what
was said to him quite literally answered
gravely that he believed he was not to
be either a millwright or a miller that
he did not yet know what he was to be 
but whatever he was to be it could do
him no harm to get all the knowledge
he could and he wished to
learn all about mills because it entertained
him
and what do you know about them
said the gentleman can you tell me
what keeps a mill going
wind keeps a windmill going replied
harry and water a waterfall
there are other kinds mills which
fare
kept going by horses and some are
moved by men and many by steam
upon my word you know a vast
deal said the gentleman
no sir i know very little said
harry bluntly and looking ashamed and
not well pleased
well i will not affront you any more
by flattering you since i find you do not
like it said the old gentleman come
added he drawing harry towards him
we shall be good friends yet you will
see i saw you playing with my grandson
at marbles yesterday do you know
how marbles are made 
no sir said harry taking one out
 his pocket and looking at it i should
like to know how they are made so very
round and smooth i should think it must
be difficult
it is my friend mr wedgwood told
me that he had found it one the most
difficult things he had ever attempted
and when i was on the continent i inquired
how they were made
 and how are they made sir said
harry
 first they cut a certain sort stone
into bits any irregular shapes no
matter what nearly the size a common
marble these they throw into an iron
mill in which there is a number partitions
and to each partition strong rasps
are fixed in a slanting direction the mill is
worked by water and is turned with great
swiftness the rubbing the stones
against the rough rasps and against each
other rounds them and by degrees smooths
and polishes them in the same manner as
the gravel becomes rounded in the bed 
a river when they are formed to the proper
shape they fall through circular holes
made in the bottom the mill the right
size to let them through from nuremberg
the town where they are made they
are brought down the river rhine to rotterdam
and thence sent all over europe to all
countries and places where boys play at
marbles and where do they not and now
you know more about marbles than nine
in ten the hundreds boys your age
who have their pockets filled with them
the backgammon table was now set
for the old gentleman usually played a
game with mrs frankland about this
time every evening but instead going
to it he staid talking to harry and telling
him various things which he had
seen when he was in holland
 when first i went to amsterdam
said he i remember as i approached
the city counting fortysix windmills all
in motion the dutch have long been
famous millwrights and many the contrivances
now in common use in our mills
in england were brought from holland 
for instance one which you may have seen
in your journey here did you take notice
that on some windmills there is a very
small sort fan wheel which stands out
a little from the top
 yes i know what you mean sir
said harry
so do i said lucy when first
i saw it i thought it was a little windmill
to frighten away birds from the corn
and do you now know the use it
 i do said harry for my father
showed me one and explained it to me 
the use that little wheel is to turn the
great sailwheel towards the wind by
means the wind itself so that whichever
way it blows the mill continues to work
in those which have not this ingenious
contrivance the mill must stand still
every time the wind changes and the
miller cannot set it in motion again without
a great deal trouble he must haul
round the whole top the mill in an
awkward way
why how said lucy do
harry explain the two ways in which these
different windmills turn or are turned
i have some idea but still i forget exactly
how it is
oh i am sure you know said
harry
perhaps i did know but go on as
if i did not begin from the beginning
first if you please with the awkward way
with that windmill which has no little
fanwheel
that common mill said harry is
called a post windmill because it is supported
upon a post which is fixed firmly
at bottom and which goes up through
the middle the inside the wooden
body or towerpart the mill this
tower is separate from the mason work
and from the grinding wheels underneath 
it hangs on the top the post and can
be turned round upon it
 this way do you mean like this
said lucy holding her pencil upright and
hanging her thimble on its point
something like it said harry but
the great sailwheel is fastened to the
wooden tower and one cannot be moved
round horizontally without turning them
both suppose the wind changes from
north to south then the tower itself must be
turned so as to bring the front the
sails to the side opposite to that on
which they had stood
how inconvenient and how does the
miller do this for that tower and the
sails and all must be a great weight
said lucy
he could not do it without the
help a lever said harry there is
a huofe ladder which is fastened to the
upper part the tower and which
reaches from that to the ground sloping
outwards so as to be a prop and stay
to keep the mill fixed in the position in
which it is to stand with the sails facing
the wind but the wind changes and
the mill must turn then the miller lifts
up from the ground the lower this
great ladder which he then uses as a long
handle or lever by which he turns round
the mill till the sails are again properly
placed
 so much for the post windmill now
for the other said lucy that with
the little fzin wheel as you call it
f 
that does the business cleverly and
without any trouble to miller or man
only the top not the whole body this
kind windmill is moveable the axis
 the great sail wheel goes through this
moveable top and therefore can be shifted
round horizontally along with it this top
rests on rollers so that it can move easily
on the top the solid stone wall the
tower now for the little wheel
aye the little ingenious wheel said
lucy
that is so placed at first that its
vanes catch the wind whenever it does not
blow upon the sails the great wheel
so as soon as great wheel stops little wheel
sets agoing and it sets in motion a train
 wheel work all which i need not describe
to you i need only say that it
has the power gradually to turn the moveable
top round till it brings great wheel
with its sails facing the wind then great
wheel sets agoing and little wheel by
this time having worked away from the
wind stops its business is done and
it rests till it is wanted when the
wind again changes so as to blow on its
vanes then it sets off again and works
the great wheel round to the right point
and so on continually
very well you understand it i see
said the old gentleman if i may say that
much without your thinking that i mean
to flatter you
harry smiled but said he there is
a thing i do not at all understand about
windmills i saw some standing still
while others nearly in the same situation
were going with the same wind i was
thinking what the reason this could be
and i suppose that there must be something
different in the way in which the
vanes or sails themselves are sloped or set
 believe i should call it
 you think rightly i believe said the
old gentleman i have a friend in france
a scientific man who made a windmill
which continued working when all the
other windmills in the neighbourhood
remained motionless the common people
used to gather round and stare at
it and say that it went by enchantment
for they could not conceive how it could
ofo with less wind than their own but
this arose from the judicious position 
the vanes which had been placed so that
the wind should act upon them with the
greatest possible force
i wish i knew that judicious position
said harry i have often tried to discover
it in making little windmills but i
could only place the sails by guess i
should like to know the rule and the reason
and the best possible way
and i should be very glad if i could
tell you all this my dear but that is beyond
me learned men have thought and
written much upon this very question but
i am not a man science or a mathematician
therefore i cannot explain it to you
i can describe only the things which i
have seen and which i understand
he then gave harry an account several
things he had seen in amsterdam
harry knew that this city is built upon
piles lucy said lie recollected reading
the number these piles which was
prodigious
harry asked whether any them had
given way or whether the houses stood
upright upon them
no said the old gentlemanthe
first idea i had when i entered amsterdam
was that many the houses were tumbling
down they were so much out the perpendicular
line but still they do not
fall
harry was going to ask the reason 
this but another question occurred to his
mind which he was afraid he should forget
if he did not ask it first pray sir
said he do you know if the dutch are
acquainted with the use steam engines
oh yes certainly
then why said harry do not they
use steam instead wind to keep their
mills at work
why should they said the old gentleman

 because said harrv wind is uncertain
they cannot have it when they
please and if they have not wind their
mills must stand still if there is a
storm they cannot make the wind less or
more just as they want more or less force
or quickness but we can manage steam as
we please at all times the year and in
all weather
very true my little mechanic said
the gentleman the dutch are now beginning
to use steam engines and what is
more 
what more he said lucy was in no
condition at this moment to hear for on
the scattering the snuff which he threw
from his fingers she was seized with a fit
 sneezing that seemed as if it would
never when she recovered she heard
the old gentleman speaking the embankments
or high and broad banks which the
dutch have been obliged to raise to protect
the country from inundations these embankments
are secured chiefly by mats
fastened downy willows which are twisted
together and which remain after the
ill
mats decay and thus form the best barrier
against the force the sea
willows said she such yielding
things which i can bend with the least
touch can they withstand the whole force
 the sea 
yes exactly for that reason said the
old gentleman because they do not resist
just as you may have seen the most
yielding manner do best against the torrent
 anger and the gentlest women subdue
the most violenttempered men
lucy smiled she was always ready fora
simile but she liked this extremely and
was pleased with its particular application
harry's heart now opened he drew close
to the elbow the arm chair from which
he had before kept at a certain distance
and he began to use his privilege asking
questions freely which he had till now
done only with great reserve his mother
soon called him away and advised him and
lucy to go to bed as they were to set off
early the next morning to pursue their
journey they were sorry to go and everybody
seemed sorry that they were going
the old gentleman asked which road they
intended to take and when harry's father
answered by coalbrook dale he said that
he was very glad that for the sake 
his young friends
perhaps i shall not be up when you set
off in the morning said he so shake
hands young gentleman and fare you well
it is happy for you that so early in life
you have acquired such a desire for knowledge
tomorrow you will see 
mr frankland interrupted him my
dear sir do not tell him what he will see
leave him the pleasure surprise
goodbye it was come to that melancholy
word and as lucy put her head out
 the carriage window to say the last
goodbye to mr and mrs frankland who
were on the steps at the halldoor shutters
opened in a bedchamber above the sash
was thrown up and the old gentleman put
out his head and repeated goodbye
goodbye and a good journey to you
 thank you thank you sir and pray
shut the window or you will catch cold
said lucy he was very kind to you
harry after all continued she as they
drove away and told you a great many
entertaining and useful things and at last
i liked him very well though he did take
so much snuff and though he was a little
crass yesterday at dinner he made up for
it afterwards i do believe harry that he
loves mrs frankland in his heart
who can help it said harry
i wish said lucy that when i grow
up i may be such a woman
i wish you may said harry in a tone
that sounded gruff because it was as much
as he could do to command his voice to
speak at all he was so sorry to part with
these kind friends lucy indulged him in
his taciturnity and began to examine a
little red morocco memorandum 
which mrs frankland had put into her
hand at parting and which she had held
till now unopened on turning over the
leaves this she found some the
pages filled with close writing
dear good mrs frankland exclaimed
lucy look mamma she has
written all this for us with her own hand 
and what do you think it is
 the juvenile gardener's calendar
dedicated to harry and lucy by their since
friend e frankland
 spring summer autumn winter
all in four little pages said lucy
i am always puzzled with the long directions
in gardening books about heaps 
things too which i have not but here i see
are only such flowers and plants as we have
or ought to have in our gardens any
and continued she after looking over the
calendar it tells me exactly all i
wanted to know about the times and seasons
for planting and transplanting and
sowing seeds and how to have successions
 pretty flowers i must read it to you
any she read and when she had
finished he joined in her delight at finding
that it contained all and no more than
they wanted
and you read it much better lucy
than you sometimes read writing said
harry
because said lucy this is much
plainer than writing is sometimes do you
recollect harry how i stumbled in trying
to read to mamma your translation
yes i knew you wanted to read it
particularly well said harry but you
boggled terribly it made me very hot
not hotter than i was said lucy i
wanted to read it particularly well indeed
that was the very reason you could
not said harry you were too anxious
and frightened
 but what frightened me was that i
could not make out the writing i knew i
was making nonsense what i was reading
and i could not help it since you
have set up to write a running hand like
papa's you run all your letters into one another
so that at last in some your
words there is not a single plain letter
ah my dear i can show you in that
very translation several 
possibly but then you make three
kinds rs and when i have learned to
know one them then comes the other
quite different and all your ws and ns
and us and vs are so alike no human
creature in a hurry can tell them asunder 
and you never cross your s so how can i
tell them from s
 but i do dot my fs said harry
yes you do but you never put the
dots over the right letter i can never guess
to what heads the hats belong and then
worse than all you half scratch out and
half write over and half turn one letter
into another and then repent and leave it
no letter at all but all this i could bear
if you did not make vulgar flourishes
oh lucy be just i have left off
flourishing you must acknowledge ever
since you told me it was vulgar i have
never flourished since that day
but that day was only last tuesday
said lucy
 i do not know whether it wa tuesday
or wednesday replied harry but i
know it was the day you read or could not
read my writing to mamma and i have
never flourished since
poor harry i beg your pardon for
reading your translation so badly said
lucy the next i well read better if i
can
 the next i will write better if i can
said harry let me look again how
does mrs frankland make her writing so
plain 
 and so pretty too said lucy tt
looks pretty because it is so even and
straight audit ig distinct because let
me see she always makes the same letters
the same way that is one good thing 
for then i know them aoain when i meet
with them and she leaves a little space
between her words so that we may see
they are separate words and she finishes
each letter and does not make her ms and
ais so very much alike that people cannot
tell the difference the little es too are a
little different from the zs
very little said harry if i hide
the other letters i defy you mrs lucy to
tell even mrs frankland's i from her e
but look at the difference harry thee
is a little open at top or at worst i
know the i by the dot over it look
the hat is always on the right head and i
know the head by the hat
a woman's way indeed knowing a
head said harry laughing
oh harry when you come to laughing
at women said lucy i know you
have nothing else to say
yes i have replied harry since
you are so fond reading mrs frankland's
writing here is a little bit more for
you here is a page in your which
you have not read
lucy took the but was disappointed
when she saw this page was only a catalogue
 the botanical names the flowers
and shrubs mentioned in the juvenile
gardener's calendar she did not know
the use she said calling flowers and
shrubs by latin names when they have
goodenough english names by which all
people may know them if they please she
confessed that the only thing she had not
liked in all that mrs frankland ever did or
said was her having that day in the garden
always told the latin names the
flowers after the english
 harry i know you think as i do that
you thought so at the time that made
me dislike it the more because i was afraid
you would think it was you know what
i know said harry and i did not
like it i own
we will ask mamma said lucy
they had been all this time talking to
one another on their own side the carriage
and their father and mother on theirs
were conversing on something perhaps as
interesting to themselves it was necessary
to wait for a pause at the first
which occurred the case was laid before
them lucy stating it with some hesitation
and ending by saying
am i wrong father to think it was
pedantic am i wrong mamma to say
any thing about it 
not at all wrong to speak your opinion
freely to us my dear said her mother
you would be foolish said her father
if you blamed without inquiring whether
you were right or wrong but you would
be wrong if you spoke to any stranger a
fault that you saw or thought you saw in
those who had been kind to you
you do not think it was pedantic then
mamma
no my dear i do not but before we
can understand one another we must settle
what we mean by pedantic what do you
mean 
lucy said she knew what she meant but
she could not exactly describe it she
turned to harry first he said that it was
talking greek or latin in the wrong place 
he added that it was trying to show that
we had any sort learning that other people
had not but this lucy thought was
rather vanity or ostentation than pedantry
they had heard people call things pedantic
which they did not think were so 
for instance a boy had once said that harry
himself was a pedant for talking the
siege syracuse and the machines used
there because the boy knew nothing about
them and disliked reading
then you perceive said his mother
that the meaning the word varies with
the different degrees knowledge those
who use it i remember when it was
thought pedantic for a woman to talk 
some books which are now the subject 
common conversation sometimes oldfashioned
learning and sometimes useless
learning is called pedantry and it is
generally thought pedantic to produce any
kind learning that is so unusual that it
is not likely that the company is acquainted
with it or can be pleased by it
in short pedantry may be said to be an
illtimed parade knowledge
vol ji g
to go back to mrs frankland mammas
said lucy she knew that we were
not acquainted with those latin names
yes but she did not consider you as
company she did not display her knowledge
to excite your admiration she used
those names in speaking to you because
she thought it might be useful to you to
learn them the knowledge the botanical
names plants is not now unusual 
most people we meet with are acquainted
with them
i did not know that said lucy and
now i recollect mamma when mrs frankland
was talking plants to the artificialflower
woman who did not seem to know
any thing about the matter she called them
only by their common english names 
therefore i am sure she told the latin
names to us because as you say she
thought it would be use to us if she
had wanted to be admired for her learning
she would have displayed it in company
so it is proved harry that she was not
pedantic and i am very glad it
but still said harry who did not seem
quite satisfied remember what mamma
said that useless learning is pedantry
then the question is whether this be
useless learning or not said hisfather
that is the very bottom the question
to which i want to get said harry
what is the use knowing all those long
latin names when people may know the
plants they are talking as well by
their own english names 
they may know them and describe
them as well to english people but not to
foreigners said his father most well
educated foreigners french spaniards
germans italians danes or swedes understand
latin therefore it is a sort universal
language in which botanists and
persons science can make themselves
understood by each other in all books 
botany the latin is given along with the
common name and then the description 
the plant to which this name refers can be
applied by people in different countries
g
i have a friend at paris who could not understand
what was meant by a cowslip because
in french there is no distinguishing
name for cowslip it goes under the
general word for primroses primeverej
 yet a cowslip and a primrose are very
different said lucy
but said her father if this french
lady had been acquainted with the botanic
name she would have known the difference
the moment it was mentioned and the deficiency
in the french vocabulary would
have been rectified i remember hearing
a french lady talking to a gentleman
about the beautiful laurier rose the
gentleman understood french but he happened
never to have seen a laurier rose
in france therefore he could not understand
what she meant she described it
but still he mistook it for a rhododendron 
at last somebody mentioned its botanic
name nerium oleander and the moment
the gentleman heard this latin name he
understood what was meant and he knew
it was the common oleander which he had
often seen in english greenhouses
harry now understood the use learning
the latin botanic names and he was
satisfied
remember my dear harry added
his mother that i mean no more than
that it is useful as a lanouaoe and as a
means acquiring knowledge
lucy said that she would learn by heart
all the botanic names the common
flowers in the garden calendar which
mrs frankland had been so kind as to
write in her pocketbook and she begged
harry to tell her whether many them
had any particular meaning like those two
which she had been told hindrance the
water lover or acanthus the beautiful
because she thought she could then learn
them more quickly by heart and remember
them better
harry said that he would if he could
but that he would rather do it at another
time he wanted to look at a broadwheeled
waggon which was coming down
the hill and while he watched the shape
and motion the wheels and asked his
father some questions concerning them
lucy was pitying the poor dog who
was chained underneath the waggon and
who as he waddled along apparently
half dragged by the neck looked very
mournful she was told that his use was
to guard the waggon and that his being
chained to it secured his always being near
it she wished very much that the man
could be persuaded to loose him a faithful
dog she thought would guard his master's
goods without being chained her mother
observed that it would be useless to talk
sentiment to an english waggoner lucy
wished that she had some money that she
might give it to buy this dog from his master
and set him free her mother told
her that even supposing she could buy this
dog the man would get another and this
dog would not perhaps be better ois as he
night not find anybody to feed him you
know my dear lucy we could not take
him with us what should we do for the
next dog we meet under the next waggon
lucy saw the impossibility freeing
them all and sighed her mother was glad
to see that she had such humane feelings
for animals but said there is much we
must bear to see in this life that we cannot
remedy all we can do is to take as good
care as possible those creatures which
we have the charge
lucy blushed i will take care not to
forget to give poor dash water when i have
him again mamma i recollect one day 
here she was interrupted by harry exclaiming
 father pray look out the
window this instant do you see that
streak black powder in the track the
waggon papa i saw it dribbling from a
barrel is it not gunpowder may i get
out and look
he spoke as fast as he could utter the
words and his father instantly called to
the waggoner stopped the carriage and
jumped out harry following him it was
gunpowder they ran after the waggoner
who either did not hear or would not stop
when they overtook him and showed him
the gunpowder running out the barrel
he being a sulky fellow was very angry
with the barrel and with the man who
packed it and with the man to whom
it was going and with every body but
himself he had no clear idea the
danger he had run till harry's father told
him that he had some years before known
a waggon to have been blown to pieces and
men and horses killed by just such an accident
some gunpowder had been shaken
out a barrel in the waggon and had
taken fire as it is supposed from a spark
struck from a flint in the road this communicating
with the gunpowder had blown
up the whole the waggoner scarcely
credited the story till he heard the name
 the hill down which the waggon had
been going and then as harry observed
without any further question he believed
it to be true so it is that ignorant people
believe or disbelieve without any reasonable
grounds they staid to see the
barrel well packed and safely stowed
some the passengers who were sitting
within the canvas roof the waggon and
who had looked out and listened now expressed
much gratitude and said they
mioht have lost their lives but for this
timely discovery danger the waggoner
then grew warmer in his thanks and as he
was repacking the barrel said in his 
tone to harry
 master you've done uz a mortal good
turn i finds and if zo be it was in my power
to give you a lift any ways fd not be
behind you'd zee but the likes i can
do little for the likes you gem'men
harry thanked him he wanted nothing
he said but he was glad that he and his
waggon were safe
 how well it was father said harry
as they walked back together to the carriage
 that i saw the gunpowder running
gout
and recollected what you had told me
about the blowing up the waggon
yes said his father you see how
useful it is to observe what passes before
your eyes and to recollect what you know
at the right time
when lucy heard what had passed
after rejoicing that waggon and waggoner
were safe she regretted that when the man
offered to do harry a good turn he had not
said a word for the dog
i forgot the dog cried harry father
will you stay for me three minutes
i will run and speak for the dog
his father smiled and back he ran
what he said or in what words the waggoner
replied we cannot tell for harry
never could remember either the words he
used or those said to him but the result
was as he informed lucy that the dog
lion was unchained that the waggoner
promised that lion should have liberty to
run after him by day and that he should
be chained only by night
lucy was proud her brother's share 
this affair and as was ever her custom when
she was happy she went on talking 
every thing she could think and all
that she saw upon the road while harry
according to his custom when he was well
pleased with himself and particularly happy
was quite silent after lucy had exhausted
every thing she could say she
perceived harry's silence
what are you thinking harry are
you still thinking lion and the waggoner
said she
 not i for there is nothing more to be
done about them said harry i am considering
what that very bright thing can be
which i see out yonder sparkling in the
sunshine
i see it said lucy it looks like a
monstrous diamond twinkling between
the trees what is it papa look at
it
her father thought it was the reflection
 light from some weathercock or polished
globe on the top a building as they
approached nearer they saw it was from
the glass roof a conservatory
reflection light said lucy what
do you mean papa by the reflection 
light and what is the difference between
reflection and refraction which i have
heard
her father answered when the rays
 light are thrown back from the surface
 any polished substance on which they
strike for instance from a polished piece
 metal or glass they are said to be
reflected when the rays pass through any
transparent body and in doing so are
turned from their direct course they are
said to be refracted and this light is called
infracted light
do you recollect lucy said harry
yesterday in the boat you observed that
the oar in the water looked as if it was
broken that was because you saw it
through the water mr frankland told
you that was the effect refraction
i remember said lucy that he told
me so and that i did not understand at the
time what he meant i was ashamed to ask
him more about it and afterwards i forgot
it but you harry can explain it to me
cannot you
indeed i cannot said harry
but papa will you be so good as to
make us understand it
my dear i cannot be so good as to
make you understand it yet till you have
more knowledge i am glad however
lucy that you observed the appearance 
the oar in the water and that you wish to
know the reason what you saw seemingly
slight observations this sort lead to
important discoveries
do they indeed papa said lucy
yes but often observations such as
these though they might lead to great discoveries
if pursued remain hundreds 
years useless because people do not try to
find out the reason what they have seen
as long ago as the time aristotle
which is above two thousand years among
other questions in his works on natural
history he asks why a stick appears
bent when it is held obliquely in water
this question was never rightly answered
till about four hundred years afterwards by
ptolemy the fame several great philosophers
among the moderns rests upon
their discoveries the rules or laws for
measuring that refraction light on which
the appearance the bent stick in water
depends and not till the time our
great newton was the whole satisfactorily
explained or all the knowledge obtained
to which it has led he by pursuing this
and other seemingly slight observations
and by trying experiments carefully to find
out the cause what he had observed made
his great discoveries those properties
and laws liorht which we call the laws
 reflection and refraction even from
considering the colours on a soap bubble
which many others had observed before
him but which they had made no use
he was led to some the most important
conclusions respecting vision and colours
but here all philosophical conversation
ceased interrupted by the sound the horn
 a mail coach harry and lucy quickly
darted their heads out the window 
for though oftentimes seen lucy never
willingly missed the passing a coach
stage or mail this was as harry guessed
the royal mail with its guard behind the
scarlet man with the gold laced hat blowing
the authoritative trumpet to clear the
road proud as a king on his throne
sat the manycaped manycravatted coachman
on his box with his four fine horses
even in hand who kept on in full trot
regardless the load behind the whip
idle in the master's hand except that once
he flung out the long lash with a light
touch to remind one careless horse that he
must draw fairly and to bring him into
true trotting time as they passed lucy
admired the horses much but the harness
more
nice said she and nicer than any
gentleman's harness bright brass rings
standing upon the horses foreheads with
twinkling mammals glittering in the sun
regardless the harness and the twinkling
mammals harry had eyes only for the
horses
what fine creatures and how they
go oh father look how they turn the
corner cried harry leaning out the
carriage to watch them till they were quite
out sight
the road for the rest this stage was
as lucy observed a stupid straight line
she could find nothing to do but to count
the carriages they met in the last five
miles her father told her that on the
bath road he had once met eleven stage
coaches in five miles but on this road
she met in five miles only one heavy
laden waggon and twelve coal carts
harry wondered that she continued still
looking out the window when there
was nothing to be seen but coal carts 
she said she had a reason for this and
he left her to take her own time to tell
it which did not happen this stage
harry do you remember that the
old gentleman told us last nioht said
lucy that we should be surprised before
this day's journey should be over
so he did said harry but i have
been so happy all day that i never
thought it till this minute
 i have been very happy too said
lucy but i have thought it sometimes
and now that dinner is over and
that evening is coming on it is time to
think about it i wonder harry what it
can be
lucy was standing in the parlour 
the inn where they had dined and she
looked all round the room and then out
 the window as she spoke
there is nothing surprising here i
am sure said she but i heard papa
order that the horses should not be put
to yet not for two hours what can bethe
reason that harry
we are to walk through some park
near this town i believe said harry
and the carriage is to meet us at the
farthest gate and we are to see some
house come come lucy papa is
calling to us to follow him
lucy followed with great alacrity certain
that they were now going to be surprised
but they walked up an avenue
 beech trees and reached the house
without meeting with any thing surprising
and lucy was disappointed when
she found that her father and mother
came to this house only to look at some
pictures neither harry nor lucy had
yet any taste for pictures and their mother
therefore advised them to divert
themselves by running about the pleasure
grounds which amusement they
were permitted to enjoy upon her answering
for them that they would not touch
any the flowers or shrubs first they
went through all the flower gardens then
through the park and by the river side and
up again through a wood on the banks till
the red light sunset which they saw on
the stems the trees warned them to return
from whence they came they were afraid
 being too late and keeping their father
and mother waiting but luckily they met
the woodranger going home from his
work and he showed them a path which
took them the shortest way to the house
instead being too late they found that
they need not have run so fast for their
father and mother had not yet finished
looking at the pictures
 let us sit down then and cool ourselves
quietly said lucy harry only
think papa and mamma having been all
this long time looking at pictures how
tired i should have been if i had been
standing all this while with my neck bent
back staring up at them harry do you
think that when we grow up and set out
upon our travels that we shall ever be so
fond pictures as to stand looking at
them so long 
perhaps we may said harry
though we do not care about them now
i remember some time ago i never
thought looking at prints except 
machines but ever since the day i saw
the prints in don quixote i have grown
fond them
yes and how happy we were together
said lucy looking over the prints
in pine's microcosm
true i forgot them said harry i
always liked those because they are so
like things and people we see everyday

and the prints in the arabian tales
said lucy though they are not like
things we see every day or any day or
that we can ever see in reality you like
those do not you harry 
 i do said harry some them
some them repeated lucy very
right so do i those that are like my ideas
 what the sultans and viziers and fatima
and their turbans and come hassan
might be but some others i do not
like such as aladdin's genius the lamp
and the african magician because they do
not come up to my imagination them
harry do describe to me your image 
the african magician
it was a difficult task and harry was
glad to be relieved from it by his father's
calling to him to desire he would see if
the carriage was come to the parkgate
it was there waiting and by the time they
got into it the sun was set and it was
growing dusk by the time that they
reached the the next stage and had
drank tea it was quite dark they were
however to go on another stage this night
lucy who did not much like travelling
in the dark observed as her mother was
getting into the carriage that the coach
lamps were not lighted
 never mind my dear said her father
 we shall have light enough soon
soon oh no papa begging your
pardon cried lucy there drill be no
moonlight these two hours i can show
you when the moon will rise by my new
pocketbook papa
very likely my dear said her father 
but lucy do not stand talking on the
step the carriage
at the moment when her father was
giving her this advice one the horses
was startled by a light and giving a sudden
jerk to the carriage lucy was thrown
from the step backward and must have
fallen under the wheel but that her father
caught her in his arms and set her
upright again into the carriage she
went directly and while yet trembling
with the fright her father repeated his
advice
while you live child never again
stand in that manner on the step a carriage
without holding by something i
assure you that you put yourself into much
greater danger at that moment than any
you are likely to meet with from the darkness
 this night
lucy hoped that her father did not think
that she was a coward and after some minutes
silent submission she expressed this
hope and began to defend her character for
courage by reminding harry all the instances
she could recollect her never
having been afraid in a carriage harry
said nothing i cannot see your face
harry i hope you are agreeing with
me
no i am laughing for i think you area
little afraid at this minute i feel you
squeezing close to me because we are
going down the hill
think and talk then something
else said her mother and do not tell
lucy she is a coward or you will make her
one lucy my dear there is no danger 
but if there were ever so much you cannot
alter it
 no mamma only i wish he would
not go quite so fast said lucy would
you speak to him 
 no t cannot teach the postillion to
drive can you lucy 
no indeed mamma said lucy
laughing or trying to laugh
 then we had better let him follow his
own business which he understands and
which we do not
very well mamma i know you are
right and that there is no danger now
we are down the hill i feel and it is allover
nicely but mamma suppose there
was danger and that the horses were
really what is called running away what
would you do 
 sit still the only thing which
would not increase my danger answered
her mother
 could not you get out mamma said
lucy
i could perhaps but i would not attempt
it because know it is the most hazardous
thing that could be done said her
mother
yes said lucy's father i believe
that more lives have been lost and more
limbs broken by persons attempting to get
out carriages when horses were running
than ever were lost by overturns
all who have had experience can tell you
that the best thing you can do is to stay
quietly in the carriage till the horses stop
or are stopped if you make any noise or
scream or call to the person who is driving
you endanger yourself more because you
distract his attention and you may be sure
that he is doing the best he can because
he is probably as fond his life as
you are yours and as to driving probably
his best is better than your best
certainly papa but if said lucy
and there she paused
 if what
i am not sure whether it is right to
say it papa but i have heard that coachmen
and postillions are sometimes drunk
vol h
and if he was drunk he would not know
how to drive
and do you think that his being
drunk would make you know how to
drive said her father
lucy laughed again because harry
laughed
but papa i should know better than
he did if he had lost all sense
 true but i would not advise you asa
little girl or even if you were a woman
i should not advise you to attempt to direct
or argue with a drunken man for
besides the danger his giving some rude
answer either the coachman would be
too drunk to understand any thing or he
would not as long as he could understand
any thing it is probable he would
understand what he habitually knows best
how to drive if he be so far intoxicated
as not to know how to do that he would be
still less able to comprehend your reasons or
directions supposing them to be ever so
good
a
very true said lucy she declared
that she never should think talking to a
drunken coachman or postillion but she
hoped that she never should be driven by
one
in which hope her mother joined her
lucy my dear said she vrhen i vias
young i was afraid in a carriage and i will
tell you how i was cured
how mamma
 i was cured my fear for myself by
a greater fear for another person i used
to be sent out airing with a lady who had
lost the use her limbs and i was so
much afraid for her that it took my attention
away from myself she was very
cowardly i was taken up in quieting her
apprehensions and i saw that nine times
in ten when she was alarmed there was no
cause for fear this encouraged me the
next time and so on besides the feeling
that if there were any danger i must act
for her was a motive to me to keep my
senses and presence mind
h 
as to that last said lucy i think
at least i fear that it would have had a
contrary effect upon me and that i should
have been ten times more afraid with the
helpless person in the carriage
no said harry i think i should
have felt as my mother did
 what stops us what is the matter
said lucy
matter nothing in the world my
dear said harry laughing only weare
stopping till the turnpike gate is opened
and till this old man with a lantern has
fumbled the key into the lock
lucy joined in his laugh and said afterwards
 laughing is very good for
curing people being afraid foolishly for
when you laugh harry i know that there
is no danger or you could not be so
merry and now it is very extraordinary
 but i am no more afraid than you
are harry i will prove it to you i will
think any thing you please i can cap
verses with you if you will
 no thank you not yet i do not know
enough to cap with you yet my dear the
little that i know is from shakspeare and
that is blank verse which will not do for
capping
but it will do for repeating said
lucy and i wish you would repeat some
 the quarrel brutus and cassias which
we read together
i will try said harry where shall
i begin
begin said lucy with brutus's
speech
what shall one us
that struck the foremost man all this world
but for supporting robbers shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes 
harry repeated this as if he liked it and
went on through all brutus's part the
quarrel he said he could not forget any
 this because he felt it he admired
brutus and lucy pitied cassius his mother
observed that he liked dramatic poetry
better than descriptive lucy however
thought some descriptive poetry was beautiful
and repeated to him the description 
queen mab and her chariot the hazelnut
made by the joiner squirrel time
out mind the fairies coachman this
harry liked well also some the fairies
in the midsummer night's dream
who light their tapers at the fiery
glowworms eyes and harry admired
ariel in the tempest whose business
it is 
to tread the ooze the salt deep 
to run upon the sharp wind the north 
to dive into the fire or ride on the curled clouds
or put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes
and he could conceive delicate ariel's
pleasure in killing the canker in the rosebuds
flying on the bat's back or lying in a
cowslip's bell but for pope's elegant ariel
and the fifty chosen nymphs special
note he cared but little he well knew
that his mother admired them but he was
too sturdily honest to affect admiration which
he did not feel he thought it was his fault
his mother told him that perhaps he would
like them hereafter and that in the meanwhile
he need not despair his own taste
for poetry
harry observed how much more easy he
found it to learn lines which he understood
than to get by heart lists names
he said that he recollected having read in
baron trenck's life that when the king 
prussia wanted to try trenck's memory he
gave him to learn by rote a list fifty
strange names soldiers in a regiment
trenck learned them quickly
i am glad said harry that i was
not in his place for his majesty would
have thought me quite a dunce and would
have decided that i had no memory it is
much more difficult to learn nonsense than
sense continued harry there is something
in sense to help one out
unless it be droll nonsense said
lucy but when it is droll the diversion
helps me to remember
harry doubted even this
their father said he would if they liked
it try the experiment by repeating for
them some sentences droll nonsense
which were put together by mr foote a
humorous writer for the purpose trying
the memory a man who boasted that
he could learn any thing by rote on once
hearing it
 oh do let us hear it cried lucy 
and try us
let us hear it said harry but
i am sure i shall not be able to learn
it
it will be no great loss if you do not
said his father
now lucy pray sit still and listen
said harry
but harry's power attention which
he had prepared himself to exert to the
utmost was set completely at defiance
when his father as fast as he could utter
the words repeated the following nonsense
abruptly beginning with 
 so she went into the garden to cut a cabbage
leaf to make an apple pie and at the same time a
great shebear coming up the street pops its head
into the shop what no soap so he died and
she very imprudently married the barber and there
were present the picninnies and the joblillies and
the garyulies and the grand panjandrum himself
with the little round button at top and they all
fell to playing the game catch as catch can
till the gunpowder ran out at the heels their
boots
gunpowder at the heels their boots 
horrible nonsense cried harry while
lucy rolling with laughter and laughing
the more at harry's indignation only
wished it was not dark that she might see
his face
well can either you remember or
repeat any this said their mother
lucy said that if it had not been for
the grand panjandrum she was almost sure
she should have been able to say it but
she was so much surprised by meeting the
grand panjandrum himself again and so
diverted by his little round button at top
that she could think nothing else 

sides laughing hindered her from hearing
the names all the company who were
present at the barber's marriage but she
perfectly well remembered the picking
 and she knew why she did because
their name was something like piccanini 
and this word had been fixed in her head
by a droll anecdote she had heard a
negro boy who when he was to tell his
master that mr gosling had called upon
him one morning and could not recollect
his name said he knew the gentleman was
a mr goosepiccanii
 so you see lucy said her father
that even with you who seem to be yourself
one the numerous family the piccannes
or the goosepiccaninies there is
always some connection ideas or sounds
which helps to fix even nonsense in the
memory
 papa will you be so very good as to
repeat it once more now harry once
more let us try
i would rather learn a greek verb
said harry there is some sense in that
papa could you repeat one 
 i could son but i will not now said
his father let your sister divert herself
with the grand panjandrum and do not
be too grand yourself harry it is sweet
to talk nonsense in season always sense
would make jack a dull boy
the grand panjandrum was repeated
once more and this time harry did his
best and remembered what she went into
the garden to cut for an apple pie and
he mastered the great shebear and the
no soap but for want knowing who
died he never got cleverly to the marriage
with the barber but lucy less troubled
concerning the nominative case went on
merrily and she very impatiently married
the barber but just as lucy was
triumphantly naming the company present
future commentators will observe that this als
lules to the ancient british adage
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
all play and no work makes jack a mere toy
and had got to the joblillies harry whose
attention was not so wholly absorbed as
to have no eves for outward nature exclaimed

father father look look out
 this window a fire a fire a terrible
fire it must be the whole sky yonder
red with it
terrible said lucy looking out
it must be a town on fire
father repeated harry much astonished
by his father's silence and composure
 do not you see it
 do said his father but it is not a
town on fire you will see what it is presently

a dead silence ensued and the grand
panjandrum was forgotten as though he
had never existed they drove on harry
stretching out one window and lucy
leaning out the other while her mother
held her fast lest the door should
open
harry what do you see i see fires
flames great sparks flying up against
the sky now i see i do see mamma
a house burning there there mamma
at a distance flames coming out at the
top 
 on my side i see flames coming out
 the ground said harry
lucy rushed tumbling over to her brother's
side the carriage bidding him lookout
at her house burning
 fires indeed the whole country is on
fire said lucy
 i suppose they are burning the grass
or a wood said harry endeavouring to
regain his wonted composure and to make
sense it but certainly there is a house
on fire father flames red as blood bursting
from the top 
and we are coming nearer and nearer
every instant cried lucy the road i see
is going through the middle these fires 
oh father mother will you call to the
man he must be going wrong
he is going quite right my dear said
her mother keep yourself quiet there is
no danger as you may see by our not
being alarmed for you or for ourselves
these words calmly pronounced tranquillized
lucy and harry determined to
wait the event and not utter another word
whatever he might see he was quite
certain by his father's composure that
there was no danger either for themselves
or for other people but this security left
his mind more at liberty to feel curiosity
and very curious he was to know what was
coming how it would and above all
how it would be accounted for
they were driving now along a raised
road with fires on each side them
flames seemed to burst from the ground at
intervals a few yards their deep
red colour and pointed shape appeared
against the dark night far and wide as the
eye could reach the fires near the road
made it as light as day
my father might well say we should
have light enough thought harry
i wonder the horses are not frightened
by the fires thought lucy she had been
for some time breathing short in dread
every instant that the horses would start
off the raised road and overturn the
carriage or plunge and throw the manor
set off full gallop when none 
these things came to pass and when
she saw the postillion so inconceivably
at his ease as to lean over and pat his
horses and then to take off his hat and
tighten the band and try it again and
again on his head till it fitted lucy began
to breathe more freely and she observed
how plainly they could see the man and
horses and the black shadow the carriage
upon the road
then exerting herself to find something
to say to show she was not afraid she
looked for the burning tower but it was
concealed by a turn in the road or it was
confounded with other distant flames
it is like the country the fireworshippers
in the arabian tales said she 
and there they are pointing to a group
 figures she saw by one the fires nearest
the road figures with pale faces like
spectres the light shining strongly on them
she could see the man's bare arms and
his shovel as he shovelled up the burning
mass and the boy standing by
and the woman with the child in her
arms quite like a picture i have seen
somewhere
but never anywhere said harry
did you see such a real sight as this
all those lone fires for miles round
bumino how or for what i cannot 


it is like the infernal regions is not
it harry said lucy
i never saw them said harry nor
any thing like this it is very wonderful
what can the fires be for signal fires 
no thought harry there are too many
and on flat ground
signal fires are always on hills are
not they father i see these fires near us
are from little heaps or hillocks earth 
but whether they were artificial or natural
made by men's hands or thrown up
by subterranean fires harry could not
divine he wished to find out he desired
not to be told and yet he almost despaired
 discovering
 father i have read in some 
travels fires that burst out the ground
 themselves and i have heard 
some lake pitch or some what do you
call it
 bitumen do you mean
the very thing i wanted father are
these fires that sort from bitumen ordo
they burst out the ground themselves

not exactly either said his father
but those are both good guesses
the fiery tower again brother cried
lucy they came near enough to it now
to see its dark form and even to hear the
roaring the fire the body flame undiminished
diminishing kept spouting
up from the top the black tower blown
to and fro by the wind nobody near or
heeding it when the road brought them
to the other side the tower they saw an
open red arch underneath which seemed
to be filled with a sloping bed fire
harry had often seen a limekiln burning
in the night it is a lime kiln i do
believe only a different shape from what
i have seen
no said his father but that is a
sensible guess
then it is a founder i have it now
i remember the picture in the encyclopaedia
it is a founder for melting iron or brass
now i begin to understand it all
and there are others the same sort
said lucy coming in view and what
is that black shadowy form moving up
and down regularly and continually like
the outline a steam engine 
like the great beam it is a steam
engine cried harry i see others
there they are going on all night long
working working working always doing
their duty by themselves and themselves
 how very 
sublime said lucy
his father told harry that he was quite
right in supposing that these were founders
as to the fires he said most 
them were low ridges coal which were
burning into coke for the use the forges
the process was very simple after the
coals were set on fire a man was employed
to cover them with ashes through
which the smoke could escape till they
were sufficiently burned coke he told
them gave out a more steady and intense
heat after the gas and smoke were driven
off some the fires he added might
perhaps proceed from the refuse small
coal which were known occasionally to ignite
spontaneously and were suffered to
burn as there w as no danger their doing
any mischief in this waste land
when this explanation was given lucy's
interest a little diminished with the mystery
 but harrv s increased when lie considered
the wonderful reality
 i shall like to see this country by daylight
said harry and to learn what
those numbers steam engines are doinof
that must be for tomorrow said his
father
when they visited the fiers moor bv daylight
they saw only a black dreamt waste
with half burning half smothering heaps 
dross coal and cinders clouds smoke
 all colours white yellow and black
from the chimneys founders and forces
darkening the air the prospect they could
not see for there was none it was a dead
flat the atmosphere laden with the smell 
coal and smoke the rass the heroes
the trees all blackened the hands and
faces expiry man woman and child they
met begrimed with soot the very sheep
blackened not a lamb even with a lock 
white wool or a clean face lucy said
that it was the most frightful country she
had ever beheld harry acknowledged
that there was nothing beautiful here to be
seen but it was wonderful it was a sort 
sublime he could not help feeling a great
respect for the place where steam engines
seemed to abound and in truth to have the
world almost to themselves these laboured
continually in vast and various
works blowing the huge bellows the
furnaces smelting houses forges and
founders raising tune water each minute
to drain the depths the coal mines
the strokes the beams the steam engines
were heard at regular intervals and
the sound the blast the furnaces at a
distance as they approached the founders
the noises grew louder and louder till
as they entered the buildings the roaring 
the draft was tremendous lucy involuntarily
holding her breath looked up to her
father she saw his lips move but she could
not hear what he said she held fast by
his hand and stood still she saw an immense
furnace full as she thought liquid
fire but it was redhot liquid metal one
man with brawny arms bare up to the
shoulders and a face shining with perspiration
was carrying this fiery liquid in a
large ladle another poured it out into
moulds sand some men with white
caps on their heads and pale firelighted
visages were hurrying to and fro carrying
in longhandled tongs masses redhot
metal others seen in the forge at a distance
were dragging out redhot bars
while two were standing with huge hammers
raised waiting the moment to give
their alternate blows lucy tried to make
harry understand that she thought the
men were like cyclops but she could not
make him hear the words in this place
it seemed in vain for human creatures to
attempt to make use their voices here
wind and fire the hammer the bellows the
machinery seemed to engross the privilege
 being heard the men went on
with their business in silence only making
signs when they wanted you to stand out
 the way
while they were seeing the founder
they were met by mr watson the master
 the works to whom harry's father had
a letter introduction he apologized
for not having been able to attend them
himself but now he said he was at
leisure for some hours he hospitably
invited them to his house which was at a
little distance there he introduced them
to his wife and sisters lucy and her
mother staid with these ladies while mr
watson took harry and his father to see
his colliery they were one by one to be
let down in a bucket into the shaft the
coal mine which was like a deep well
mr watson turning his eyes upon harry
asked his father if the boy would be afraid
to go down harry colouring highly
answered for himself no sir i am not
afraid to go wherever my father goes
his father went down first with one 
the colliers in the bucket it was let down
by the rope from a steam engine in a few
seconds harry lost sight him and soon
the bucket reappeared with only the collier
in it
now you may go down or not just as
you will said mr watson
i will go down said harry
then do not be in a hurry let me
put you into the bucket
he took him by the arm and lifted him
in and the collier bid him be quite still
and he was so the bucket was let down
and it grew darker and darker as they descended
till at last he could see only a little
speck at the opening at top like a star 
lipht he could but just distinguish the
mans hand and arm like a shadow as he
pushed against the sides the shaft to keep
the bucket from striking they landed safely
at the bottom where there was lamplight
and harry sprung out the bucket
with the assistance his father's hand
and he was very glad that he had had the
courage to go down as soon as mr watson
had descended and joined them
he took them through the galleries and
passages the coal mines and showed
harry where and how the men were at
work harry was surprised to see the
numbers workmen and carriages that
were conveying the coal and here he
had the pleasure seeing what he had
long wished for the manner in which a
steam engine was employed in pumping
out the water that collects in a mine before
steam engines had been brought into
general use the master told him that it
was the labour years to do what is now
perhaps done in a few days
his father stopped to look at a kind
 lamp which has been used for sometime
in lighting mines and which from
its peculiar construction is called the
safety lamp as it completely prevents
the fatal accidents that formerly occurred
from the explosion inflammable vapours
when ignited by the unprotected flame
 a candle harry wished to understand
it but his father told him he would
vol i
explain it to him at another opportunity
that they must not delay now for mr watson's
time was precious which mr watson
did not deny however he did not
hurry them he only spoke shortly passed
on quickly and called to the man at the
windlass to let down they were
drawn up in the same manner by which
they had descended and harry was glad
to see the daylight again though it dazzled
him and to feel the fresh air next they
saw the iron rail roads on which small
carts loaded with coal were easily pushed
along by one man sometimes by one child
guiding or following them and presently
they came to what mr watson called
the inclined plane harry saw two
roads railway placed beside each other
up and down a steep slope on one them
there were several empty coal carts linked
together and on the other a cart loaded
with coal which as it ran down the slope
dragged the empty carts up this was effected
by means a chain which was fastened
by one to the loaded cart and
by the other to the empty carts and which
passed round a large pulley at tee top the
slope or inclined plane so that the loaded
cart descending by its own weight on one
road made those on the other road ascend
 little man you may take a ride up
and down if you will said mr watson 
safe enough and i see you are no flincher
and not bred too daintily to sit in a coal
cart a slave to a coat or a jacket
harry jumped upon one the empty
carts
 throw him a truss that hay to
sit on there hold fast now for your life
keep an eye on him up with you
and up he went and from the top
looked down upon his father and for a
moment he felt afraid to go back again it
looked so steep a collier's boy who was
standing by grinning told him he went up
and down the same way ever so many times
a day and no harm never harry said to
himself if it does not hurt others why
should it hurt me and thus conquering
his fear by his reason he took his seat
and down he went 
father cried harry as soon as he
i 
had one leg out the cart i am glad
lucy was not with us she would have
been frightened out her wits at seeing
me coming down
look to yourself now and take your
other leg out the cart said mr watson
for we want the cart to go up again
it was lucky i drew my leg out the
way in time or i should have been thrown
out the cart along with that mountain 
coal said harry
yes people must take care their
own legs and arms in these places said
mr watson and in all places it is no
bad thing to do
bluff and rough as he was harry
liked mr watson who was very goodnatured
and whenever he had time to
think the boy pointed out what was
worth his seeing but once nearly threw
him into a ditch by swinging him too far
with one arm over a stile at the next
stile harry said
 i would rather get over by myself
sir if you please
do so if you can and i see that you
can so i need not trouble myself more
about you
it was dinner time when they reached
mr watson's house here they dined at
an earlier hour than harry and lucy were
used to but they were quite ready to eat
harry especially after all the exercise he
had taken the dinner was plentiful
though plain and there were creams and
sweet things in abundance for the master
loved them and his wife and sisters were
skilled in confectionary arts as soon as
the cloth was removed mr watson swallowed
a glass wine and pushing the
bottle to his guests rose from table saying
i must leave you now to take care 
yourselves i must go to my business
harry jumped up directly and followed
him to the door his mother called him
back saying she was afraid he would be
troublesome mr watson did not ask you
to go with him did he 
i did not think the boy said
mr watson looking back from the door
 i am going only to see my workmen paid
this saturday evening this would be no
diversion to you my boy would it
yes it would said harry if i should
not be troublesome he was going to say
but mr watson went on
follow then and welcome you will
not be any trouble to me i shall not think
 you more than if you were not with
me
so much the better thought harry who
liked to stand by and see and hear without
any body's minding him mr watson
hastily swinging round his great coat as he
spoke flung the flaps into harry's eyes
but harry not minding that ran after him 
mr watson strode across the court yard and
up the office stairs three steps at a time
the room was full men who made way
directly for their master but the crowd
closed again before harry could pass
however he squeezed in under the elbows
 the great men till he got to a corner
beside the desk the clerk who was sitting
with a great open and a bag 
money before him harry knew he was
not to interrupt so he asked no questions
but got up on a tall mushroomtopped leather
stool which stood beside the clerks
seat and watched all that went on he
was amused with the countenances the
men who each in turn came to the desk
he observed that mr watson was in the
first place very exact to see that they were
rightly paid once when there was some
difficulty with a deaf stupid old man
about the balance his account he
looked into the books himself to see whether
the old man or the clerk was right 
and harry looking and listening tried to
learn what was meant by this balance 
account mr watson was better than his
word for he found time between the going
away one class workmen and the
coming another to explain it to harry
whom he saw poring over the clerk's
shoulder and who once ventured to saw
where is the balance that he is talking
af
look here the whole mystery is this
look at the top these pages and all
the pages in the d and c that
is debtor and creditor debtor on the
left hand page creditor on the right
hand page all that this man owes to me
is put on the debtor or left hand side 
the all that is due to him is to be
put on the creditor or right hand side
then add together all the sums that belong
to the debtor side and all the sums
that belong to the creditor side and see
which is the heaviest or largest and deduct
the least or lightest sum from it the
difference whatever it may be is called
the balance you may consider an account
as a pair scales and the surat
put on either side as weights the
two sides are at last to be made to
balance each other as the weights in the
opposite scales now for example look
here at john smith's account debtor
side two pounds creditor side four
pounds eight shillings you my boy may
make out what the balance is which i
am to pay him write your answer down
when you know it but take your head
out my way i must go on with my
business
harry wrote his answer with a pencil
and put it on the desk before mr watson
but it was long before it was seen or
thought 
two pounds eight shillings is the balance
due to john smith
right said mr watson the same
method is observed in keeping all accounts 
the money paid by the person who keeps
the account is put on the debtor side and
the money received by him on the creditor
side
is that all said harry
 all in simple accounts said mr watson
but bookkeeping though on the same
principle is much more complicated
harry was interested in listening to what
was said to the people mr watson inquired
how they were going on at home
and they told him all about their wants
and their hopes and their fears
several the workmen left part 
their money in his hands to be put into
the savings bank harry understood
i 
that by so doing the men obtained a provision
for the time when they might be
sick or must grow old there was one
slovenly man in rags illpatched when
he came up to be paid mr watson
looked displeased and said what a
shame giles to see you in such rags
when you earn so much if you would
put less your money into your cup
you would have more on your back
harry understood what he meant the
ragged man walked away ashamed while
his companions laughed at him mr watson
was steady as well as goodnatured
to the people the industrious and frugal
he encouraged the idle and drunken he
reproved and he took pains to see that
justice was done to them all
while harry had been seeing these
workmen paid and learning what is
meant by the balance an account
lucy had been learning something
equally interesting to her concerning
sugar plums and sugarcandy one 
mr watson's sisters was well informed
both in the practice and theory confectionary
as soon as harry came in
lucy ran to him to tell him what she
was intent upon and he was obliged
for the present to keep his debtor and
creditor accounts to himself 
 harry my dear you know those
little tiny sugarplums which are no
larger than the head a minnikin pin
 i think i know the sugarplums you
mean said harry but i do not know
a minnikin pin nor the size its head
then never mind said lucy i
forgot that you being a man could not
know minnikin pins as well as i do but
as to the sugarplums you saw some this
very day at dinner on the top the trifle
 i remember said harry well
 well my dear harry you can have
no idea what hard work it is to make
those little comfits miss watson was
telling me how she made qinofer swear 
and afterwards i asked her if she could
tell me or show me how those little
sugarplums are made she said that
she could not show me for that she
could not make them herself not being
able to bear the heat in which they
must be made she told me that the
pan in which they are boiled must beset
over a great fire and that the sugar
 which they are made must be stirred
continually in that heat a man with a
longhandled shovel keeps stirring stirring
stirring and sometimes strong men
faint in doing this
harry wondered that some way stirring
the sugar in these pans by machinery
jiad not been contrived and he was going
to question lucy farther upon the
subject but she was in a great hurry to
go on to sugar candy
 harry do you know how sugarcandy
is made i will tell you for i
have just learned when sugar is dissolved
it is poured into pots across
which sometimes thin rods and sometimes
threads at a little distance from
each other are stretched these moulds
and the liquid sugar in them must all
be covered up and kept in a great
heat for a certain time and nobody must
disturb them they are placed in a
room which is one great stove care is
taken that no wind should be admitted
for they say that the least disturbance
spoils the whole and prevents the sugar
from forming into those regularshaped
crystals which you have seen in sugarcandy
if the vessels are not disturbed
they form on the little rods i mentioned
to you or on the strings i dare say you
remember often finding strings in sugarcandy
 and now we understand the use 
them
 but what do you mean by crystals
said harry will you explain
i remember i once thought said
lucy that crystals meant only bits 
that white substance which looks like
glass but miss watson has explained
to me that there are crystals various
sorts and substances sugar for instance
and sugarcandy and i do not know
how many kinds salts in short all
substances that can be crystallised those
were her words as well as i can remember

very likely said harry but still
i do not know exactly what is meant by
what you call crystallising
turning into crystals said lucy
what more would you have here is
what they call a crystal sugarcandy
here are its regular sides crystals you
know have always regular sides and a
regular number them look at it and
touch it and taste it if you will
harry looked and touched and tasted 
but still not quite satisfied he said i
want to know what difference there is
in things before and after what you call
crystallisation
the difference in this tji'mg is very
plain said lucy before it was crystallised
it was syrup that is sugar and
water and now you see it has become
solid
 very well so far i understand said
harry but how or why do fluids crystallise

lucy did not know she confessed and
was well satisfied to let the matter rest
there for the present some time afterwards
she took notice an ornament on
the chimneypiece a small basket which
looked as if it were composed crystals
 glass or white spar
miss watson told her that it was not
made either glass or spar i made
it said she
you made it how could you make
it said lucy and what is it
made it looks something like white
sugar candy perhaps it is made in the
same way perhaps it is a sort sugarcandy

 the taste would soon decide that
said harry may i just try the experiment
with the tip my tongue
miss watson gave him leave to taste
it but she warned him that he might perhaps
not like the taste
 then i guess what it is said harry
after having applied the tip his tongue
to one the crystals he added by the
taste i am sure it is alum
it was alum lucy had seen large
pieces alum but none large enough
to be hollowed out into a basket such
a size and it would have been difficult
to have carved it into such regular shapes
she recurred to her first idea the resemblance
to sugarcandy and she continued
to think that it was made by the same
means miss watson told her that she
was so far right in her guess that it was
made in the same manner as sugarcandy
that is by crystallisation she showed
her the whole process which is very simple
in the first place she put some
water into an earthen pipkin with as much
alum as could be dissolved in that quantity
 water she boiled it till the alum
was dissolved by these means she told
lucy that she had obtained a saturated
solution alum that is that as much 
the alum had been dissolved as the water
could hold then miss watson took a
little wicker basket and suspended it
by its handle on a stick laid across the
mouth the pipkin so that the basket
handle and all were totally immersed in
the dissolved alum the basket did not
touch the bottom the pipkin as it was
very light it would not have sunk in the
water had not a little weight been put
into it the whole was then covered with
a coarse cotton cloth and put aside in a
cool place where it was not likely to be
disturbed she advised lucy to let it
alone during a day and night to give
time for the crystallisation to go on slowly
so as to form perfect crystals which can
be obtained only by the slow and regular
evaporation the water
there still seemed to be some difficulty
in lucy's mind after she had heard this
and looking at harry she said
i know what you are thinking 
harry and i am thinking the same
thing that i wish i knew exactly what
is meant by crxjstallisationr
 that was what i was thinking said
harry and i was wishing that i could
get at a which we have at home in
which i know that there is an explanation
 it
miss watson asked if the was
conversations on chemistry
the very how quickly you
guessed it and you have it how very
lucky said lucy as miss watson took
the from her bookcase she found
for harry the passage that he wanted it
begins with emily's saying
 i do not quite understand the meaning
 the word crifstall'isatlon t
 that is exactly what i felt said
harry
 and what i ought to have felt said
lucy but i really did not know that
i did not understand it till you asked me
to explain it harry now let us read
on
after readings a few lines she came to
conversations on chemistry vol i p 
eighth edition
the word caloric and asked if caloric
meant the same as heat
not exactly miss watson said in
this the difference is defined
she turned to another part the 
and showed lucy the passage vhieh drfines
the difference between heat and caloric
 the subject was new to lucy
and almost at every lineije wanted explanations
she stopped and whispered to
harry that she was not sure she knew
what was meant by the integral arts 
a body miss watson turned to the beginnings
 the volume and showed her a
perfect clear explanation integral
parts f
how well you know all this i said
lucy you know where to find everything
in this 
miss watson said that was not surprising
for that she had read it more than
once
conversations on chemistry vol i p 
eighth edition
t ibid p 
the first time you read it did you find
it difficult said lucy
no she said she had not found it difficult
but very easy and clear
ah because you did not read it till
you were grown up i suppose said lucy
miss watson said that she did not think
this was the reason as she had seen readers
not older than lucy understand it perfectly
well
it is very odd then said lucy
that i am obliged to stop you see two
or three times before i have read a single
page to ask the meaning the words
because you have begun in the
middle you have not read the from
the beginning said miss watson or
else you would have found all the terms
explained as you went on
but even so i am afraid i should
have forgotten them said lucy sighing
you must have a very good memory to
remember them all
miss watson said that besides having
read the from the beginning she had
often looked back to the definitions the
words and to the explanations whenever
she found herself not clear as to what was
meant
the conversation afterwards turned upon
different subjects in which lucy had no
concern therefore she followed harry
who took the conversations on chemistry
to a comfortable nook in the room where
he could be quiet and after his slow but
sure manner he made himself understand
thoroughly what he was reading lucy
read more quickly and when her mother
and miss watson were passing by them
she caught hold the skirt her mother's
gown and said
i understand this passage about crystallisation
now mamma i think it is very
clear
 i do not in the least doubt that it
is very clear my dear said her mother
but are you very clear 
 here mamma if you will just look at
the at this passage mamma which
begins crystallisation is simply 
 i do not want to read it my dear
said her mother or to hear you read it
bit tell me the sense it in your own
words
but mamma though i do understand
its said lucy you know it is impossible
that i could put it in such good words
 i am well aware that lucy said
her mother but explain it in any words
that will express what you mean then
you will be certain what you know ordo
not know
well mamma in the first place suppose
a body that is a substance 
what kind a body what kind 
a substance said her mother
 it must be a fluid said lucy yes
mamma before it can be crystallised it
must be a fluid therefore begin by supposing
a fluid no i believe that first 
all before it becomes fluid the body should
be a solid hey harry which shall i
tell mamma to suppose a fluid or a
solid
settle it for yourself lucy my dear
said her mother it cannot depend upon
what harry thinks but upon what really is
the fact
i recollect it all now mamma said
lucy after a short pause and i will begin
again with a solid body mamma suppose
a solid body sugar for instance or
alum mamma is dissolved either by
heat or by water and suppose that none
 its original parts that is the parts 
which it was originally composed are
lost by being dissolved but only separated
as it were by the water or by the
heat by which they are dissolved then
mamma if you could again take away the
heat or the water the original parts the
substance the alum for instance would
come together again and adhere when
what separated them is gone this is
crystallisation you may take away the
heat by cooling it and then the first parts
come together again in a solid form or
you may evaporate the water which separated
the parts by heat and then they
will come together again crystallised
whatever way you do it whether by heat
or cold if it is not disturbed but allowed
to go into its regular forms it is called
crystallisation
 you have laboured through your explanation
lucy tolerably well said her
mother
but there is one other thing more you
should say lucy said harry
 say it for me said lucy
 that different substances form into
crystals different shapes crystals 
substances different sorts as i have just
been learning continued harry have
always a certain regular number sides 
so that when you see the crystal after
counting the sides you can tell what
it is composed or you can tell beforehand
the number sides and the shape 
the crystals that will be formed from any
known salt or substance which you have
dissolved and left to crystallise
for instance alum cried lucy the
alum which was dissolved in the hot water
and which miss watson has left there to
crystallise we know will be in the same
shaped crystals as these in this first
basket i will count and tell you the
number sides
harry said he thought that miss watson
could if she pleased tell the number 
sides without counting them and so she
did
 how difficult it must be said lucy
to get by heart and to keep in the memory
the number sides which belong to
all the different kinds crystals 
you need not do that said miss
watson lists them are to be found
in many books to which you can refer
when you want them
but you knew alum without looking
at any said lucy
yes because i had been accustomed
to see its crystals said miss watson
as i told you before many the facts
in chemistry or mineralogy which it would
be difficult to remember separately or
merely from having read or heard an acvol
 k
count them are easily fixed in the
mind by trying experiments and by connecting
those facts with others
miss watson told lucy that she had become
particularly fond this study because
her father was a chemist and she
had often been in his laboratory while he
was at work unless i had seen the
actual things i should not have remembered
the descriptions them i am sure
said she and besides i was so much
interested in my father's experiments and
so curious to know whether they would
turn out as he had previously expected
that the whole was fixed in my memory
unless i had had somebody with whose
pursuits i could sympathise and in whose
discoveries i felt an interest i should
soon have forgotten even the little i had
learned
 but does not it make you happy
lucy asked
are you or are you not happier than
if you had not this pursuit said harry
miss watson smiled at the earnestness
with which they questioned her and answered
that she thought she was much
happier for having this taste and this occupation
she said it never prevented her
from doing other things which were more
necessary to this her brother added his
testimony
her beinsr something a chemist has
not spoiled her hand for being a good confectioner
said he on the contrary it
has improved it for she knows the reasons
for what she is doing all confectioners
and cooks must be chemists for so much
but they do not know the reasons why
they succeed one time and fail another
with them it is all knack and haphazard
or what we call iwactke at best now
continued mr watson here is an old
receipt which belonged to the greatgrandmother
 a noble family famous in
her day no doubt for her cakes and puddings
and confectionaries and cures
for all manner sprains and aches and
k 
bruises look at any these and you will
see what nonsense half them are how
many useless ingredients are put into the
receipt either on purpose to puzzle other
people or from ignorance and a sort superstitious
belief that there was a viistoy
in doing these things
harry and lucy amused themselves by
looking at some these old receipts
which however were hard to decipher
the ink being yellow and the spelling old
and incorrect
the next day was sunday harry and
lucy went with their father and mother
and mr watson and his family to church
the church was in the village near the
house as they were walking home mr
watson asked if they would like to see
some the houses in the village where
his workmen lived and the cottages in the
neighbourhood harry and lucy were
glad to take this walk and harry kept
close to mr watson wherever he went
in one cottage the master the house
a great fat man was sitting at his dinner
hot roasted duck and cauliflowers were on
the table before him while his wife a
pale starvedlooking soul was standing
behind his chair waiting upon him and
his children were huddled together in a
corner at a distance he never let any
 them eat with him he laid down his
knife and fork as the company came in
trying as much as he could to soften his
sulky look mr watson spoke kindly to his
wife and children but took no notice 
the man as he went out the house he
said loud enough for him to hear
 i should have no appetite for my roast
duck if i were forced to eat it by myself
without my good wife to take a share
lucy wondered that mr watson did not
insist upon the husband's letting the wife
and the poor children sit down with him
but mr watson replied that he had no
right to do this every man had liberty to
do as he pleased in his own house and in
his own affairs he could not interfere
between man and wife farther than he had
done by laughing at the surly husband
and shaming him before company he
said he had known this man buy for his
own eating the first green peas the season
when they were expensive rarities 
even when his children had not clothes to
cover them
the selfish creature said lucy
 the brute said harry
in the evening as they were walking in a
pretty lane near mr watson's house they
met a man who was endeavouring to come
up the lane but he could not by any
efforts he could make walk in a straight
line he was so much intoxicated that he
scarcely knew what he was doing when
he met mr watson he started stammered
tried to take ojqfhis hat and to stand out 
the way but he could not accomplish it
lucy was very much shocked mr watson
called at his clerk's house and ordered
that this man john giles should be struck
ois the list workmen and should not be
admitted to the founder for the next
week and that markham who was a sober
fellow should come m his place
harry thought this was very right till
some time afterwards when the drunken
man's wife came to mr watson to beg him
to pardon her husband and to readmit him
to the work she said that if he did not
she and her children must suffer for it
that her husband would beat her and only
drink the more if he was vexed the
tears rolled down her face as she finished
speaking harry wondered how mr watson
could refuse her for it was not her
fault that her husband was drunken
at night when harry was in his father's
room he talked to him about this
and asked whether he thought mr watson
was right or wrong right his father
said he did not think his refusal was hardhearted
but steady because it was his
duty to do what was just for a great number
 people as well as for this one man
if he were to employ a drunken workman
in preference to a sober man this would
encourage the drunken and be unjust to the
sober
 i would not encourage the drunken
and idle upon any account said harry
i thought mr watson was quite right at
first in ordering that he should not be admitted
to the works for a week but
might not mr watson have forgiven him
for the sake the woman 
then any other workman might drink
and might hope that his wife would beg
him off and obtain his pardon said
harry's father
father said harry after a long silence
and looking very serious i thought
that a great mechanic was only a person
who invented machines and kept them
going to earn money and to make things
cheaply but now i perceive that there is
a great deal more to be done and if ever i
grow up to be a man and have to manage
any great works i hope i shall be as good
to my workmen as mr watson is i will
be as just and steady too if lean but
father i see it is not so very easy to be
just as i should have thought it was
there is a great deal to be considered as
i find from all you say about forgiving or
not forgiving the drunken man for his
wife's sake i feel that i have much more
than i knew before to learn
 harry i wish you would go to bed
and to sleep said his mother for i am
sure you must be tired after all you have
seen and heard and thought this day
not in the least mother i never was
wider awake said harry however
i will go to bed to please you
our travellers were to set out before
breakfast and very early in the morning
the family promised that they would not
get up to see them off lest they should delay
them on their journey lucy did not
forget to inquire for the alum basket when
she wished miss watson good night and
goodbye
if it has succeeded you will see it in
k
the hall as you pass through in the morning
said miss watson but yesterday
one the servants shook the vessel containing
it and by that means prevented
the crystals from forming rightly i was
forced to begin the whole operation again
this time i locked the door to secure its
being undisturbed
as soon as she was dressed in the morning
lucy ran down to the hall to see whether
the basket was there and there it
was standing beside her bonnet the
wicker skeleton was no longer visible 
every part it handle and all being
covered with crystals alum apparently
perfectly formed she did not however
stay to examine exactly or to count their
sides which is always a tedious business 
but seeing a note directed to herself tied
to the handle she tore it open immediately
it told her that this basket was hers if she
liked it
if to be sure i do said she
miss watson suggested that if lucy
should ever attempt to make such a one
she might put into the solution alum a
little gamboge which would give to the
crystals a pretty yellow tint or she might
mix with it any other colour she preferred

within the basket nicely placed lucy
found several little paper cornucopias
filled with sugarplums and rose and
lemon and barberry drops with receipts
for making each written within the
papers in which they were contained
she was so much delighted with her
cornucopias and their sweet contents
and with the pretty crystallised alum
basket and with the goodnatured maker
and giver these good things that she
could think nothing else during the
first hour the morning's journey
now mamma will you taste the barberry
drops excellent are not they and
the lemon better still oh mamma cannot
you taste any more here are seven
other kinds
before breakfast it was impossible to
taste all the seven even to oblige lucy
and in honour miss watson but
harry was an indefatigable taster he
went on without resistance but without
giving what lucy deemed sufficient tribute
 praise to each at last when
much urged by the repetition is not
it excellent harry
he confessed that the tastes different
drops were now all so mixed in his
mouth that he could not tell one from
the other lucy shut up her cornucopias
and reserved her plenty for time need
but mamma said she when all
these are gone now that i have the
receipts i can make the same whenever i
please
it is not quite certain her mother
said that because you have the receipts
you can make others equally good whenever
you please
piqued a little by this observation and
by a smile harry's lucy began to form
various schemes trying experiments in
making rose and barberry drops and
sweetmeats like those which she had
tasted miss watson's and which everybody
had liked she enumerated such
numbers things which she intended to
make that harry at last laughed and
said
my dear you will then turn cook and
confectioner quite and forget every thing
else
her mother observed that it was useful
to know how these things should be done 
but that the propriety making or not
making them ourselves depends upon the
circumstances in which we are placed
and on our rank life those who have
servants that can make them would act
foolishly in wasting on such work their own
time which they may employ more advan
dangerously miss watson who perhaps
had no servants that could make these
things did wisely and kindly in making
them herself for her friends who like
them and it was particularly obliging
and amiable her to condescend to do
so because she has other pursuits and a
cultivated understanding lucy's mother
told her that if she persevered in her wish
to learn how these things were made she
should at the proper season the year
see and assist the housekeeper in making
sweetmeats this satisfied her and she
was at leisure to listen to harry who
for his part was anxious to become a
chemist and who had been struck with
the idea the happiness the person
who possessed a laboratory and could try
chemical experiments his father told
him that it was not necessary to have a
laboratory and a great apparatus for this
purpose as one the most ingenious
and successful chemists and philosophers
has observed many most useful
and excellent experiments can be tried
in an easy and simple manner
here his father was interrupted by an
exclamation from lucy at the sight a
tall finger post on one the arms 
which she observed to birmingham
harry and lucy anxiously watched to
see whether the driver turned down this
road as they had both an ardent desire to
go to birmingham to see some the manufactures
 which they had heard most
interesting accounts lucy's astonishment
had been excited by some scissors which
mr frankland had shoti her which she
had tried and which though not the
most beautiful polish cut sufficiently well
for all common purposes and yet oh wonderful
 mr frankland told her that this
pair was one a dozen which he had
bought for one shilling 
harry's curiosity had been raised by
hearing a knife with five hundred blades
which he had been told was to be seen at
birmingham
the knife came first to his recollection
an instant afterwards however he said
but there are things there a thousand
times better worth seeing than that

 oh father cried he turning to his
father i hope we shall go to birmingham
that we may see the grand works
at soho mr bolton's i read an account
 them while we were at mr
frankland's in one the notes to that
botanic garden when you were looking
for the bartering vase lucy it said
that there is a magnificent apparatus for
coining all worked by one steam engine
which cuts halfpence out sheets 
copper and at one stroke stamps both the
faces and edge the money
yes i remember your reading it tome
said lucy and it was said that
four boys ten or twelve years old no
bigger mamma than harry could by the
help this machinery worked by that
great giant enchanter the steam engine
make how many guineas do you think
in one hour thirty thousand mamma
was not it harry
 yes thirty thousand repeated
harry and besides this it is said
that the machine keeps an exact account

an unerring account was the very
word said lucy it keeps an unerring
account all the money it coins papa
i do hope you are going to birmingham
oh mamma i hope we shall see all that
was described in those lines do you recollect
 i hope we may see
 hard dies steel the cupreous circles cramp
and with quick fall the massy hammers stamp
her father told her that he believed
that these massy hammers are no longer
at work at soho but that a far more magnificent
apparatus for coining is now
established at the mint in london he
hoped he said to show them all these
wonders mechanism which they had
read in prose and poetry at some future
time for the present however he must
disappoint them he could not go to
birmingham he must pursue the road
to bristol even on their account he
added addressing himself to their mother
he did not choose now to go to
birmingham the general principles 
a few great inventions he hoped had
been clearly understood and fixed in their
minds by what they had already seen
he was glad to find that they had taken
pleasure in following the history the
progress and consequences those noble
discoveries he would therefore take care
not to confuse their minds by showing
them the details small ingenious
contrivances in the birmingham workshops
and manufactories or by dazzling
their eyes with the sight more
than arabian tale magnificence in the
show rooms the great toyshop 
europe
harry and lucy had not been so much
spoiled by their father's and mother's indulgence
that they could not bear disappointment
one sigh lucy was heard
to give for the great toyshop europe
harry suppressed his rising sigh for since
the steam engine coiner was not to be seen
he cared little for the rest they both
agreed that papa knew best
and this was not with them a mere
phrase said with a look hypocrisy but
with honest faces and hearts and firm
belief from experience the truth 
what they said
what is the name the town to which
we are to come next mamma said lucy
bridgenorth my dear
bridgenorth repeated lucy i am
sure there is something i have heard about
bridgenorth but i cannot remember what
it is
i know what it is i believe said
harry a famous leaning tower
 yes said lucy that is the very
thing i recollect reading about it in
my history england which said that
this tower bridgenorth was not always

leaning formerly a great while ago it
was upright and like any other tower but
it was shaken from the foundation when
it was bombarded during some siege
in the time the civil wars was not it
mamma i read it to you and it has
hung over in the same leaning state ever
since looking as if it would fall and yet
not falling i am glad we are to pass
through bridgenorth that we may see it
with our own eyes
 yes i shall like very much to see it
said harry
their father desired the postillion to
drive slowly when he came into the town
and harry and lucy's heads were first out
 one window and then out the other
eager for the first sight the hanging
tower
there it is cried harry
 red brick said lucy i see it
i had fancied that it was grey old stone
i expected to see a fine venerable ivy mantled
tower
 i cannot help it said harry but
my dear take your head out my way
for i cannot see what i want to see
there you may have it all to yourself
my dear harry said lucy i think it
is very ugly
 nobody ever said it was pretty did
they said harry but it is a curious
thin 
 not nearly so curious as i expected
said lucy not nearly so dangerous
looking as i fancied it must be i had
hoped that it would quite take away my
breath to look at it and that we could not
drive by without fearing that it would fall
upon our heads
harry had no such fears or hopes because
he recollected distinctly having read
an account it he knew that at pisa
there is a tower which overhangs feet
much more than this bridgenorth his
father asked him if he could tell why these
sloping towers continue to stand what
prevents them from falling harry do you
know
harry said he believed he knew because
he had read in scientific dialogues
an account them and an explanation 
the principle on which they stand
 know you did said his father and
you understood it at the time you read
it but let me see if you understand it
now
 father it is very difficult to express it
in words as lucy says but if i had my
little bricks i could easily show the thing
to you
yes said lucy very often we
built towers which leaned over and yet
stood and we used to try how much we
could venture to make them overhang
vrithout their falling i recollect that perfectly
though i do not know the reason
why they did not fall
if i had the little bricks i could show
and explain it said harry
but as you have them not and as you
cannot always carry a hod little bricks
about with you harry said his father
 try what you can do to explain yourself
by words those you may always have at
command
may i wish i had said harry
begin harry by thinking what you
wish to express till you are quite clear that
you know what you mean and depend
upon it you will then easily find words
said his father people often imagine
that their difficulty is in finding words
when the real difficulty is in having clear
ideas things
then you must if you please father
give me time said harry
as much time as you please said his
father and that i may not hurry you i
will go on reading this 
thank you father said lucy for
harry
harry looked back at the hanging tower
which was yet in view and after he had
thought till he was clear what he meant
to say without considering about the words
which came when he began to speak he
went on fluently after the first word father
had made his father look up and lay
aside his 
suppose that a plumbline was let
down from the centre gravity the
whole mass that leaning tower the
bob the plumbline would fall within
the base or foundations the plumbline
could not hang outside the base or else
the tower must tumble down as long as
the centre gravity is supported any part
may lean over or may hang out the perpendicular
line and yet provided the materials
stick together the tower will not fall
i think i understand that said lucy
 but i am not quite clear
if you do not understand what is
meant by the centre gravity said her
father you cannot be quite clear indeed
you cannot comprehend it at all
lucy said she remembered seeing harry
when he was a little boy standing upon
her father's knees and leaning his body so
much to one side that she was afraid he
must have fallen and papa you then
explained to me how far he might have
leaned over without any risk tumbling
down you also told me something about
the centre gravity but that i do not recollect
exactly
and course i cannot remember it at
all said harry but my father has often
shown us that the motions our tumbler
toy depended on the situation the
centre gravity by the bye there is
a way finding out where the centre
 gravity is in a body or figure any
shape
is there said lucy i do not remember
papa's showing us that how did
you learn it and if it is not very difficult
can you teach it to me who taught
it to you
a said harry my own good
scientific dialogues and if i had buta
bit card and a bit thread and a
pin and a pencil and if we were not in
the carriage i think i could show it to
you now
vol l
but as all these ifs stood in the way
the matter was put off for the present and
like many good things that are put oifwas
forgotten nor can we much wonder that
this was driven from the recollection even
 the philosophic harry by the bustle he
saw in the next town through which they
passed it happened that there was a
otcat fair in this town and it was filled
with such crowds people and so many
stalls and booths covered with canvas
lined the streets that it at first seemed impossible
that way for their carriage and
horses could be made through them without
trampling on some the people or
overturning some the tents the postillion
stopped and called civilly to the people
to make way red cloaks and greatcoats
yielded on each side and those in
front got from under the horses noses as
they advanced step by step lucy had
let down the glasses and was looking outwith
great interest not unmixed with apprehension
and listening to the 
universal hubbub wild
 stunning sounds and voices all confused
and as little by little the carriage made
its way through the dense multitude she
saw many hairbreadth escapes which made
her shrink and cry oh and ah 
many a time for those who were all unheedful
 their danger in the ardour 
bargaining the pleasure gossiping the
vehemence scolding the stupidity 
staring or the anxiety maternal affection
here was seen a mother crossing before
the very pole the carriage which nearly
ran into her ear in so much haste was
she to snatch out the way two children
standing unconscious the one with
an apple the other with a whistle in his
mouth and close to the wheel the
carriage at one time there was a young
with pink cheeks bargaining so
earnestly for a pink ribbon with an old
woman in her booth that the wheel must
as lucy thought have gone over her outstretched
foot but that just in time looking
l 
up she drew it in and still holding the
dear ribbon in her hand continued her
bargaining next there was a group 
old women leaning on their sticks with
their bonnets close to each other telling
and listening to something so eagerly that
they never heard the carriage coming till
the wheel went over the point one 
their sticks and begrimed the scarlet
cloak the speaker before she would
move her shoulder out the way
then came an awkward clown on horseback
with elbows out lugging at the hard
mouth his shagmaned colt who knew
no more than his rider the way he should
go but who with glassy eyes starting out
 his frightened head seemed to have a
mighty mind to run straight in at the
carriage window seeing which lucy
ducked directly how they passed she
knew not but when she looked up again
they were gone and harry's body was far out
 the window watching the operations 
man and horse at the farther the
street there was the colt floundering
and struggling with his rider at the corner
 the street where both vanished
before it was settled which would be victorious

but now lucy saw before them in a
new street a huge wooden house or caravan
on wheels on the outside which inlarge
letters were written the names the
wild beasts who lodged within and who
were all to be seen for the sum one
shilling across this part the street hung
flapping furious portraits coloured to the
life a lion rampant a hyena a tiger
and a mountain cat with enormous whiskers
lucy began to be a little afraid that the
poor horses would be very much frightened
but either they did not think the portraits
striking likenesses or they were not sufficiently
acquainted with the originals and
their private histories to be as much afraid
as lucy thought they ought to be they
went by quite quiet yet were as lucy
observed most foolishly frightened soon
afterwards by a poor little boy popping
out from under the long skirts a puppetshow
one reared the other shed but
their driver being a temperate whip patted
them into good humour and brought them
on safely to the inn turning under the
archway they knew where they were
lowered their prickedup ears and stood
perfectly still at the bardoor neighing
by turns to their acquaintance in the yard
who answered from their inmost stalls
lucy found on the chimney piece the
room where they were to dine an advertisement
informing the public that 
 there is now in this town a new fairy
infinitely surpassing the old corsican fairy
who appeared in england in the last century
and who was honoured with the approbation
 the nobility and gentry but the
new fairy is full an inch less than the old
fairy and can speak three languages
french english and italian dances to
admiration and waltzes inimitably if required

while lucy was reading this card
harry was perusing another which he
had found on the table and which informed
the public that this evening at six
o'clock a company tumblers would at
the theatre in this town exhibit for the
amusement the public several curious
feats in tumbling and rope dancing one
man promised to carry a ladder poised on
his chin and another to balance a table
on the rope and even a chair on which
he was himself to be seated with his bottle
before him and quite at his ease
harry was curious to see these sights 
he told lacy that here would be fine examples
 all they had been saying about
the centre gravity these wonderful
things must be done from understanding
how to manage that properly he wished
more and more the longer he thought 
this to see these tumblers lucy it must
be confessed was not so curious on this
subject and she would much rather had
she been to choose see the new corsican
fairy
their father and mother had determined
to sleep at the inn where they now were
and they told harry and lucy that they
would in the evening let them see either
the corsican fairy or the tumblers but to
both they could not take them as they were
in opposite parts the town the tumblers
at the theatre the corsican fairy to be
seen at the court house between the acts 
a concert lucy was fond music
harry did not care for it
well harry and lucy which do you
choose said their father take five
minutes to consider but then you must
decide that we may engage our places or
buy our tickets in time
lucy recollected the resolution she had
made when first she set out upon this
journey that she would imitate her mother's
kindness which she had seen so many
examples she therefore gave up generously
her own wish to hear the concert
and see the fairy she did this in so kind a
manner that she put her brother quite at
ease she was very happy with him
seeing the tumblers and when it was allover
she was quite content with them and
with herself
at the the next day's journey our
travellers arrived at clifton harry and
lucy were delighted with the place and
were glad to learn that they were to spend
some days here in order that their mother
might rest herself the next morning
after their arrival they walked with their
father on the downs from the top 
which they looked down a steep cliff
and saw the river avon below they
descended to the river down the cliff by a
new road which a number workmen were
then making the workmen were breaking
some hollow stones which had fallen
out the bank by the side the road
the hollows these stones were lined
with shining crystals lucy picked up
bits this stone and added them to the
collection which she had made at matlock
the stone that sparkled with crystals was
called she was told bristol stone and the
l 
crystals themselves were called bristol diamonds
lucy afterwards saw at the house
 a lady in clifton a cross these bristol
diamonds and another cross real diamonds
and on laying the two side by side
she could scarcely tell the difference
they had now descended to the bank 
the river where they stood some time to
admire the cliff called st vincent's rock
they then walked to view an extensive
quarry where some miners were blasting
the rocks with gunpowder they inquired
 the head workman to what use the stone
was applied he showed them some 
it which had been hewn into blocks and
was intended for paving the streets bath
and bristol the chipping he informed
them were not thrown away as useless
but were after being broken very small
employed to mend the roads the rock
was limestone harry saw some it burning
in a kiln and he was informed that it
was hard and when cut and polished
formed a handsome marble some it
was a reddish colour some grey and
some black but all might be converted
by burning into white lime
 the lime burnt at our kilns said
their conductor is very much sought
after not only in this neighbourhood but
also in foreign parts we send it in casks
to the west indies
do you know said their father to
what use lime is applied in the west indies

harry and lucy replied that they supposed
that lime served there as it did in
england to make mortar and to manure
land
it is also employed in making sugar
said their father
harry and lucy begged to be informed
in what manner
i am glad he replied that our visit
to the lime quarry has turned our attention
towards sugarmaking for on that subject
during our stay at clifton we shall
have the best opportunity informing
ourselves in the port bristol we shall
see ships from the west indies unloading
their cargoes sugar and on board 
those ships if we are fortunate we shall
find some stems the sugar cane in the
manufactories here we shall meet with the
apparatus required for making sugar which
apparatus is to be exported to the west indies
 here too are extensive refining houses
where they extract from brown sugar that
pure white substance that you see every
morning on the breakfast table let us
walk at once to bristol and try to satisfy
ouj curiosity but tell me children
whether you already possess any information
on the subject sugar making
harry and lucy replied that they had
read in edwards's west indies an account
 the sugar plantations in jamaica the
sugar canes and sugar mills
lucy was asked what she remembered 
this she recollected that the sugar cane is
a sort strawcoloured jointed reed about
the thickness the handle an umbrella
it grows in general to about the height 
a man and at its top are leaves like flags
the canes are cut in autumn and the
sugarmaking time is a season gladness
and festivity to man and beast especially
to the poor negroes who work in the plantations

here lucy was near going off far away
from the sugarmaking to talk the poor
negroes but her father called her back
again by the question what is to be
done to the sugar canes after they are cut
they are tied in small bundles said
lucy and carried to the mill where the
sugar juice is to be squeezed out them
lucy looked to harry for assistance when
she came to the mill
it consists said harry three large
iron rollers turned by wind or water or
horses or oxen or perhaps now the people
may have learned to work them with
steam the bundles cane are passed
between the rollers and squeezed again
and again till all the juice is pressed out
it is caught in a wooden gutter lined with
lead and runs into the house where it is
to be boiled it is said to be great
consequence to boil it as quickly as they
can but i do not know the reason
the reason is lest it should ferment
said his father do you know for what
purpose it is boiled lucy
that the water which is in the juice
may evaporate replied lucy and that
on cooling the liquor the sugar may crystallised
there not being water enough to
keep it dissolved just as we saw the
crystallising the alum for my basket
the boiling is also necessary said
her father to cause the other vegetable
matters contained in the juice to separate
in the form scum when they are removed
by the skimmer and here it is
that lime is so serviceable in rendering the
separation this scum complete it also
renders the liquid thinner and less viscid
so that the particles sugar can move
freely and crystallise more readily do
you remember harry by what name they
call that ropy portion the liquor that
will not crystallise
molasses answered harry when
the sugar has crystallised it is put into
casks with holes in the bottom the molasses
drains to the bottom the casks and
runs out at the holes
harry lucy and their father were still
engaged in talking about sugar when they
found themselves arrived at the wet docks
 bristol the wet docks are a basin 
water formed by throwing floodgates
across the ancient bed the avon the
river itself being turned into an artificial
channel the water within the basin was
prevented by the floodgates from falling
with the tide so that the ships were kept
constantly afloat even at low water
our party found the basin crowded with
ships they distinguished the ships arrived
from the west indies by the hogsheads
 sugar that the crews were hoisting
out and by the black sailors whom
they saw on board on the decks 
these vessels they observed some the
sailors and boys sucking some pieces 
the sugar cane on account their sweetness
harry noticed in a warehouse ashe
walked along the parts a rolling
mill for squeezing the canes and pans 
iron and copper for boiling the juice
men were employed in packing these for
exportation our party continued their
walk until they arrived at the the
basin and then turned homewards towards
clifton highly delighted with all that they
had seen on their ramble
on the following morning as they sat
at breakfast the subject sugarmaking
was resumed
the art as practised in the west
indies is still very imperfect said their
father much the sugar existing in
the juice is lost by injudicious management
two sweet substances are contained
in the juice sugar which crystallises
easily and molasses which is incapable
 doing so the planter should
endeavour to obtain from the juice all the
sugar that it contains when first expressed
with as little the molasses adhering to
the sugar as possible but sugar by being
overheated loses its power crystallising
and is converted into a substance
resembling the molasses much sugar is
therefore destroyed in boiling the juice
rapidly and the quantity thus destroyed
increases the proportion molasses
i have often burnt a piece sugar
in a candle said harry when burnt
it remains sweet but it becomes brown
soft and sticky
 the same change takes place said
his father when a strong solution sugar
is heated in a vessel over the fire
when only a little hotter than boiling
water it begins to undergo this change so
that a part it loses the property crystallising
on cooling
harry and lucy were sorry to learn that
so much the sugar raised by the hard
toil the poor negro was spoilt and expressed
their hopes that some remedy
might be devised for the evil
 much the sugar brought to this
country used formerly to be wasted in the
same manner said their father but inconsequence
 late improvements that is
no longer the case
 and what are those improvements
said harry which you now speak
that is what i propose to show you this
very morning said his father for i
mean that we should see the new process
 refining in one the sugar houses at
bristol so now let us talk about refining
that you may understand what you seethe
people doing have either you
heard or read any thing concerning sugarrefining

harry said that he had heard that bullock's
blood was made use at the sugar
houses but in what manner and for what
purpose it was applied he did not know
when brown sugar has been dissolved
in water said his father the blood is
employed to clarify the solution that is
to remove the impurities the blood is
mixed in a liquid state with the cold solution
 sugar it coagulates on the application
 a moderate heat and rises in the
form scum which is then removed from
the surface but in the suoar house that weare
going to see this clarifying process is
dispensed with it being found that much
sugar is wasted by being mixed with the
scum from which it cannot afterwards be
separated
do not you remember harry said
lucy a story concerning a process called
claying by what an accident it was first
found out that clay was good for sugar 
good for whitening sugar i mean
 i do not recollect said harry
 so much the better said lucy for
i shall have the pleasure telling it to
you it is a very curious thing about a hen
 tell it to us my dear lucy i advise
you said her mother without raising
our expectations lest it should disappoint
us afterwards
then you must know mamma that
one day a hen who had been walking in
some wet clayey place and had clay sticking
to the bottom her feet happened
to tread on the top a pot sugar
it was soon afterwards observed that
the sugar beneath the marks the hen's
footsteps was whiter than elsewhere and
from observing this and considering how
it had happened people thought using
clay to whiten sugar
 very ingenious said harry and
lucy remembered it well just at the right
time for us did not she mamma i had
quite forgotten it but i recollect it all
now the sugar is put into a vessel 
the shape a sugarloaf which is placed
on its narrow then clay moistened
with water is put over the top the sugar
and the water by slow degrees quits
the clay and oozes very slowly down
through the sugar the water mixes with
and dilutes the molasses and carries it
down to the bottom i forgot to tell you
that there is a hole at the bottom the
vessel this hole is stopped at first by a
plug but afterwards a man takes out the
plug and lets the stuff run off that had
been oozing to the bottom
so men learned from the hen to clay
sugar said lucy we are very much
obliged to the hen are not we mamma
when next i see very white sugar i
shall say to myself thank you for that
mrs hen
you will be doings mrs hen far
more honour than she deserves replied
her father for in the sugar house that
we are about to visit the operation claying
is laid aside the art refining as
now practised is a new discovery and
has arisen not from mere lucky accident
but from judiciously combining sound scientific
principles with accurate observation

 how is that said harry drawing
closer and listening with great eagerness

 this continued his father is one
 the happy applications science to the
common purposes life in improving the
manufacture a substance so agreeable
and almost necessary we learnt yesterday
how to extract brown sugar from raw cane
juice we are now to be taught how to obtain
from brown sugar the pure saccharine
matter as white and as hard and as crystalline
as that which you see daily on the
teatable we should know the nature
and properties the foreign ingredients
in brown sugar to be able to produce
pure sugar completely separated from them
besides various impurities brown sugar
as i have already told you consists two
sweet substances sugar forming small
crystals and molasses which remains in a
semi fluid state the latter being combined
with a dark colouring matter which renders
the sugar brown molasses differs
from sugar in remaining semi fluid whereas
sugar remains solid now if a small
quantity water be added to a mixture
 molasses and sugar the whole the
molasses will be rendered fluid and only
a small portion the sugar so that by
means water the constituent parts 
brown sugar may be separated
i see plainly said harry that by
mixing a little water with brown sugar
and by putting the mixture into a mould
such as they use in claying i should be
able to free the sugar from a large portion
 the molasses
very well said his father i see
that by stating to you a few facts and by
putting to you a few questions we shall
lead you to invent the new improvements
yourself
 there is nothing i like better than to
be taught in that way said harry
it is a good exercise for you and for
everybody said his father
pray help us when we cannot get on
said lucy
 to help you then to get on said her
father some previous explanations are
necessary it is only the small crystals
 brown sugar that we have learnt
to free from molasses to come at the
matter within the large crystals we must
dissolve them completely in water and
before they are crystallised the syrup
must be freed from the colouring matter
and from all impurities but how is the
colouring matter to be separated from the
syrup 
 i know that alum is used by the
dyers to separate colours from liquids
said lucy
that property depends on the earth
which alum contains said her father
and this earth being mixed with the
syrup attracts the brown colour to itself
charcoal made bones is sometimes
employed for the same purpose
when added to the deepestcoloured wines
it is able to deprive them their redness

when the process discharging the
colour is completed the earth alum or
the charcoal together with all the impurities
are to be separated by means the
filter and when the liquor has run through
it then requires to be evaporated
 i know papa said lucy from
what you before told us that the syrup
must not be heated in a vessel over a
naked fire yet in what manner to boil
away the water if not over a fire i cannot
imagine
i told you said her father that the
sugar would be injured if made hotter than
boiling water
 i think then i know how to contrive
it said lucy i would boil it as they
sometimes do things in the kitchen by
steam i have heard you say papa that
some great buildings are heated by steam
i do not know exactly how to set about
it but i think the sugar might be boiled
by steam
 that is well thought said harry
vol m
i would conduct steam through pipes
under the pan that holds the sugar
you are both you on the right road
to the principal improvement in sugar boiling
said their father but yet you have
not fully mastered the difficulty by the niethou
that you have suggested one might be
able to heat the sugar but certainly not
to boil it for you knows that a solution 
sugar if in an open vessel requires a
stronger heat to make it boil than water
does
but i should think said harry that
by confining steam it could be made much
hotter than boiling water and in that case
with compressed steam i might be able
to boil syrup
you might so said his father and
some persons do boil sugar in that way 
but highpressure steam as it is called
is hazardous to deal with and by this
method also we risk the overheating 
the sugar turn your thoughts therefore
another way and instead raising the
temperature the steam consider whether
there are not means making syrup
or any other fluid boil at a lower temperature
than when exposed to the common
atmosphere
harry considered for some time and at
length said i am not certain whether i
could succeed with syrup but i have seen
water made to boil when only moderately
warm by putting it under the receiver 
an air pump
how did that happen said his father

because there was a vacuum said
harry there was no pressure the atmosphere
if we could place the sugar
pan under the receiver an air pump that
perhaps might do but the quantity 
sugar to be boiled puzzles me father the
sugar vessels are very large i believe i
could only boil a very small quantity in
an air pump so that after all it would
not do i suppose
why will not it do said his father
m 
do not give up your ideas too hastily 
till you are sure that they will not answer
never fly off to any thing else do not fix
your imagination upon the particular receiver
 the air pump you have seen
to be sure you could not conjure a sugar
boiler into that small receiver
no to be sure said harry laughing
then becoming quite grave again he went
on thinking how shall i manage it
it is impossible to blow a glass large enough
for the receiver
why do you stick to the notion a
glass receiver harry said his father
do you think it essential to the having
a vacuum that it should be produced in
glass 
certainly not said harry it is not
necessary by any means i only thought
 the glass one because that was the only
receiver i had seen but i perceive that
any other substance that is airtight will do
as well as glass how foolish i am i
remember now the pump and the steam
engine where the vacuum is large enough 
or a vessel might be made as large as could
be required for the purpose
 now you have it harry the sugar
is boiled in a vacuum and that vacuum is
produced by means an air pump the
exact details i do not knows having never
seen it done myself but i hope we shall
see it today and so now let us set out
the sugar house which harry and lucy
went to see was a large building eight
stories high the first circumstance which
struck them on entering it was that in several
spacious rooms through which they
passed and in which the work seemed to be
going on there were not many workmen
lucy supposed that it was the
hour dinner as had happened in some
other manufactories which they had seen 
but she was told that this was not the case 
and that all the men who were ever employed
in this sugar house were now
there few only were necessary because
so much was done by machinery in truth
the men seemed little importance it
appeared as if they were employed only as
underservants to the machines and to do
trifling things which the mechanic and the
chemist had not thought it worth their
while to invent the means affection in
any other way
the large rooms and passages through
which they passed were all warm as lucy
observed and yet she could not anywhere
perceive any fire she asked how they
were warmed and was told that she would
soon see as they were going to the
place from whence the warmth came
their guide the gentleman who was so
kind as to show them these works took
them to a building separate from the rest
in which there was a steam engine the
fire under its boilers was the only fire used
in these works all the rooms were heated
by steam that passed through pipes in the
walls or under the floors
harry was here perfectly satisfied and
he looked delighted and proud when he
heard how much was performed by one
steam engine it sent over this vast
building equable warmth and supplied
all the water that was wanted in every
part the works it put in motion a mill
for crushing the sugar and other substances
used in refining it and it kept in
unremitting action the pistons a huge
air pump
after having seen or heard what was
done by this steam engine the great
moving power on which all the rest depended
they followed their guide into a
sort outhouse in which the earth 
alum was prepared by adding quicklime
to a solution it
they then entered that part the
building where the preparatory operations
 cleansing the sugar were performed
they saw in the first place a
few workmen with naked arms and in
light clothing suited to their hot work
stirring with huge shovels in a great pan
the raw brown sugar such as it is when
brought from the west indies they were
stirring it up with a small quantity 
water not sufficient to dissolve it it looked
like treacle this was afterwards poured
into earthen moulds which there were
great numbers in the shape sugar
loaves such as those which they had
read a description with a hole at the
point which was turned downwards and
in these moulds it was to be left twentyfour
hours to filter in the course that time
the molasses would pass through into jars
beneath the sugar loaf moulds and the
sugar left behind would be in solid lumps
 a light brown colour some the
sugar thus purified was put into lucy's
hand she felt that it was soft enough to
be readily crushed it was now to be
dissolved in water which was heated by
having steam passed through it the
earth alum which they called finings
was then added to this solution and thoroughly
stirred about by passing currents
 steam through it
this was performed in a great square
cistern which had a double bottom and
sides with a space left between sufficient
to introduce the steam the inner bottom
and sides were perforated with minute
holes and through these holes the steam
passed up into the liquid sugar they
heard a rapid succession explosions
occasioned by the sudden condensation 
the steam and when the solution became
hot they saw immense volumes steam
rising through it after this treatment
the syrup was allowed to run into the filter
the filter appeared on the outside like a
great square chest and the inside was
divided into parallel compartments by
coarse linen cloth which was stretched
over frames copper the liquor was
admitted into every alternate cell and was
thus filtered in passing into the contiguous
cells on either side which were empty the
syrup flowed out from the filter a transparent
fluid a pale straw colour
they were now conducted to the most
remarkable part the new apparatus the
evaporating pans in which the water was
driven off from the syrup they were
m 
made with double bottoms so as to admit
steam between the two for heating the
syrup and the pans were covered with
domes copper these domes communicated
with the air pump the great pistons
 which were kept at work by the
steam engine these served to pump out
the air so as to preserve as far as possible
a vacuum over the liquid the perfection
 the vacuum was shewn by a barometer
the master the sugar house
informed them that it required one hundred
degrees less heat to boil sugar in
vacuo than in the ordinary method and
that it was accomplished in less than onefifth
 the time formerly requisite
after having been evaporated the heat
 the sugar was brought to a certain
temperature at which it was found most
disposed to crystallise it was then poured
into earthen moulds the form a sugar
loaf such as were before described and
in these it was allowed to consolidate
it is then a tolerably white colour
and is finally purified by being washed
o 
with a solution the finest white sugar
which is suffered to filter through it the
top and the bottom the loaves as being
less pure are then pared off in a 
and the loaves are afterwards
dried in a stove
lucy said that before she came to
the sugar house she had a general idea
from what she had read and heard that
suoar went through several processes 
filtering and boiling and cooling and
crystallising before it could be white and
fit for the teatable but still she was surprised
by seeing the number the different
operations the size the vessels and
the power and time necessary she had
not been tired by what she had seen because
she knew beforehand the general
purpose and she had not been puzzled or
anxious
harry was delighted at seeing that principle
which he had before so clearly understood
carried into practice with success
in such great works
 i hope you will now acknowledge
said he to lucy that the air pump is 
some use in common life and i hope you
are convinced now that the air pump is almost
as useful as the water pump
lucy acknowledged this and said that
harry might well triumph for the air
pump
think said harry its being applied
to such different things as makingsugar
and making ice and not only employed
for boiling quickly but for freezing
quickly i do not think that otto garrick
or mr boyle himself could have foreseen
all the uses that were to be made 
their own inventions i wish they could
see all we have been shown this morning
 so do i said lucy wish they
could
all goes back to that one great principle
 the vacuum said harry
the gentleman who had shown them
this establishment and who had with the
greatest patience and politeness explained
every part the business was glad to perceive
that he had given pleasure to the young
people and that they had attended to and
understood what they had seen and heard
he begged that they would rest themselves
before they went away and showed them
into a room where they found refreshments
were prepared he gave a cup chocolate
to lucy and another to harry
you must said he taste some 
the sugar which has been refined by the
process you have just seen
it was in a black wedgwood ware basin
which showed its whiteness
 but father cried harry eagerly
 can you tell me who invented the method
 applying the air pump so beautifully to
this use 
i can tell you said his father it
was the invention edward howard
brother to the duke norfolk he was
an honour to his family and i hope
addressing himself to the master the
sugar house that he has been amply rewarded
for his ingenuity by the gentlemen
 your profession
 the fruits have been ample said the
master but he did not himself reap them
they are enjoyed by his family he only
just lived to perfect his invention
the master the sugar house then entered
into a statement the prodigious
quantity sugar saved by adopting the new
process eight pounds sugar he said
were saved in each hundred weight and
he helped harry to make a calculation 
what that amounted to every year upon
the total quantity sugar refined in great
britain
our party having finished their chocolate
thanked their host for his attention
and took their leave him
as you go down the hill from clifton
to bristol you may see in the city below
a number very high blacklooking
buildings in the shape huge
cones from which still darker coloured
smoke in thick black billows is continually
issuing these conicalshaped
buildings are glasshouses lucy remembered
her father's having showed her and
told her what glass is made she
recollected the taste the alkali the
ashes weeds and the touch and sight
 the sand she recollected also the
story the accident by which it is said
the making olass was first discovered 
and above all she remembered the pleasure
that harry and she had had in seeing
the thermometer man blowing tubes
and bulbs glass with his blowpipe
she wished very much to see some more
olassblowino her father took her and
her brother one day to a glassblower's her
first feeling on entering the glasshouse
was alarm on seeing a number men
with ladles full redhot liquid fire as
it appeared running past her and every
minute crossing each other with these
burning masses with which they seemed
in imminent danger scalding one
another to death but when she observed
their dexterity and their fearlessness
and saw how much they were at
ease as to the danger she by degrees was
reassured and able to be amused she
saw in the first place furnaces from
which were taken earthen pots filled with
redhot liquid glass she was puzzled
at first by the workmen calling the
contents these pots jiietal but that
was only their name for what was in
reality as harry said glass she was
much amused by seeing the operations
 the glassblower first the blowing
 a glass bottle and a wine glass
one circumstance in the finishing the
wine glass struck her particularly when
he cut its rim round with a pair shears
the glass being as yet soft yielded under
the pressure the shears so that the wineglass
was no longer quite circular nor was
the rim even the workman then heated
the wine glass again and dextrously twirling
it round it was brought back to the
circular shape and its rim was even
harry's father asked him why this happened

he said he thought that it was turned
into a circular shape by the pressure 
the air as it was whirled round while soft
as any other substance is made circular
by the pressure the tool when turning
round in a lathe and he thought that
the air with inside the glass prevented
its being driven in and squeezed together
by the motion
his father told him that he was partly
right in his supposition but there was one
reason one cause to which he had not adverted
and which he had not yet perceived
he would say no more because
perhaps by observing further he would discover
it for himself in attending to another
operation the blowing window glass
or crown glass as it is called first a
great pearshaped bubble glass about a
foot in diameter was blown at the 
an iron tube to which being soft and hot
it adhered then by rolling the pearshaped
bulb upon a smooth marble table
and blowing into it and by repeating these
operations alternately several times and by
whirling it rapidly round near a hot fire
the bulb was brought from its pear shape
into that a globe the globe was then
cut open opposite to the iron tube and
after being whirled again with great swiftness
the parts spread out still more till
by continuing this operation it became a
large circular plate flat glass
harry now perceived what he had
omitted in the case the drinking glass
the centrifugal force or that force which
arises from the tendency the pails 
bodies have to fly from their centre when
turned round rapidly
as he left the glass house he continued
his explanation
i suppose father that the parts 
the soft glass as they are whirled round
endeavoured to fly from the centre and by
so doing the globe became a larger globe
and the circular plates became larger
circles and all the parts flying off equally
from the centre the rim the drinking
glass became quite circular
it is said lucy not exactly but
something like a mop yes harry a
mop when the maid twirls it round
fast the threads the mop all fly out as
far as they can go from the centre and
if it was a wet mop out fly circles beyond
circles drops
 well said harry you have made
out your likeness to a mop better than i
thought you could
i remember continued lucy the
first day i ever heard centrifugal force
or had any idea what it meant it was
from you harry when i was making a
pancake papa
 a pancake my dear i do not remember
your ever making a pancake
perhaps it was a cheese said lucy
some people i believe call it a cheese
not a cheese or a pancake to eat papa 
but i will show you as soon as we are in
mammas room
lucy kept her word and whirling herself
round the moment she was in her
mother's room the skirts her petticoats
flew out and as she popped downwards
while they swelled out she ex
claimed
there is a pancake papa or a cheese
whichever you please and it is made
harry by centrifugal force is not it
i have been very much amused continued
lucy seeing the glassblowing
were not you harry
 very much indeed and it has left a
great deal to think and to inquire more
about said harry
what more said lucy
 a great deal repeated harry for
one thing annealing i do not understand
that
i recollect said lucy that when
the man had twirled the wine glass round
and finished it a boy came with a long pair
 tongs and seizing the glass ran away with
it as our man said to the annealing furnace
to be annealed and when i asked
what that was and what was to be done
more to it the man showed me a pan in
an oven and i saw our wine glass with
many others put into it to be heated again
and then to be left to cool slowly the
man told me they ought to take several
days to cool this was done to make the
glass less brittle he said and this is annealing
what more harry would you
know about it
a great deal more if i could said
harry in the first place i do not in
the least know icy annealing makes glassless
brittle
 why oh that is another affair
why nor i said lucy
and i heard papa and the masterman
in the glass house talking a curious
fact he said that when a glass vessel
 a particular shape is allowed to cool
immediately after being made it will often
sustain the shock a pistol bullet or any
other blunt body falling into it from a considerable
height but a small splinter 
flint dropped gently into it makes it fly to
pieces with great violence
indeed said lucy that is very
curious
so papa said and they went off to
talk about prince rupert drops oh
my dear there are a great many many
more curious things to be known about
glass and all the whys more than in my
life perhaps i shall ever know
 but you need not know all the ivhys
said lucy
 but as many as i can said harry
there was a man came in while we were
in the glass house did you see him
lucy
i did a gentleman you mean
i do not know whether he was a
gentleman or not said harry he was
a man
but i know he was a gentleman said
lucy
 by his coat or his waistcoat or his
hat said harry smiling
by neither by none those said
lucy by something better by the way
he spoke by his tone his language i
knew he was a gentleman
and i by what he said knew him to
be a man sense said harry he
came to inquire for a person who grinds
glasses for telescopes
then he must be a man sense to be
sure said lucy smiling in her turn
 my dear you have not heard all he
was trying experiments to improve the
making those glasses i did not understand
all he said but it made me very
curious to know more
papa seemed to like him said lucy
yes said harry papa and he
talked what a fine useful discovery glass
is and how long before people thought 
making all the uses that are now made 
it
it happened that the next day harry
went with his father to the house a physician
who had a good library and while
his father and the physician were busy he
asked leave to look for something he
wanted in some the books the physician
gave him leave and to work he
went searching for a chemical dictionary
or encyclopedia in which he might find
aymealmg and glass the volume containing
annealing was missing he
thought this very provoking but like
many things which we think very provoking
it was really fortunate and well
for him had he found it he would not
have understood the article he had not
the previous knowledge necessary and he
would have lost his labour if not his
patience he went in search glass and
there he found much that he could not
but some that he could comprehend as he
was both enthusiastic and indefatigable he
searched all through it and had the great
pleasure picking out several entertaining
things seizing on all that was suited to
the present state his knowledge he left
the rest for another time one passage
delighted him so much from describing
exactly what they had seen and what he
would have found it difficult to explain
that he scribbled a copy it for lucy
scribbled truth compels us to say for it
was scarcely legible when he came to
read it to lucy he could hardly make it
out even with her best assistance and she
could read his running hand better than he
could himself but as she observed this
hand had run almost quite away
 my dear i wrote it in a desperate
hurry and on a crumpled back a letter
with a pencil that wanted cutting and
my father was standing up with his hat
and his gloves in his hands i thought
he was going every instant while i was
writing the three last lines scribble
scribble scribble as fast as ever my pencil
could go
 thank you said lucy for doing
it for me but what is this about a cham 
 saw no chain at the glass house
 chain my dear lucy it is chair
said harry
chair oh now i understand it all
said lucy it is the description what
we saw the men making the drinking
glass the man sitting in the armchair
and blowing through his long iron tube 
then rolling it on the arm the chair 
and the other man sticking on the foot 
the glass and then taking the chair oh
vol n
i see it all again it is very well described
 
 i am glad you think so said harry
it is more than the man who wrote it
expected
 expected did he ever think me
said lucy opening her eyes very wide
 no no my dear said harry laughing
 you may let your eyebrows down
asrain the author never thought you
in particular i meant only his readers in
general
yes said lucy mis young readers
i suppose he said as people often do in
books is that what you mean harry 
i mean nothing replied harry but
that the w river says he could hardly expect
by any description his to make glass
blowing intelligible now that is all goon
to something else
with all my heart cried lucy here
are some more scribbled notes yours
harry what does this mean
brave man and quick hands
edinburgh encyclopedia
throuoli flames covered with wet
skins eyes glass
 what can this mean v
 do you remember said harry seeing
a great furnace at the glass house 
you saw only the outside they could not
uncover it to show the inside to any body
lest they should have let in the cold air
into that furnace they put the earthen pots
full glass which had been annealed
and they left them there to set as they
called it if one these pots happen to
break it is a terrible difficulty to get it out
and put another in its place the getting
out the broken one can be done well
enough by a man at arms length from the
fire with a long iron hook or a fork but
the man who is to put in the new pot can
have no use hook or fork he must put
the new pot into its place with his hands
passing them through the flames
then indeed said lucy you mioht
well call him brave man and quick he
must do it as quick as lightning
 but he could not do it as quick as
n
lightning or do it at all said harry
v without precautions he must be
dressed my dear in skins which are all as
wet as possible and they must cover him
all over all but his eyes two holes are left
for him to see through but these are
defended with thick glasses
i am sure i am very much obliged to
you harry said lucy for bringing me
home such entertaining things that man
brave and quick as you called him was
worth reading all glass through to get at
how many pages did you hunt through to
find him 
i came upon him by accident said
harry but i met with several other
things which interested me and i thought
i would bring them away in my head for
you and i have them somewhere there
if i could but recollect them but i cannot
when i try in a hurry
do not try then said lucy when
i try too hard to remember i never can
recollect what i want but then it comes
all back aofain when i am thinking 
something else so now harry look at
this nice little glass tumbler which papa
bought for mamma's dressing box in
place that which i broke it is prettier
than the old one look at its prettywhite
leafy border that is ground glass
papa said and this part below like crystals
is cut glass and papa told me how
this was done
two the very things i was trying
to recollect said harry then i need
not tell you about that
no said lucy what a beautiful
transparent clear clean thing glass is
continued she and how very useful
and in how many different ways drinking
glasses and lookingglasses you may
smile harry but men use lookingglasses
as well as women
 yes said harry and for better purpose
too than looking at themselves they
use lookingglasses you know for some
astronomical instruments
yes and for shaving too said lucy
 or they would cut their throats mighty
grand you were about the astronomical
instruments added she laughing but
let me go on my own way in honour 
glass to tell you all that i know besides
lookingglasses there are magnifying
and diminishing glasses both very useful
and entertaining and then spectacles 
oh harry what would grand mamma do
without them and how happy she is
with them reading and working as well
as i can at eightysix what a wonderful
invention spectacles are by which people
can see so many years longer than they
could in former times spectacles i think
harry are the most ingenious things people
ever made glass
do not forget telescopes my dear
said harry the most wonderful man's
inventions
how curious it is said lucy that
all these things spectacles and telescopes
would never have been thought but
for that first bit glass which the shipwrecked
sailors observed when they were
boiling their kettle on the sand with the
the fire made sea weed do you remember
harry my father's telling us that
story
i do said harry and now that
puts me in mind what i wanted to say
to you it was about that story it is
told in the i was reading today and
i was glad to meet with it there was a
little difference the sailors supported their
kettles on the sand with pieces fossil
alkali nitre with which their ship had been
loaded
and in our old story said lucy the
fire was made weeds and the alkali
came from their ashes which burned with
the sand and made glass there is very
little difference in the stories it all comes
to the same things
 i know it does said harry but
i was going to say something quite different

say it then my dear said lucy
 what time did you think that story
happened said harry
 t do not know said lucy i hardly
ever think about time in stories i think
it was in former times a great while ago
in the time pliny or before said
harry he tells the story
very likely said lucy i do not
care who tells it
but my dear said harry what i want
you to care for is the wonder that it should
be so long since glass and the way 
making it were first discovered by that
lucky accident and yet that it should be
hundreds years before it was brought
into common use you know the ancients
the greeks and romans had not glass as
we have
 i thought that they had glass bottles
in old roman times said lucy i remember
something about a bottle glass
in the roman history which a man brought
to the emperor tiberius i think and he
dashed it to pieces when he was provoked
and the emperor put him to death for it do
not you remember harry my reading it
loud to mamma and your being so angry
with that tyrant 
i remember that perfectly well said
harry but that was only one particular
bottle
but besides that particular bottle
said lucy i recollect hearing mrs frankland
tell mamma that there were plates 
glass found in the ruins herculaneum
did he said harry
yes said lucy and from that it
is supposed that glass windows were used
bv the ancients
 perhaps so said harry but my
dear lucy to go no farther than england
my says that the english had not
glass windows for many hundred years after
that the windows houses and churches
were covered with linen cloth till towards
the the tenth century
 you mean till about the year 
said lucy
 it was not till after the days queen
elizabeth said harry that it was quite
common for houses to have glass windows
 how very stupid people must have
been in those former days then said lucy
n 
so it seems said harry and yet i
suppose they were not naturally more stupid
than we are now recollect virgil
and homer my dear but then the ancients
had not many men science
and then came the dark ages as our
history calls them said lucy and in
the dark ages i suppose people fell asleep
and could not think glass or any thing
else even when they wakened there
were not many that could write or read
you know harry
they had very few books to read
said harry except the ancient greek
and roman books over again and they
had scarcely any books experiments i
believe
they had only manuscripts said
lucy written on parchment or on papyrus
i remember papa once showed mea
papyrus manuscript in a museum and
i saw parchment rolls too which the ancients
called books
and what work there must have been
making copies enough those manuscript
books said harry for people to read
and how few copies books a man could
make after all and be could do nothing
else
no wonder the people were stupefied
said lucy
but then happily was invented the
grand art printing said harry
yes i remember said lucy seeing
it in capital letters in the memorable
events and when i first read it i did
not know why so much was said about its
being such a grand invention now i
beoin to understand better by the bve
harry you have seen a printingpress
i never saw one and i should like to see
how they print i think that my father
was asking something about printingpresses
in bristol
yes said harry he told me that he
will take you to see one if he has time
i wish it may be tomorrow said
lucy we have very few days more to
stay at clifton i hope papa will have
time to show me the printingpress butin
the mean time harry will you play at
cup and ball with me look what a pretty
ivory cup and ball mamma has given me
i thought it several times while you
were talking glass but i would not interrupt
you now let us have a trial on
the spike which will catch it the oftenest
will you spin the ball for me
what is the use spinning it
a question easily asked very difficult
to answer
mamma i am sorry that you could not
go with us to see the printingpress to day
for it was very entertaining and look
said lucy i am not covered with printer s
ink as you said i should be
if you did not take care my dear i
said did not i
 yes mamma but i did take care you
see for i have not a single spot and yet i
saw every thing perfectly mamma you
have seen printing so often i suppose that
it would be tiresome to describe it to you
and i shall only tell you that it was done
almost exactly as is explained in our 
 trades in the chapter the printer
do you remember my reading it to you
mamma and the picture the letterpress
printer and at the it was said that
after reading this young people should endeavour
to go through a printing office
i asked you directly mamma to take me
to see one and you said that you could
not then but that you would some time or
other and now the sometimeorother
which i thought never would arrive has
come to day i saw the letters or the
types all in their square divisions in their
cases which lay sloping within reach 
the compositor who with his composing
stick in his hand picked out the letters
and placed them in the form then another
man inked their faces with a black
puffball and afterwards the wet paper
was pressed down on them i knew and understood
almost every thing he was going
to do mamma from recollections description
this was very pleasant there
was one thing though which i had mistaken
 when i took up one the types i
saw that the letter stands out from the face
 the metal it projects now i had always
fancied that the letters were hollowed out
cut into the types as the letters for instance
 your name mamma are cut into this
seal
how could you think so lucy said
harry you know that would be engraving
that is the way engravings are
made
yes now i recollect i know that is
the way engraving is done but i thought
in printing books it was the same and i
know now what led me into the mistake
it was our little ivory letters which we put
together so as to spell out words they are
all cut into the ivory and filled up with
ink
but does not your trades
lucy describe how the letters are made
said her mother
 no mamma not that i recollect
said lucy i dare say the author supposed
every body must know it but i did
not
 that is my fault i am afraid said her
mother
 not yours mamma but the fault the
man the author the trades if
it is any body's fault but indeed it
must be very difficult for great grownup
old authors to recollect the time when
they did not know every thing or anything
themselves and very tiresome to
them to explain every little particular from
the very beginning it must be difficult
too for wise authors to guess or conceive
the odd sort little foolish mistakes that
children make
harry waited till lucy had done speaking
and then told her that the manner in
which letters are made is described in the
 trades under the head typefounder

is it indeed said lucy then i read
very carelessly but i remember the calico
printer perfectly well and how his
types or his blocks and patterns are made
i know the pattern is first drawn on the
block wood a leaf and flower for instance
such as there is on this curtain
then with a very sharp knife or a little
chisel they cut away the wood all round
the pattern and between every part it so
as to leave it standing up and standing out
in relief said her mother
 then they rub colours on this pattern
said lucy
as the other printer rubs ink on his
types said harry
and the calico printer stamps it down
on the calico
just as the letterpress printer did the
paper on the types said harry
how comes it lucy said her mother
that you remember so accurately all this
calico printer's business
oh mamma for an excellent reason
which harry knows do not you harry
i do said harry smiling
mamma harry was a calico printer
once and printed a blue starred gown for
my doll said lucy
and a pretty blotted blurred gown it
was said harry
i liked it the best all her crowns
and so did she said lucy and we
were so happy doing it mamma except
when harry cut his finger hacking at the
block added lucy shrinking at the recollection

 what signified a cut said harry 
 but i broke the point my knife and
that was the reason the star was but a
botch at last
 the worst it was said lucy that
the stars all came out the first time it was
washed but that was not your fault
harry but the washerwoman's
more probably the fault the colours
you used said her mother or else
why did not the colours wash out your
own gowns the same person washed them
that is an unanswerable argument
said harry
therefore i will not attempt to answer
it said lucy
i am glad it said harry i want
to qfo on to sonietliinof else mother it is
very extraordinary that printing should
not have been invented for so many hundreds
 years
the same thing we said about glass
cried lucy
it is surprising that the ancients should
not have invented printing harry said
his mother because they had in common
use contrivances vshich might with a little
more thought and ingenuity have led them
to the invention
what do you mean mamma said
lucy
i think my mother means their seals
and their medals said harry their
seals were made like ours with letters
cut in
yes in intaglioy said his mother
but how did you know that harry 
i knew it mother from one the
large books prints which you used to
lend me to look at at night when i was at
home
montauban
eyes mamma there were in that 
figures and descriptions several very
large roman seals in which there were
names in capital letters i brought you
the one night mamma when it was
so large and heavy i could hardly hold it
i remember and asked you to tell me
something those seals and to read and
translate a bit the description to me for
it was french and you were so good as
to do it mamma
 i am very glad i was since you remember
it and that it is useful to you so
long afterwards my dear boy said his
mother
it said that those great seals were
used for marking some large earthen vessels
in which the romans kept their wine
they stamped them down on the clay vessels
while the clay was soft and then it
hardened and the letters remained
just like our seals on wax said lucy
i think mother continued harry
that all those great seals had the letters
a
to
cut in and not in relief
yes and all which he gives representations
i think he never found any with
the letters in relief but we are sure that
there were such in use among the ancients
for i recollect it is said that some the
names on those wine vessels were cut in to
the clay that is in intaglio which you
know is a proof that they were made by a
seal or type that was in relief in the
ruins pompeii loaves bread have been
found with letters stamped upon them and
virgil mentions the branding cattle
then said lucy they actually did
know how to print without knowing it
 wonder when they had such trouble in
copying writing that they never invented
a printing press how stupid when they
saw the letters on the jars standing before
their eyes continued lucy but i suppose
that from only seeing one name or a
few letters at a time it never came into
their heads
were there any roman seals ever
found do you know mother said harry
 the rare kind with the letters in relief
in which there was more than one word 
yes i believe said his mother that
the duke richmond has in his collection
a seal on which there are four words
the four names the roman to whom it
belonged and this seal belonged it is
thought not to any emperor or great man
but to some private individual therefore
it is believed that such seals were in common
use amoncr the romans
 and they never invented printing after
all said lucy the germans or the
dutch i believe invented it
and how did they come to it at last
do you know mother said harry
that is disputed and not yet settled
my dear said his mother some say
the hint was taken from these roman seals 
others from the seeing the names saints
cut on blocks wood under their images
other people think that the idea was suggested
by the seeing the manner in which
cards were stamped
indeed said lucy but those
were from wooden blocks not metal letters
or types
true and the first books were printed
from wooden blocks said her mother
 some these are still preserved in public
libraries as curiosities
i should like to see one said lucy
you would see how coarse they were
and how inferior to our improved printing
to be sure from these clumsy wooden
blocks said harry but i suppose they
soon got rid those
the chinese use wooden blocks still i
believe said his mother and it is said
they had the art printing long before it
was known in europe
more shame then for them said lucy
since they have not improved it all this
time what use wooden blocks still
what blockheads
gently gently said her mother
there may be some reasons for this
which you do not know they have not our
alphabet
but without going oft to defend or
attack the chinese let us go on with our
own affairs said harry what came
next mamma and how did the people get
to the printing press 
the first improvement made after
the printing whole words with wooden
blocks was the making moveable letters 
then the same letters could be used over
and over again and as many made as they
pleased these were first wood afterwards
they tried metal and when they had
moveable types metal they next found
the readiest way fixing these in frames
and inking and stamping a heavy weight
down upon the paper which was laid over
them there was the printing press
what was the name the man who
first made a printing press said lucy
that is disputed too said her mother
some say a man the name schemer
a servant a dr faustus and some say
faustus poor dr faustus should be allowed
the glory the invention as it
brought him into some difficulties
difficulties how mamma such a
great convenience as the art printing
said lucy
 when he carried a parcel his printed
bibles from germany to paris and offered
them for sale as manuscripts had formerly
been sold the french considering the
number copies he had made and finding
them all to a letter the same which was a
degree exactness beyond what any
the best copyist could have accomplished
suspected that he was a wicked magician
and by threatening to pursue him as such
and to burn him they extorted his secret
from him
how cruel cried lucy
how unjust exclaimed harry i
would never have told it to them
i would rather have told it than have
been burnt alive said lucy
it is very happy for us that we do not
live in those days ignorance said their
mother men are honoured for inventions
now not persecuted or burned
that is a blessing said harry but
mother how much you know about printing
and printers and printing presses and
all the history the invention how could
you remember it all and have it ready for
us the very moment we wanted 
very easily my dear said his mother
smiling shall i tell you how and why
when you went with your father this
morning to see the printing press as i
could not go with you lying on my sofa
here i read an account printing for i
was determined to be as wise as you by
the time you came back
and a great deal wiser mammas said
lucy
a great deal because you picked out
all the things i did not know and wanted
to know said harry thank you
mother
his mother asked harry if he had found
out whether there was in bristol any printing
press moved by a steam engine harry
answered that he did not know
you do not know but did not you
vol o
put your father in mind to inquire said
his mother
no i did not said harry
that is very odd said lucy you
who never forget any thing that sort
it was unlike you indeed harry
said his mother you were so intent upon
it yesterday i recollect your surprise and
admiration when your father told you 
the double printing press moved by a
steam engine which he had seen in london
where without hands the types are
pressed against the paper and the ink
spread just in the quantity required over
the letters and which can in one hour
print sheets on both sides my dear
harry is it possible you can have forgotten
this
 no mother i never said i had forgotten
it answered harry
then why did not you put your father
in mind to inquire whether there was any
such printing press in bristol when you
left me your head seemed quite full it
yes mother but 
but what pray tell me for i cannot
understand your silence my dear said his
mother
only i thought mother that lucy
would like better to see the plain common
printing press first because she said that
she should like so very much to see exactly
what is described in the trades
therefore i did not ask papa about the
steam double printing press because i
thought that would puzzle and hurry her
and that she would not see the thing just
as she wished and you knows i can see
what i want another time perhaps
how very kind harry said lucy
so that was your reason and you did
not forget but you never told me that
you gave it all up for me if mamma had
not by accident asked i should never have
known oh harry why did not you tell
me
what signifies telling or talking about
it said harry it was nothing but
jvist what you would do for me i do not
o 
forget the fairy you gave up for me lucy
the other day the new corsican fairy
a steamboat will set off from bristol
tomorrow morning oh father cried
harry can you take me to see it
i can harry and will with pleasure
said his father
 and lucy said harry in a tone
which showed that his joy great as it
was could not be complete without her
 and lucy said her father if the
day be fine but i cannot take her if it
should rain
next morning harry was up by daybreak
peeping out to see what kind a
day it was likely to be a cloudy morning
it was at five o'clock threatening
rain desperately between six and seven 
raining downright between eight and
nine and presently it not only rained
but it poured so that all hope was over for
lucy splash splash harry trudged
after his father through the dirty streets
scarcely hearing not at all heeding the
rattling carriages rumbling carts
rolling barrels jarring and jangling
 iron bars dragged upon diays without
wheels over rough pavements with all
the indescribable clatter and clangor and
clamor and stunning din this most
noisy noisy cities nor did he feel the
rain which poured over him but when
the heavy shower ceased and when dripping
umbrellas closed and the sun through
the clouds gave promise a better day
harry entreated his father to let him run
back for lucy if his father would but
wait for him five minutes in a shop 
this bookseller's shop papa i will be
back in less than five minutes and i will
bring her very quickly and as safe as possible
through the streets may i papa
 no his father said he could not wait
for the vessel would set off punctually at
the appointed hour and if they delayed
five minutes they should be too late
then harry thought they could never
walk fast enough on he kept before
his father the rest the way till they
came to a great crowd people not
only the lower class idlers but persons
 all ranks assembled to see the departure
 the steamboat harry darted
quickly after his father while heads and
elbows closed over him he could not
see farther than the backs and legs 
the people before him for some time but
he pierced through the darkness the
dense crowd tall bodies and emerged
at last from under the elbow a 
seacaptain into full daylight he
found himself standing on the stonepier
 a large dock at the very edge the
water in the front row a multitude 
spectators who covered the quay through
the buzz voices the first thing he distinctly
heard was 
 she will not get out this quarter 
an hour she will not get out till the
tide lets them open the dockgates
she as harry knew meant the steam
vessel he rejoiced to find that they
were in such good time now he had
leisure to breathe and to look about
him close beneath the stone pier on
which he was standing were several vessels
among which he first distinguished
the steamboat by the faint grey smoke
which he saw rising from a black iron
chimney that stood in the middle its
deck the boat had sails but they were
not spread they were close furled as unnecessary
for the voyage it appeared as
if there were fewer sailors on board than
in the other vessels but all was in motion
on her deck and on the adjoining pier
two men were rolling a chariot over
planks laid from the pier to the edge 
the vessel others were dragging to its
right place on the deck another carriage 
others held horses on the quay who were
to go into the boat and who with ears
pointed forward and expanded nostrils
drew back and yet in a few instants patiently
submitted to their fate while the
gentlemen to whom they belonged or their
servants anxiously called out giving directions
about their valuable and their favourite
horses groups people with bundles
baskets boxes bags and umbrellas in their
hands stood by waiting impatiently till
the horses and carriages were disposed 
and then they stretched their necks and
their hands and gave in their goods with
eager directions to a sailor who balanced
on a board scarcely appearing even to
listen to them handed the packages as
fast as he received them to another sailor
behind him repeating continually to the
anxious proprietors 
 they will all be safe all will betaken
good care sir or madam as
the case might be
harry was astonished by the vast weight
number and bulk things animate and
inanimate which were stowed on board
loads boxes and parcels and baskets
trunks chests or packingcases besides the
carriages and horses and after all passengers
crowding in innumerable all
these to be carried by steam full against
the wind which was now rising there
was a man in a blue jacket with a large

straw hat on standing near harry he
was a sailor belonging to one the 
which lay in the dock and
which was not likely to sail this day wind
not permitting he eyed with no friendly
eye these preparations going forward with
such alacrity his brow darkened and
with a sulky look he began to whistle
one belonoirip to the steamboat who
heard him smiled and said 
 no need to whistle for a fair wind
we can oo without a wind or against it
provoked beyond endurance by this
boast the old sailor swore yes i am
sorry to say he did swear that for his
part he would not go on board a steamboat
for both the indies and a puncheon
 rum into the bargain not he he
would rather in the roughest gale be out
at sea in an honest sailing packet with
a gale in his teeth than go on board
such a thing as this the finest day the
year
this speech making little impression
upon the bysanders he added that ito

was well for her it was fair weather for
she would never stand a gale
then shutting one eye and looking upwards
with the other he observed that if
he was not more mistaken than ever he
was in his days the wind that was rising
would soon blow a storm which would
bring as he prophesied evil to all who
were going on board her
among the intended passengers who
were standing by was a poor decent looking
woman in a black bonnet and cloak
with many bundles in one hand and
holding by the other a sickly looking
little girl the woman listened with
great anxiety and the child looked exceedingly
frightened whilst this sailor
was speaking and grew paler and paler
when he went on telling the dangerous
accidents he had heard happening
on board steamboats boilers that
had burst and scalded some to death or
blown all on board and the vessel to
pieces the child on hearing this let go
a cocoanut which she had been hugging
close to her bosom and clung with both
her hands to her mother the cocoanut
would have rolled into the water if harry
had not stopped it but he picked it up
and returned it to the little girl offering
to put it into a bag which her mother tried
to open but her hands trembled so much
that she could not untie the strings harry
disentangled them for her and begged her
not to be alarmed the sailor persisted
in saying that she had good reason to be
afraid adding that as her child was so
much frightened and as her own heart
failed her she wouldst much better not
to go in the steamboat but to wait till
the next day and take her place and a
comfortable birth in the sailingpacket
which would be off early in the morning
the poor woman said that she could
not wait for the morrow and though she
still trembled she tried to speak steadily
saying that her heart did not fail her that
she was determined to go now and in the
steampacket for it was the cheapest and
the quickest way she could go to her
mother who was lying dangerously ill in
dublin and if she missed this day she
might never see her mother alive
the tears rolled down her cheeks as
she spoke the sailor still urged her not to
go and risk drowning her child harry
called to his father who was talking to
some gentlemen and had not heard what
passed harry begged his father would
come and tell this poor woman whether he
thought she might safely go in the steamboat
or not not only his father but the
gentlemen who had been talking to him
came immediately and assured the poor
woman that in their opinion she might
go with perfect safety one these gentlemen
was an american he told her
that he had in his own country been
hundreds times and many thousand
miles in steamboats and had never seen
any accident happen
harry's father added further to encourage
the poor woman that the two gentlemen
who were speaking to her had themselves
taken their passage on board this
very packet she thanked them and
wiping away her tears said she had been
determined to go at all hazards but now
she had no fears the sailor sulkily turned
away and walked off
a call now came for all to go on board
as the tide served and they were just
opening the dock gates all hastened onboard
except the poor woman but the
moment she began to move her child
screamed and clinging round her legs
cried i know it will burst i know it
will burst it will scald me to death it
will kill us oh mother mother do not
go oh mother mother the poor
avoman did all she could to soothe her
but in vain the child was so terrified that
it listened to nothing and when its hands
were loosened from round its mother's
knees and when she tried to lift it up the
little girl caught fast hold harry's arm
struggling with all her might a messenger
came saying that the captain would
not wait the woman again trembled excessively
and grew pale
perhaps father said harry if i
offer to go on board the little girl will
come with me when she sees that i am
not afraid
try said his father
harry spoke very gently to the child
who stopped crying and listened to him
and let him lead her on when she saw
that he was not afraid he thus got her
into the boat to the woman's satisfaction
the child still held fast hold his hand
saying do not leave me do not go
i must go said harry and i am
very sorry for it for i should like to stay
very much
his father who had followed him and
who had learnt that they could go a few
miles down the river and be put on shore
at a landing place told harry that since
he wished so much to go he might and
that he would accompany him harry
thanked him and was delighted the
crates were now opened and they were
slowly towed out the dock and between
the narrow piers while the swing bridges
turned back were covered with spectators
a band music stationed on the deck
played the sun shone bright and all
looked happy yet harry was a little disappointed
by their being towed he told
his lather that he had thought it was all to
be done by steam
wait a few minutes and you will see
that it will be so said the captain smiling
as soon as the vessel had reached the
river and passed the place where a ferryboat
was crossing the smoke from the
chimney issued thicker and thicker and
spread like a gigantic pennon over their
heads the towing had ceased the paddle
wheels were set in motion and
now my boy said the captain we are
going by steam and easily and swiftly
they went gliding rapidly on between high
hills and rocks on both sides them
the lofty crescents terraces and hanging
gardens clifton seemed to fly back as
they passed in a few seconds the ferryboat
lessened and vanished they passed
the majestic rock st vincent crowned
with specks human figures birds hovered
round their nests in the rock as
they passed on the captain pointed to
leigh woods and nightingale valley 
but scarcely had he named them when
new scenes were before them harry
felt afraid that they were going too
swiftly and that his pleasure would too
soon be at an he had never
stirred from the spot where he stood
when he had first entered the boat the
child having fast hold his fore finger
had by this time lulled by the music and
the easy motion fallen fast asleep with her
head in her mother's lap harry longed
to go to his father who was walking up
and down the deck with the captain
and the american gentleman talking ashe
heard every now and then as they
passed him something entertaining about
steam boats but he thought he could
not draw his finger away from the child
without wakening it and the mother looked
up piteously in his face once when he
offered to move saying 
this is the first sleep she has had these
three nights she has been very ill
try if you can put in your finger instead
 mine whispered harry and gently
unclosing the hand the sleeping
child he drew out his and the mother
slipped in hers the hand closed again
the child did not waken the mother smiled
and harry set free ran off joyfully to his
father he found the gentlemen were
eagerly claiming for their several nations
the honour bringing into general use
the invention the steam vessel
the captain who was a scotchman
claimed it for the men glasgow the
american maintained that the number 
steam boats in america and the years they
had been there in use proved that they had
first felt the value the invention this
could not be denied the scotchman admitted
but it must never be forgotten that
the first was sent out to america from glasgow
and that a scotchman went out with
it and that the engine was one bolton
and watt's without this it could never
have been set agoing
an irish gentleman here begged leave
to remark that the experiment the last
winter's trial them between dublin and
holyhead had been undeniably the most
fair and satisfactory ever made and had
established steam vessels in the three kingdoms
an englishman who was present
and who was silent till the last said only
that he was content since none could doubt
the original invention was english and the
whole establishment this glorious and
useful discovery in europe was exclusively
british harry's father to whom he appealed
had the candour to mention a
french gentleman who many years ago
tried an experiment with a steam boat on
the rhone at lyons by listening to all
that was said harry learned in short the
history this invention it was first
thought nearly a hundred years ago by
a mr hull for towing vessels in and out
the marquis de jouflfroy
i
 harbours but he only made the proposal
not the attempt and he had no idea 
using it in any other manner the first
person who actually placed a steam engine
in a boat and tried the experiment was a
mr patrick miller at glasgow the remains
 the boat are yet in being and the
scotch gentleman said he had lately seen
them several persons in scotland and
england about this time proposed to employ
steam vessels but they did not come
into general use till a model one was
carried from glasgow to america its
successful establishment in that country
on the prodigiously extensive lakes and
rivers the new world proved its practicability
and brought it at last into use in
scotland england and ireland
harry was surprised to hear that a hundred
years should have passed between the
first invention and its beings brought into
general use and asked why it had not succeeded
at first as well as at last several
reasons were given the scotch captain
said that vessels were not originally made
strong enough that the improvements
lately adopted in ship building had rendered
it possible to employ a greater power
 steam than they could formerly without
danger destroying the vessel the
englishman observed that people had been
for many years too much occupied in applying
the steam engine to other purposes
in england to think adapting it to
boats and indeed it was scarcely necessary
till now that commerce has increased
so rapidly and the goods and people to
be carried on canals rivers and sea are
so numerous
harry was much obliged to the gentlemen
who took the trouble to give these explanations
in reply to the question he had
asked and felt a little proud being
treated so much like a reasonable person
he took care not to interrupt them with
more questions though there vivere many
he wished to ask but at the first pause
he whispered to his father and asked whether
it was possible for him to see the
machinery this steam vessel he could
not see the paddlewheels which he had
heard the captain speaking he wished
very much to understand how these were
moved by the steam engine and how they
worked the ship forward so rapidly and
powerfully against the wind which now
blew strong his father told him that he
could not show him the machinery while
they were going on but he would ask the
captain to show it to him whenever they
stopped which they were soon to do at a
place called lamplighter's hall this
was now in sight and in a few minutes
they reached it and harry heard an increased
sound the rushing the steam
which was let out before the vessel could
be stopped the noise the working 
the machinery ceased the vessel stood still
and a rope was made fast to the shore some
 the passengers were to be set down here
and others taken up and during the delay
this occasioned the captain had time to
attend to harry's request he was a goodnatured
man and took pleasure in gratifying
as he said the boy's laudable curiosity
he showed him how the engine is connected
with the paddlewheels they
looked something like the waterwheels 
a mill and as they turned and as each
vane struck upon the water he perceived
that it urged on the boat like the oars 
the boatmen whom he had seen rowing
he asked at what rate they had been moving
today and was told about eight
miles and a half an hour they had
been going against the wind but with the
stream he asked what is the fastest rate
at which steam vessels can go and was
told by the american gentleman eleven
miles an hour but in england as the english
gentleman said ten miles an hour
the irish gentleman asserted that during
the last two years the passage from dublin
to holyhead had always been performed
at an average rate about seven miles an
hour and that the mail which was carried
by the steam packets had scarcely
missed a day even in the most stormy
weather he asked harry if he had
suffered from sea sickness harry had

never been in a ship and had never been
sick in a boat the river had been so
calm to day that they had scarcely felt the
motion the vessel
well some time or other you will feel
what it is and then you will be thankful to
the steam packet which at least lessens
the time the suffering and affords the
certainty that it will be over in a given
number hours
harry listened to his father and these
gentlemen who spoke the great advantages
to commerce and to society from this
quick communication between distant countries
enlarged views opened upon his
young intelligent mind and he exclaimed
 what a grand invention i am glad it
was made by 
efigiishmeji he was going to saps britons
he did say which word satisfying the
scotch the irish and the englishman
they all smiled upon him
 pray young gentleman what do you
think us americans said the american
we have done more than any you i
guess recollect that we have at the
least three hundred steam boats in constant
use
 three hundred said harry with a
tone admiration but recollect
added he that it is by our help that you
have all these you know we sent the
first model to america
we scotch interposed the scotchman
in a low voice
that model helped i acknowledge
said the american
then added harry if we helped
you in the beginning you that have a whole
new world to yourselves will help us in
the i hope
all fair and i hope we shall so shake
hands said the american shaking harry
heartily by the hand for one i promise
you if ever you come to america
my little man i will make you heartily
welcome and if you please you shall go
in a steam boat on the mississipi and
missouri and on the ohio some thousands
 miles that would please you
i guess 
i am sure it would said harry
gratitude to these kind gentlemen and
the enthusiasm which had been excited in
harry's mind quite overcoming his habitual
taciturnity he went on talking this
glorious invention after a hundred
years working at it it is at last said he
 brought to perfection
perfection repeated his father
harry that is saying too much
too much for any human invention
sir said the scotchman and as we
know even at present there is much more
to be done for these steam vessels
and much is doing continued harry's
father men science and genius are
going on continually making improvements

just before i left london said the
englishman i heard a number capital
improvements preparing for our steam
vol p
boats which will make them more durable
and safer than they are at present
the american nodded with an air 
great satisfaction and some mystery
can the steam boats be made safer
than they are said harry
since accidents have happened said the
captain they may happen again but
many that have will hardly occur again
we shall guard against them in future
may i ask sir said harry very respectfully
 might i ask what was the
cause those accidents and how you
guard against them now
you may ask and welcome my eager
little man said the captain with a goodhumoured
smile but i cannot undertake
to answer you all this at once or at
any time certainly not now my dear
little fellow added he looking at his
watch for i must be off so goodbye
to you
the poor woman with her child stood
close to the place where harry must pass
when he was to land with a grateful
smile she said to him as he came near
master my child here is a deal the
better for that sweet sleep she had thanks
to you for it
pleased yet ashamed to have this said
to him in the hearing several people
who were standing by harry coloured upto
the ears and answered in a blunt manner
and in a rude tone 
do not thank me for nothings i did
nothing at all
the child running before him so as
to stop him as he would have pushed on
held up her cocoa nut and said
 i will give you this take it do
oh no i cannot take it from you
said harry but thank you thank you
the child still held up the cocoa nut
and harry seeing that she looked vexed
by his refusal took it from her hands and
turning back rolled it along the deck
p 
 run after it run said he and
thank you as much as if i had it goodbye

the child ran after the rolling ball and
harry sprung from the boat on shore
a chaise was procured at lamplighter's
hall an inn near the landing place and
his father and he were now to go in it
back to clifton harry's head was so
full the steam boat that he could
think and talk nothing else all the
way
 father among other advantages which
steam boats have over carriages with horses
and men there is this great one that the
steam engines neither eat nor drink nor
sleep and steam never grows tired but
horses and men must rest sometimes
i wish you would rest now harry a
little said his father and do not kick
my shins in your transports
i beg your pardon said harry
but father i do not see why a steamboat
should not go on for weeks and
months just as well as for hours and days
surely it can go as long as there is fire and
as lonof as there is water cannot it
surely as long as we can supply the
engine with fuel and the boiler with water
and as long as the machinery does not
break
then if they make the whole strong
enough said harry why should not
people cross the great ocean from england
to america as well as the little sea from
england to ireland why not father 
what is the difficulty you look as if
there were some impossibility
 no harry not an impossibility but
there is a difficulty and a great difficulty
said his father and if you consider you
will perceive what it is
harry considered but he did not find
it out his mind was too much exalted 
he was too full the noble steam boat to
be able to think with his usual degree 
attention
his father helped him a little to settle
his thoughts and brought him to consider
the time which would be requisite for this
voyage to america
it takes about three weeks harry
what would be absolutely necessary to
the steam boat to enable it to stay out
at sea all that time and to perform its
voyage
fire water men that is all said
harry except provisions the usual
things which are carried for long voyages
we may take for granted are carried
true but there is something which
you have not yet named that is essential
said his father by essential i mean that
without which the thing cannot be
fire water men men fire water
repeated harry i can think nothing
else which you could say is essential i
heed not say men even one man could
regulate the engine i believe
what do you mean by regulate the
engine said his father
 i mean said harry he can supply
the boiler with water and the fire with
fuel fuel aye now i see what novi
mean father fuel there must be to keep
up the fire to boil the water to make the
steam so coals must be carried or wood
and great quantities but their weight we
need not mind on the water and with that
power steam you know father
 i know son but what will you do
about the bulk coals or wood or whatever
fuel be put on board your steam boat
must take up space calculate how
much
after o'oino through a calculation which
need not be here repeated harry groaned 
and acknowledged that unless the steamboat
were many times larger than any
that had ever been made it could not
afford space for the necessary quantity 
fuel
but why argued he should not a
vessel be made several times larger than
any we have seen 
a moment's reflection showed iii
that such increased bulk would require increased
strength to keep it together and
that again must bring increase weight
and difficulty managing the whole
still said harry though there is
this great difficulty about carrying the
fuel we should not give it up should we
father perhaps some those ingenious
men who first thought steam boats a
hundred years ago or even fifty years
ago imagined they should never succeed
and they were laughed at were not
they because they did not succeed at first
yet now oh if they were alive now 
and could see what their invention has
come to the admiration the whole
world therefore father i think people
should not mind being laughed at when
they know they are right and they should
not be stopped in their great discoveries by
little difficulties or great difficulties or any
sort difficulties but still go on trying
experiments and inventing till they come
to some impossibility and then they must
be quiet but not till then they need not
give up and they should not cried harry
right right my dear boy said his
father i am glad to see this spirit
rising in you 
harry was silent for a mile or two
and then exclaimed 
 father i am so glad you have no
 this morning to read in the carriage
because you have time to talk to me tell
me what accidents happened formerly in
the steam boats and how do people
prevent them now as the captain said they
can f
the principal accidents and the most
dangerous replied his father have been
the bursting the boilers if i recollect
rightly one which burst in an american
vessel killed several people and blew the
boat to pieces another which burst in
england scalded to death the persons in
the cabin who were near it
the sailor spoke truth then said
harry to that poor woman this morning
though i did not believe him he advised
her not to go on board the steam boat because
he said that many such accidents
have happened and happen very often
p 
 there he was wrong said harry's
father because he exaggerated but
few have occurred we have accounts 
them all and can therefore judge and
speak positively
i am glad it very very glad
cried harry now father about the
ways preventing them in future will
you tell me that
first lei me harry do you know the
difference between what is called malleable
or ivroueht iion and cast iron you saw
both and the difference was explained to
you when we were at the founder
i recollect it father replied harry
 cast iron is i believe that which has
been melted and made to run into the form
in which it is to be used malleable or
brought iron is that which is hammered
when it is heated into the shape whatever
it may be that is required
since you know this much harry i
can ofo on said his father it has been
found by many trials that hammered or
wrought iron is stronger than cast iron 
and better able to resist the expansive force
 steam those boilers steam engines
which burst were in almost all instances
made cast iron others wrought
iron have also in some cases given
way but even when they have they have
not exploded violently so as to do mischief
they have rent asunder and
opened so as to let out the steam inconsequence
 this experience boilers are
now generally made wrought iron this
is one cause increased safety
and a great one said harry
another step in improvement and
safety has been made continued his father
 by experience having proved to us
that though copper is rapidly destroyed by
alternate heating and cooling it is more
durable than iron for boilers steam vessels
at sea
copper stronger than iron father
cried harry i should never have thought
it was
 you do not repeat with your usual exactness
what i told you said his father
i did not assert that copper is in all circumstances
and for all purposes stronger
and more durable than iron i said that
it has been found to be more durable
when used as the boiler a steam engine
at sea
at sea repeated harry father
i know that you have some particular reason
for being so careful in the words 
what you say and in that emphasis you
laid upon sea
 find out my reason then said his father
perhaps said harry there may be
something in sea water which rusts iron
and so destroys it and perhaps that whatever
it may be does not rust and destroy
copper
just so harry but what is that
something you are acquainted with it
said his father
is it sea salt said harry which is
in the water 
yes harry a chemist has lately tried
experiments which have ascertained this
fact and in consequence these experiments
it has been decided that in
future the boilers should be made 
copper
how useful it is to try experiments 
said harry that settles what is truth
and there is no more doubting or disputing
that chemist was a sensible
man
and here is another large instance
harry said his father in which chemistry
has assisted the mechanic
true father said harry but there
is another question i want to ask you about
the paddle wheels what were the improvements
in them which those gentlemen
were talking 
i cannot explain them to you harry
said his father because you do not
know distinctly the difficulties and the
faults in the present construction and these
i cannot now describe to you you should
first see them in action in the water
and how and when can i do that 
said harry
not now when we are going in a
carriage on land said his father laughing
but some time or other we may be in a
boat within view a steam vessel
harry sighing repeated some time
or other is there any other great improvement
you could explain to me
his father yawned and said he began
to be weary his questions
only one thing more i have to say
said harry and you need not answer
the steam engine i saw this morning in
the boat takes up a great deal room if
it could be made to do as well in a smaller
compass what a great improvement how
comfortable it would be said harry
true said his father and how
comfortable it would be to me if you would
let me rest now
 poor father so i will thank you
i have quite tired you
 no harry but i did not sleep well
last night i drank too strong tea or
coffee
his father went to sleep and harry sat
as still as a mouse lest he should waken
him how tea or coffee could keep people
awake he did not know he pondered long
on that subject but was never the wiser 
he had never yet been kept awake by
either when the carriage stopped and
not till then his father wakened quite refreshed

when they got out their postillion begged
harry to stay a minute while he
fumbled for something in the side pockets
and then in the front pocket the carriage
it was here it should be here they
told me it was here muttered the postillion
while he continued his search with
his legs out and his body in the chaise 
at last in the sword case he found what he
had been told was there and he brought
out the cocoa nut which he put into
harry's hands telling him that a sailor
charged him not to forget it he said
that a mother and child sent it to him 
and the message was that it might
make him a cup some time or other and
had good milk in it if he could get it
out
the postillion was anxious to deliver
this message correctly for he said he
knew the woman who had been always
very kind to him
lucy who had been looking out the
window the inn watching for their return
heard what passed and saw the
cocoa nut with joy she ran to meet
harry and to learn from him who gave it
to him and to hear an account his adventures
these he told with all the details
she desired till he came to the moment
 the woman's crossing his passage
as he left the boat then pausing and
turning his cocoa nut about in every direction
he said he was ashamed to tell her
how crossly he had spoken
his father added yes harry you are
riofht to be ashamed i was ashamed for
you
i wonder you did not tell me so at the
time father said harry
i knew it would not do you any good
at the moment i thought you would recollect
it afterwards yourself as i find you
do and i hope the pain you now feel will
prevent you from doing the same sort 
thing again
 i hope it will said harry but when
that kind feeling comes over me it is so
disagreeable i do not know what i am doing
or saying and i am angry with myself
and with the people who speak tome
and with every body but the pain
 reproaching myself afterwards with
having been illnatured is worse still as i
feel now and i shall remember this and i
will try and conquer myself next time
 i am sure you will try and i am sure
you will do it said lucy
take the cocoa nut said harry putting
it into her hands we will not
open it yet pack it up somewhere forme

 men always talk packing up a thing
somewheres thought lucy and women
are to find where
it required lucy's best powers packing
to find a somewhere for the cocoa nut 
but she did at last stow it into the carpetbag
contrary to the prophecies all beholders

when they were leaving bristol they
stopped at a bookseller's to buy some 
or books to read in the carriage several
works were spread upon the counter in the
bookseller's shop for them to take their
choice harry and lucy read the title
pages some which their father and mother
allowed them to look over
we will dip here and there in the
books said harry and see whether they
look entertaining may we papa
 may we cut the leaves said lucy
peeping between two uncut pages
the showman with some hesitation
presented an ivory cutter to her telling her
that she was welcome to cut the leaves if
she would be so good as to take care not to
tear them he became at ease when he
saw her set about the operation perceivingshe
was used to it and dextrous but
care sat on the bookseller's brow considerate
when harry took up the ivory
knife he thought that he would tear away

like most other boys that he had seen
without heeding what mischief they did
if i make the least jag i will stop
and show it you sir you may depend
upon that said harry proudly
 you may trust to our honour whoever
jags first stops
very well said their father looking
up from the he was reading upon
that condition you may cut away
they were glad to see their father and
mother both caught by some new 
sitting down to read we shall have
good time said they to cut and dip
after each cutting half a volume they
showed the adores the books not the
slightest indenture appeared that could
by the most exact bookseller's eye be accounted
ajv all was smooth and fair
even to the inmost recess the dangerous
corner the quadruple page
 now we have cut enough said lucy
 let us dip three times harry and catch
what we may
harry seized upon one the books and
opened upon this passage which he read
aloud 
as the gloomy habitation my grandfather was
in was not to be long endured but from necessity
they were contriving other places safety for him
particularly one under a bed which drew out in a
ground floor in a room which my mother kept the
key she and the same man worked in the night
making a hole in the earth after lifting up the boards
which they did by scratching it up with their hands
not to make any noise till she left not a nail upon her
fingers she helping the man to carry the earth as
they dug it in a sheet on his back out at the window
into the garden he then made a box at his own
house large enough for her father to lie with bed
and bed clothes and bored holes in the boards for
air alien all this was finished for it was long
about she thought herself the happiest creature
alive
i have heard that before cried lucy
the lady grisell bailie mamma i
heard you reading it last winter to papa
oh mamma do you remember the diverting
part about the sheep's head i will
show it to you harry lend me the for
one minute but this is not the same 
you had continued she that was a
poem and there were notes to it here
is no poetry and i am very sorry i wish
i could see again that pretty description 
all that grisell did when she was a young
girl i am sure harry would like that
though it is poetry
shall i try said her mother i
think i can remember the lines you mean 
and well with ready hand and heart
each task toilsome duty taking
did one dear inmate take her part
the last asleep the earliest waking
her hands each nightly couch prepared
and frugal meal on which they fared 
unfolding spread the serve white
and deck'd the board with tankard bright
through fretted hose and garment rent
her tiny needle deftly went
till hateful penury so graced
was scarcely in their dwelling traced
with rev'rence to the old she clung
with sweet affection to the young
to her was crabbed lesson said
to her the sly petition made
to her was told each petty care 
to her was lisp'd the tardy prayer
metrical legends by joanna bailie
what time the urchin half undress
and half asleep was put to rest
thank you mamma i do like it
said harry
i am glad to see there is something
new in these memoirs grisell bailies
resumed lucy who had been looking over
the here is more than we had
in the notes to the poem pray mamma
pray buy this for the carriage
no my dear i will not buy it for
the carriage said her mother laughing 
but i will buy it for myself if you please
and i will read to you whatever can entertain
you
thank you mamma harry are not
you glad we are to have this said
lucy hey harry 
bnt harry made no answer he was intent
upon a passage in another 
which he had just opened
 what is it said lucy looking over
his shoulder oh i see the word steam
engine that is enough for him but now
harry do not choose a stupid 
no danger that miss this is
one the scotch novels said the shopman

 a novel harry said lucy how
did a steam engine get into it 
 i do not know said harry but i
know that i have found a fine character
 i will not tell you but you shall hear
it father would you be so kind as to
read it out to my mother and lucy
 why should not you be so kind
harry as to read it to them yourself
said his father
because father i cannot do justice toit
said harry and it is so good that i
could not bear to spoil it pray father
read it here is the 
his father read the following character
 the great inventor the steam enfine
 
 amidst this company stood mr watt the man
whose genius discovered the means multiplying our
national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond
his own stupendous powers calculation and combination
 bringing the treasures the abyss to the
summit the earth giving the feeble arm man
the momentum the afrite commanding manufactures
to arise as the rod the prophet produced
water in the desert affording the means dispensing
with that time and tide which wait for no man and
 sailing without that wind which defied the commands
and threats xerxes himself this potent commander
 the elements this abridger time and
space this magician whose cloudy machinery has
produced a change in the world the effects which
extraordinary as they are perhaps are only now beginning
to be felt was not only the most refined
man science the most successful combined 
powers and calculator numbers as adapted to
practical purposes was not only one the most
generally well informed but one the best and
kindest human beings
 
several gentlemen who had been reading
laid down their books to listen to this
eloquent and just eulogium when it
was finished and when the reader's voice
stopped there was silence for a moment
then a general burst admiration
who wrote it where is it whose
is it
all crowded round harry to look at the
 harry felt proud having found
out ybr himself and by himself what was

 
good it is scarcely necessary to say that
his father bought the work the parcel
was made up put into the carriage and
they drove on as soon as they were out
 the noisy streets harry and lucy seized
again upon this eager to know if there
was any thing more in it about mr watt
they found an account his powers 
pleasing in conversation and his great
variety knowledge
this struck harry with fresh admiration

 how i wish papa had known him 
cried lucy oh harry if you had
but seen him should not you have liked
it very much 
 i should not have cared for merely
seeing him said harry unless i could
have heard him and known him
they now began to question each other
which all the great people whom
they had ever heard or read they should
most wish to have seen and known and
then which they should have liked only
just to see which to have for acquaintvol
 q
once which for friends and which they
should like to live with always 
these questions brought on a great deal
 interesting and diverting discussion
during which papa and mamma were often
appealed to and in which they took their
share much to harry and lucy's delight
the number those with whom they
should choose to live which at first was
prodigious on lucy's part especially was
gradually reduced till at last it came down
to very few indeed not above five or
six
it was observed that harry who informer
times desired to see only great
mechanics now desired to know great
chemists too and all sorts sensible and
inventing people as he said
this was one good consequence as lucy
remarked their having lately travelled
so much but tomorrow harry continued
she is to be the last day's travelling
are you glad or sorry harry i do
not know which i am myself partly glad
partly sorry t feel sorry that the journey
will be at an because i like travelling
very much and seeing every day some
new and entertaining things and people
but i shall be glad for one great reason to
come to the our journey that we
may see the cottage by the seaside i
long to know what sort a looking cottage
it is do not you harry
yes said harry but above all i
wish to sea the ocean
and the sea shore cried lucy
 where i may pick up hundreds 
shells 
 and i hope i shall see ships said
harry
 and a boat with sails in which we
may sail sometimes said lucy
yes i should like that very much
said harrv i want to know more about
sails
 shoulder mutton sails especially
cried lucy which i remember reading
about in robinson crusoe i wonder what
they are 
her father sketched for her a shoulder
 mutton sail and she was rather disappointed
when she learned that the name
arose merely from the shape
the conversation was interrupted by the
sight a boat on a river but it had no
sails it was a ferry boat
at harry and lucy's age it was a real pleasure
to cross a ferry though to travellers
more advanced in years it may sometimes
be a pain or at least a trouble they
are apt to prefer a bridge
on the evening the last day their
journey harry and lucy looked out anxi
 ously at every house they saw and many
times they hoped that cottages which at a
distance peeping between trees looked
charming would be theirs till on a nearer
n view they were as often contented to let
them pass one with a honeysuckle porch
and another with a trellis and another with
a pomegranate in full flower lucy however
looked back with regret fearing that
theirs could never be so pretty theirs
was to be on the sea shore but as yet they
did not seem to be near the sea presently
they turned into a lane which led down a

steep hill with hedges so high on each
side that nothing could be seen but the
narrow road before them at the bottom
 this lane to the right there was a gate
and a road leading through a wood
harry's father stopped the carriage and
asked an old woman who came to the
gate is this the road to rupert's cottage
 
yes sir
i am glad it thought hany weare
sure a wood that is one good thing
the gate opened and they drove in
now we shall see what sort a place
it is said lucy
rupert's cottage was at the foot a high
hill covered with trees which sheltered it
at the back in front was a very small
green lawn surrounded with evergreens
the cottage had a honeysuckle porch and
a bow window and a trellis the outside
was all that lucy desired and within 
within it was an odd kind house with
one long matted passage and steps up
here and down there and rooms that had
been enlarged with jutting windows and
niches and nooks in curious ways and
lucy liked it all the better for not being a
regular house the rooms in which she
and harry were to sleep if rooms they
could be called were very very small
as even lucy observed there was but just
space for a little bed and a little table and
a little chair and for a little person to turnabout
in no chest drawers or any
such luxury only a press in the corner cut
in the wall but the more difficulties the
more inconveniences the better there would
be more work for ingenuity in contriving
how to settle themselves and their ooods
lucy wanted to have the trunks brought
in and to go to the unpacking and arranging
directly but harry had other thoughts
in his head
lucy said he i am disappointed in
one thing and a great thing
what my dear harry said lucy
opening her eyes wide
the sea said harry looking out 
the window no view the sea any

where i thought the cottage was to be
on the sea shore
and so it was but the sea was hidden
from the view the windows the house
by a sand bank which had been thrown up
by the tide and which was now covered
by a plantation evergreens harry persuaded
lucy to put off unpacking their
trunk till morning and to go out with him
in search the sea he led the way and
as theywent round the little haven she delighted
with the new place and with every
new flower and shrub would have often
stopped to admire oh harry look at
this myrtle taller than i am oh harry
this myrtle taller than mamma 
harry looked back but ran on to find
the way down to the sea shore this is
the way this is the way he shouted joyously
to lucy bidding her follow 
follow follow 
but suddenly he stopped and was silent
struck by the first sight the ocean
lucy followed and turning abruptly the
corner the rock which had hid the
view from her exclaimed the sea the
sea
she stood for some moments in silence
beside her brother looking at the vast extent
 water far as her sight could reach
bounded only by the sky they were now
standing on the sands the shore it was
a still evening the tide was ebbing the
sun setting and there was a long bright
light upon the water while the green and
white waves curling gently over each
other moved on continually
how beautiful it is exclaimed lucy
how grand harry is not it more beautiful
and grander than you expected is
not it harry
infinitely said harry but hush
i want to look and to listen to it
lucy stood beside her brother a little
while longer and then ran back to the
house to call her mother to look at it before
the red sun should be quite set her
mother came and they found harry still
on the same spot fixed in admiration his
mother seemed to know what he felt and
thought and to sympathise with him just
as he wished at first in silence then expressing
for him in words that for which
he could not find utterance the ideas 
boundless extent duration power the
feelings admiration astonishment and
awe which create the sense the sublime
while his soul was under this strong impression
his mother seized the proper moment
to raise his thoughts still higher from
the ideas immeasurable extent duration
and power to that power by which the
ocean the sun the earth and we ourselves
were created and are preserved
the impression made on the minds 
harry and lucy was never effaced
by sunrise next morning harry was on
the sea shore at the stated hours he was
constantly there to watch the coming in
and going out the tide this regular
ebbing and flowing the sea excited such
astonishment in his mind that it seemed
insatiable a fisherman who lived by the
sea side asked him if he had never before
heard the coming in and going out 
the tide every day
yes i had heard it but i never said
it before said harry that was quite another
thing
the sea and the tides took such possession
 his imagination that he could think
 nothing else not even steam boats or
steam engines during the first day he
did not even think crossing the sea in a
steam vessel he was completely absorbed
in viewing this great spectacle nature
and in considering its wonderful phenomena

his mother was surprised to find that
he was susceptible this kind enthusiasm
 which she had not till now seen in
him any symptom all his enthusiasm
had seemed to be for mechanics his mind
had indeed opened during his travels to
other objects but still these had been introduced
or had interested him by their
connection with the steam engine to which
he had traced every thing good or great
so that as she had once told his father
she was afraid that harry's head would
be quite turned by his dear steam engine
or at best that it would leave no
room in his imagination for the beauties
 nature or for any thing else but his
father had answered that there was no
danger in letting the boy's enthusiasm take
its course especially as it was a means 
collecting all the knowledge he could upon
one subject his father said it was 
little consequence to which science he
first turned his attention the same thirst
for knowledge when satisfied on one point
would turn to new objects the boy who
was capable feeling such admiration for
the ingenious works art could not fail
as he thought to admire with still greater
enthusiasm the beauties nature he
would have probably disliked them if they
had been pressed upon his attention and
yet he would have felt pain from not being
able to sympathise with the admiration 
his friends his father was justified m
his opinion and his mother was now quite
satisfied
but on the evening the day after their
arrival lucy came to harry with no face
 rejoicing
 oh my dear hany here you are
standing on the sea shore looking at the
tide very happily but you do not know
what a misfortune has happened to you
 what misfortune can have happened
to me without my knowing it said
harry
i have been unpacking our trunk
said lucy
the glass my camera obscura is
broken i suppose said harry
you suppose so calmly cried lucy
perhaps it can be mended said
harry
impossible said lucy come and
look at it my dear harry it is broken into
a hundred pieces
then there is no use in looking at the
hundred pieces said harry

 but if you will come in and look at
it said lucy i can show you just how 
it happened
i cannot help it now said harry soit
does not much signify to me how it happened
i will look at it when i go in but
i want to stay here just to see how high
the waves come at full tide
i am glad your head is so full the
tide harry said lucy i was afraid
that you would be excessively vexed as i
was when i opened the box and saw it besides
i was afraid that you would think it
was my fault
 no i could not be so unjust said
harry i remember how carefully you
packed it and how goodnatured you were
about it and i do not forget your shell
box which you left at home to make room
for my camera obscura now i am sorry
you did not bring it
 can do without it said lucy
 i will make a shell box for you cried
harry and i know how i can make it
out that camera obscura mine and
without spoiling it even if i should get a
new glass i will go in and look at it and
begin directly said hairy i mean as
soon as ever i have seen the tide come in
and marked how high it comes up on this
rock
withinside the box harry's camera
obscura there was a set hinged
flaps which lay at the bottom when it was
not used but which when it was to be used
as a camera obscura were lifted up and
joining together formed a sort pyramid
on the top which the eye glass was fixed
this glass being broken harry cleared
away the fragments and took out the pins
from the hinges the flaps which formed
the pyramid then he could take out the
flaps and these with their pins and hinges
he gave into lucy's charge to take care 
till they should be wanted again then
with the help an old knife the only tool
to be had in rupert's cottage he cut up
a blue bandbox the only pasteboard to be
had in rupert's cottage he carved and
cut this pasteboard into a number slips
with tolerably straight edges and these
were to be fastened inside his box at the
bottom so as to form divisions from the middle
in the shape a large star the corners
round it filled up with other divisions
 hearts and crescents with some as lucy
described them no particular shape
this was the ground plan these divisions
were but half the height the depth 
the box over this first story there was to
be another a tray was to be made to fit in
and to lie on the top the basement story
as harry would have it called with difficulty
the blue bandbox furnished sufficient
pasteboard for this every scrap was required
and some parts its rim had been
so much bent and bruised and battered
that they could scarcely be made fit for
service with harry's utmost care and skill
when the work was all cut out harry set
lucy to write numbers on the pieces the
stars hearts crescents and nondescript
that each might fit rightly into its place
this he had learned he said from reading
the description the building the eddystone
lighthouse it was a precaution
he found great use in the present work
the first the kind he had ever attempted
he had no glue the cook or she who
acted as cook in rupert's cottage had no
time to make paste harry however
searched in the orchard on the cherry trees
for gum and found some which he melted
in hot water it was too thin so thin
that it would not stick his divisions together
by his mother's advice he melted
it in vinegar with which he made an excellent
cement though his fingers were
unused to this fiddlefaddle work as he
thought it he persevered for lucy's sake
and for the sake his promise it was
difficult to make the tray fit rightly or
draw up and let down easily but he polished
away all friction at the four corners
and he fastened tapes to the middle each
 the four sides so automatically that it
could be drawn up without hitching and
without dangler that when filled to the
brim with the smallest 
shells it should overturn or be overturned

while hairy had been working at the
shell tray in his oven little room lucy's
head was in all the cares and joys arranging
his goods and her oven after the
general unpacking it not only required
nice arrangement to make things comfortable
in the small space allotted to them in
their new abode but continual care would
be necessary to keep them so and now
lucy felt particularly the advantage those
habits order which her mother had
taught her even when she was a very little
girl
lucy put your work into your workbag
and put your work bag into its place
had not been said in vain
when lucy had arranged her own room
she stood contemplating her arrangements
and said to herself
 what a pleasure there is in seeing all
things fit nicely into their places
this pleasure in the perception the
fitness things has been felt probably by
every little or great lover order as well
as by lucy besides our sense the convenience
 having things in their places
and the expectation finding them readily
when wanted we feel some selfapprobation
in having done our duty in putting
them to rights
lucy having finished to the best her
power the arrangement all her brother's
things and her own went out to the seashore
to look for shells and numbers she
found the whole day was spent in the
delightful search and the next morning the
moment breakfast was over she asked
harry to come again with her to the same
amusement but he said that he had business
to do first and that he would join her
as soon as he had learned his lessons
 lessons repeated lucy with surprise
not unfixed with disappointment
do you intend to go on with lessons
harry
yes why not
 i do not know answered lucy putting
on her bonnet but i thought you
need not learn them i did not know
that we were to go on with lessons now
we are not at home
 we are at home now i think said
harry this is to be our home for two
months at least
that is a long time to be sure
said lucy tying the strings her bonnet
but i have not settled to any thing yet i
have no greek to learn thank goodness
i will go down to the sea shore to day at
least and you will find me there harry
when you have done your business make
haste
harry with his books under his arm
and lucy with her bonnet on and shell
tray in her hand were turning their different
ways in the matted passage when
their mother came out her room
where are you going lucy
 to the sea shore mamma to look for
shells
her mother said that this was a pleasant
amusement but reminded her that
there were other more necessary employments

yes tomorrow mamma i intend 
why not today lucy said her
mother
 i thought it would not signify mamma
if i went without lessons one day more 
you know i have not done any during all
the journey and in one day i could not
learn much
 my dear lucy said her mother
when your father and i first thought 
bringing you with us on this journey we
considered whether it would be advantage
or disadvantage to you
 thank you mamma and you said yesterday
that you thought it had been already
 great use to harry
true my dear but now i am speaking
 you
me only mamma said lucy when
you said you i thought you always meant
both us
you are not quite so steady in perseverance
as your brother and i was afraid
that seeing a great number new things
and being with a number new people
might be disservice to you
but i hope you do not think i am
spoilt at all yell mammas said lucy
i cannot tell yet my dear said her
mother smiling that remains for you to
show me your father thought as he told
me that i might trust to the habits regularly
employing yourself which you have
lately acquired or resumed and to the influence
 your brother's example i shall
not have it in my power to attend to you
here so much as i do at home i must
ride out while i am here some hours everyday
for my health and i am to bathe
therefore i cannot be with you so much or
hear your lessons as i used to do at regular
times
never mind my dear mother said
lucy i will get them always regularly
you shall see mamma that papa was right
in thinking you might trust to me and i
will follow harry's example and i will
begin today and this minute added she
untying her bonnet i will put by my
shell tray you will allow mamma that
i am exact in putting by my things and
before i went away from you mamma i
was regular in employing myself i know
that was the reason you said resumed
you shall see mamma
from this time forward lucy at fixed
hours always went to her daily employments
or lessons as punctually as harry
went to his and performed them well
whether her mother had leisure to attend
to her or not never did lucy neglect or
voluntarily omit any them one single
day while they remained at the sea shore
and when it was all over she declared
that all the pleasures the many pleasures
she enjoyed there the reflection that she
had done this was the greatest nothing
is more tiresome than to spend all day long
in amusement or in trying to amuse oneself
lucy after working hard and well
at whatever she knew she ought to do enjoyed
with double pleasure the succeeding
hours by the sea shore hairy with complaisance
which his lasting gratitude for
the packing his camera obscura sustained
used to help her to pick up shells but it
was not an amusement particularly to his
taste and when he had stooped till his
back ached which soon happened he went
off to refresh himself at some his own
works he had a bridge to build and a
canal to cut and a lock to make these
were some the projects which he had
formed during the journey and which he
was now eager to carry into execution
he found a fine place for his canal between
two rivulets at some distance from
each other his little bark might sail triumphantly
for a length course if he
could effect their junction he levelled
and calculated and calculated and levelled
before he dug with as much care perhaps
as has been bestowed upon some great
public works he dug and excavated indefatigably
his method proceeding
was to keep the water back by a small
dam earth till he had advanced a few
feet he would then remove the dam and
the water which flowed in detected any
errors that he had committed in the level
when the cut however had been made
some yards in length the sides in many
places fell in for the soil was loose and
crumbly this misfortune was easily remedied
by increasing the slope the
sides but a more serious disaster befel
our young engineer which obliged him to
recur to his father's neverfailing advice
he had carried his work through a vein 
sand and though the sides had been properly
sloped to keep them from falling in
yet when he opened the dam and admitted
a little water it gradually disappeared
and left the canal dry
his father willingly gave his assistance
and having examined the spot and perceiving
that the sand communicated with
other porous ground underneath he said
 this is a difficulty my dear harry which
often occur sto older and wiser engineers and
always occasions great increase trouble
and expense i was in hopes that by
some alteration in the line your canal
this leaky place might have been avoided 
but the sand is so extensive that i believe
your only resource vill be to puddle the
sides and bottom
he took harry to a ditch at some little
distance in which there was abed strong
tenacious clay and he explained to him
that puddling was performed by spreading
the clay in layers wetting it sufficiently
and then beating it into a thick paste
which he would find was quite impervious
to water as soon as harry knew what
was to be done he proceeded in his work
with fresh vigour and lucy assisted him
in carrying the clay in small quantities
such as their only basket would hold the
claypaste was well mixed and rammed
with the buttend a long club and the
sides and bottom were nicely smoothed
with the back the spade when the
dam was again opened the canal was
tight and firm to admiration and harry
felt not only the pleasure successful
labour but the satisfaction having acquired
knowledge in every step he took
lucy stood by to witness and admire
this operation in which proper female
consideration for her shoes and petticoats
forbade her to join but female
sympathy is often agreeable in circumstances
in which woman's aid can in no
other way be given something to this
effect but very unlike it in words harry
once said to lucy and it paid her for
standing above an hour looking on
harry had examined the real lock on the
canal and understood its construction so
well that he succeeded in making his miniature
imitation the canal about two feet
wide and one foot deep the lock about
four feet long from gate to gate the gates
were made an old hatch door the
chicken yard which he found posts and
all among a heap rubbish in the wood
house his father oave him leave to take
possession it and the woodman lent him
a saw with which he cut it in two across
the middle leaving on each half one 
the leather straps which had served for
hinges he wisely contented himself with
single gates at each his lock as he
was aware that neither his skill nor his
tools would enable him to construct the
double gates which meet together anglewise
so as to support each other and
which he well remembered was the casein
the real lock the posts he sawed
in two also in the middle their
height but this he did without sufficient
consideration he spoiled his four
wellseasoned posts and lost a day by
this rash act he found each them cut
too short for the doors and sides his
lock because he had not considered the
depth to which it was necessary to drive
them into the ground to make them stand
firmly and bear the weight the doors
that hinged upon or shut against them
he had four new posts to make and these
he made twice as high as the others and
drove them down several inches deep into
the ground this was the hardest work 
all harry without hat or coat wielding
the woodman's heavy axe battered
these piles with the butt lending his
little soul at every stroke at every pause
lucy in pity would say
harry pray do let me try now while
you rest yourself
but when she took up the axe she
found it was too heavy for her and her
strokes were so feeble that they did no
good the post never stirred at her hammering
never sunk in twenty strokes a hairbreadth
each blow hers was so uncertain
in its aim that harry fearing the
axe would turn in her hands and that
she would by cutting off her legs besought
her to desist protesting that it
made him hotter to see her batter than to
batter himself he assured her that battering
was too hard work for women and
quite unfit for them and she being much
out breath believed him and resigned
the ponderous axe he worked himself
into another heat while she repeated
many times
it will do now harry it is deep
vol iii c
enough down now harry i am sure that
is enough
but harry battered on till the post would
stir no more then he was satisfied for it
was as he said au refus de mouton
 au refus de mouton said lucy what
can that mean mouton is mutton or
sheep what can mutton or sheep have
to do with this 
harry told her that mouton is not only
the name for mutton and sheep in french
but also for a battering hammer or pile
engine the machine with which piles are
driven down into the ground he said
that he met with the expression in a description
 the pile engine which he had
read in consequence the old gentleman
at mr franklin's having excited his curiosity
about it by the description he gave
 the houses in amsterdam built on piles
how curious it is said lucy to see
how one thing leads to another and how
one bit knowledge sometimes in the
oddest way helps us on to another that
seems to have nothing to do with it and
harry think your explaining this french
expression to me though i began to learn
french so long before you and though i
heard so much it from french people
too when i was at aunt pierrepoint's i
ought to be very much ashamed
not at all my dear said harry 
this is a scientific expression not necessary
for a woman to know
lucy looked as if she was not sure
whether she should be satisfied or dissatisfied
by this observation
not necessary for a woman to know
she repeated to be sure it is not absolutely
necessary one could live without it
yet i do not see why a woman should not
know scientific expressions as well as
men
you are very welcome to know them
ray dear said harry i do not make
any objection am not i teaching them
to you but i hope my dear lucy you
will never use them
 never use them said lucy
c 
 in the wrong place i mean added
harry
no danger if once i understand them
rightly said lucy
 still you do not quite understand me
said harry if you knew the meaning
 the words ever so well there might be
danger your using them in the wrong
place
oh harry how could that be
ask mamma and she can tell you better
than i can said harry
but tell me as well as you can said
lucy
 then for instance said harry if
you were to talk au refus de mouton
before company just to show that you
knew the expression or could say it do
you understand me now
yes but i would never do such a foolish
thing said lucy
pray do not my dear sister said
harry for it would make me feel horribly
ashamed
i shall never make you ashamed me
i hope brother said lucy i will take
great care but there was another thing
i was in a great hurry to say before you
went off to this why is a battering hammer
or a machine for driving down posts
or what do you call them piles called a
mouton 
i do not know said harry
i think i have found out the reason
said lucy
have you said harry then you are
much quicker than i am but that you always
are
 only about words said lucy and
i am not sure that i am right but i think
perhaps it is because sheep sometimes butt
this way with their heads
 i do believe you are right said harry
 this must be the meaning batteringraw
it never struck me till this minute
but i do not know what i shall do for want
 nails to nail these leather hinges on my
gate posts
lucy recollected having seen some yesterday
left sticking in the lid a deal
packing case perhaps these would do
she ran to ask her mother if she might
have them and soon returned with them
and with a hammer which had been used
at the unpacking the case and which
though it belonged to the carriage toolbox
her father lent her trusting to her returning
it punctually
not only quick in words but in deeds
said harry as she put the nails and hammer
into his hands
the hinges were fastened on and harry
pronounced the lock to be finished
but after all said lucy here is
your lock and your canal but where is
your boat to go upon it now you must
make a boat or a canoe harry yours
indeed must be made out a branch not
from the great trunk a tree to be in
proportion to your canal
true said harry a branch as you
say will do but what size must it be i
must consider that before i ask papa to let
the woodman give it to me
 you might do it by the rule three
said lucy as the great canal is to the
great boat so must the little canal be to the
little boat
well said harry do the sum forme
here is a pencil and a bit paper
but stay said lucy there is something
more we want i must have the measures
 the great canal and the little canal
and the size the great boat
harry measured his little canal and
gave breadth and depth to lucy who
multiplied them rightly into one another
the measures the great canal and the
great boat he did not know but his father
estimated them for him nearly enough to
answer his purpose lucy and he worked
out the sum patiently that evening and
when he knew the size required his father
gave him an order upon the woodman fora
branch or piece a branch the requisite
dimensions he also borrowed for
him a mallet a chisel and a gouge and
even an adze which were necessary tools
for hollowing out the solid wood and for
shaping the outside the intended canoe
this last indeed is a dangerous tool and
should never be trusted without circumspection
to oung or to old hands unless
they be skilful and careful harry
both careful and skilful for he had been
practised in the use this tool under his
father's eye at home was trusted with it
now but upon special condition that
lucy was never to touch it a condition
to which lucy having just fear her
shins as well as proper habits obedience
willingly submitted
as the hollowing out this canoe chip
by chip was likely to be a tedious operation
lucy left harry and his adze to themselves
and went to her own amusements
upon the shelly shore as she was creeping
aloncr searching for shells an old woman
crossed her path carrying on her back a
huoe basket full sea weed the woman's
foot hit against some shingles on the
beach she stumbled and let fall her
basket the contents which were overturned
on the sands lucy went to fill it
again for her and now seeing that she was
the gatekeeper who lived at the entrance
 the wood took hold one the
handles the basket and helped her to
carry it home
dame peyton for that was the old woman
s name thanked her and accepted her
offer more perhaps for the pleasure 
talking to the young lady on the way than
for any use in her assistance the load
though bulky was very light the basket
was chiefly filled with the little black bladders
 a particular kind sea weed
these when dried and oiled she strung
and sent by her daughter to the shops in a
town hard by where they were made into
necklaces and bracelets for whosoever gentle
or simple might chance to have a liking
for such the dame loved talking and she
pursued her discourse you were looking
for shells miss when i came by i suppose
 and if i may be so bold i can show
you more in an hour than you would find ina
week without me for i know where the
beds them lie and where the sea urchins
c 
bide miss if ever you heard them
urchins
lucy was eager to find a sea urchin and
had been searching for one in vain as
soon as they reached the cottage at the
gate where she lived dame peyton
pointed to a shelf in her corner cupboard
on which were several shells which had
been left there by her sailor son who had
picked up some them from the neighbouring
sands and some from foreign
parts
the shell the sea urchin which lucy
first examined was about the size an
orange the shape a turnip and divided
into compartments like a melon the colour
was lilac jut looking as if sprinkled thickly
with little white frosted sugarplums in
some its quarters and in others perforated
with a multitude holes nearly as
small as pin holes the shell was as light as
an empty egg shell through each the
little holes the urchin when alive puts out
its prickles or spines which stand in all directions
round the creature's shell like the
prickles a hedgehog lucy who had read
the description it knew that these serve
the sea urchin for legs with which at the
bottom the sea it can walk as it is said
in any direction sometimes with its mouth
upwards sometimes with its mouth downwards
sometimes rolling along sideways
like a wheel there was an opening at
the upper part the shell which served
for its mouth and another opposite to it
through which the creature can at pleasure
push out or draw in what resemble the
horns snails these which were formerly
supposed to have been its legs the
urchin uses only to feel about wdtb when
it walks as a blind man uses a staff to
touch and try every thing that lies in his
way
lucy who knew all this from her books
was eager to see the fish alive with all its
spines about it but dame peyton's dinner
was ready boiling over in her pot and
though the goodnatured old woman would
have left it to go that instant to show lucy
the haunt the urchins yet lucy would
not let her she waited till evening and
then harry accompanied her though rather
unwilling to lay by his adze and leave
his canoe
as he went with lucy towards the appointed
place he objected to her wonderful
account the urchin's mode walking
on the spines he said that as these
creatures were in the habit walking only
at the bottom the sea few people only
those who had gone down in a diving bell
could have observed them walking
 you shall see you shall see them
yourself harry said lucy
she recollected what she had read that
reaumur had first seen an urchin walking
at the bottom a shallow pan full seawater
and at her request dame peyton
had provided one her shallow milk pans
to show the experiment they found her
waiting for them when they reached ure
she took out one from a number
 these fish which had congregated
together and put the apparently inanimate
ball into the pan full water presently
it sent forth some its hundred horns
through the holes in its shell and soon
stretching its spines it appeared with all
its wiry looking prickles full upon it
thirteen hundred horns and two thousand
spines well counted
it moves it moves now harry
see it rising up now it is putting out
its feelers from beneath now look at it
feeling about like a blind man with his
staff and now he is really beginning to
walk look at him w alkino on his shines
like a wheel on its spokes how beautifully
he goes on 
 he is an admirable mechanic exclaimed
harry look how he uses some
 his spines as a fulcrum against which
he pushes and drawls on his shell by
turns i did not think any fish could have
so much sense
harrys admiration increased as well
it mioht the more he considered these
things
 now harry you see that even my
shell hunting leads to something said
lucy you will not despise shell fish
when you know more about them and
their houses
after this day whenever harry wanted
to rest himself from his hard labour he
used to go to lucy to learn something
more her shells
one day she showed him the shell the
razor fish and told him in what an ingenious
manner the fish which inhabits this
shell can move itself forward or descend
into its sandy hole it does not walk upon
spines but by means its tongue it hasa
fleshy cylindrical tongue which it can use
by turns as a shovel a hook a borer and
a ball when it wants to go on it forms
its tongue into the shape a hook which
it strikes into the sand and by which it
pulls its body after it when it wants to
descend it bores a hole in the sand with
its tongue sometimes two feet in depth 
and when it wants to ascend to the surface
it forms the its tongue into the
shape a ball which stops the bottom
 the hole and serves as a fulcrum and
then making an effort to extend the whole
tongue pushes the shell upwards till by
a repetition this operation it gains the
surface
 all things lucy most wished to see
a barnacle not for its beauty nor for its
rarity but on account the strange stories
she had read concerns it she had first
met with some account it in a note on
the barnacle in her bewick's british birds 
and afterwards she had copied from some
other a whole page its fabulous
history she searched honor the shore
many a time in vain for a barnacle but
dame peyton gave her one which had
been found by her sailor boy at the bottom
 an old plank a ship lucy ran with
her treasure to harry and showed it to
him it looked something like a transparent
white flexible gristle branching from
one centre or body into various arms 
at the or summit each branch
there was a small shell about the size a
bean and the shape the bill a large
bird these arms or branches are called
pedicle or footsteps by these the fish
attaches itself to rocks or to the bottoms
 vessels these footsteps are sometimes
 a fine red and the shells sometimes
 a violet colony
 but now harry said she you
might guess for ever what not only foolish
people but grave naturalists my dear who
wrote books in former times believed came
out these little shells pray guess
i suppose some sort offish said harry
no but a bird a goose a great
goose said lucy out each these
tiny shells this was called the treebearing
goose and now let me read this
to you or read for yourself if you please
and can read my small hand writing
harry read as follows 
what our eyes have seen and hands
have touched we shall declare there is
a small island 
lucy put her hand over the name the
place and bid harry read on without
knowing where the place was
 there is a small island wherein are
found the broken pieces old bruised
ships some whereof have been cast thither
by shipwreck and also the trunks and
branches rotten trees whereon is found
a certain spume or froth that in time
breadth into certain shells in shape like
those the muscle but sharper pointed
and a whitish colour wherein is contained
a thing in form like a lace silk
finely woven together one whereof is
fastened to the inside the shell even as
the fish oysters and muscles are the
other is made fast unto a rude mass or
lump which in time comes into the shape
and form a bird when it is perfectly
formed the shell gapeth open and the
first thing that appeareth is the aforesaid
lace or string next come the legs the
bird hanp'ino out and as it orroweth greater
it opened the shell by degrees till at
length it is all come forth and hanoeth
only by the bill in short space after it
cometh to maturity and falleth into the
sea where it gathered feathers and groweth
to a fowl bigger than a mallard lesser
than a goose which the people 
lucy put her finger over the place
 call by no other name than a tree
goose which place aforesaid and all those
parts adjoining do so much abound with
that one the best is bought for threes

pence
 i never heard such nonsense in my
life said harry
 for the truth whereof if any doubt
continued lucy reading may it please
them to repair unto me and i shall satisfy
them by the testimony good witnesses
 good witnesses indeed said harry
he asked in what part the world and
at what time what age such nonsense
could have been believed he supposed
that it must have been in the dark ages
and at novazembla or the lord knows
where he was surprised when lucy
told him that the place reputed to be the
native soil the tree bearing goose
was in england in a small island on the
 
coast lancashire and that the time when
grave naturalists wrote its history was the
latter the days queen elizabeth
 but what could have given rise to such
a strange story 
lucy said that there was no reason
given but that the silky looking membrane
which hung out the shells the fish
look something like feathers
their mother observed that as the barnacle
goose was a bird passage and
appeared only for a short time in severe
winters the country people had not means
 learning their history nor could they
tell how they came there and seeing the
barnacle shells also but seldom and perhaps
happening to see these also in bad
weather when cast ashore on shipwrecked
vessels they had concluded too hastily
that one elinor was the cause the other
because it appeared at the same time or
just before it
lucy said this was natural for ignorant
peasants but for naturalists mamma and
people who write great books think 
their believing that a great goose which
weighs i have it written down hereabout
five pounds and measures more than
two feet in length and nearly four feet
and a half in breadth came out this
little shell 
 but lucy said her mother i do
not think that is the incredible part the
story
no mamma dont you indeed
 i do not do not the common geese
you see every day come from an egg almost
as much less than the fuuorown bird
as the barnacle shell is less than the barnacle
goose 
 that is true to be sure said lucy
 great birds come from small eggs we see
but then mother the wonder is that the
bird should come from the shell a
fish
 now you have it lucy cried harry
and why should not that be believed 
said their mother
 oh mamma and do you really believe
it cried lucy
i do not recollect telling you that i
believed it replied her mother smiling
but i asked you your reason for disbelieving
 unless you can give some reason
for your belief or your disbelief you are
not wiser than the poor people you have
been laughing at
that is perfectly true said harry
but i did not think it till mamma said
so
my reason for not believing it said
lucy is that it is contrary to all we ever
heard or read the history birds or
fishes
that is a good reason said her mother
 all that we know their history is
from observation or from reading the observations
 others and all the means we
have judging whether any new fact we
hear related be true or false must be from
comparing it with former established facts
and considering whether it agtrees with
them or not
yes mamma i understand said
lucy also by considering whether it
agrees or not with what are called the laws
 nature
and what do you mean my dear by
the lawes nature said her mother
the laws nature repeated lucy
to gain time oh mamma you know
what i mean by the laws nature you
only ask that to puzzle me
no my dear lucy i ask it only
that you may not puzzle yourself that you
may not use words without clearly understanding
their meaning
is not the laws nature a good expression
mamma said lucy
a very good expression for those who
understand what they mean by it said
her mother but no expression can be
good for those who do not to them it
expresses nothing
lucy thought for some time and then
said harry do you try you can explain
it better
you mean by the laws nature said
harry things or circumstances which
have been known regularly and constantly
to happen about animals and vegetables
and minerals and all things in nature i
cannot express it quite mother but for
instance it is a law nature that the
earth turns round every twentyfour
hours
 yes that the sun rises every morning
said lucy and in the same way it maybe
said to be a lave nature mamma that
birds do not come fishes shells
very vell between you you have explained
pretty nearly what is meant by
the laws nature said their mother
 what from the beginning the
world was never in any instance known to
happen we do not believe cadi happen
said harry i mean in nature and
yet continued he new facts are discovered
which sometimes prove that what
was thought to be quite true and a settled
law nature is not so
but said lucy to go back to the
barnacle goose tree harry suppose that
you and i had lived in queen elizabeth's
days and in lancashire and near that
island geese do not you think that we
should have believed in the goosetree
i hope not said harry butlam
not sure
 suppose that a great many people had
told you that they were sure there was
such a tree said lucy what would you
have said then
 i would have asked whether they had
seen it themselves or whether they had
only heard it from others said harry
 i would have questioned the people separately
and have observed whether they
all agreed or disagreed in their answers
and above all i would have gone to the
place and would have examined the barnacle
shells with my own eyes then i
think i should have perceived that what
people had mistaken for feathers a bird
were the membranes or what do you call
them lucy teiitacula a fish i would
have returned at different times the
year to watch what became the barnacles
and then i think i should have found
the truth
and i think harry said his mother
 that if you follow such a prudent course
in judging extraordinary assertions you
will never be the dupe wonders or undertakers
whenever either you
feel inclined to believe in a wonder without
proof pray remember the barnacle
goose and the goosetree
so long as luc had any ingenious contrivances
to show harry in her shells or
any curious anecdotes to tell him the
modes life their inhabitants he
looked and listened and was pleased 
but he ceased to be interested and looked
dull when she told him any their hard
names he however admitted that the
great classes into which shells are divided
are easy to remember and he liked their
names univalves bivalves and mulilvalves
lucy placed before him a snail shell an
oyster shell and a barnacle as examples 
each class he examined the curious construction
 the hinges various shells
vol iii d
but farther he had no curiosity he could
not he said understand the use lucy's
spending so much time in settling to what
order each shell belonged lucy had
much to say in favour the use and advantages
 classification to preserve things
in order in our memory and to assist us
in recollecting them more easily but it
was not a good time to enter upon the
subject nowe because harrys head had
gone back to his boat he had finished
it and he wanted her to come out and
look at it she put aside her shells directly
and followed him
the boat it must be confessed was buta
clumsy affair the few tools that harry
had were in very imperfect order but he
forbore to complain because he had once
heard from lucy a french proverb un
mauvais ouvrier se plaint de ses outils
a bad workman complains his tools
imperfect as the boat was lucy viewed it
with indulgence and when harnessed to it
she towed it along respectfully and with
the greatest circumspection often looking
back to see that she did not upset or strand
it by pulling it against the bank harry
however remonstrated against her looking
back which he observed was out character
for a horse he told her that she
should go steadily on with her head down
and that he would take care ail the rest
and guide and govern horse and boat
the boat was on the upper branch the
canal and harry as lockman shut the
lower gate so that the lock might fill
but the lock did not fill the water indeed
rose a few inches but gushed outwith
sad velocity between the gate posts
and the sides the lock harry stood
calmly contemplating this disappointment
and considering how he could make good
the defect when lucy who observed that
the water was actually subsiding instead
 rising said
indeed harry you need not stand
there looking at your posts for all the
water that was in the lock has run out 
i think it has found some other channel
true replied harry we must stop
d 
 lia
up our useful dam once more and then we
shall discover the fault no knowledge
like that we gain by experience
the dam was soon stopped and when
the lock was nearly dry harry perceived
that the pressure the water when it had
begun to rise had torn away the loose
earth under the gate and escaped almost
as freely as if there had been no gate
after due deliberation on the best means
 obviating this unforeseen evil he resolved
to fix a sill in the bottom the
lock from post to post so that the gate
should shut tightly against it
lucy said he one those old
posts which i so awkwardly spoiled will
now be the greatest service
two days were occupied in this undertaking
the sill was at last securely pegged
down to the ground and for fear a
similar misfortune with the upper gate he
laid a sill to it also to prevent the
weight water from undermining these
sills he paved the bottom the whole
lock and a small portion the canal with
large flat stones and the intervals between
the gateposts and the lock sides he
puddled with great care another happy
thought occurred to him he had felt the
difficulty opening the gates when the
water was bearing against them and he
now provided means for letting it off gradually
by boring two round holes in each
gate into which he fitted plugs in imitation
 the sluices in the real lock
a satisfactory trial was made their
work and having ascertained that all was
right harry ran home and requested his
father to come and see his boat ooino
through the lock his father came and
first it was to go down the stream when
it came within proper distance the lock
the lower gate was closed and the sluices
 the upper gate were opened by harry
with due ceremony and with proper apologies
for not having double gates the
lock was now brim full to the level the
stream through which the boat had passed
the boat entered the gate behind it was
shut harry opened the sluice the
lower gate and by happy degrees the boat
sank as the water flowed out till it came
down to the level the lower branch 
the canal then the lower lockgate was
opened and out was drawn the boat safely
and happily
just as well said lucy as it was
managed in the real lock on the real
canal
say on the great lock on the great
canal said harry for this is a real
lock is it not father though it is
small
to reward him for his perseverance
his father promised harry to provide him
with the tools necessary for the better
finishing his boat he showed him the
principal faults in its shape and explained
to him that the middle part a boat or
ship is made broad ov full in proportion to
the kind cargo it is intended to carry 
that the foremost or bow is rounded off
to a sharp edge called the stem or cutwater
in order to lessen the resistance in moving 
and that the stern is made very narrow
under water to allow the full impulse 
the water to strike the rudder
soon afterwards his father took harry
with him to see a boat which was building
at some miles distance from rupert cottage
there he learned how the ribs a boat
are put together and fastened to the keel
so as to make them as strong and as light
as possible harry told lucy when he
returned that the framework a boat
before the boards are put in looked like the
skeleton the dead horse which they had
often seen in a rove near their father's
house he told her that he had heard the
boatmaker and his father talking about
ship building and some great improvements
that had been lately made
harry could not understand much what
they said because he had never seen the
inside a ship besides the boatbuilder
talked in workman's lanoruasre using a
number terms that were familiar to
shipwrights but not to him and taking it
for granted that every body must know
what he was talking 
 picked out however some things
that interested me said harry particularly
some that concern the steamvessels
these improvements in shipbuilding
have been great use to them
people have learned how to put the timbers
together in such a manner as to make
vessels much stronger than they were formerly
 so that now they can bear the
straining and wo j king the steamengine
i heard the man say that unless they had
been so strengthened engines such
great power could not have been used 
in short they could not have made the
steam vessels carry so much or go so fast
or so safely as they do now
 that is good for the steam vessels
said lucy and for all who go in them 
and some time or other perhaps i shall
go in one myself but harry you said
there were other things you heard which
interested you what were they
oh i heard one very ingenious
and useful invention cried harry for
taking down easily and quickly the upper
masts topmasts a they call them 
ships
upper masts topmasts repeated
lucy i do not understand what you
mean i thought the mast a ship was
all in one a great thick straight upright
pole like the stem a tree
but it is not all in one piece said
harry there is a piece put on at the
upper part the lowest mast to which
sails are hung which are called topsails 
and that piece is called the topmast it
is often great consequence for sailors to
be able to take down and put up the topmasts
quickly as my father explained tome
sometimes a topmast is broken by
a high wind or a sudden squall and till
they can replace the broken mast you
know they cannot make use the sail
that belongs to it perhaps at that moment
the ship may be running away from
an enemy or perhaps trying to escape
from some rocky shore on which they are
afraid being wrecked
then to be sure the sailors must be in
d 
a great imrry said lucy to get down
the broken mast directly
but they could not do it directly in
the old way said harry it required a
great many men pulling and hauling and
a great deal time an hour at least
even if there were plenty men and
sometimes there are few men and then
it takes a longer time two hours very
likely now by this new invention they
say it can be done by one man or two
men at the most and in five minutes or
less
and how is this done said lucy
 will you tell me the old way first and
then the new way if you can make me
understand them
i do not understand them myself yet
said harr but i shall soon know more
about the matter i hope my father is to
go next week to see a friend his who
lives near plymouth and there is a great
dockyard at plymouth and a number 
ships there and amongst them there is
one that has this new invention
but are you to see it my dear harry
said lucy
 yes my father says he will take me
with him said harry is not that
good 
very good and next week too and
you will tell me all about it harry when
you come back and i hope you will see a
man war and that you will describe
that to me too said lucy
next week arrived and harry's father
took him to plymouth and to the dockyard
on his return he told lucy that
he had seen and heard so much that he
did not know where to begin his description
or what to tell her first
first tell me about the man war
said lucy if you saw one
 i saw many said harry and i went
on board one and all over it but it is
impossible to give you any idea it
harry however attempted to give her
an idea its magnificent size the height
 the masts the spread the sails the
intricate rigging the coils ropes on the
deck and the vast thickness the cables
which were to draw up the huge ponderous
anchor then he described the
accommodations and all the conveniences
for jiving in this floating wooden town
it was more like a town than a house he
said as it was such an extent and
contained so many inhabitants several
hundred men and all their provisions and
all they must want for living months perhaps
years at sea he described how the
sailors hammocks were slung and how
they were aired every day on the deck
then he described the captain's cabin a
large handsome room with a sofa and
writing table and a bookcase and ail the
comforts and luxuries life but principally
harris expatiated on the manner in
which the arms were arranged in the gunroom
in star shapes and curious forms
which at first he thought was merely for
ornament but he learned that they were
all so placed in order that they might take
ei
up the least possible room and that they
might be found easily in time need
and in the storerooms he observed that
every thing great and small down to the
least bolt screw or nail had its own
place the use order was seen thereto
the greatest perfection
 in time action as they call it said
harry meaning in time battle and
in a storm when the safety the vessel
and the lives the men all depend on
their being able to find what they want ina
moment consider my dear lucy what
advantage it must be to have them all in
order but i cannot give you a right
idea it you must see it lucy and i
hope you will some time
and i hope then you will be with
me said lucy
i hope so said harry so now i
will tell you about the jiciy
what is di jicir said lucy
a thick iron bolt said harry which
is run through a hole in the heel or lower
 the topmast when the topmast is
up in its place the ends the fid rest
upon two strong bars wood which are
fixed to the head or upper the
great lower mast the topmast stands
up between these bars and the fid you
perceive lucy supports its whole weight
as well as that all the sails and yards
which are hung on it and besides all
this weight there are several thick ropes
from the head the topmast which are
called shrouds and which are fastened
down very tight in order to steady it
now you must understand next continued
harry that when the topmast is
up it cannot be taken down without first
taking out this fid
but what a very odd namewis said
lucy
fiddlefaddle said harry never
mind that one name is as good as another
when you are used to it now let
me explain the thing itself before the fid
can be pulled out the whole weight the
topmast must be lifted up off it and
before this can be done all the ropes
which steady it on each side must be
loosened to lift this great weight there
must be great pulling and hauling and
altogether it is a long difficult job and
many men must work hard at it and fora
long time but now without loosening
rope and with only one or two men
they get out the new lever fid in a fewminutes

 how very nice cried lucy
 nice repeated harry what a word
when talking the masts a great ship
 one word is as good as another when
you are used to it as you said about fid
replied lucy laughing but what is the
contrivance you have not told me that 
can i understand it
 yes if you understand the general
principle the use the lever are you
clear that
 i believe i am said lucy i know
what you have told me and shown me
that the greater the space your hand passes
through in moving the long a lever
the more weight you can move at the short
 it
very well you might have put it in
other words but i believe you understand
something about it said harry now
for the view lever bids instead one
great bolt run through the mast there are
two strong levers one at each side it
and they are fixed on the same bars which
supported the ends the common old fid
when the topmast is up in its place the
short arm each lever goes a little way
into the hole in its heel and the long armis
securely fastened by a small pin to a
frame wood when it is to be lowered
the little fastening pins are taken out the
levers immediately tilt up and down comes
the topmast but not with the sudden and
dangerous jerk you might suppose because
there are ropes from the long arms the
levers by which the sailors manage the
affair as gently as they like
so then said lucy you mean that
these two little pins from being applied
at the ends the long arms the levers
have power to balance the whole weight 
the great topmast and all its ropes and
sails and other things that are supported
on the short arms how wonderful 
there is the wonderful power the
lever lucy said harry
 then you could lift any weight in the
world with a lever if you had but one long
enough and strong enough said lucy
if i had space and time enough and
something to stand upon said harry i
am glad lucy you are so much struck by
the use this wonderful powder for as
my father said to me when we were talking
about the fid on our return home it
does not much signify whether we know
the best way lowering the topmast 
a ship but the principle the lever it
is great consequence that we should
understand because in some way or other
little or great we have to use it every day
in the most common things
 yes said lucy for instance at this
moment when i am going to stir the fire
i could not without the help this lever
in my hand commonly called the poker
raise up this great heavy coal which now
i lift so easily look putting the point
 my pokerlever under it and resting
my lever on the bar 
yes the bar is your fulcrum said
harry
and by pulling down the other 
the poker i gain all the power as you call
it this long lever
 tell me exactly what advantage you
think you gain said harry tell me
how you would measure it
i gain the advantage the whole
length the poker said lucy
 not the whole length the poker
said harry look where it rests on the
bar from that bar to the point under the
coal is what we may call the short arm 
your lever and from the place where it
rests on the bar to your hand is the long
arm your lever now if you were to
measure those two lengths and find how
many times longer the one is than the
other you would tell exactly the advantage
you gain in this case and in every
possible case in which a lever is used
ha the proportion between the long
and the short the lever said lucy
 is the advantage gained now i know
exactly oh i hope i shall remember
this
but lucy is not this leverfid a very
simple invention 
beautifully simple said lucy i
only wonder that it was never found out
before
that is the wonder always when any
good contrivance is made said harry
but now i will tell you another wonder 
that this was not found out by any sailor
or captain or admiral or any seaman 
any kind but by a landsman as the captain
said to papa and what is more he
belongs to a profession quite away from
the sea he is a lawyer
 a lawyer lucy exclaimed
and what do you think made him a
lawyer said harry
i suppose studying the law said lucy
and as they say being called to the bar
but said harry i meant to ask
what do you think first turned his mind to
the law or determined him to become a
lawyer my dear it is a foolish question
 mine because you cannot guess 
so i will tell you it was his love mechanics

 how could that be said lucy
 i will tell you said harry i heard
the whole story for a gentleman a friend
 his who had known him from a boy
and as well as he knows himself was
telling it on shipboard to my father this
is what i wanted to come to all the time i
was telling you about the lid the inventor
who has made such a useful invention
which will probably save many ships
and the lives all that are in them has
often said to his friends that he owes all
his success in life to his early love 
mechanics when he came home from
school he used to employ himself in doing
all the little mechanical jobs that were
wanting about the house he used to mend
the locks for instance then in taking a
lock to pieces he saw how it was made
and by degrees learning the use tools 
he made many things which he could not
afford to buy when he was a boy
what sorts things did he make
said lucy
i do not know all i only heard a
desk and a little cabinet i think then
he took to pieces an old watch his
father's and learned how to put it together
again when he left school he
lived two years at home with his father
and sometimes he employed himself in
drawing maps in attempting to draw
portions very large circles on his
maps he found great difficulty for want
 right instruments and he invented and
made for himself an instrument by the
help which he could as his friend described
it to my father draw these small
portions circles without the necessity
 using compasses or finding a centre
i wish you had invented that harry
said lucy
i exclaimed harry but do you
know he was only eighteen at that time 
well he was one day using his instrument
and not at all aware that it was anything
but a help to himself when a gentleman
came into his father's study where he
was drawing this gentleman was charmed
with the invention and advised him to offer
it for sale to some optician or some maker
 mathematical instruments he determined
to follow this advice and set about
directly and made one neatly in brass
and carried it to london to an optician
who approved it and gave him for it
an air pump and an electrical apparatus
and some other instruments 
delightful cried lucy and what
did he do next 
he improved his own little instrument
by adding a scale to it then other people
used it and found it answered and at last
what do you think he had a silver medal
voted and presented to him by the society
 arts when he was yet a boy as his
friend said not out his teens
 a silver medal from the society 
arts i know the look it said lucy
i saw one that was given to a friend 
papa's i remember seeing it in its little
crimson case lined with satin but what
an honour for a boy 
 he did not stop there said harry
he went on 
 i know to the fid cried lucy
 stay a bit said harry we are not
come to the fid yet during those two
years he lived in a lonely place in south
wales and his attention happened to be
turned to the shoeing horses some
horse his father's was ill shod i suppose
and he considered how to prevent
horses feet from being cramped and hurt
by their shoes he invented an elastic
horse shoe
 better and better said lucy
stay a bit said harry it was
tried upon the horses some regiment 
horse guards and it did not do
 what a pity that must have vexed
him very much said lucy
not at all said harry i should
think not a man cannot expect always
to succeed in every thing much less a boy
but though the horseshoe did not succeed
yet it led to the most important event
 his life
how tell me that said lucy i
am always glad in lives when we come to
those words
tell me first said harry do you
know what is meant by taking out a patent

 not very well said lucy
not very well but do you know at
all do you know what a patent is
 not exactly said lucy but i have
read about patents and monopolies in the
english history long ago to mamma in the
reign king james or king 
 never mind about the kings or their
reigns said harry ego on to the thing
if you know it
 i know that the kings england
were blamed said lucy for granting
these monopolies and patents
but what were they said harry
i believe they were permissions
granted to particular people to sell particular
things and orders that none should
sell those things but themselves said
lucy
i did not think you knew so much
about it said harry how came you to
know that 
the way i know most things that i
do know said lucy mamma explained
it to me when i was reading to her
 but those were some them unjust
patents and mamma explained how and
why i dare say said harry as my father
did to me yesterday b ut there are patents
in these days which i think are very
just laws which by granting some writing
called a patent secures to whoever makes
any new useful mention the right to sell
vol iii e
it to others and to have all the credit and
profit it for a certain number years
as a reward for their ingenuity
 very fair said lucy
 this gentleman wanted to have a
patent for his horseshoe continued harry
and before he could obtain it it is necessary
they say to make out in a sort 
law paper a description the invention
in lawyer's words he went to a great
lawyer to do this for him but the great
lawyer was no mechanic and he did not
understand and could not describe the
thing at all he did the law words
rightly but the mechanic himself was
obliged to rite the description so borrowing
the law terms from his lawyer he
put the description in himself and he did
it well and it was thought by others to be
well done now he found that some
lawyers are paid a great deal money
for drawing out these patent descriptions 
specifications is the word which harry did not
know
or whatever they call them this first
put it into his head that if he knew as
much law as was necessary for this he
could do the whole himself and earn his
bread by doing it for other people this
determined him to learn law and he
did so you see as i told you his love
 mechanics first made a lawyer 
him he acquired all the knowledge requisite
 and now as his friend said he
is unrivalled in england in that particular
employment but now i must tell
you another curious circumstance continued
harry to show you how after he
was a lawyer he was brought back to
mechanics again it happened that he
was employed as an advocate in some
cause where there was a dispute about
the loss a cargo or the goods onboard
a merchant ship which had been
wrecked he was to examine the captain
 the ship in the court justice to find
out whether he had or had not done all
that was possible to save the ship and the
cargo in this examination he asked the
e
captain some question about the loweringthe
topmasts the captain laughed at
him for his question whatever it was because
it showed that he did not understand
rightly how the topmasts were to be got
down the captain explained this to
him and showed him the difficulties and
i suppose told him all about the fid the
common old fid i mean he perceived
what an inconvenient contrivance it was
and that very evening after the trial by
considering how a fid could be better managed
he invented the leverfid his
friend said that when he went to his
supper he cut out the shape his leverfid
in a bit cheese and thinking that
it would answer its purpose he could not
go to rest till he had made a nice little
model in box wood he made model after
model till he was satisfied then how to
get it into use was the next difficulty
the gentleman said a great deal about
the lords the admiralty that i did
not understand but in short his contrivance
was approved by them and they

ordered that all the assistance he wanted
should be given to him for trying it in
some one ship the maidstone frigate
i remember that was the name the ship
in which it was tried and it succeeded
perfectly the first time the ship went
out to sea with it the topmast was to betaken
down and this was done so easily
and quickly that all felt the use and excellence
 the invention and the officers
 the navy have given it their decided
approbation and it has been brought into
use in a great many ships
how happy the man who made this
invention must be added harry
 and his sisters and his father and
mother said lucy how glad they must
be to see it succeed so well and to know
how useful it is
an invention useful to all the british
navy what a grand thing said harry
after pausing and considering for sometime
harry added
yet he was once a boy like me and
trying little mechanical experiments my
dear lucy i heard his friend telling my
father something which made a great
impression upon me the more so because
he was not thinking me or that it
could do me any good to hear it when he
said it
 what did he say asked lucy eagerly

that this gentleman attributes all his
success in life to his having early acquired
a taste for mechanics and to the habit 
trying to invent and to improve his early
inventions in those two years which he
employed so well at home when he came
from school and before he was fit for any
profession a time which they say many
boys waste in idleness
i am sure you never will harry said
lucy
no after hearing this i think it
would be impossible i should said harry
 this has raised my ambition i assure
you but i must go on as he did learning
by degrees and be content with doing
little things first
 what will you do next said lucy
 now you have finished your boat and
your lock
 i have a plan said hairy you
shall know it tomorrow
harry's new project was to build a bridge
over a little mountain stream which had
often stopped his mother in her walks
he had already laid a board across from
bank to bank and had fixed it steadily
but upon this two people could not walk
abreast nor could the ass cart pass this
way it was necessary to take it by another
road a quarter a mile round that a
bridge at this place would be a public and
private benefit seemed evident and harry
was ambitious building a real substantial
arched bridge which should last he
would not say for ever but as long as man
could reasonably expect a bridge to last
this project was heartily approved by his
prime counsellor lucy before whose quick
anticipating eyes the arch instantly rose
complete
and when it is built cried she it
shall be called harrys bridge i or afi
another's bridge which shall we call it
harry
let us build it first said harry and
we may easily find a name for it afterwards
come with me to the place lucy
when they reached the spot hairy bid
her guess what the distance was from bank
to bank she guessed about a yard and a
half
a yard and a half such a woman's
measure that is four feet six said
harry
such a man's measure six what lucy
might have said had she been disposed to
retort criticism but that was far ar from
her disposition she knew what he meant
and that was all she thought 
four feet six inches said she is
it more or less 
 you are within half a foot it my
dear said harry my arch must be a
five feet span i mean that the width
across from abutment to abutment from
foundation stone to foundation stone on the
opposite sides must be five feet but
there is my father cried harry on the
sands below at the very place where i
want him to be i will show him my
plan directly
down the hill ran he to the sea shore
and down ran lucy after him with equal
speed their father was stopped short
and the bridge project started and his consent
assistance and advice anxiously requested
lucy thought his first look was
not favourable he shook his head and
answered that he feared harry would find
it beyond his skill or present knowledge
to construct an arch
harry stood quite still and silent for a
minute or two then collecting himself he
deliberately answered
 i remember father your showing me
long ago an arch which you made for me
 a thin lath between heavy weiojits
e
half hundred weights from the qreat scales
which were placed at each for buttmeets
then i pressed on the top the
arch and felt how strong it was it bore all
tny weight i recollect this i think
continued he in a very modest but firm
tone made me understand the oreat
principle the arch which as you told meat
the time depends on the buttments being
secure and i will take care and
make the abutments my bridge strong
enouoh
you will do well hany and you remember
well and understand one oreat
principle on which the security an arch
depends but there is much more to be
known and considered however my
dear boy try and build your bridge you
will lean best from your own experience
you may amuse and instruct yourself at
the same time tell me what assistance
you want and i will tell you whether i
can give it to you
thank you father then in the first
place will you come on a few steps that i
may stow you my arch which i have
drawn on the sand and will you give me
your opinion it
lucy ran on before to see it first and
then waited anxiously to hear her father's
opinion she saw surprise in his countenance
the moment he looked at the arch
described on the sand
this is well done harry this will
do said he who showed you how to
describe this arch or how happened it
that you chose this shape more than any
other 
nobody showed me how said harry
 but i took it from the little bridge which
i saw the mason building in that lane
where we went to look at the road mending
i measured the centering as it lay
on the ground when they had done with
it and i drew my arch exactly by that
centering
 what is the centering harry whispered
lucy
 a sort wooden frame on which the
stones the arch are supported while it
is building said harry for you know
they could not hang in the air
his father told harry he thought he had
done wisely to take advantage the experience
 a mason who was used to
build bridges instead going to work
rashly without knowing what he was
about
 but father said harry colouring i
do not think i deserve to be praised for
prudence i was not prudent at all at
least not in the way you think i would
much rather have done it all myself and
drawn my arch my own way and different
from this but i took this curve because
the masons centering will fit it and i
thought you could borrow it for me and
that though you might perhaps allow me
to build the bridge you would not like the
trouble or expense getting boards forme
to make a centering for myself besides
i was not sure that i could make it
all myself
well harry since i cannot admire
your prudence i am the more satisfied
swith
yoiir honesty now what assistance
do you want for your bridge consider
and let me know tomorrow
 i have considered already father
cried harry and if you please i can tell
you all today and this minute stones
in the first place and i know where they
can be had and where they are no use 
in the ruins the old garden wall which
is now rebuilding brick
granted as many them as you
want and can carry said his father
but there are some too heavy for me
said harry will you order the boy and
the ass cart to bring them
his father assented
and will you order for me lime and
sand enough for mortar 
if you can tell me how much each
you want harry
he could for he had inquired from the
mason how much had been used in building
the bridge the same size and he
named the quantities then he had farther
to ask for a bucket a hod a trowel
and a plumbline and the mason's centering
and the mason or the mason's manif
he could be had for three days to assist
him in lifting and placing the heavy
stones
lucy held her breath with anxiety
while harry uttered all these requests
fearful that so many at once could not be
granted but her father was pleased by
harry's making them all at once and by
his having so well considered what was
necessary for his undertaking bucket
hod trowel plumbline and centering all
were granted but there was a doubt with
respect to the mason or the mason's man
 i am willing to give you all necessary
assistance hands but not head harry
i cannot let you have the mason but i
will lend you for three days the mason's
man who if i mistake not has hands but
no head
i am glad it father cried harry 
 i mean so much the better for me because
if he had ever so good a head it
would be in my way it would hinder me
from using my own then i should not
learn as you said from my own experience
i would rather do all that i possibly
can my bridge for myself i am sorry
the arch is not my own but that could not
be helped you know father on account 
the centering
 however just the curve the arch
does not much signify i suppose said
lucy one shape one curve an arch
is much the same or as good as another
though not so pretty perhaps
there you are quite mistaken lucy
said her father one curve on the contrary
may be as pretty but not as good as
another not as capable sustaining weight
not as durable there is a great deal 
difference between one curve and another
for a bridge as harry when he has more
knowledge science will be able to explain
to you
harry again expressed his regret that
he had this arch laid out ready to his hand
in short said he now the most
difficult the most scientific part is done
and i have only to do the easy masonwork
part which any body can do without
making any mistakes or requiring any ingenuity

 there is no danger harry your not
finding sufficient difficulty before you have
done there is room enough left i promise
you to make mistakes and to exercise
as much ingenuity as you possess
harry brightened up again on hearing
this and so did lucy
 the more difficulty the more glory
said she
as soon as all was provided which was
not quite so speedily as lucy wished
harry set to work first he cleared and
levelled a place on the bank on each side
for his foundations then while the
heavy stones were drawing up by the ass
he was busy very busy making mortar
with the assistance the man without a
head the great foundation stones were
then placed harry taking particular care
to choose the most solid weighty stones
and to have them laid level and firm
then came the wooden frame work that
was to support the mason work while they
were building the arch the centering
as lucy knew that it was called and she
would have liked to have examined it
but she would not interrupt harry at this
moment for he was eager to have it put
up and to get on with the work therefore
she stood by without interrupting the
operations by question or remark the
centering was hoisted up and fixed by
harry and the headless man whose
hands and length arms were it must be
acknowledged manifest use upon this
occasion the wooden arch was raised
to the height at which the stone arch was
to be built upon it and it was supported at
each side by upright props between these
and the wooden frame wedges were put
in and harry busy as he was stopped to
explain to lucy that these wedges were to
be knocked out when the bridge was completed
and that the wooden arch being
removed would as it was to be hoped
leave the stone one standing firm
then the building the arch began
we cannot follow the work stone by stone
as lucy did with untired sisterly sympathy
not only stone by stone as each was
placed but as they were many a time displaced
and tried over and over again before
they fitted to lucy's surprise and
mortification she observed that even the
stupid mason's man by long practice could
judge better which stones would best fit
and how they would best go into certain
places than harry could with all his
quickness eye and sense this was
most apparent the first and second days on
the third after even this little practice
harry found his eye and hand improving
and his sense began to get the better his
awkwardness at his new trade after
this third day's long and hard and hot
labour the arch rose from each side till it
nearly met at top and wanted only the
putting in the last stone the key stone
to complete the work harry showed
lucy that when this was put in all the
parts the arch were pressed together
and that none could give way without displacing
the others each part tended to
support each and to hinder any stone from
being pressed upwards or downwards
more than another
 so it is impossible it should comedown
as long as it is an arch said lucy
 as long as it is an arch impossible
said harry all we have to desire is
that it should never alter from this shape
and i do not see how it can continued
he looking at it my abutments are so
secure there is no danger their giving
way or being thrust out by any weight
that will go over the bridge
now then said lucy you will
take away all this wooden underbridge
and these props and you are to knock out
the wedges that you may take down the
centering now the bridge is finished
not yet said harry we must leave
it some time for the stones to settle and
the mortar to dry a little
lucy's impatience yielded to her brother's
prudence but he was very eager
himself for the taking down the centering
that trying time at length arrived
an anxious moment even to old experienced
architects veteran bridge builders the
wedges were knocked away the props
fell the centering was lowered and
withdrawn from under the arch and it
stood i harry took breath and pushed
back his hat off his hot forehead lucy
clapped her hands exclaiming
it stands harry's bridge stands it
shall be called harry's bridge 
no my mother's bridge said harry
if you please it was for her i built it
 and i will run and call her to see it
cried lucy
 and i will go for my father said
harry i hope he is not busy
neither father nor mother were to be
found in the house they were outriding
and they staid out till it was so late that
harry and lucy thought it was better not
to ask them to look at the bridge till the
next day their mother had never yet
seen even the plan she was not in the
secret they hoped that she would be
delightfully surprised it was settled that
she should be invited out to look at it
early the next day she was as they
arranged it to be handed over the bridge
by harry to a seat which lucy had prepared
in a recess in the rocks on the opposite
side where she might sit and read
happily
alas who can answer for tomorrow
the next day it rained and the next and
the next poured torrents the rain lasted
without intermission a week a long melancholy
week for in rupert's cottage
they had not the same means amusing
and employing themselves which they
possessed at home they had but few
books and those few belonged chiefly to
their latin or english lessons their
father and mother had been promised the
use the library a friend who lived in
the neighbourhood and upon the faith 
this promise they had brought scarcely
any books with them but their friend

unexpectedly called to town upon business
was unfortunately for them absent
there was no circulating library no 
society in this part the country
there was one advantage to be sure in
possessing but few books these were well
read and many things found in them
which had escaped attention when in the
midst greater variety at last they
were reduced to johnson's dictionary not
the delightful quarto in which there are
quotations from all the best authors in our
language exemplifying the various uses 
each word with the great johnson they
might have happily amused themselves at
night reading those quotations and puzzling
their father and mother by making
them guess the authors this had often
been a favourite resource at home but
now they had the little octavo johnson in
which there are only the meanings and
the derivations the words this
however they made what profit and diversion
they could they picked out
words for each other to explain and compared
their own explanation with definitions
in the dictionary
 now lucy i will give you a woman's
word to darn cried harry let us see
whether you can explain the meaning as
well as it is explained here by a man 
lucy made many attempts her colour
rising at each ineffectual trial and at last
she could not equal the mans definition 
to darn
to mend holes by imitating the texture
 the stuff
lucy had her revenge when they came
to network which is thus described by the
learned doctor 
 any thing reticulated or decorated
at equal distances with interstices between
the intersections
 look for decussate said harry
lucy turned over the leaves and read
 decussate to intersect at acute angles
well that is something like netting
said harry
is it how said lucy
 why you know said harry in a
net each mesh or stitch is intersected is it
not at acute angles
 but it is not intersected said lucy 
for to intersect means to cut in two
does not it and the mesh the net instead
 being cut in two is joined at the
corners is it not very extraordinary that
the man should say the very contrary to
what he means and to the sense the
thing 
 it would be very extraordinary if it
were so said cautious harry but i
think to intersect does not always mean to
cut in two i know in euclid lines are
said to be intersected when they are only
crossed 
on turning to the dictionary harry
found himself supported in his assertion
for there are two verbs to intersect one
is a verb active meaning to cut to divide
each other the second is a verb
neuter and means what i told you said
harry to meet and cross each other 
as in your net the threads do meet and
cross at the angles
 yes said lucy but they must do
more not only cross but be tied and
knotted i wish continued she that
dictionary makers would use easy words
instead words more difficult than those
they are explaining at least when i am as
sleepy as i am now i can look for no
more words so good night dr johnson
i am going to bed
let me put him away for you said
harry poor creature you are fast
asleep
as he went to put johnson in his place
he saw another dictionary by dr ash on
the same shelf and taking it down said he
had a mind before he gave up the search
just to look in this for network
it will do you no good said lucy 
 all the dictionary people since johnson's
time have copied from him mamma told
me so and she told me a droll story
which proves what bungling copies they
vol iii f
sometimes make but i am too sleepy to
recollect it rightly mamma would you
be so good as to tell him about curmudgeon
r
his mother asked him if he knew what
is meant by a curmudgeon
yes a cross selfish miserly person
is not it 
 and can you guess from what the
word is derived harry it is but fair to
tell you that it is a corruption two
french words ill pronounced
 french words said harry then i
have no chance if you had said english
words i might have said two that must
came into my head
oh say them for i am sure they are
odd by your look said lucy wakening
with the hope diversion
 cur munching said harry say it
quickly and it will make curmudgeon
and a cur munching is cross and miserly
if you attempt to take his bone from him
lucy laughed and tried to repeat
cur munching as often and as quickly as
she could to turn it into curmudgeon for
harry and his mother wrote down for
him the derivation as it is given in the
quarto edition johnson's dictionary
curmudgeon n s it is a vitious
manner pronouncing coeur merchants fr
an unknown correspondent
now here is ash's dictionary cried
lucy i will look for it i am quite
awake now mamma but stay first
harry tell us what you think is meant by
 fr an unknown correspondent 
fr means french to be sure said
harry and an unknown correspondent
sent johnson this derivation i suppose
you suppose perfectly rightly said
lucy but now look how dr ash understood
or misunderstood it for want 
knowing the meaning the two french
words here it is
curmudgeon noun sub from the french
coeur unknown merchant correspondent
excellent cried harry laughing
let me see it 
oh mamma can you tell us any more
f 
 such droll mistakes said lucy i
dare say there are a great many more if
one could but find them and i should like
to make a list them all
to shame the poor dictionarymakers
said harry but that would be very
ungrateful you after all lucy for
consider how often dictionaries have
helped us when we were in difficulties
and how much amusement we have had
from johnson's quotations
in the great johnson oh i acknowledged
that at first said lucy and
you forget this curmudgeon mistake was
not your dear great or little johnson's so
i am not ungrateful
 but you know you triumphed over
him when you had him caught in your
network said harry
because his hard words said
lucy
lucy said her father did you ever
hear the fable apollo and the critic
no papa pray tell it to me said
lucy i love fables
are you awake enough to hear and
understand it said her father
yes papa perfectly wide awake 
curmudgeon and the munching cur have
wakened me completely
there was a famous critic who read
a famous poem for the express purpose 
finding out all its faults and when he had
found them and made a list them he
carried his list and his notes to apollo
apollo ordered that a bushel the finest
wheat that had ever grown on mount parnassus
should be brought and he ordered
that it should be winnowed with the utmost
care and when all the corn was separated
from the chaff apollo presented the chais
to the critic for his reward and banished
him for ever from parnassus
 thank you papa said lucy i
understand the moral that fable very
well and i think i hall better banish myself
to bed now good night harry i
hope it will be a fine day tomorrow
it was a fine day all the dark clouds
had disappeared and left the sky clear
blue the sandy soil had dried so quickly
that harry and lucy flattered themselves
that their mother would walk out this morning
and they ran to prepare her seat beyond
the bridge
but oh disappointment extreme oh 
melancholy sight the bridge was no
more nothing remained the arch but
some fragments over which the waters
were rushing the mountain stream
which had been swelled by the rains to a
torrent had not yet sunk to its natural
quiet state but was dashing down the
rock with deafening noise
harry stood motionless looking at it
i do not hear you my dear said he
as lucy twitched his arm to obtain an
answer what do you say 
come a little further away from this
noise said lucy i say that i am exceedingly
sorry for you harry
thank you said harry so am i
sorry for myself but sorrow will do no
good
how could it happen when you took
such care about the abutments asked
lucy
i did not take care enough said
harry that much is clear but it is not
clear to me how it all happened or why 
the water covers every thing now it
runs you see over the banks beyond my
foundations we must have patience
oh how hard it is to have patience
sometimes said lucy with a deep sigh
harry could not forbear echoing her
sigh though he passed it off with a hem
immediately thinking it was not manly
he was determined to bear his disappointment
like a man but he could not help
feeling it
in the evening when the waters had
subsided they revisited the place their
misfortune while harry surveyed the
ruins below and examined into the cause
 the disaster lucy stood on the bank
looking alternately at his countenance
and at the fragments the fallen bridge
in all the respectful silence sympathy
i see now how it happened said
harry though i made my abutments
strong enough i did not go down to the
solid rock for my foundations i bush them
on the bank which i thought at the time
was firm enough
so did i i am sure said lucy it
was as firm and hard as the ground i am
now standing upon
but it was all sandy soil as you can
see here where it has been broken away
said harry and i perceive exactly how
it happened when the rain swelled that
mountain torrent the water came higher
under my arch than i ever expected
who could have expected it said
lucy
 there was not room for it to pass underneath
continued harry and therefore
it pressed against the sides the arch
and rose up over the banks then the
earth and sand were loosened the foundations
were undermined the stones were
swept away and then down fell our arch
 poor arch poor harry said lucy
that horrible mountain torrent how
violent it was who could have thought it
who had only seen it running gently in its
peaceable way but it is all over we
can never have a bridge here we must
give it up
 give it up because i have made one
mistake said harr and when i seethe
cause it oh no if my father will
but let me try again and here he is and
i will ask him cried harry
his father who had heard his misfortune
was coming to condole with him
and to inquire how it had happened
harry showed him you were quite
right father said he in foreseeing
that i should find room enouoi to make
mistakes and so i have you see but
this was my first attempt and now i have
learnt something by experience will ou
be so kind as to let me try again and let
me have the assistance the mason's
man for three days more 
three days more a labourer's work at
two shillings a day some people would
consider this a oreat deal too much to five
f 
to the mother s bridge or rather to the
sons bridge but harry's kind father did
not think so he was pleased to find that
his son was not discouraged by disappointment
and that he had immediately
set about to discover the cause his
failure and he told harry that he should
have the mason's man for three days to
make a second trial upon the same conditions
as before
 and will you help me father to find a
better place for my foundations will you
father 
 no harry do it all yourself
he would give no opinion or advice he
pursued his walk to the wood and harry
was left to determine his plans after
much careful deliberation he decided on
a place a little higher up the stream where
the foundations his abutments would
stand upon the solid rock so that no treacherous
sand or loose earth should be
washed away by the torrent and again expose
them to be undermined
after settling this point and measuring
the span and other dimensions he repaired
to the seashore to draw the plan
and elevation his second bridge the
stream being rather wider and the
banks much higher in the new situation
that he had chosen it was clear that the
arch could not be the same as the first 
and at this he seemed to rejoice and so
did lucy for now it would be all his
own he described arches various
curves on the sands but he had no exact
principle or rule to guide him in what he
was about he had a general notion that
the strength his bridge must depend in
some degree on the curve or the proportion
between its span and height and that
the weight and pressure it was to bear on
its different parts should be calculated
but how to accomplish all this or how to
choose the best curve for the situation he
did not know he could be guided only
by his eye by a sort feeling proportion
 by guess in short lucy assisted
lii with her feelings and taste as to which
was the prettiest
 my dear harry cried she that
high pointed arch is very ugly it will
never do your first bridge was a much
prettier curve
it must be this height my dear said
harry because my foundations are to be
upon the rock which is far below the
bank the top my bridge will be
but a little above the level the path on
each side and when the bridge is built
i shall fill np the space between the side
and the banks with stones and earth and
then level the road over it from the path
on each side he drew the slope for her
and she was satisfied
but now harry had to consider the serious
affair a centering for his new arch
his father had said that if he could make
one for himself he might do so and
that he would supply him with boards if
he could tell him exactly what he wanted
harry fortunately knew what he wanted 
but he was ashamed when he came to
write down all that would be necessary
to see how much it was
twelve thin boards each four feet
long and nine inches wide and three
boards six feet long which are each to
be slit into two parts for ties and six
uprights any pieces rough wood 
and nails one hundred and a half
his father seemed satisfied with these
distinct orders and told him that he should
have all that he required next morning
the carpenter and his boy arrived bearing
the wishedfor boards on their shoulders
the moment harry obtained possession 
them to work he went to make his centering
flat on the ground he laid four 
his four feet boards two forming each side
 the pointed arch and bringing their
upper edges as nearly as he could bring
straight lines to something like the curves
which he had marked upon the ground
the ends the boards were lapped over
where they joined and the corners were
left projecting on the outside
 it is not in the least like an arch yet
said lucy
 have patience and you shall see said
harry
with all the decision a carpenter who
knows what he is about harry bored holes
for his nails and nailed the pieces together
as they lay three nails in each side
joint and four at the top then he nailed
one slip one the six feet long boards
across his wooden arch at bottom to hold
it together and another piece half way upto
brace and strengthen it then he
sawed ois the jutting corners the boards
which had been left sticking out and
chiselled and planed away parts the
outer edges to bring them to the curves
he wanted three such frames or wooden
arches he made in the same manner and
exactly the same size
then having determined on the proper
breadth for his intended bridge and having
marked it on the ground by two parallel
lines and drawn another midway between
them he placed the frames erect on their
lower edge and exactly upon the three
ill
lines with ready lucy's assistance and
some broken branches he secured them
steady and upright and then proceeded
to roof them over with narrow slips 
wood bits paling which he had prepared
for this purpose these he nailed
across the top all the three arches
leaving intervals between the breadth
 each slip so that when the whole was
done lucy said that it looked something
like the model the roof a house
this day's work completed the centering
props wedges and all were prepared
for putting it up and going on with
the masonry there was no hindrance
from the stream the little rivulet now
sunk to insignificance ran so quietly down
its pebbly bed that lucy could scarcely
believe it to be the same which had roared
so loud and foamed so high and had done
such mischief in its fury
the masonwork harry's second
bridge went on more rapidly than that his
first his eye and hand having become more
expert in the builder's art he worked
and wondered at the work he made or
rather lucy wondered at it for him
how one improves by practice cried
she as she stood by looking on while the
arch was closing the key stone was in
before they left off work on the fourth day
and the triumphant finishing blow the
mallet given
but the work the arch only was
finished much remained to be done to
close up the hollow on each side the
bridge between it and the banks this
was to be filled in with stones and earth
down to the rocky foundation a heavy
job and heavily they felt it the three
days allowed them help from the headless
man or as lucy now in gratitude for
his services called him the handy man
were passed they averse left to themselves
and obliged to bring the stones and
the earth from a distance many yards
and up a height the handy man had
carried his barrow ofi and they had
only one wheelbarrow and a basket if
basket it could be called which was so
infirm that it let through continual
scribbling sand lucy however
mended this with a plaiting sea weed
and stuffings moss and refrained as
harry was busy from saying something
she could have said about the sieve the
dana'ides
when at last both gulfs were filled up
and well trampled and harry was spreading
gravel on the road over the bridge
lucy had time to rest for they had but
one shovel and while he shovelled away
she sat on a large mossy stone amusing
herself with observing a community 
ants whose dwellings had been disturbed
by the new works these emigrants were
toiling on in search new habitations
each with his white load in his forceps all
following the leader through the moss
and up the stone to them a rock perilous
height and scarcely practicable
ascent once when a wayworn ant had
just reached the summit a white polished
treacherous pebble intervened he raised
one half his body so as to be almost
perpendicular and wabbling about his
little head from side to side deliberated
which way he could go or whether he
could go at all on he went straight up
the slippery hill on the pinnacle the
white pebble another pinnacle arose 
sparkling mica whose projecting points
proved fatal striving to reach the first
 these he lost his balance he fell head
over heels if ants have heels and at the
bottom the hill lay on his back on the
sand for a moment helpless but the
next instant being an ant spirit ne
righted himself resumed his load and his
labour up the hill labour in vain this
time a treacherous rush more treacherous
than the pebble a springy green rush or
branch sedge hanging from above
tempted him to trust himself on its smooth
green side but
the wind fell a blowing and set it a going
and gave our dear joy a most terrible toss

lucy held out a helping finger and
raising him up placed him safely at once
upon the very pinnacle he had been so
long labouring to attain away he ran
as she hoped perfectly happy she was
particularly pleased with him for this 
because she had sometimes helped up ants
who had not seemed in the least obliged
to her for her assistance nor at all happier
for it but on the contrary by turning
back directly or not going the way she
wished had provokingly given her to understand
that they would rather have been
without her interference in spite however
 these incivilities and the little disgusts
they had at the moment excited her love for
the species had continued it had indd
commenced happily in early childhood at
the time when she and harry used to
watch them making their causeway and
by reading the travelled ant in
evenings at home it increased when
she read with her mother that entertaining
paper in the guardian well known to
young and old and it had been late renewed
with fresh interest by some curious
anecdotes which her mother had told her
from ruler's history the industrious
race
harry said she taking up her basket
again i feel quite rested i have
been very happy looking at these ants i
am sure this has rested me better than if i
had been the whole time yawning and
thinking nothing at all
pray can any body think nothing
at all said harry 
let every body answer for themselves
said lucy i think that i have
sometimes thought nothing at all but i
am not sure yes indeed i remember
saying to myself now i am thinking 
nothing 
but then my dear lucy said harry
your own very words prove you were not
thinking nothing
 how so said lucy
 you were thinking that you were
thinking nothing at all said harry
 i do not understand said lucy is
not that nonsense harry
 oh no my dear it is metaphysics
said harry
and what do you mean by metaphysics
my dear said lucy
it comes from two greek words said
harry
but i do not ask you where it comes
from said lucy but what you mean
by it
i said harry a little puzzled i
mean i am not sure i believe metaphysics
is the knowledge our oti
minds
but if we do not know our own
minds said lucy what is it the
knowledge will you tell me harry 
 i cannot tell you more said harry
i will look for metaphysics in the dictionary
when we have time but now let
us on with our bridge
ove however hairy
you may laugh but i assure you as i
stooped down to look at one them he
put up his head and looked at me and
see there is another coiling his tail
how curious i do not touch them nor
move any thing that touches them here
are my hands not even near their drawer
so that i cannot have loosed any springthat
could set them in motion but perhaps
opening the drawer did it
no but that is not a bad guess said
sir rupert
 think again lucy said hany and
you will find it out
 first let me look at this conjurer said
lucy pointing to a painted figure a
conjurer with a long beard and cap and
wand which she saw glimpses under
the serpents at the bottom the drawer 
 may i have him out sir said lucy
perhaps he may tell me something i have
a mind to consult him
do as you please said sir rupert 
 but i think you had better consult your
own sense
yes yes so i will said lucy i
am only in joke about the conjurer but i
just want to look at him because when
i have satisfied my curiosity about him i
shall think better about the serpents
as she spoke she cautiously began to
put her hand down through the midst 
them toward the bottom the drawer to
seize hold the conjurer but the serpents
all rearing their heads or tails immediately
she hastily withdrew her hand
i am afraid i shall do some miscliietv
said she
 no my dear said sir rupert smiling
 you will do no mischief to them and
they will do none to you there is no
danger
 danger oh no know that said
lucy but i think harry had better be
so good as to take him out for me
harry plunged in his hand and drew up
the conjurer by the beard there he is
for you said harry what good will
he do you 
it is only a coloured print on a paper
case now i see it in the light said lucy
may i open the case sir there seems
to be something in it
as sir rupert assented she opened it 
within the case she found a yellow paper
on which were what lucy called hieroglyphics
 and inside were a number little
fish about twice the length the motherofpearl
fish which are used as counters
at a cardtable but these were not 
d
motherofpearl they were some very
thin material thin as oiled paper or as
goldbeater's skin and somewhat that
colour as lucy looked close to see what
they were made they began to move
sir rupert took one by the tail out 
the paper and bidding lucy hold out her
hand he laid it flat upon the palm at
first it lay still but in a few seconds began
to heave and move its head and tail
like the serpent said lucy but
how or why they move i cannot conceive
because there is no room for any spring
or any mechanism harry withinside
there is no double skin he is quite
transparent i can see through him and
there is nothing in him how he writhes
about but what says the conjurer what
has he to do with it let me look at his
paper and try if i can make it out it is
not english copenhagen copenhagen
it is danish then
yes this conjurer and his fish were
brought to me from copenhagen by an
officer long ago before they became common
in this country and they afforded us
then much amusement trying the temperaments
and fortunes or at least the tempers
and understandings those who consulted
this conjurer and took his fish in hand
here is an english translation his advertisement
for you lucy
lucy read and learned that the conjurer
promised to tell the temperaments dispositions
characters and fortunes all manner
 men women and children by the
aid his fish mute but not still their
motions spoke a language which as he
boasted could never like the language 
men err or deceive and this language he
to a certain degree and in some general
points condescended to interpret for the
advantage all who consulted him and
purchased his hieroglyphic scroll opposite
to the hieroglyphics on this scroll
were the interpretations the different
motions the fishes heads and tails and
bodies also what was to be inferred from
their lying still and motionless
now i understand the directions and
let us try on ourselves said lucy hold
out your hand harry
she placed one the fish flat on his
palm and observing its motions which
were quick and sudden floundering vith
his tail she consulted her hieroglyphics
and found that harry was sanguine and
choleric fortunate in war
 that is not true i can answer for it
cried lucy as far as the choleric and
sanguine go now try mes
atrabilious and melancholia to die
 a broken heart if not taken in time
lucy let fall the fish while she laughed
and exclaimed what nonsense 
the fish fell into seme water which was
kept in the workshop for the use the
grindstone recovering from her laughter
she said that he was at last in his proper
element yet he did not seem to like it
his head and tail curling up met and he
lay with only the middle his side touching
the water as if he feared to go in
put him quite in said harry and
see what will happen
lucy pressed him down into the water
but not without his struggling however
when he was fairly in for it as she said
he ceased to flounder and lay perfectly
quiet
 now let us take him out and dry
him said harry and see what will
happen
harry dried one his sides and laid
him down in the sunshine
oh the poor fish cried lucy he
is just as the proverb says as uncomfortable
as a fish out water how he writhes
about i'll sprinkle a little water over
him
 stay let me dry him quite and that
will do as well you will see said harry 
he will lie quietly then though he is a
fish ont water
well try said lucy now he
does lie quiet indeed exactly as if he were
dead
but as she stooped closer to look at
him he seemed to revive and moved
again
as if he felt my breath cried lucy
 oh harry i see how it is row i
know it all
harry smiled
 you are right said sir rupert
and you knew it all the while harry
said lucy i was very stupid not to
think it before
you would have thought it said
harry but that you were so full the
conjuror
 but even now i do not know all
said lucy i suppose that the motions
 this fish depend on the changes
from wet to dry and that he curls and
incurs as my hair does and for the
same reason i have not forgotten
harry all you and papa explained tome
about the cause curling when
one side is wet and the other dry
when the pores are filled with moisture
on one side and not on the other i
understand that that was the case with
the fish when you dried him on one side
and left him wet on the other but 
vol iii n
cannot yet guess what substance he is
made
 think some those substances 
which you know hygrometers are made
said harry
 old whalebone hygrometer i remember
you said lucy you smile harry
it is whalebone but i never saw any
before so thin
very likely you never did said
harry but whalebone can be scraped
very thin as thin as this you see
it really is whalebone then and i
could make such a fish myself said
lucy if my head had not been so
full that foolish conjuror i might
have seen all that you observed harry
and then i should have found it out
too
i dare say that now you will find out
what the chinese serpents are made 
said sir rupert
they are hygrometers too then i
suppose said lucy hey harry what
can they be made do you know 
i am not sure but i believe i do
said harry
yes you are right said sir rupert
following the motion harry's eye
lucy turned and looked yet she saw
nothing as she said but dust under the
workbench and a box full old iron
and brass and hundreds things continued
she going towards it
you had better stop and think instead
 going into that box said harry look
back at the serpents and see what they are
like recollect all the substances which
you know would make good hygrometers
and then consider which is most like these
serpents
ivory cried lucy i remember you
told me that it has many pores and that it
makes a good hygrometer they must be
made ivory and now i know what
your eye turned to it was to that curled
shaving ivory which is lying on the
floor
sir rupert after some conversation with
harry about hygrometers asked him if he
had ever seen daniel's and when harry
n 
answered that lie had not sir rupert exclaimed
 let whoever is curious in hygrometers
follow me to the laboratory
harry followed instantly but lucy did
not she thought she had had enough hygrometers
 and she preferred going to divert
herself with a canary bird which she saw
hanging in its cage at the window the
housekeeper's room on the side the
court opposite to the laboratory this
bird could as the housekeeper told her
draw up water for itself in a little bucket
she saw this bucket it was about the
size a thimble it hung by a delicate
chain on the outside a sort projecting
o bow window in the cage the upper
 the chain was fastened to the bird's
foot and the bucket lay in a small reservoir
 water the manner in which the
bird drew it up was as the housekeeper
told lucy by taking the chain in his beak
and by placing his foot on each portion 
it as it was drawn up till the bucket was
as high as the little window where he
could drink
he disliked it seems the labour 
drawing water and never performed this
operation except when compelled by thirst
unluckily for lucy just before she arrived
he had drawn up a bucket full and having
satisfied his thirst he was now singing
away loud and shrill as if rejoicing in
having cast dull care behind him lucy
waited and waited she and the housekeeper
exhausted all their exhortations al
the endearing epithets in the language and
all their hemp seed in vain the canary
took all the bribes as fast as they were
offered and received all the compliments
seemingly in good part but no return
made he not that he did not understand
what return was expected the rogue
eyed the bucket askance as the housekeeper
held it up to him then straight he
turned his back upon her or upon it and
sang away pertinaciously with a louder
and a shriller note than before a full
quarter an hour was spent upon him
then lucy gave it up
what an obstinate or capricious little
creature it is said lucy she then went
to ask lady digby whether it hurt him to
draw up the bucket
lady digby said she believed it did not
hurt him though she could not be certain 
but she thought his unwillingness to perform
the operation might be accounted forby
recollecting the pain which he had
undergone in learning this feat it is said
that much cruelty is practised on birds
when young in teaching them this and
other accomplishments
 how happy lucy it is for some young
birds who are taught accomplishments
without pain
meantime as soon as sir rupert and
harry had returned to the laboratory sir
rupert said before i show you the new
hygrometer harry i must tell you that
in all those hygrometers which are made
 vegetable or animal substances and
which measure the moisture the air by
their expansion or contraction there is
one great source error they have no
standard point by which they may be
readily compared with each other the
great de saussure whom you will admire
still more for his random than for his
ingenuity foresaw and pointed out this
fault in his own hair hygrometer and the
celebrated humboldt who used both the
hair and the whalebone hygrometers complained
that he could never make their
results agree another philosopher calls
all the ordinary hygrometers mere toys 
but without going further it is enough
for you to know that from this cause all
those instruments are found to be insufficient
for ranking nice observations on the
atmosphere they have besides other
imperfections no two hairs are exactly
similar in elasticity whalebone is not only
very irregular but very slow in its expansion
 the wind disturbs their movements
and dust and oil in time clog the
pivots
 thank you sir said harry for
explaining to me the faults the old
ones
 now for the new one said sir rupert
 you have i dare say often observed
the dewy appearance on the outside
 a glass cold water when brought
into a warm room this dewy appearance
you know is the condensation the moisture
contained in the air and it was this
circumstance that first turned mr dan i ell's
thoughts to a new mode measuring the
pi'oportiojt they bear to each other with
the aid some hints which he candidly
acknowledges that he received from other
philosophers with whose names at least you
must be acquainted dalton and wollaston
he succeeded in making the ingenious instrument
which i will now show you
he placed before harry's eyes a bras
stand and pillar five or six inches in
height to the pillar was fixed a small
thermometer and from the top there hung
a glass tube each which was bent
down and terminated in a ball or globe 
thin glass one these globes was
covered with muslin and the other contained
a very delicate thermometer the bulb
 which was partly immersed in ether
 the first thing to tell you harry
said sir rupert is the purpose these
two thermometers the outside one on
the pillar shows the temperature the
air while the inside one marks the temperature
 the ether and therefore the
glass globe that contains it
now let us place it in this open window
 and when i wet the muslin covering
 the empty ball with a few drops 
ether you are to observe what takes place
on the other ball
it was what is called a very dry day
and after sir rupert had applied the ether
two or three times harry said that he saw
a slight film dew forming like a ring
round the uncovered ball
now harry said sir rupert mark
the height both thermometers
 you are aware he continued that
rapid evaporation produces cold and that
ether evaporates more rapidly than any other
fluid
harry was partly aware this yet he
was surprized by the instantaneous cold
n 
produced by a drop ether that sir rupert
let fall on the back his hand
 when i applied some ether to the
muslin said sir rupert the glass under
it was immediately cooled and the
condensation the vapour inside gradually
communicated the cold to the other
ball the degree cold there is shown
by the inside thermometer and the difference
between that and the temperature
 the external air at the moment the dew
is deposited on the glass is the measure
we want the moisture suspended in the
atmosphere
then i suppose sir said harry
 the drier the air the greater is the difference
between the thermometers for the
difference is fifteen degrees
you are right harry and i will endeavour
to explain to you how and why
when water is evaporated from the surface
 the earth it can only be supported
in the atmosphere by the influence heat
a decrease heat therefore condenses
some the watery vapour and when there
is a large proportion moisture in the
air a very small additional degree cold
precipitates it in the shape rain or dew
if that had been the case during our experiment
or in other words if it had been
just going to rain you would have seen
the film dew immediately follow the
application the ether to the covered
ball on the contrary when the air is
very dry a considerable increase cold
is requisite to make it part with its moisture
as you have found to be the case today
 the inside thermometer having fallen
fifteen degrees before the dew was deposited
on the ball
all we have to do then said harry
is to observe what additional degree 
cold is necessary to convert the vapour into
water and this is shown by the difference
 the two thermometers when the ring
 dew is formed
that degree cold said sir rupert
is called the point deposition or the
dewpoint and this hygrometer marks it
with great precision for an instrument
 daily use however i think it has
one inconvenience can you perceive what
it is harry 
harry after a few moments reflection
answered it is certainly an inconvenience
to be obliged to pour fresh ether on
the ball every time an observation is to be
made
that is what i meant said sir rupert
 but on the other hand in this very
ingenious instrument there is no unequal
stretching hair or whalebone no clogging
 the pivots with dust and the results
are certain as certain and as easily
compared with each other as the results 
the thermometer
after this explanation for which harry
was very thankful sir rupert advised him
to look at the inventor's own description
 the instrument in the quarterly journal
 science no 
but first said sir rupert let us go
out if you please this fine day and have
some exercise and some amusement remember
the bow must not be always
bent by the bye here are bows and arrows
and here is a little bow which edward
had when he was your age which
will just suit your sister lucy call her
and brinof her out with you to the bowling
green i will have the target set up for
sou
 an hour and a half is it possible
said lucy that we have been really an
hour and half here on this bowlinggreen

 exactly an hour and a half since first
i fixed an arrow in that bow and settled
it in your hand said harry for i happened
to look at the sundial just as i
went back to my place
we have been so very happy i said
lucy stretching out her arm to rest it
but now you seem to be rather tired
 your happiness said her father and
you had better stop before pleasure turns
into pain
 my arm only is tired papa said
lucy i am not the least tired myself
however i think we have had enough for
today and we can come back to it tomorrow
if tomorrow should be as fine as
today
in the mean time come with me to
the house said sir rupert this
way leads towards the old part the
castle i will turn you into a cool armoury
to rest yourselves and where perhaps you
may find fresh amusement in looking at
the bows and arrows former times
they followed joyfully to the armoury 
he showed them in the first place a bow
and arrows which had remained in this
castle family tradition failed to tell how
long but certainly since the days our
henrys and edwards when bowmen and
archers flourished and when bows and
arrows were not as now taken up as matters
 amusement by fine gentlemen and
ladies to win prizes at festive meetings
but employed as serious weapons in battles
and sieges sir rupert was going on to
show harry the crossbow such as was in
use and repute among our ancestors but
lucy's eye was caught by an indian bow
and arrow and he turned to take it down
for her it was stiff with rings dried
thongs leather which had been put on
the bow to commemorate each savage victory
obtained by the owner next to this
indian bow there hung another said to
have been brought from mexico at the time
when those poor people or unhappily for
them those too rich people were invaded
by the avaricious pizarro and when their
bows and arrows so ill defended them
against the firearms the spaniards
harry and lucy regretted the fate the
inoffensive mexicans and wished that they
had been possessed the ingenious invention
 firearms for their just defence
sir rupert went back to the crossbow
and showed harry how it was constructed
and used the stock was made wood
neatly inlaid with bone and ornamented
with tassels but the bow was steel and
so stiff that harry's utmost efforts could
scarcely bend it sir rupert told him that
no person had sufficient strength to drawback
the string into its place without some
mechanical assistance and desired him to
examine the bow carefully harry observed
a long iron lever the which
turned upon a pin in the middle the
stock to this lever a little jointed arm
was attached which terminated in a kind
 hook that seemed to invite the string 
he slipped the string over the hook and
pulling round the outer the lever
down to the butt the stock he
easily accomplished the bending the
bow sir rupert then showed them the
trigger or serpeiit'we as he said it was
formerly called by which the string was
released and the arrow or ball projected
harry was surprised to hear him mention
balls still more when he was told
that balls both lead and stone were used
sir rupert showed them also various kinds
 darts and arrows one which to lucy's
great amusement he called a quarrel he
explained to her however that the termwas
derived from the old french word
quarreaii on account its square head
 iron crossbows and quarrels sir
rupert added were much used in the time
 henry the second they were great
effect in his wars in ireland and assisted
much in his conquest the irish who
possessed no such weapons
in this armoury were many the warlike
instruments and armour used in ancient
times by the english sir rupert showed
harry the helmet the vizor and the lance 
and explained to him how the lance stood in
the rest when the knight was on horseback
 and he showed him all the parts 
the knights armour with which he cased
himself and his horse in iron so that as
honores he and his steed could hold together
they were almost invulnerable till
the lance was wrested from his hand or
his foot ousted from the stirrup the
united weight man and horse or their
joint momentum was great consequence
as the heavier they were the greater the
shock with which they came against their

adversary horse to horse and man to man
harry and lucy were glad to know the
exact appearance all these things 
which they had read in history as being
used not only in battles but in the just
and tournaments former days
lucy enjoyed them from the recollection
they brought to her mind many passages
in poetry and from the pleasure she
always felt in whatever filled her imagination

harry's mechanical taste was gratified
by examining the ancient coat mail or
hauberk consisting small steel rings
linked together or interwoven in the manner
that some ingenious purses steel
rings are made at this day
after harry had satisfied his curiosity
sir rupert took him on to those later inventions
which made no avail helm
and hauberk's twisted mail he showed
him some the first rude attempts at firearms
 the arquebuse or long gun described
by froissart used with a rest upon
which it was supported and with a sort 
shelterpiece to protect the match from
wet and wind between this first clumsy
attempt to execute that grand invention
and the perfected wanton's and forth's
guns our own times various improvements
were made some which sir rupert explained
to harry lucy whose curiosity
was not only satisfied but satiated went
off to seek for amusement and information
more interesting to her in the garden and
the conservatory with her mother and
lady digby indefatigably kind sir rupert
ended by finding froissart for harry
in the library and unfolding for him those
delightfully entertaining old prints where
the battles poictiers and cressy are
represented so happily though in defiance
 all the laws perspective
after speaking the wonderful change
which the introduction firearms produced
in the world and the astonishment
which their first appearance created
among civilized and uncivilized nations in
europe and america sir rupert related
to harry an account which he had just
read in a new travels a people
by whom the power firearms has been
even recently defied
 between the nile and the desert said
sir rupert there is a narrow strip 
cultivated land which in some places is
not more than half a mile in breadth but
which stretches hundreds miles in length
this strip land was inhabited by various
independent tribes till within the last three
or four years when a despotic turkish
pasha the name mahomet ali
resolved to send a large army under the
command his son ismael to subdue
them ismael's progress was unresisted
till he came to one warlike tribe who
with equal courage and patriotism defied
the invader he may drive us to the
gates the world but we will never submit
was the answer they sent to his
threats
brave people cried harry i
hope they drove him back again
 they were heard shouting from their
encampment continued sirrupert you
may come against us from the north and
from the east and from the west but we
will never submit they knew that the
pacha had firearms they had none 
but they put their trust in the weapons and
shields to which they had been accustomed
and in their own courage their
shields hippopotamus or crocodile
skin covered the head and the breast
their weapons were swords and lances
and their sorcerers assured them that their
shields and themselves should be rendered
by magic invulnerable to masque balls
bravely they came out to give him
battle and advanced boldly at first but
when the vollies musketry began to
play and when they found that in spite 
their promised invulnerability many fell
wounded and killed a panic seized them
and they fled after this first defeat however
they entrenched themselves in their
mountains their courage revived and
again they sent forth shouts defiance
bidding the pacha to come if he dared
but ismael had learned to respect their
bravery he had once already been surprised
and almost defeated by the black
horsemen the desert and he therefore
prudently resolved to attack them with a
heavy fire shot and shells one these
shells fell amongst them and as it was
rolling and bounding along these poor
ignorant people gathered round it admiring
and amused by its motions but
when it burst and spread destruction round
it they cried out the evil spirits are
come against us and are too mighty for us
the superstition that had at first given
them confidence now only increased their
despair and abandoning their strongholds
they set off in full flight their
patriotism expiring with their liberties
afterwards they bargained for their wretched
lives and were contented to join as his
soldier slaves the army their conqueror
as sir rupert concluded harry groaned
was this said he the their
glorious you may drive us to the gates
 the world but we will never submit
even so harry so little dependence
can there be on mere animal ignorant
courage thatbraves the danger which
it does not know the nature or extent
the glass doors at one the library
leading into the conservatory were half
open and now that harry's attention was
no longer engaged he observed a gale 
fragrance like the smell fresh hay or
 that grass which gives to fresh hay its
pleasant odour anthoxanthum odoratum
a second waft however decided that it
was from lady digby's favourite plant
the heliotrope innumerable pots which
the skilful old gardener contrived to force
into premature flower and perfume so as to
have a constant succession for her ladyship's
conservatory he heard lucy's voice too 
and though he was not as he used to say
 himself a great greenhouse merchant
he now went in there and found
lady digby showing some plants which
had been lately sent to her from north
carolina by a kind american lady there
was one which is rather uncommon in
these countries as it is so delicate that
without care it seldom survives a winter in
our climates it is something the
nature the sensitive plant the inside
 the leaf is thickly set with bristly hairs
like thorns or like many little sharp teeth
as soon as lucy saw this plant she took
up a straw and drew it along the division
or middle rib one its leaves and
immediately the two sides the leaf folded
up and the prickly teeth closed together
so as to hold fast the straw
i see it is the plant i thought said
lucy venus's flytrap is not it
 yes dioncba muscular said lady
digby have you seen one before 
no lucy had never seen one but she
knew it she said from having read a
description it the gardener by this
time had caught a fly which he bad
been in search on the window for sometime
 for flies were few and rare at this
season and holding his struggling prisoner
by the two wings he was going to
set him upon one the leaves that the
young lady as he said might see what
would happen but lucy stopped his hand
she knew what would happen that
the moment the fly touched the leaf the
teeth would close upon it as they had
closed on the straw and squeeze it to
death the old gardener immediately
complied with lucy's entreaties to release
the poor fly and lucy observed to him
that there was the less occasion for this
experiment as the many dead flies showed
how well some the leaves had performed
their cruel office but i really think
she said that those flykilling leaves are
larger and greener than the rest
the gardener answered that he had
often remarked the same thing and though
some folk said that they were fattened and
nourished by the dead flies for his part
he thought it just as likely that it was because
the healthy and vigorous leaves had
a greater power shutting close and
crushing the flies but added he with
vol iii o
due philosophic caution i can't take
upon me to decide
harr admired the ingenious mechanical
structure this flytrap and began to
say that it reminded him something
which he had seen elsewhere when lucy
smiled and said i know what you are
going to say harry and you are quite
right you mean the plant called the flycatcher
 a sort arum which smells as
you said harry like a dead horse and
there is another plant in which mamma
showed me the same sort contrivance
continued lucy but i cannot recollect
its long latin name i remember
that papa lent me a magnifying glass to
look at the dead flies lying at the bottom
 its flowers some were held by the
proboscis and some by the legs this
plant is called in english i believe dog'sbane
was not this what you were thinking
 harry 
no i was not thinking any plant
said harry i was thinking a machine
a sort trap which catches rats in the
manner that this catches flies
lucy was a little scandalized by this
inelegant comparison
 the flytrap venus compared to a
rattrap but on harry's appeal to his
father it was allowed to be just as far as
mechanics go
the gardener thought it was now his
turn to get in a few words in praise the
strength and healthiness his dionaea
it had been sent over from carolina in
sods its native earth which still remained
in a box to which he pointed
there were more plants in it said he 
but they have died so i shall empty
out the sods now for they are a disfigurement
here
harry said it would be a pity to throw
this earth away for he recollected having
heard that when the boxes plants
which peruse in his voyage round the
world sent home to france were opened
the plants and shrubs in some were dead
yet the gardener did not throw away the
o 
earth but preserved it carefully because
he thought it might contain the seeds 
some sorts plants unknown perhaps in
these countries and so it proved
lady digby upon hearing this circumstance
desired her gardener to put the
american earth into small pots and to
place them in a hot bed if it should
produce any plants that are worth your
acceptance harry said she you to
whom shall owe them shall share them
with me
mayhap master you might not know
what this is said the gardener opening
another little box and putting into his
hands a small bundle what seemed to
harry to be black horsehair
 is it horsehair said harry
 it is horsehair said lucy
no miss no master though i took
it myself for that at first unpacking
lucy pulled a bit it out and after
feeling said it feels like horsehair
crisp and springy and it looks so like it that
i can hardly believe it is not horsehair
 never was on a horse's back miss
nor ever belonged to any animal
is it animal or vegetable said lucy
that was soon settled by harry's running
back to the library and burning a bit
 it the remains he held to lucy's nose
and its smell convinced her that which
her eyes had failed to discover that it was
neither horsehair nor any animal substance
 then it is a vegetable what
can it be 
 and what do you think this can be
miss said the gardener putting into her
hand another little bundle something
which harry said looked like ends white
coarse thread such as he had seen in a
taylor's shop and which he had heard
called thrums lucy agreed that it was
like tangled housewife's thread but on a
nearer view she who was more knowing
in housewifery than harry pronounced that
it certainly was not thread looking at
what harry drew out and called a needlefull
she observed sundry little short filaments
or stalks and at the some 
them were little knobs which on further
examination were evidently the remains 
very small flowers she pronounced it
therefore to be a vegetable and she was
surprised to hear that both this and what
she had called black horsehair were one
and the same thing only in different states
i will if you please said lady digby
read to you the account that i received
from the american friend who sent them
to me
she returned to the library to look for
the letter in her writingdesk and harry
and lucy stuck close to her much afraid
that the letter might not be forthcoming 
but she found it and read as follows 
 the foliage several trees here
near wilmington in north carolina
has in some situations a singular appearance
a sort long grey moss suspends
itself from the branches and waving
in the wind gives the trees a hoary and
to me not uninteresting appearance when
stripped its external coat this moss
nearly resembles horsehair it is 

elected for that purpose in large quantities
and buried in marshy spots and when the
outer coat peels off the inner part is dried
and cleaned and makes excellent mattresses

lucy's mother observed that the outer
coat flax is destroyed in the same way
by steeping it in water
lucy inquired whether this kind horsehair
moss as she called it had any name 
and whether it was known in england or
was a new discovery sir rupert digby
told her that though he had never before
seen this extraordinarily fibrous species yet
he was aware that the genus or family 
plants to which it belonged had been well
known to linnaeus who had given it a
singular name from a singular circumstance

it will make me remember the singular
name said lucy if you will be
so good as to tell me the singular circumstance

 you must know then said sir rupert
 that among the early botanists sweden
there was a certain doctor who having in
his youth had an unfavourable voyage by
water from abo where he lived to stockholm
made a vow the moment he set his
foot on dry land that he would never again
venture himself upon the sea he kept
this vow so scrupulously that when he was
to return home he took a roundabout
journey several hundred miles to avoid
a passage a few hours by water his
hatred water and his love the dry
land rose to such a pitch that he laid
aside his family name to take that tillands
which in swedish means on land
you think perhaps and so do i that this
doctor made a rash vow and did not in all
this show much sense but a man maybe
weak in some things and wise in others
he was wise in botany and made an excellent
catalogue all the wild plants in
the neighbourhood his residence in
honour which and the whimsical
name he had adopted linnaeus gave the
name tillandsia to this genus plants
as they are remarkable for their dislike 
water lucy do you think you will now
be able to remember the nametillandsia
i think i am sure i shall said
lucy
sir rupert further told lucy that one
 the most severe censors linnaeus had
been so much pleased with the happy
choice this name that he declared he
would excuse in linnaeus a thousand
faults for that fact alone
lady digby said her american friend
had been so obliging as to send many
other curious things in the box besides
the specimen this moss among
others i am sure lucy you will like to
see some pods cotton in their different
stages ripening my friend tells me
that they grow on a bush from two to four
feet high and that the flower is a delicate
straw colour i dare say you may
have seen an engraving it
i think i have said lucy bui
oh lady digby before you shut the box
will you give me leave to look at that
green leaf if it is a leaf 
you do well to say if it is a leaf
answered lady digby do you know
what it is 
 is it the creeping leafy said lucy
no answered lady digby it
much resembles the creepingleaf or mantis
strumaria but this is a different insect
by the country people in america it is
called the candid from the sound its
chirping resembling the frequent repetition
 candid candid
lucy examined this insect more closely
it was about the size a roseleaf the
pale green colour the inside a pea
pod and apparently that smooth texture
 but upon looking at it with a magnifying
glass lucy saw that what had
appeared like the veins a leaf were the
ribs or sinews the wings and in the
intermediate spaces which had to the
naked eye appeared perfectly smooth she
now saw embossed innumerable little
spots looking like shagreen
now i see the animal's head where
the footstalk the leaf seemed to be and
its eyes nose and mouth cried lucy
 pray look harry its head and face
are like a horse's head and face in body
clothes look at its protuberant bladderlooking
eye the mouth however is like
a pig's or the antbear's and round its
neck it has a curious worked pelerine
standing up like the leather hood on the
collar a waggon horse but what
curious thing is that lying loose in the box
with its green longjointed storklike legs 
what do they belong to 
before her question could be answered
her rambling eye fixed with delight and
curiosity on a plant which hung flaunting
from the top the conservatory she
asked where its roots were how it was
nourished or whether it lived on air
ladydigby answered that it was reputed
to live on air as its name jos aris or
the airplant shows and that probably it
derives its nourishment from the moisture
in the air however this may be in
its native country it thrives much better
here if planted in a little light earth or
even in wet moss as you may perceive
by comparing it with the other specimens
which you see twined round that
pillar and which are all planted in pots
this plant nevertheless has been hanging
where you see it for four months and
though it requires a much greater heat it is
quite alive it is frequently watered and i
want to try how long it will live in that situation
but continued lady digby if
you my dear lucy who are so active and
obliging will run up stairs to the little
turret within my room you will find a
 with many paper marks in it on my
desk bring it down to me and it will
tell you something more about this curious
plant
lucy vanished and reappeared bearing
in her hand the proof her swift errand
this is a favourite mine and
 my son edward's all these marks he
put in for my edification i was no botanist
but he and this little volume together
have made me fond what appears to me
the most interesting and rational part the
study that which opens to our view the
curious and useful structure plants and
the progress vegetation i like this
 for another reason continued lady
digby turning to lucy's mother which
makes me rejoice that it pleases young
people without any ostentation religious
sentiment it really inspires it in the
best and happiest manner here is the
account the jos aeris continued lady
diobv will you read it to us it is
very short
lucy read there is one species 
the epidendrum family the jos aris a
native india that deserves to be particularly
distinguished it is so called because
it grows and blossoms when suspended
in the air and we are assured
that hanging from the ceiling a room
it will vegetate for years it is likewise
said to be remarkably reviving to the inhabitants
by the fine odour its blossoms

that fact said lucy's father its
hanging from the ceiling a room and
vegetating for a length time in that
manner is mentioned if i recollect rightly
in one sir william jones's letters written
when he was in india he says the
flos aris was at that instant suspended
over his head that he had tied its rootless
branches to the beams the roof and
he speaks with delight the charming
fragrance the blossoms
and now said sir rupert pray
may i ask i have been very patient while
you ladies have had the to yourselves
with three pairs hands upon it
at once may i ask the name this favourite
 if name it have for hitherto
i have heard it called only it or the 
or my favourite has it a name
it has a name answered lady 
 and a name that will be well known
to fame in due time dialogues on botany


next morning after breakfast an express
came from the housekeeper's room to inform
lucy that the canarybird was beginning
to draw up his bucket downstairs
she ran immediately and after her
followed harry
the thirsty little fellow nowe working for
his own interest and with his own goodwill
soon performed his task and earned
his thimblefull duly raised when lifted
to the proper height he held it by keeping
the collected chain fast under one foot
then he dipped shook his beak and
dipped and shook again much to his own
delight and to that the spectators
when he had fully satisfied his thirst he
began to favour the company with a sono 
but his notes even when joy tuned his
throat were so loud and shrill that his
mistress the housekeeper soon threw a
white handkerchief over the top his
cage to reduce him to silence so that as
she said she might hear somebody speak
besides him
lady digby who had followed lucy
to see her friend the canarybird perform
its little exercises confirmed lucy's hopes
that birds may be taught by gentle methods
when young many those feats
which are generally acquired by the infliction
 so many tortures she had
when abroad as she told lucy known
a german musicmaster who was very fond
 birds and who was most expert in
teaching them he assured her that he
had himself instructed a bullfinch which he
would venture to say was as accomplished
as any its kind in all germany where
these birds are chiefly born and bred and
he had never used hot knitting needle or
any other instrument torture in its education
 only soft words and sometimes he
acknowledged a little wholesome fasting
lady digby recollected that this judicious
birdfancier or birdinstructor further
told her that he always taught his
pupil at the dead still hour midnight
or when all the rest the family were
asleep and when there was nothing to
distract the bird's attention then he
would play tunes for him on the violin
the bullfinch seemed to take no notice
and never attempted at the time to follow
him but the next day he would practise by
himself and at last bring out the tune he
had heard at night
lucy's attention was now called off to
a basket lavender which a maid at this
instant brought into the room the housekeeper
was going to make her annual store
 lavenderwater the still was ready
and lucy wished to see the operation 
distilling but harry whispered his advice
to her to wait and see it performed in the
laboratory looking out the window to
the other side the court he observed that
the iron door was open which was a sign
that sir rupert was in the laboratory and
on this hint lucy immediately ran therewith
harry and found sir rupert and
their father
fortunately for lucy sir rupert wanted
for the experiment he was then trying to
have some water that should be perfectly
pure that is quite free from all mixture
 earth or salts or other substances and
for which purpose it was to be distilled
this was a simple process which lucy
could understand sir rupert had just
prepared his alembic the apparatus usually
employed in distillation for chemical purposes
it was a pearshaped glass vessel
into which the liquor to be distilled was
put a lamp was placed underneath by
the heat which the liquor was made
to boil and the vapour that rose was condensed
in the cover which was a conicalshaped
cap metal with a beak or spout
that sloped downwards into another vessel
called the received
these drops said sir rupert which
you see running ois from the beak are
collected in the receiver and the liquor
thus collected is said to be distilled
all distillation is performed upon this principle
though the apparatus is different
for different purposes and sometimes made
 copper
i have heard a worm used in a still
what is that said lucy
the worm is a spiral tube so called
from its resembling the form a worm 
its use in the still is the same as that 
the cap over this alembic to condense the
hot vapour
lucy asked why the worm was used
instead the cap 
 because said sir rupert it exposes
more cold surface to the vapour
suppose the whole pipe to be unwound
and laid open you would then perceive
what a large surface there would be besides
which the colder the worm is kept
the quicker the condensation proceeds 
and a worm or a long pipe coiled up is
very conveniently placed in a vessel 
cold water which may be changed whenever
it becomes warmed by the hot vapour
that communicates its heat to the metal
worm
 i understand it now thank you sir
said lucy
she perceived that in fact though the
apparatus was different the thing done
was no more than what she had formerly
seen when she was six years old when the
cold plate was held over the vapour 
boiling water that issued from the top 
the tea urn she recollected something 
the account distillation and sublimation
in conversations on chemistry and
searching for the in the library she
refreshed her memory by reading the passages
over again at this moment when she
had the advantage seeing the real
things and perhaps seeing the experiments
tried
she there found that sublimation is the
name given to the process distillation
when applied to solid substances
sublimation a sandbath flowers 
sulphur she repeated wishing earnestly
that she could see all these things
sir rupert said that as the sandbath
was now heated over his little stove for
his own experiments he could easily gratify
her curiosity if she pleased he would
however instead flowers sulphur let
her see flowers benzoin
he put into her hand a small lump 
a brownish substance which he told her
was benzoin and that it was a res'm or
more properly a balsam obtained from
certain trees which grow in the east indies
chiefly in the island sumatra from
this substance flowers benzoin are obtained
by sublimation in the same manner
as flowers sulphur are produced lucy
watched the process
the benzoin was put into the glass
alembic which was placed in the sandbath
and this she saw was merely a castiron
vessel containing a quantity sand
sir rupert explained to her that the heat
was more uniform and could be better regulated
by means the hot sand and
that there was less danger to the glass
than if it were exposed to the direct heat
 the fire he told her also that chemists
make much use a bath boilinor water 
and that in some arts tempering certain
kinds springs for instance workmen
use baths melted lead or tin or some
other fusible substance because the exact
temperature at which these metals melt
being known the proper heat may be applied
with the greatest precision
in a short time the benzoin began to
swell the resinous parts and other impurities
with which it had been combined
remained at the bottom the alembic
but the volatile parts flew off and were
condensed by the cold cap these were
the flowers and were different from what
lucy expected to see they were more
like flakes snow than any thing else to
which she could compare them while
she was looking at them harry ran out
into the yard to the gardener's boy whom
he saw coming in from the garden with a
basket herbs on his arm from his
basket harry plucked a sprig rosemary
and returning without letting lucy see
what he had in his hand he sprinkled it
over with flowers benzoin and then held
it before her eves
 it looks exactly as if it were covered
with hoar frost cried lucy howbeautiful
 i shall never forget this harry
but here are the horses coming out for
sir rupert and papa to ride and so there
is an all things at least in the laboratory
for this day
battledore and shuttlecock was kept up
one rainy morning by harry and lucy 
believe it who may boast as much who
can two thousand three hundred and
twentyfour times they had also many
a game ninepins in the great hall
where prolonged by its echoes was often
heard the heart's light laugh at the fall 
the merry men all
but all these the promised joys 
castle each proving greater in the enjoyment
than the promise were exceeded
by the delights the workshop and laboratory
every morning they watched for
the moment when sir rupert moved towards
the iron door avicenna never
watched more anxiously the famous library
door that opened but once a year
one morning lucy observed a shallow
drawer on the table between her father
and sir rupert and in this she saw some
things which she thought might be very
useful to harry the drawer contained
many lenses telescopes and glasses 
different sizes some as large as that 
harry's camera obscura which had been
so unfortunately broken it occurred to
lucy that the loss might now be repaired
she waited till sir rupert was not busy
and then she asked him whether these
glasses were very precious too precious to
part with or whether she might beg one
for harry sir rupert said that they
were precious to him because he was repeating
some beautiful experiments dr
brewster's and mr herschel's on the magnifying
powers telescopes but he desired
to know which lucy wished for as possibly
that one might be spared
she looked at the variety that lay before
her but which them she wanted she
could not tell it was in vain to consult
her father's eye it never moved sir
rupert stood by with his goodnatured
smile waiting her decision but without
giving any direction to her choice
 if i could but recollect exactly the
shape the old glass in harris's camera
obscura said lucy what i want is a
glass that magnifies that i am sure
these which are convex magnify i believe
but continued she after having looked
through several them at a word which
was written in small characters on the front
 the drawer i find that some these
glasses magnify much more than others 
and another thing i perceive that as i
move each glass nearer or further there
is one particular distance at which
the object appears distinct but that the
distances are quite different for different
glasses i recollect hearing you papa
telling harry something about the focal
distance but i had better not say anything
about that as i do not understand
it i cannot tell which these convex
glasses will suit the camera obscura
vol iii p
however i know the sort that i want
should be convex
 very well my dear said sir rupert
that is indeed all that you can tell or
that can be known without trial you
shall therefore take several these convex
lenses home with you and harry by trial
can determine which will best answer your
purpose
lucy was very much obliged to sir
rupert and delighted that through her
means her brother's camera obscura was
likely to be mended but now that her
curiosity was excited she wished to know
more
 why papa do convex glasses magnify
and concave glasses diminish i
wish i knew i wish i could understand
the camera obscura mamma says that
camera obscura is italian for dark chamber

 so far so good for the name said
her father but in this case the name
tells us nothing the nature the thing
 yet papa said lucy the first
time you showed harry and me a camera
obscura it was in a large dark
room
 was it quite dark said her father
not quite the shutters were all
closed but there was a little hole in one
 them through which the rays light
came we saw images things very
faintly upon a white sheet which you
had hung up opposite to the hole what
we saw was a sort coloured shadowy
picture the landscape that was outside
 the window and i remember that all
the images were upside down
true said her father you observed
that it was very faint and indistinct
did it remain so
oh no papa it became afterwards
quite distinct and almost as bright as the
natural colours the trees and orass and
we saw the figures people as they
walked past in a field at a little distance
from the window i saw the colour 
the women's red cloaks and their faces
quite plainly and the figures were not upside
down as before
and what made these differences
asked her father
it was a glass a lens you called it
which you put into that hole in the 
just the same way as the
glass makes the landscape appear brighter
on the paper in harry's portable camera
obscura
 do you recollect how or why the lens
produced this effect said her father
no papa not exactly harry explained
to me afterwards something about
it but he could not tell me all he said
he did not know all then
all no indeed said harry not
tien nor now
tell us all you remember if you remember
any thing what he did explain
said her father
 first he told me said lucy why
we see the shapes and colours things
he said it was by the rays light which
come from them
come from them how said her
father do you mean come out 
them
no papa but the rays light go
from the sun and strike upon objects and
then come from them to our eyes or as
people express it are reflected by those
objects harry next told me something
which i thought i understood at the time
but i am not sure that i can explain it
 try said sir rupert
harry showed me in a an engraving
 an eye with lines representing
the rays light coming from all parts 
an object and meeting in an angle at the
eye he told me that objects appear tous
great or small according to the size 
that angle next he told me that our eye
is in some way like a camera obscura
there is a little hole in the middle
through which the rays light pass as
they passed through the little hole in the
windowshutter into the dark room and
after having crossed each other they make
a small picture the object i do not
know where exactly somewhere at the
back the eye i believe and upside
down as we saw the objects at first on the
white sheet but in the eye these pictures
must be extremely small something more
harry said about a part the eye which
he called the crystalline humour and
about the rays light being bent as they
pass through it which i think he called
being refracted but which i did not understand
at all
sir rupert observed that lucy did well
not to attempt to go farther than she knew
clearly there is hope he said teaching
any thing to those who perceive and
acknowledge when they do not clearly understand
and who are not satisfied with
confused notions lucy was glad to hear
sir rupert say to harry that his little
pupil did him credit and that she was not
like little conceited misses who instead 
wishing to learn in order to improve desire
only to display a smattering knowledge

i am glad my dear lucy added her
father that your curiosity has been raised
on these subjects but we cannot at present
assist you further only keep what
you have steadily in your mind and from
that you may go on hereafter with
harry's help assisted by his favourite 
 scientific dialogues and with your own
attention you may learn what you desire
but not all at once you must not expect
to learn optics in one morning

it was in the second week their visit at
digby castle that one morning as harry
 and lucy were left alone in the workshop
harry whirring happily at the lathe he
 felt lucy suddenly touch his arm and
 saw her looking up in his face as if eager
to say something rather reluctantly he
slackened the whirring motion and held
back the tool
well what do you want my dear
 want you to come with me i have
made a discovery follow me harry
harry laid down his tool and followed
the workshop was a large irregular
room surrounded by shelves and drawers

and racks for tools with various benches for
carpenters and carvers and for braziers and
smiths three lathes were placed obliquely
to the windows in the middle the room
stood a circular saw machine a lapidary's
wheel and a treadle blowpipe and there
were two flagged recesses partly screened
off and contrived for a camp forge and a
small casting furnace there was another
recess elevated two or three steps above
the floor which contained some tall models
and behind these lucy had discovered
a door which being unlatched she
had pushed a little more open and now
throwing it quite back she said look
harry at what is in that room he
looked in and his eyes sparkled with joy
an electrical machine a great battery
 
but with his foot on the threshold he
stopped and laying his hand on her arm
said do not go in i do not know whether
we may i hope you have not been in
there 
 oh no said lucy m would not
without asking you
and i must not without asking sir
rupert but lucy when you first saw
this what did you think it was 
oh i knew directly that it was an
electrical machine said lucy
you never saw one before that i know
 said harry i saw my uncle's but
you did not it has been packed up ever
since you came home from aunt pierrepoint's

very true but i have seen a print 
one with electrical machine written underneath
 and i knew it directly from that 
but i do not understand any thing about it
as you saw my uncle's real machine you
can explain this to me we need not go
in harry but just as we stand here you
might show me the use all the parts first
tell me the use that glass cylinder which
is something like a broad grindstone 
glass with a sort a silk curtain hanging
over it and a long windlass handle and
i see a chain and
yes yes interrupted harry you see
a great deal which i cannot explain to
you the use
why not said lucy
 you had better ask my father or sir
rupert said harry
so i will then said lucy for i am
exceedingly curious about electricity i
want to know all about the electrical kite
and the leyden phial and conductors and
nonconductors and electrics and nonelectric
and electrics per se
my dear lucy cried harry how
comes it that you know all these names
which you rattle off so finely 
i thought i should surprise you said
lucy laughing
i do not remember my father ever
having talked them to you said any
and i am sure i never did
no you never did but i heard them
at aunt pierrepoinfs and i will tell you
how it happened it all began from a bit
 wit one day when there were a great
many visitors they were talking a lady
who was very delicate very nervous
aunt pierrepoint advised her to try electricity
and a gentleman said he would
answer for it that the ley den phial would
do her more good than any other phial in
the world my aunt smiled and everybody
smiled and said he was witty
when the company had gone away i
asked my aunt what he meant she said
only a jeu de mot child a pun i
asked what the leyden phial was she
said it was rather a glass jar than a phial
and that electrical people with their machines
contrived to fill or charge these
jars with electricity i asked what electricity
was but she had not time to tell
me any more then she was in a great
hurry dressing
a few days afterwards some the same
people came again and i heard that the
nervous lady had received two or three
shocks and was wonderfully better was
quite set up again and that electricity
had cured some old duke a palsy in his
arm he had lost the use it but after
one shock he could carry his glass to his
mouth then every body said electricity
was a wonderfully charming thing but the
week afterwards i heard that it was all a
mistake that the duke's arm had fallen
back again and that the nervous lady was
as low as ever then they talked people
that had been knocked down and a professor
somebody that had been killed formerly
by electricity and an old lady said there
should have been an act parliament
against it from the first then they talked
 an electrical kite and conductors and
lightning i asked aunt pierrepoint again
afterwards what was meant by an electrical
kite and conductors she told me that
they were talking the great dr franklin's
kite that he was a wonderful man
and had a wonderful kite which brought
lightning down from the clouds and that
he was the inventor conductors for
houses and churches and people in thunder
storms but she said she could not
explain more to me without being a professor
 electricity which she did not
pretend to be now harry as you say
that you saw my uncle's electrical machine
when i was away you can explain it all
to me
 i am afraid not said harry my
uncle showed me several entertaining
experiments and i found in the closet
within my room a most entertaining 
on electricity which i once sat up reading
at night till my candle was burned
out there was an account otto garrick's
making and whirling a sulphur globe
and seeing for the first time sparks and
flashes light come from it in the dark
then i got to the leyden jar and the first
electrical shock and franklin's sending
up his kite in the thunder storm i was
exceedingly happy that night but i believe
my head was as much puzzled as
yours was at aunt pierrepoint's in the
morning when my mother found i had
been up half the night she was not
pleased and she made me promise not to
do so again and i never did i only got
up as early as possible in the morning and
at every spare minute i was at the in
the closet it was a great thick quarto
my father however stopped me before i
had got half through it he said it was
not fit for me and it is true i did not
understand half a quarter it the but
i think i could iioic and i wish i could
see it aoam
j
 but harry why did you never tell me
all this before asked lucy and why
did you never mention to me the electrical
machine or leyden jar or even electricity

i had my own reasons said harry
one was that you had not come up to
electricity before we began our journey 
and indeed i was afraid puzzling you
because i had been puzzled myself i
thought too that my father could tell you
better whenever he pleased besides i
was not clear that he would like my goingback
to electricity then but i dare say 
i mean i hope he will have no objection to

st
it now and that sir rupert will show us
some experiments with this machine i
will go and ask my father what he thinks
about its concluded any
let us go directly then said lucy 
 and while you are asking papa i will ask
sir rupert if he will at least give me an
electric shock
no no first let us be sure my fathers
said harry
 i am sure he can have no objection
said lucy but when they asked him about
it lucy observed that though he seemed
unwilling to refuse their request yet he
looked somewhat sorry that it had been
made she did not know why however
as to the essential point he made no
objection to her having a shock and seeing
the electric spark he approved their
seeing some the experiments mentioned
in scientific dialogues such as thatof the
pith balls and the poker and that for
which harry specially pleaded as he was
sure it would divert lucy the experiment
 the dancing paper figures in 
short their father said that he could not
object to their seeing any electrical experiments
which their friend sir rupert
might think proper to show them he
could trust safely to his judgment in this
and in every thing that concerned harry
to him they next went
they found him in the library settled
in his armchair reading and looking so
comfortable that they did not like to disturb
him he was indeed very happy
looking over a new pamphlet that interested
him particularly an account the
late m guinand and the improvements
made by him in the manufacture flintglass
for large telescopes harry and lucy
hesitating went up to his chair one to
each elbow and stood still looking behind
him at each other they had a mind to
retreat without making known their request
but he looked up and smiling
kindly asked what they wanted they
told him and when he found that notwithstanding
their great desire to see the
electrical machine they had not been farther
than the threshold the room he
half rose from his chair but sitting down
again said i must finish this passage
first you may read it over my shoulder
if you will cannot leave the story in
this note half told
while making this glass m guinand
never permitted any persons to be present
except his wife and son who assisted him
on these occasions they were generally
secluded for many days and nights in his
little laboratory but when he had completed
the operation if the result was
favourable his friends and neighbours were
admitted and partook some refreshment
while offering their congratulations
a year or two before his death m
guinand tried an experiment on a larger
scale than he had previously attempted
after much exertion he had succeeded in
producing a perfect objectglass eighteen
inches diameter this glass had been put
into the oven for the last time in order to
be gradually cooled and the operation
being now considered as completed the
friends were as usual admitted in the
midst their congratulations on this unprecedented
success after an unusually
long seclusion the fire by some accident
caught the roof the building on this
alarming occasion all present exerted themselves
 and after some trouble the flames
were extinguished but not before some
water had found its way into the oven and
destroyed its precious contents 
 ah poor m guinand cried lucy
i hope he was more successful the
next time said harry
he was nearly eighty years old
harry said sir rupert and the discouragement
caused by this misfortune and
the great expense those experiments
prevented his attempting any more on a
similar scale before he died i should
have told you that he was a poor watchmaker
in a country village in switzerland
and that neither artists nor philosophers
have ever succeeded in making glass equal
to his
sir rupert laid down the with the
air a man who makes but is willing to
make some sacrifice and he attended his
young friends to the electrical machines
as lucy called it she watched
every thiner that was done harry went
to the handle the slabs cylinder and
was going to turn it but sir rupert stopped
him as he said that he had something to
show lucy first he took up a glass tube
and rubbed it with his silk handkerchief
then holdings it to harry's head lucy saw
the hair rise up and bend towards it and
a feather on the table jumped up and
hung to it as sir rupert held the olass
tube near it
 just like what i have seen harry do
with the glass stopper the decanter after
dinner said lucy and i have seen
the same with a stick sealingwax after
it has been rubbed on a coat sleeve and
i remember long ago when we were
little children that we used to play with
an amber eoor mamma's and that
little bits paper and feathers stuck to it
just so
true said sir rupert this property
 attracting light bodies was observed
in amber hundreds years ago
by the ancients the latin name for
amber which is derived from the greek
is electrum thence our word electric and
electricity all that was originally known
about it to the ancients was this power 
attracting light bodies remember i say
attracting lucy did you observe anything
more when you amused yourself with
your amber qggj and the bits paper and
feathers 
yes said lucy we saw that after a
time they would jump no more they stood
quite still or they jumped back i recollect
do not you harry that they jumped
forward and backward alternately
 that is said sir rupert that they
were alternately attracted and repdltd i
am glad that you observed and have remembered
that you will now understand
what i mean by the repellent as well as
the attractive power amber but this
repellent power was never observed by the
ancients nor known to the modes till
about a hundred and fifty years ago when
it was thought a great discovery
lucy expressed some surprise that this
had never been observed till so lately
sir rupert smiled and said there is more
to be seen and known about amber with
which perhaps you are not yet yourself
acquainted did you ever see sparks ora
flash light come from amber after it
has been rubbed or did you ever hear a
little crackling noise from it
never sir said lucy
nor was it likely that you should
said sir rupert because your amber
egg probably was not a sufficiently large
piece that substance to produce the
effect but sparks have been seen from
a large smooth piece amber and this
observation created much surprise when
first it was made which was about the
same time when its repellent power was
as i told you discovered then the
same properties were observed in jet sulphur
resin and glass and still the same
word the same name electricity was used
to express the supposed cause all these
properties in whatever substance they were
found to those substances in which
after using friction these properties appeared
people gave the name electrics
and to those from which they could not
be obtained by any degree rubbing they
gave the name o nonelectrics amber
sealingwax and glass for instance are
called electrics this table and the poker
for example which you might rub with
your hand for ever without making them
attract light bodies and without obtaining
from them any sparks are called nonelectric
but take care lucy that this
name nonelectrics does not mislead
you into taking it for granted that in nonelectric
there is no electricity when we
come to your brother's favourite experiments
i shall show you that the electric
spark can be obtained from the poker by
other means experiments tried by various
people at different times in afferent countries
within the last sixty years have
ascertained that not only in the poker and
in the table but in every substance in
nature with which we are acquainted
solid or fluid vegetable animal or mineral
in earth air and water electricity is
to be found though in various proportions 
and to be obtained or made apparent to
our senses by different means remember
then that electrics is only the name
given to those bodies from which electricity
cannot be had by friction and
when i use the word electricity i mean
the supposed cause the electrical properties
 bodies i must however observe
that as yet we are imperfectly acquainted
with this science and what is
known i know but a small part and 
that i can explain very little to you however
some the principal facts i can tell
you and some the principal phenomena
or appearances i can show you in the
first place before i say any more we weill
show you some electric sparks and you
shall have an electric shock which you
are so curious to feel turn the handle 
the glass cylinder harry
as he worked it sir rupert showed
lucy that the glass cylinder as it revolved
rubbed against a cushion which was fixed
so as to press hard against it this cushion
he told her is called the rubber instead
 rubbing with the silk handkerchief
as you saw me rub the glass tube friction
is in this manner more conveniently produced

when this had been done sufficiently
harry held his knuckles to a brass knob at
the a tin cylinder belonging to the
machine and which sir rupert told them
was a conductor immediately lucy heard
a slight crackling noise and saw sparks
come either from the brass to harry's
knuckles or from harry's knuckles to the
brass she did not know which they passed
so quickly she followed his example 
and holding her knuckles to the brass knob
felt with some surprise the tingling sensation
produced by the electric spark sir
rupert now told her to stand upon a little
wooden stool with thick glass legs which
he set on the floor near the machine he
desired her to hold a chain the other 
 which was fastened to the conductor
after the handle the glass cylinder had
been again turned sufficiently he told
lucy to give her hand to harry she
exclaimed that she felt the same tingling
sensation she had perceived before on
touching the knob from the conductor
yes said sir rupert you acted
the part a conductor and harry received
an electric spark from you
he now told her to get off the stool 
and said that he would give her an electric
shock if she pleased but warned her that
perhaps she might not like it
then give me only a little shock sir
if you please a very little shock my dear
sir pray 
sir rupert promised that it should be
very slight he desired her to hold in her
lefthand a chain that touched the outside
 a glass jar which sir rupert told her
was a leyden phial he put into her
righthand a bit brass wire with
which he told her to touch the brass
knob fixed on the top the jar she did
so and at that instant she felt a shock
slight as it was it made lucy start violently
at first she thought harry had
given her a blow on the elbow then
holding her elbow fast she said that her
curiosity was satisfied and that if this
was the famous electrical shock she never
desired to feel it aoain
harry could not help laughing a little
at her start and surprise which seemed to
him so much greater than the occasion
deserved recovering lucy began to
look a little ashamed sir rupert observed
for her comfort that great philosophers
had been not a little frightened when
first they felt the electric shock
philosophers sir said harry how
did they show that they were frightened
by the strangely exaggerated accounts
they gave their sensations one gentleman
after his first shock wrote to a friend
that he felt himself so struck in his arms
breast and shoulders that he lost his
breath that he was two days before he
recovered from the effects the blow and
the terror and that he would not take a
second shock for the kingdom france
another after trying the shock from the
leyden phial said his whole body had
been affected with convulsions and that
he felt as if a heavy stone lay upon his
head
lucy hoped it would be remembered
that her little start and first fright had all
been over in a minute or less instead 
lasting two days harry but i suppose
added she that their shocks must have
been much greater than mine
sir rupert said that the shocks they
received could not have been much more
violent than what she had felt
harry asked how he could be sure 
that sir rupert answered that as they
had described the apparatus they used an
estimate could be formed the utmost
power the shock which they could possibly
have received they used only a
small glass bowl said he and not
coated as the ley den phial is now they
had no electrical battery nor any means
by which they could give a powerful
shock
lucy observed that harry was perfectly
satisfied by this answer therefore she was
sure that he understood it but for her
part she did not in the least comprehend
what sir rupert meant she was very
desirous to know more but so many questions
occurred to her that she could scarcely
tell which to ask first she wished to
know why she had been made to stand
upon a stool when she gave harry the
electric sparks or why the stool unlike
all others had legs glass she wished
to know what was the cause her receiving
a shock from touching the knob on
the leyden jar with the wire but her
first question was to sir rupert's surprise
 has this electric shock been really 
any use to sick people or to men or women
in palsies 
sir rupert said lie did not know it
had at first been thought to be medical
service and it was said to have restored
persons to the use their limbs but
afterwards this had been doubted and
the apparent or transient advantage was
ascribed to the effect on the imagination
so far lucy had not obtained much more
actual knowledge than she had had before 
but the diffidence with which sir rupert
spoke gave her an idea the gi'eat caution
and modesty real philosophers'speech so
unlike the rash assertions halfinformed
persons or conceited pretenders to
science
in compliance with harry's request sir
rupert next showed lucy some the first
experiments which harry had seen at his
uncle's which need not be detailed here
as an exact description the experiment
o the pith bails and the pokei and 
the dancing paper figures may be found in
scientific dialogues illustrating the nature
 electric attraction and repulsion lucy
was amused with these experiments but
fl
she could not take in all the explanations 
she became a little confused and puzzled
about conductors and nonconductors
which having candidly confessed sir rupert
advised her to stop assuring her that
he would at another time when her mind
should be rested and refreshed return to
the subject and promising that he would
reward her candour by doing his best to
make it clear to her which he added he
did not doubt but he should be able to
accomplish if she would not either despair
or be in a hurry if she would only
have patience with herself and with him
and allow to both sufficient time and
now said he i shall be glad to return
to my pamphlet and you and your brother
will be glad i think to take a good run
or a walk suppose we take the walk
lady digby was talking across the
fields through copsewood and over the
ford to farmer dobson's ah ha you
like that i never knew young people that
did not prefer a difficult to an easy i
will not say a dirty to a clean walk well 
by the time bonnets and hats and walking
shoes are on and papa and mamma and
lady digby and all assembled in the hall
ready for a march i have a notion i shall
have done my pamphlet and be with you
too
this walk was as rambling and as
scrambling with as many hedges and
ditches to get over and as many bad
passes and unstable stepping stones to
cross as hearts youth could desire or
legs age accomplish
farmer dobson the snuggest yeomen
and the best tenants met the party at
his outermost gate with a warm welcome
for his landlord and his landlord's friends
whomsoever they might be his eye
brightened when he saw young folks
 he had a power his own thank god
for them he said as he opened wide the
house door he loved young folks he
added and requested that they would all
vol c
be so agreeable as to come in and rest
themselves after their long walk
after they had sat for some minutes and
after orchard and poultryyard and farmyard
had been all duly visited and that it
was time to think returning home harry's
and lucy's satisfaction was completed by
the farmer's assuring them that if they
had any disliking to go back the same
road they came they might return quite a
new way by passing through sopha
turnstile and higglesham pike down the
fields reddeer manor and so getting
by the short cut straight up the back way
to the castle
harry listened most attentively to these
directions but as he did not know anyone
 the places named it might have
been even dinner time before they reached
digby castle had he persisted in acting as
avantcourier but he gave up the point
at higglesham pike whence under the
straight forward guidance sir rupert's
cane they reached home by the usual
hour for luncheon
sir rupert looked at his watch and
finding that he had ample time sat down
to write some letters telling harry and
lucy that when the clock should strike
next he would be ready for them at the
electrical machine
punctual as the clock harry and lucy
were opposite to the electrical machine 
and sir rupert equally punctual shut the
door after him ere the clock had done
striking
lucy my dear said sir rupert
i hope you have put out your head
whatever it was that puzzled you about
conductors the name conductors is
given to all substances which conduct electricity
from one body to another those
which will not do this we call nonconductors
is this clear to you
quite clear said lucy do not
know what puzzled me before but i believe
it was that nonconductors are also
sometimes called electrics
yes it has been found that all originally
c 
electric substances are also nonconductors
 electrics and conductors lists have been
made and you may look at them at your
leisure it is enough for our present purpose
to tell you that earth and water are
conductors and so are all the metals 
metallic conductors are the best this
brass chain is one so is that iron rod and
so is this tin tube
lucy saw and understood this and now
hoped they might go on to the leyden jar
my dear lucy said sir rupert
your brother tells me you are fond 
french proverbs did you ever hear faut
reculer pour mieux sauter i must therefore
go back if you please to the reign 
charles the second where i left off just
before harry persuaded me to show you
the experiment the poker many 
the members the royal society which
was at that time first established were at
work on electrical experiments among
others was a philosopher with whose name
you are perhaps acquainted boyle
lucy asked harry if this was his boyle
the great vacuumman 
yes answered harry
he was one the first persons who
had a glimpse electric light continued
sir rupert which he first saw from a
diamond
a diamond sir said lucy i
thought you told us it was first seen in
amber
 i said it was seen in amber but i did
not tell you it was first seen in amber
said sir rupert i should not have mentioned
that out its order in point 
time boyle is supposed to have been one
 the first discoverers electric lioht
he noticed it as he was rubbing diamond
in the dark
but was boyle the first person who
made this discovery said harry doubtingly

perhaps said sir rupert smiling
you claim the honour it for the children
in the arabian tale who wakened
their mother by quarrelling for the diamond
that gave light in the dark
harry and lucy both smiled
but seriously sir said harry did
not otto garrick see sparks and flashes
from his whirling globe sulphur
sparks and flashes he certainly saw
from his sulphur globe but whether before
boyle saw the flash from his diamond
is to this hour a disputed point and i
advise our avoiding all disputes
i am glad it said lucy they
hinder one from getting on
but said harry i thought it was
but justice to settle this and to give boyle
the honour the discovery if it was really
his especially as i love otto so much
very right my honourable friend
said sir rupert preserve that spirit 
justice all your life but for the present
consider that if we were to attempt to
settle all the disputes about priority 
discoveries in electricity we might stand
here all daw and be found in the dark at
last now let us go on and keep safe in
the use the impersonal pronoun it it
was discovered i assure you harry 
am willing to give all due honour to your
favourite otto garrick for the ingenuity
 his whirling globe sulphur to excite
friction by means which he made the
great discovery electric repulsion but
harry it is remarkable that he missed
another discovery which was absolutely
under his hand
 under his hand what how sir v
cried harry
 you recollect or you forget perhaps
continued sir rupert how he made hi
globe he melted the sulphur in a hollow
globe glass and then broke the glass to
get out his sulphur ball little imagining
that the glass which he broke and threw
away was a more highly electric substance
and would have answered his purpose
better than that upon which he was
intent
 that is curious but he could not
tell that beforehand said harry
 no but he might have tried he need
not have taken it for granted that glass is
not electric
harry asked if sir isaac newton who
lived at the same time as boyle and was
one the early members the royal
society had made any discovery in electricity

yes said sir rupert he made one
and but one discovery importance ashe
was rubbing a glass lens he observed
that it became electric on the side the
glass opposite to that on which it was
rubbed this circumstance i did not
mention to you because i cannot explain
its consequence without entering into explanations
that would not suit you at present
we will go on where we were
after the flashes light from the sulphur
globe there was darkness on the subject 
electricity for some time public curiosity
which had been suddenly excited as suddenly
grew tired and fell asleep in england
from the reign charles the second
till the reign queen anne when it was
first wakened i think by mr hawksbee
who set to work by whirling a globe 
glass he also provided himself with a
globe sulphur and one sealingwax
inclosing another wood and he had a
fourth made rosin with all these he tried
experiments the chief result which was
the discovery that all known substances
glass is the most electric this proved the
greatest convenience as well as importance
to science as glass can be so easily moulded
and blown into different forms it was best
adapted to the use every experimenter
and from that time became the principal
part every electrical apparatus in the
form tubes globes cylinders and circular
plates
still philosophers were as much puzzled
about conductors and nonconductors as
you were this morning lucy it was
only by experiments that they were enabled
to settle which were which and many
were tried at this period by two friends
mr wheeler and mr gray who in conc

junction with one another laboured to
ascertain how far they could communicate
electricity to what height and to what
distance from balconies they let down
long hollow canes and in great barns they
stretched wooden rods and strings packthread
sometimes supported by others 
silk with considerable difficulty they
conveyed electricity by these lines 
communication about seven hundred feet
but they were as it seemed still much in
doubt which substances served their purposes
and which did not besides their
imperfect knowledge conductors another
difficulty occurred they found that
the electricity which they communicated
to bodies or which existed in electrics
was dissipated after a short time it was
discovered that these bodies parted with
their electricity to other surrounding objects
 to the earth and to the air they
perceived that their labour must be vain
if as fast as they poured the electric fluid
into the substances on which they were
trying experiments it was lost before they
accomplished their object conveying it to
a distance
some new contrivances were required
to counteract and remedy this inconvenience
they separated as well as they
could the substances on which they were
operating from all others and hung them
from lines dry cotton and silk finding
that these were not conductors some
 their experiments were tried upon
living creatures they suspended a child
by silken lines and tried to communicate
electricity to him they electrified iijin
as you were electrified this morning while
standing on the glasslegged stool and
only felt the tingling sensation you described
but the electric shock had never
yet been felt and though sparks had been
communicated to the human body no one
at this time suspected that electricity
existed in it
public attention in england was fixed
upon these experiments by the lectures 
one whose name harry i think you
know a great mechanic dr defaulters
but it was in france that electricity
now became particularly popular
this was in the reign louis the fifteenth
who was contemporary you know
with our george the second the abbe
colet a very ingenious and celebrated
man began by repeating the english experiments
along with his friend m du
fay whose name is less known i cannot
tell why by using wet packthread for
their line communication they succeeded
in conducting electricity along the
walks a garden above a thousand yards
which was then considered wonderful
at a famous experiment however exhibited
at shooter's hill it has since been
conveyed above four miles i should not
have told you this out due order but
for the honour old england harry i
could not resist i beg the abbe nollet's
pardon he succeeded as i told you in
communicating electricity above a thousand
yards by means a line wet
packthread the general observation had
long been made by gray and others that
moisture assisted in the communication 
electricity yet it had never occurred to
them that water was a conductor now it
was ascertained that water is a good conductor

the abbe nollet and his friend m du
fay repeated gray's experiment suspending
living creatures by lines silk
and setting them on cakes rosin or
stools glass as nonconductors for the
purpose preventing the electricity communicated
to them from beings carried down
to the earth this was called insulating
them placing them as it were in an
island m du fay had himself suspended
in lines silk and electrified and delighted
he was but infinitely more so
when to his surprise he saw what no
one had ever before seen a spark electric
fire drawn from the human body
the abbe nollet declared he never could
forget the astonishment he felt when first
he saw a spark electric fire come from
a human creature
this experiment and others upon
electric attraction and repulsion were immediately
repeated before the french academy
 sciences curiosity was raised among
all ranks in paris and crowds people
flocked to see them exhibited as it had
been discovered that electricity could be
conveyed from one person as well as from
one inanimate substance to another people
stood hand in hand in circles to be electrified
and the novelty and surprise the
effect were entertaining to all
did they feel a shock such as i had
this morning asked lucy
 no not a shock said sir rupert 
only that slighter sensation which was
attended by the snapping noise that you
heard when the sparks came from your
hand to the brass knob and from the brass
knob to your hand as to the electric
shock that was not learnt till the discovery
 the ley den phial but the abbe
colet's experiments were sufficiently wonderful
at that time to produce general admiration
franklin was then as well as i
recollect at paris and saw nobles experiments
when he returned to america
his powerful mind set to work on the subject
with all the requisites that could
promise i might almost say humanlyspeaking
ensure success acute observation
indefatigable patience and great caution
in trying experiments with the habits
 close reasoning and active invention
but i must not let enthusiasm for franklin
draw me out my course it is not yet
time to follow him to the country which
he is the glory first justice calls me to
holland now lucy we come to the
leyden jar but for one moment more let
me try your patience it is very difficult to
be patient i know when just in sight 
your object
lucy's eye glanced at the tray full 
jars which she saw near the electrical
machine before her but she forbore to ask
any question she stood an edifying example
 patience and the admiration 
harry
i must say a word or two to you
my patient lucy continued sir rupert
about this electrical machine you do
not imagine that it came into the world as
you now see it ready armed with conductors
and provided with all that could
fit it for the service electrical philosophers
far from it this machine such
as you now see it is the result the combined
observation ingenuity and labour
 a succession philosophers who have
been at work for above one hundred and
fifty years trying experiments on electricity
 and in fact this machine contains
the evidence and register their progress
when the name and the knowledge electricity
was confined to one substance no
apparatus was necessary the man rubbed
his piece amber with his hand or on
the sleeve his coat and his business
was done with this he could see and
show all the wonders which he knew
the existence but when knowledge increased
and when the lists electric
substances and conductors swelled and
lenotenet when experiments were to be
tried with globes glass and conductors
 metal with balls and points and lines
 silk all these things were by degrees
arranged into the form you see a cylinder
 glass is used in this machine instead
 a globe it is found that this
shape is preferable lucy do you now
perceive the use the glass legs to the
stool on which we placed you when you
were electrified and when you gave a spark
to harry 
lucy said she thought that they were to
prevent the electricity from being carried
down to the earth glass being a nonconductor
she supposed that she was put
upon it for the same reason that the manor
boy to be electrified was set upon the
cake rosin
you reward me for my pains said
sir rupert or rather you complete my
pleasure in teaching you lucy for you
show me that you have been attending
and that you have perfectly understood all
that i have been saying
harry looked far prouder than if praised
himself
now i hope the leyden jar will not
disappoint you after all continued sir
rupert it was so called simply because
it was invented at ley den and by
means a phial or small bottle its properties
were discovered by a dutchman 
the name muschenbroek about eighty
years ago and in this manner having
observed like all those who had tried experiments
on the subject that electrified
bodies when exposed to the atmosphere
soon lose their electricity and were capable
 retaining but a small portion he
determined to try whether he could not
prevent this loss and whether he could
accumulate a greater quantity by surrounding
the substance to which electricity
was to be communicated by some nonconductor
instead suspending it in the air
as formerly by silk lines or supporting it
upon rosin or glass the experiment
could be simply tried with water and glass 
he chose water as being a powerful conductor
and glass as it is the most perfect
electric and nonconductor electricity
was to be communicated from a metal
conductor to the water in a glass phial
when the water had received as much
electricity as it was supposed that it could
contain the person who had the phial in
one hand was going with his other hand
to disengage an iron wire which communicated
from the water to the principal
conductor but the moment he touched
that wire he was surprised by a sudden
shock in his arms and breast the first
ever felt from any electric machine and 
which such exaggerated descriptions were
given as i repeated to you this morning
but how did it happen said harry
 what was the cause the shock
sir i
that said sir rupert i dare not
even attempt to explain to you you must
be contented at present with the simple fact
this astonishing experiment gave sudden
celebrity and popularity to electricity accounts
 it were written to every country
where science could penetrate all persons
were eager to feel the shock notwithstanding
the terrible account it
numbers people made their livelihood by
going about and exhibiting it in every part
 europe philosophers all went to
work to repeat the experiment and to try
to account for what had happened many
theories or suppositions were formed but
as dr priestley says in his account it
the circumstances attending it remain in
many respects inexplicable and the experiment
is to this day justly viewed with
astonishment by the most profound electricians
since the first discovery the
ley den phial its power has been increased
by coating it to a certain height with tinfoil
both with inside and without and it
soon became an essential part an electrical
apparatus an electrical battery
such as you see in the machine before you
or as you lucy called it a tray full 
jars is formed several leyden jars
connected together by conductors so as
to increase prodigiously the power and accumulation
 electricity
 to console you harry for not attempting
to explain what i cannot explain
i will describe what i can describe the
electric kite franklin his delight and
astonish merit were great on hearing the
leydenjar he repeated the experiment
his ardour increased in pursuit electrical
discovery and a most brilliant discovery
soon rewarded his genius and perseverance
some points in which the flash
and sound electricity seemed to resemble
thunder and lightning had early occurred
to him and he now resolved to examine
the truth his conjecture by experiments
but harry it is very important to inform
you that several other people had long before
been on the brink this discovery 
had actually touched it but had let it go
the man who first saw the electric light a
hundred and fifty years before this time
said and wrote that the crackling noise and
flash reminded him thunder and lightning
 but he pursued the idea no further
at a more advanced period our electrical
knowledge their identity with thunder
and lightning was again suggested by
others but franklin when once the
happy thought occurred to him pursued it
unremittingly and has left us what is almost
as valuable as his discovery an account
 the reasoning by which his mind
arrived at that grand truth this harry
you will be curious to know hereafter
 i am curious to know it now sir
cried harry will you tell it me 
no that is not in my promise said
sir rupert that would lead me too faraway
from my present engagement to lucy
this much to please you i will mention
that franklin argued thus with himself if
lightning be the same as electricity it will
obey the same laws it can be managed
by the same means if there be electric
fire in a thunder cloud it may be attracted
and brought down to the earth by some
 those substances which are found to
conduct it he therefore made a kite a
silk handkerchief stretched on a light cross
 wood with an iron wire pointing upwards
the string was twine to the
 the string he tied a silk ribbon and
where the silk and twine joined he fastened
a key lucy can you tell me why he tied
a silk ribbon below the key why did not
he hold the kite by the key
because the key would be a conductor
and bring the lightning down to his hand
but the ribbon would stop it because silk
as you told me is a nonconductor
 very true said sir rupert but
harry why did not he hold the kite by ths
twine 
because perhaps he thought sir said
harry that if it rained and if the twine
should be wet in the thunder shower it
would like the weet packthread used formerly
conduct the lightning down to his
hand
just so harry all that he had foreseen
happened and all the precautions he
had taken succeeded in preventing danger
his kite went up as soon as a thundercloud
came over it the electrical matter in
the cloud was attracted by the iron wire
conductor it rained the string was wet
the lightning ran along the string to the
key and there was stopped from going onto
his hand by the silk ribbon
oh i am glad it cried lucy i
am glad he succeeded he deserved success

 he afterwards applied this discovery
to a useful purpose upon the same principle
as that his electric kite he attached
rods or chains iron to buildings and
connecting them with the earth the electric
fire the clouds was safely conducted
there and away from all it could injure
and here at this excellent application 
the discovery i will leave you my young
friends i cannot leave you with an impression
more favourable to science
but sir said harry could not you
go on i do not say now but another day
could not you go on to the discoveries made
since that time and then to galvanism and
magnetism 
no harry i cannot i will not said
sir rupert
but sir rupert could not you at
least be so good as to explain to lucy what
i now recollect was a thing that puzzled
me the difference between positive and negative
electricity you never mentioned
them is it not necessary to understand
what they mean v
necessary to the knowledge the
science electricity certainly said sir
rupert but you know i did not undertake
to teach you that
no but i wish you would said
both harry and lucy
come with me and i will show you
how impossible it is for me to fulfil your
wish
they followed and he led them to the
library their father who was writing a
letter looked up as they came in and
saw sir rupert go to one the bookcases
and take down two volumes one them
a very thick quarto these he laid on the
library table before harry and lucy
to give some idea said he the
quantity that has been written and may be
vol 
read and learned upon the subject electricity
look at these volumes
harry's father looked at the titles
oh sir rupert what have you done 
it is all over with harry now thought he
and sighed
one these volumes the largest 
them was the very which harry had
sat up a night to read his eyes grew
round the moment he espied it again
and pouncing upon it he neither saw
nor heard any thing more not even his
father's sigh
poor innocent sir rupert equally unconscious
 the delight and the alarm
he had given to father and son stood considering
lucy with whom also as his ill
fate would have it his intended good lesson
was not operating as he had designed
he had expected that lucy would have
been completely awed by the sight the
bulk these volumes and that by turning
over the pages and the titles he could
have soon proved to her how vain an attempt
it must be for her to master such a
voluminous subject but it chanced that
the lesser the quartos was left to her
and immediately turning to its excellent
index she found ani electrical parti 
pleasures and a bill fare that quickened
her appetite amazingly as she read 
 electrical eel electrical dinner 
dinner electricians the turkey to be
killed by an electrical shock roasted by
an electrical jack before a fire kindled by
an electric spark the healths all the
company to be drank in electrified bumpers
under the discharge an electrical
battery 
 very good philosophical nonsense after
all said sir rupert addressing himself
to harry's father and not clearly understanding
the cause the uneasiness
visible in his countenance franklin
well knew how to catch and fix the attention
 young and old there is no harm
is there in her amusing herself with
these things she will soon find what she
can understand and what she cannot
d 
her father assented but still the uneasiness
in his countenance continuing sir
rupert added
 she is too sensible a girl to pretend to
know what she does not know she will
never i will venture to say turn out one
 those mere index hunters who some
witty poet describes as catching the eel
 science by the tail but let young
people catch the eel any way they can so
that they do but catch it
 but we must be sure that they can
hold it afterwards said her father
 true true you are right and i was
wrong misled by my own simile as reasoners
fond similes usually are said
the candid sir rupert
 harry said his father harry
started
i am sorry to see you at that 
again
 i am sorry that you are sorry father
said harry in some confusion
you recollect what happened last year
harry you lost a whole month your
life trying to make an electrical machine
i found your head so full that that
i could get nothing else into it like an
intellectual glutton you had devoured till
your mind had an indigestion and absolutely
could not stir
but i am a year older now and a
year wiser i hope you shall see how
moderate i will be if you will let me finish
the while i am here i will read it
only one hour before breakfast and i
really think i deserve that father because
from the time you stopped me i not only
put it quite out my head but never
mentioned it or electricity even to lucy
till just now when she showed me the
electrical machine and then indeed it
all came out
 and it was all my fault said lucy
there is no fault in the case mv
dear children said their father let
us consider only what is best for
you
harry closed his and without uttering
a word returned it to sir rupert
with proud submission and dignified humility

i will give you my reasons as well as
my advice harry said his father for you
are a reasonable creature and wherever
practicable opinion should be supported
by reasons even from age to youth even
from a father to his son
i advise you my dear son to defer
the pleasure reading that entertaining
 and to reserve electricity altogether
as a study for a later period your life 
because in the first place you have not
time for it at present you have many
things more necessary to learn more essential
to the progress your education 
in other words essential to your acquiring
that strength understanding which can
alone enable you to advance in knowledge
hereafter neither boy nor man can embrace
all the sciences at once you are
now learning those which are in a state 
certainty as far as human certainty goes 
electricity as a science is in but an imperfect
state since that has been
written many discoveries have been made
new and vast views have been opened ot
which at this moment none can even guess
the termination many the theories
adopted as certain when that was
published are now considered as obsolete
or what is worse unfounded
i beg your pardon for interrupting
you father said harry but the facts
proved by experiments must remain the
same must not they as far as they go t 
 true harry replied his father as
far as they go they remain the same but
the explanations the phenomena the
reasonings on these experiments and the
conclusions formed from them have varied
in consequence later information and
will vary from day to day as fresh experiments
and newer discoveries are made 
so that supposing harry you gave up
every thing else in order to make yourself
master all the knowledge in this
thick quarto and granting that you accomplished
this object in what condition
would you be not up to the modern
state the science far from it on the
contrary not in nearly so good a condition
for advancing as you are in at this moment
because you would have much to
unlearn and false notions and favourite
prepossessions to lay aside if you postpone
reading this work for some years the
science will probably have taken a more
stable form then go on with electricity if
you will when you are able to distinguish
truth from error you will read
this with infinite advantage and you
will find it not only an excellent history 
this particular science but an admirable
view the progress the human mind
in making discoveries and an invaluable
lesson in the errors as well as the efforts 
the human understanding have i satisfied
you harry 
satisfied oh thank you my dear
fathers said harry
there were certain nephews and nieces
 lady digby's whom sir rupert had
once mentioned regretting that they could
not be at digby castle while harry and
lucy were there by some new arrangement
 journeying it was however discovered
to be quite possible that they could
now come to spend three whole days
when this was announced harry to say
the truth felt more sorry than glad he
knew that the pleasures the workshop
and the laboratory must be given up
and that they could not hope to have so
much sir rupert's conversation and instruction
 besides harry was not naturally
inclined to like strangers nevertheless
when they arrived he liked them tolerably
well even the first evening the
party consisted a father and mother
two daughters and three sons the
boys one was about harry's age the
others younger the young ladies were
older than lucy almost grown up and
quite unaffected goodhumoured and gay
when they went out to walk all together
they became well acquainted and soon
joined in various amusements as they
d 
s
were standing on the bowlinggreen one
 the boys observed that there were bowls
in the alcove his brothers ran for them
and all began to play at bowls its being
rather an oldfashioned game was no objection
 but the young ladies found the
bowls rather heavy and cumbersome on
hearing this lady digby suddenly recollected
a ball a new sort which she had
brought from london thinking it would
be agreeable to some her young friends
she went for it and returned bearing in
her hand a ball as large as lucy's head
and a beautiful light brown colour
it looked transparent it felt light as a
feather sir rupert bid harry try if it
would bound well harry struck it on the
ground and it rebounded high over the
heads the admiring circle higher as all
declared than ever ball was seen to bound
before all inquired eagerly what
is it made all examined it and guessed
but none guessed rightly sir rupert told
them that it was made caoutchouc which
is naturally very elastic but by a new and
ingenious mode preparation it may be
blown out to almost any size
 this ball then is filled with nothing
but air so that it is no wonder that it
should be light said lucy
sir rupert said that he had seen such
balls in a shop the day before he left
town they were then quite new things
while the showman was showing him how
well one them rebounded it suddenly
disappeared and for some time could nowhere
be found at last it was discovered
in a comer a shrunk shrivelled bao it
had struck upon a nail a young person
who was in the shop suggested that a
covering leather might preserve such
balls from similar disasters in future sir
rupert did not know whether this advice
had been followed but he had little doubt
that the ball would become popular it was
much admired by the present company for
its elasticity its beauty and its safety for
with this they could play even in the
house without danger to windows or to
lookingglasses
they played with their new ball till by
chance it fell among the branches a tree
one the young alloys lady digby's
nephews climbed the tree with great
agility to bring it down some one said
he vas as active as a harlequin and this
led another to mention a harlequin entertainment
he had lately seen and from harlequin
entertainments they talked pantomimes
and it was proposed that they
should act pantomimes this evening
harry and lucy had never tried but
they were very willing to take any part
proposed to them they understood that
the thing to be done was to represent by
action without speaking any well known
story or character or event in fiction
poetry or history after having assisted in
some subordinate parts their companions
begged harry and lucy to choose some
subjects for themselves they proposed
several but from want experience their
choice was seldom happy
harry's first thought was william tell
and the tyrant who ordered him to shoot

at an apple placed on his son's head
harry was provided with a bow and arrows
for william tell a tyrant was
easily found but who could stand for the
child harry stuffed a little coat with
straw and lucy made it a head and put a
hat on and the apple was set on the hat
but harry could not hit the apple and the
stuffed child tumbled on its nose and when
its hat fell off there was an william
tell
miss mallory recommended the favourite
stories in english history alfred
disguised as a minstrel in the danish
camp and alfred in the old woman's
cottage the new performers had
good success harry in the character 
alfred wasted and burned the cakes with
wellacted carelessness and lucy's box on
the ear was capital but these had been
acted rather too often at digby castle to
have the charm novelty
lucy was resolved now to choose quite
a new subject and she thought one from
the new arabian tales xailoun surnamed
the silly who was desired by his
wife to change himself and who never
could find out what she meant but nobody
was acquainted with xailoun or his
follies this was as much too new as the
other subjects were too old
lucy next proposed surely an unexceptionable
scene the parting hector and
andromache harry to be hector and
miss mallory andromache for she
acts so well said lucy and i act so
ill but i think i could be the nurse soit
was arranged hector provided himself
with a dazzling helm and nodding
crest to scare the young astyanax but
unluckily though they had chosen the
least the children from the porter's
lodge the child was too old to cling
crying to the nurse's breast obviously
too large for nurse mother or father
the young astyanax besides was
terribly awkward he would keep his
thumb in his mouth notwithstanding all
his nurse could do to hold down his hand
astyanax began to kick and pushed his
father from him in the midst andromache's
distress there was no standing
the contrast hector and andromache
parted more abruptly than they had intended
and left the nurse to get off astyanax
as she could
they were more successful in ulysses
and euryclea lucy was admirable as
euryclea and started finely at the sight 
the scar but this was too short one
start is not enough to make a good pantomime
harry proposed to lengthen it by
placing penelope at her loom and shooting
the suitors at their riotous feast a feast
is always a good thing for acting as frederic
mallory observed and his eldest sister
who was tall and graceful would act penelope
beautifully her mother's shawl and
veil happily disposed converted her into
the queen ithaca in a trice and when
harry had taught her to weave and unweave
she bent over her loom with dignity
and pensive sat and mourned by
lamplight in the great hall but a penelope
was nothing without suitors vain
was the bow ulysses for he had nobody
to shoot only three suitors could
be had the three young alloys and
they were dressing for the forty thieves
an experienced manager however suggesting
that the suitors might be supposed
to be feasting in the diningroom he left
the door half open between them and the
queen ulysses looked in and frowned
and twanged his bow at them through the
door way with fine tragic effect
harry and lucy found that in the pantomimic
art as in all others actual experiment
is necessary in the selection subjects
as well as in the mode execution
one general remark was made that the
caliph haroun alraschid and his vizier
giafar were constantly well received so
were zobeide and her favourite with the long
unpronounceable name nouzhatoul aoua
dat there was something in the turban
and in the eastern costume which was becoming
 this prepossessed the spectators
favourably at first sight besides the effect
 the complete disguise upon the actors
themselves gave them courage the only
part in which harry felt at ease was in
giafar his black face was as good asa
mask behind which his own was safely
concealed when thus thoroughly incognito
the little actors can forget themselves
and be what they represent
it is peculiarly difficult to act any part approaching
to our own character or touching
upon our real tastes this truth lucy
was made sensible by a mistake she fell into
in the choice a character for harry
she persuaded him to act archimedes
it did not suit him at all lucy acted
the soldier bravely with a drawn sword
brandished high over his head but harry
was a very awkward archimedes at his problem
 and this was the more mortifying
because there was not time to prepare
another part for him it was the last night
and too late to act any thing else it was
disagreeable to with a failure
harry and lucy however showed so
much good humour upon this as well as
upon many other occasions during these
plays that though they failed in most 
their attempts at acting they succeeded in
making themselves liked by their young
companions the good nature and perfect
freedom from little jealousies displayed
by the whole party made them all
happy together and harry and lucy
agreed on the morning when their young
friends were leaving them that the visit
had been very pleasant though it had interrupted
them in their own little pursuits
such interruptions are good for us all
they prevent us from becoming selfish 
they teach us to turn readily and in an
obliging manner from one thing to another
and further show us that there are
many ways employing the time and 
occupying the mind different from our
own and yet which tend to the same ends
utility and happiness
the carriage drove from the door and
by the time the sound the wheels was
out hearing harry and lucy who
were standing in the porch heard in the
hall the short little bark a dog and
then that sort noise which is made by
a provoked cat which ould fain call
by a more genteel name than spitting
if we could find any that would better
suit the action the short bark they
knew to be that sir rupert's own little
terrier dustfoot the other sound they
suspected to come from the housekeepers
great persian cat selima who was rather
a spiteful creature
oh the ball the ball hamr cried
lucy
harry ran to the rescue at that instant
there was silence the dog had the
great ball between his paws the cat with
her backup hair erect tail still eyes glaring
stood and looked while harry patting
the dogs head with one hand drew away
the ball with the other but with a sudden
spring the cat darted forward and set
her paw upon it harry seizing hold 
her leg shook it and loosened the claw 
she gave him one scratch and seemed
to meditate another lucy then advanced
unfurled her parasol full in the
creature's face and straight selima fled to
her regions below no shame for cat to
fly before that terror which has ere now
scared the most furious the tiger race
the ball is safe said harry after
careful examination selima's vile claws
have not gone through it has had a narrow
escape in future we will put it in a
place safety
while harry looked round to decide
where that place safety should be lucy
patted dustyfoot who stood wagging his
tail apparently much satisfied with himself
for having so well defended his masters
property but he suddenly sprung from
beneath her hands and darting to an opening
door ran to meet his master sir rupert
had the key the laboratory in his
hand which he held up to harry and
lucy and they followed him with the
speed dustyfoot
harry was going to inquire where they
should secure the ball but sir rupert interrupted
him by asking
 what is the matter with that bleeding
hand yours which is tied up in your
handkerchief
 only a scratch sir answered harry
in his cutthemattershort tone lucy
desired no better than to fight the battle
oer again
 but after all harr said lucy i
wish you would let me put some court
plaster on the scratch she had one
precious bit in her pocketbook which she
produced no harry would not hear 
 it court plaster would never stick
upon him he said
 a man must never mind a scratch 
that i have known ever since i was four
years old said sir rupert nevertheless
since i have come to man's estate i
have found that scratches are troublesome
when they fester and if you will take my
advice harry accept your sister's offer
you will be able to do nothing in the laboratory
with your hand muffled up in that
fashion
this was an unanswerable argument
whereupon harry surrendered his hand 
but he persisted in his objections to court
plaster goldbeater's skin was the only
thing which would stick on his wounds
sir rupert recollected that in edward's
press some might be found edward's
press as everybody knows was in the laboratory
sir rupert unlocked it observing
that as in his son's absence he
was sole guardian and administrator his
effects he had no scruples in administering
this
lucy opened her eyes at the sight a
piece goldbeater's skin a foot wide and
a quarter a yard long she cut off the
strip she wanted inquiring at the same
time what goldbeater's skin was sir rupert
told her that this skin so called from
its being used by gold beaters was the inner
membrane one the intestines 
an ox narrow slips which are joined
simply by moistening and laying the
edges over each other he added that
the gold was first flattened between steel
rollers then beaten out between leaves 
parchment with broad heavy hammers 
and lastly reduced to the proper degree 
thinness between pieces this membrane
by beating them with lighter hammers
lucy next asked why edward had such
a store this among his valuables did
he cut his fingers so very often as to need
such a provision 
sir rupert told her that edward had it
for a very different purpose for mending
balloons at the word balloon delight and
eager curiosity glowed in harry's and
in lucy's faces
oh sir cried harry did he ever
send up a balloon 
 only some very small ones with
which we were trying some experiments
well even a small one said lucy
i should like to see for i never saw a
balloon in my life
sir rupert went back to edward's press
and took down from the hook on which it
hung a bag or bladder about the size a
man's head
harry observed it was thinner than any
bladder he had ever seen it was a ready
formed globe in which he could discover
no joining he asked what it was made
 from what he had heard about the
caoutchouc ball he began to suspect that
this little balloon might be the same
substance
 animal or vegetable sir asked
he
animal answered sir rupert he
told them it was the craw a turkey
harry began to blow into it to swell it
out that they might see its full extent
sir rupert desired him to take care what
he was about and to handle it gently for
it was one his son's most precious valuables
it was the craw an uncommonly
large norfolk turkey and had been
peculiarly well prepared some skill and
care were necessary he observed in the
cleansing and preparation he knew that
his housekeeper had spoiled several before
the art had been attained so completely as
to render them thus inoffensive to smell
and so light as to be the balloon maker's
lucy admired its delicate texture and
 weight harry observed that there
had been several little tiny holes in it not
larger than pin holes which had been
carefully patched
yes as sir rupert said it had been in
truth most carefully patched he had seen
his son at it for half a day sir rupert
bid them guess how edward had contrived
to detect all these small fractures which
were scarcely discernible before the patches
had marked their situation
lucy thought that in the first place he
must have blown air into the craw so as
to swell it out nearly to its utmost extent
and then he might have pressed it to discover
where the air came out and there he
must have applied his patches
 this was the way he first tried said
vol e
sir rupert but his feeling was not acute
enough he was obliged to think another
method can you invent what that
was r
lucy at this moment saw a bit downy
feather which was floating in the air as
sir rupert observed her eye caught by it
he said that is a good idea lucy
edward held a bit down as light as this
to the parts the balloon where he suspected
there were holes and as he pressed
the balloon the motion the light filaments
gave him notice the place from
whence the air issued but this dovn was
not sufficiently sensitive to detect the
smallest holes
perhaps said harry edward went
round it with a lighted taper holding the
flame as near to the surface as he could
without endangering its safety and at
whatever place he perceived that the flame
 the candle was blown he must have been
sure that there was a hole
 you are right harry said sir rupert
 this way succeeded very welland
still better when he fixed the light
and turned the globe round so that he
might try each part in succession
 but why was it necessary to fill up
every little hole so excessively carefully
asked harry my uncle's balloon went
up very well without all that care
sir rupert asked what size it was
and with what it was filled
it was about ten feet in diameter answered
harry it was filled with hot
air from a fire lighted straw over which
its mouth was held
sir rupert explained to him that the
turkey's craw was to be filled with hydrogen
gas which is much more difficult to
confine than the common heated air that
had been used for filling the balloon
harry had seen at his uncle's
lucy was very much afraid that harry
would ask some further question befoi'c
she should have time to make a petition
which was on her lips and which was
keeping her breathless with anxiety
 well my dear lucy said sir rupert
e
taking compassion upon her say whatever
you want to say
 i wish i could see a balloon go up
cried lucy and the vehemence the exclamation
expressed the strength the
wish
then you shall if we can manage to
send one up for you said kind sir rupert
but only this squall one i have no other 
will this content you 
oh yes thank you sir said lucy
any one for i never saw any
sir rupert asked how it had happened
that she had not seen that which harry saw
at his uncle's 
 because she was not there it was at
the time her long visit to aunt pierrepoint
harry said and i hope she will
never be away so long again
then turning to the balloon harry's and
lucy's attention anxiously waited for what
sir rupert should say next to their great
satisfaction he determined on filling the
little balloon that very day he would immediately
look for the materials for making
the hydrogen gas and explain the process
which was very simple he said
that he knew he might leave them to
harry's care though it was not to everyone
 his age that sulphuric acid should
be trusted
harry and lucy in the same breath
though in different tones said thank
you oh thank you sir
but before we go to the sulphuric
acid sir said harry could you be so
kind as to tell us something more about
balloons i mean their use i have seen
only one and know very lite about them
from what you said just now said
lucy i understand that there are different
kinds i should like to know how they
differ but what i particularly wish to
hear is how balloons were invented if you
would be so very good as to begin at the
very beginning their history
 then i must go back again to the
reign charles h my dear said sir rupert
 and even to an earlier period about
four hundred years before his time whenas
the biographical dictionary makers
would tell novi flourished one roger bacon
not the great philosopher bacon but a
monk a most ingenious man with whose
name perhaps harry is acquainted he
who made that brazen head which is said
to have pronounced the words time is
time was time will be whether his
brazen head ever pronounced these words
or any other i will not take upon me to
decide you may judge the probability
for yourselves added he smiling
 but what is more certain he made a discovery
which was scarcely less extraordinary
 gunpowder and it was he who
invented lucy what is more in your way
and will please you better the camera obscura
it was this roger bacon that first
suggested the possibility a machine
by which a man might mount into the
air but none believed him some
hundred years as usual passed between
the first suggestion and accomplishment
 a great invention nothing more was
done or attempted after roger the great's
time till the days that constellation 
scientific men who shone forth at the first
establishment our royal society in
charles the second's reign
at that period there arose another bold
genius the name wilkins a daring
inventor who rather imprudently published
before he had actually tried the
experiment that he should soon be able
to fly with wings his own contrivance
by the aid these wings he was not only
to raise but sustain himself in the air and
to travel in a flying chariot which by mechanical
means he promised himself he
could guide at pleasure and raise or
lower by the movement his wings
he further prophesied that in future
times men would travel through the air
as commodiously and as easily as on the
water or on the earth and that the day
would come when people would call for
their wings in setting out on a journey as
commonly as men call for their boots
those were his words and they have been
too often repeated in scorn projectors
and inventors
i am sorry said harry that he was
so imprudent as to boast before hand
whatever he might hope did he try any
experiment 
 he tried and tried but 
let him try or wood or wire
he never got two inches higher
i am sorry for it repeated harry
i cannot bear when ingenious men do
not succeed in their inventions for then
stupid people laugh at them
therefore ingenious men should be
prudent harry and not bolt out their inventions
before they have tried them the
wings did not answer and as there appeared
to be little probability that his audacious
prophecy would ever be fulfilled
the world both learned and unlearned
joined in laughing at wilkins and at his
wings send his voyage to the moon even
philosophers deemed it beyond the powers
 mechanism or science for man to mount
and sustain his flight in the air and common
people expressed their sense the
impracticability or visionary nature any
scheme by saying it is as impossible as
to fly or to mount above the clouds
yet this was not impossible for science
at last exclaimed harry triumphantly
about the same time continued sir
rupert an ingenious jesuit the name
 lana laying aside the idea wings
thought mounting in the air on thin
hollow copper globes in which he had
produced a vacuum
 a vacuum very ingenious cried
harry did he succeed 
 no poor man he failed with all his
ingenuity he did not know how to make
his vacuum perfect enough besides the
weight his copper balls was too great 
and when he made them very thin the
pressure the atmosphere drove them
inwards and destroyed them
ah there was no resistance within
said harry who came next 
 another ingenious man galen who
e 
wrote a little in which he plainly
said that if any lighter kind air than
the common atmosphere could be found
and if a bag were filled with it people
might mount by means it into the air
that is exactly the description a
balloon is not it sir said harry
 yes but he never discovered this
lighter kind air said sir rupert
 he only said said lucy
his principle however was quite
right but there it remained no one applied
or pursued it for another century till
at last the simplest observation imaginable
led again to the right point from observing
the smoke rising in the air and
clouds floating in the atmosphere it occurred
to montgolfier 
montgolfier exclaimed lucy now
i know we are coming to real balloons
it occurred to montgolfier continued
sir rupert that if he could confine the
smoke or the cloud in a bag it would rise
into the air and that if he could fill the
bag with it on earth he could mount along
with it to the skies pursuing these ideas
he observed that air when heated is
lighter than when not heated because it is
more expanded more rarefied and he resolved
to try heated air for his balloon 
now he has it cried harry
yes said sir rupert when filled
with heated air up it went then his
next ambition was to make a balloon that
should not only rise itself but carry him
up also for this purpose it was necessary
to ascertain what size would give it
sufficient power when the capacity a
balloon is such that the difference between
the weight the lioht heated air that it
couta'uhs and that the heavier atmospheric
air which it displaces is exactly
equal to the united weijjhts the man
the car and the balloon then that balloon
will just float in the air but as we find
that the atmosphere is gradually thinner
and lighter in proportion as we rise above
the earth so it becomes necessary to
make the balloon considerably larger in
order to ascend to anv rreat elevation
the difference between these weights is
called the ascension power and you see
harry continued sir rupert how necessary
it was for this great inventor to
know how to calculate with exactness or
he would never have mounted in triumph
into the air as he did
 he did mount then cried lucy oh
yes i know he did
this balloon was filled with air rarefied
or heated by a fire straw made underneath
it continued sir rupert and
crowds spectators assembled at paris to
see the first public experiment which completely
succeeded but i need not describe
it as accounts it can be read in
so many books in prose and in verse
but how did he keep up asked
harry for when the outside air cooled
the heated air inside his balloon he must
have come down
very true harry but then he carried
fire up with him fastened to the bottom
 the balloon to keep the air within
constantly rarefied
was not that very dangerous t said
lucy
 it was said sir rupert those
fire balloons are very dangerous
and besides said harr how could
they carry up weight fuel enough to
supply the fire 
yes that was another difficulty said
sir rupert
and how were all these difficulties
conquered said harry
they are not all conquered yet answered
sir rupert but some improvements
have been made
 by what means sir said harry
 principally by chemical means long
before the time jniontgolfier philosophers
had discovered a kind air or gas
that was much lighter than atmospheric
air it was first called inflammable air
from its property easily inflaming but
now it is called hijdrogeti gas
then still even that was dangerous
said lucy
yes said sir rupert but it only
b
inflames when it conies in contact with
flame if we keep it from this it is safe
 well that was much better said
lucy than carrying up fire flaming under
the balloons then they filled them with
this hydrogen
not for some time first one man
said it might be tried and another man
tried it but only in blowing large soap
bubbles at last three ingenious chemists
employed this gas in filling a large balloon
which was made silk and well varnished
to keep it from escaping
 and i hope that kept it in tight said
lucy for then the man might stay up in
the air as long as he pleased
it kept it in too well said sir rupert 
as it rose very high the outward pressure
 the atmosphere became so much less
that the gas expanded with great force
and having no way to escape the silk
burst and down fell the balloon
and the poor men said lucy what
became them 
 they did not go up in it said sir
rupert but the experiment succeeded
so well that the inventors resolved to try
it again and this time to go up themselves
for now having considered what caused
the accident they thought that they had
found out a way preventing it from happening
again
sir rupert paused to give harry time
to think what way
harry said to himself the balloon
burst because the gas could not get out
when it expanded perhaps sir said
he they put a valve to their balloon
something like the safetyvalve a steamengine
so that they could let some it
out when they liked
just so said sir rupert
this succeeded then said lucy
 how far did they go 
 about a league as well as i remember
said sir rupert 
only a league three miles said
lucy i thought people had gone much
farther in balloons
much farther some time afterwards
said sir rupert one man crossed the
sea from england to france and another
went three hundred miles in a few hours 
seven i think
three hundred miles in seven hours 
that is real flying said lucy
i wish i had been with him said
harry
he was in great danger said sir
rupert he went up at night his
balloon was filled with this inflammable
gas and illuminated by several lamps
hung round it
how beautiful it must have been
cried lucy
but very dangerous said harry
for how could he let out the gas when
it was necessary the lamps would have
set it on fire
he was not quite so imprudent as you
think said sir rupert he had provided
a contrivance for keeping the hydrogen
safe from the lamps as well as to
permit his letting it out occasionally during
his voyage but it happened that at the
time his balloon was filling the mob 
paris crowded round it and they were so
impatient that they would have torn it to
pieces if he had delayed they would not
even give him time to adjust his apparatus
to the safety valve he rose with unexampled
rapidity high above the clouds 
the balloon suddenly expanded he saw
the danger but from fear the lamps he
dared not let out the hvdrooen it swelled
more he saw it must burst in another
minute what did he do harry
he put out the lamps answered
harry
 yes said sir rupert with one
hand he stretched to the lamps and extinguished
as many as he could reach
while with the other he tore a rent in the
balloon to let out the gas the inflammable
air was discharged in great quantities
and thus his presence mind saved
him
great presence mind indeed said
lucy i wonder how people can think
at all up in clouds at that terrible height
and no possible assistance near them
she wished to hear more entertaining
adventures people who had gone upon
voyages discovery in balloons
sir rupert told her that he would put
into her hands a in which she might
read all the adventures these aeronauts
or aerial voyagers related as he said ina
much more amusing manner than he
could tell them i will look for the 
for you in the library and you may read
it before you see our balloon go up or
afterwards whichever you please
 before if you please sir i should
like it now answered lucy it is so
pleasant to read about things at the very
time when we are thinking them harry
will you come and read it with me 
no thank you said harry if one 
us read it that will do you will tell it tome
afterwards and i want to see how this
balloon is to be filled
 i should like to see that too said
lucy
sir rupert began the operation he
put some filings iron into a bottle and
upon these he poured sulphuric acid diluted
with about six times the quantity 
water
lucy as soon as she saw the sulphuric
acid kept at a safe distance she did
wisely when the acid was poured upon
the iron filings a cloud white vapour
rose and she perceived a peculiar smell
sir rupert told her that the gas which
was then rising was hydrogen and with
this the little balloon was to be filled
sir rupert then took a bent glass tube
which was open at both ends one he
placed in the neck the bottle and the
other in a jug almost full water so that
the gas after passing through this tube
was made to rise through the water in the
jug in order to purify it over the jug he
put a glass funnel with its broad mouth
downwards to collect the little bubbles 
gas which rose to the surface the water
sir rupert having placed this apparatus
on the floor took the little balloon and
suspended it from a walkingstick which
he laid on the backs a couple chairs
the aperture in the bottom was tied fast
round a piece quill about an inch 
which was left projecting beyond the place
where it was tied this he put into the
small the funnel and plastered
round their joining with a lute made 
that which was ready at hand some almond
paste and water and he also luted the
glass tube into the neck the bottle the
joining being now airtight none the
gas could escape except through the quill
which left an open passage for it into the
balloon
presently lucy saw the bubbles rising
more and more thickly and as the gas
ascended through the funnel she observed
that it began to inflate the balloon
as the affair however seemed to proceed
but slowly she thought it would be tiresome
to stay till it was finished especially
as she could be no use she said therefore
that she was satisfied and went to
the library to read the adventures the
other aromatic voyagers
sir rupert accompanied her and having
kindly marked several entertaining
passages he returned to harry who ashe
said would want his assistance
lucy had time to read all that sir rupert
had marked in the history aerial voyages
before the little balloon was filled
she found harry alone in the laboratory
when she returned holding the balloon
which was now a perfect globe quite inflated
he showed her that the quill was
stopped at the bottom by a little plug 
cork which sir rupert had stuck in when
the balloon was sufficiently expanded so
that he might clean off the luting without
fear losing any the gas
i am glad sir rupert staid to do all
this for me said harry and that i
have seen how quick and dextrous it is
necessary to be with it you are come
just at the right time lucy added he
 we had but just finished
let go the string harry by which
you are holding the balloon said lucy
 that i may see if it will go up
go up to be sure it will said harry
look how it pulls against my hand i
am fastening this little weight to the bottom
 it i think it will carry this up
also
 that little weight said lucy is
that all it is able to carry
all and a great deal it is said harry
 for such a small balloon
it may be a good weight for it to carry
in proportion to its size to be sure said
lucy now harry pray loosen the
string there there up it mounts
 but i do not wish it to mount too
high or to strike itself against the ceiling
cried harry i must add more weight
he added a little more weight and tried
it again and at length to satisfy lucy he
let go the string it seemed to be nicely
balanced above their heads halfway between
the floor and ceiling after remaining
still a few moments it moved towards
the fireplace as if as lucy said it wanted
to warm itself and when it had remained
there till it was warm enough went away
again the fact was as harry observed
that the draught or current air wafted
it towards the fireplace as it approached
the fire heated the gas within so that the
balloon rose higher towards the ceiling
and floated about till the gas cooling it
descended and again wafted by the draught
the same movements were repeated harry
observed them with untired interest calling
out now it rises because and nowe it
falls because c
but after a minute or two lucy said
 it is very curious but when will you
let it up out doors harry i want to
see it go up to the clouds
 as soon as my father and sir rupert
come back said harry
 in the mean time said lucy i will
tell you what i have been reading sir
rupert might well say it was entertaining 
but i cannot tell it to you if you are so
entirely intent upon that balloon
 but my dear i am not entirely intent
upon it i can hear you very well
ah you can hear i know but you
will not listen to me comfortably while
you are watching that balloon
 then said harry laughing you
must watch the balloon and i will listen
to you while i am sharpening my knife 
and your's too if you will give it to me
may'ldo that
oh yes thank you said lucy i
know you can listen while you do that
my dear harry do you know any thing
about parachutes v
no answered harry nothing
i am glad it said lucy for i can
tell you something at least about them 
parachutes are used to prevent the danger
in falling from balloons the name parachute
from the french word chute shows
its use it is a sort umbrella which
spreads out itself the moment it feels
the resistance the air and that prevents
it from coming too suddenly down a
man tried it first with his dog he fastened
him to a small parachute and when the
balloon was at a great height he dropped
him out the parachute spread and 
very well said harry i see the
parachute must have been use in preventing
his descending too quickly
so i thought my dear harry and soit
would have been but for the wind the
wind blew and blew till it was a great
storm quite a whirlwind the poor dog
and parachute were blown up and down
and all manner ways and at the same
time the man in his balloon was equally
tossed about without power to stop or
to guide himself at last when the storm
began to cease man and dog came in sight
 each other again and the dog knowing
master began to bark just as he would
have done upon earth once they came so
close together that the master stretched
out his hand to take him into the balloon
but another provoking gust wind whirled
him away however at last the man and
the dog came to the ground man first
dog next with his parachute quite safely 
then it succeeded you see said
harry
 yes this time said lucy but
another time a poor man broke his leg by
vol f
coming down with a parachute and you
must know harry i am sorry to tell it
you but i must for it is the truth a
great many dreadful accidents have happened
to people with these balloons one
man was burnt to death and several were
near being drowned by dropping into the
sea they must have been drowned but
for some goodnatured fishermen who saved
them another balloonman was in a
terrible condition a thunderstorm came
on and he in the midst it up in the
clouds he says that at one time he was ina
state insensibility lying at the bottom
 the car he does not know how long 
then bounce came the balloon against the
earth and when it rebounded he was
dashed against a rock oh my dear
harry at last his anchor hooked in a
tree and this saved him philosophers
may say what they please but indeed i
liiink it is very bad work harry i should
not at all like to go up in a balloon
i am glad you would not said harry
for i do not think it would be fit for
you
but what is more harry i should not
like that yoii should go up in a balloon
said lucy
 that is another affair said harry
 it is a man's business to brave danger
 in a good cause said lucy
in a good and great cause to be sure
repeated harry
but then it comes to this what is a
great causes said lucy
is not the cause science my dear
a great cause
i do not know said lucy i think
it is quite enough if a man hazards his life
for his country for his father and mother
and friends or for poor women sisters
and so forth you may ask my father as
soon as he comes down stairs
not now said harry we will talk
 it another time you know we are going
to the balloon but lucy where is the
balloon oh lucy what is become 
it i told you to watch it
i do not know cried lucy what
has become it it must be somewhere
f 
in the room but i cannot see it look upon
that high press i will look under the
tables
high and low and everywhere they
looked but without seeing it
 the windows are shut the door is
shut nobody has opened it nobody has
come in nobody has gone out the
room since we had it safe said harry
ait must have burst said lucy look
for the skin
it could not have burst without some
little noise i think said harry
 we will settle about the noise after
we have found the skin said lucy but
i cannot see any thing like it what can
have become it
harry made another careful search in
silence and then said i am now sure
that it is not in the room and it could not
have got out the room any way but
one
 what way asked lucy
 up the chimney said harry
up the chimney said lucy but
now i recollect it is very likely you
know how fond it was going towards
the fire
 it may have stuck in its way up said
harry trying to look up the chimney but
nothing was to be seen
 nothing but darkness said lucy
popping up her head as harry withdrew
his harry ran out directly to try if the
balloon could be seen hovering over the
house where it had flown none could
tell one man had seen something very
odd come out the top the chimney 
another had seen this odd something passover
his head he had thought it was a
kite he could tell only what he had
thought it was and how much he was
surprised when he saw that it was not what
he had thought but more he could not
tell
harry ran from field to field jumped
over ditches and jumped back again and
breathless hot and tired came home no wiser
than he had gone out lucy all the time
was exceedingly sorry for her carelessness
for which harry never once reproached her
they were particularly vexed by the
loss this little balloon because it belonged
to edward digby who had as
sir rupert had told them spent nearly a
whole day in patching it the more they
thought it the more they grieved sir
rupert did all he could to comfort them
by saying that he would take it upon himself
to provide for edward as good and
great a norfolk turkey's craw as that which
was lost but added their kind comforter
i by no means give it up yet as lost only
strayed certainly not stolen our neighbours
and our neighbours children are all
honest and kind people some one will
probably find our little balloon and bring
back its skin tomorrow but now for today
i am sorry you are disappointed i
wish i had for you a beautiful little balloon
i once possessed my flyingfish
a flyingfish i wish we had it said
lucy
harry asked what size it was
about four feet from head to tail and
broad in just proportion for a fish said
sir rupert with proper fins and everything
that could make it look like a real
live fish it was made baudruche
harry asked what is baudruche v
 simply goldbeater's skin baudruche
is the french name for it and my thoughts
going back to paris where i had first seen
such a balloon i used the name by which
i had there heard it called i gave my
pretty fish to edward who was very young
at that time it was lost in coming over 
it fell i believe into the sea
very natural said lucy for the
fish to go into the sea
 but since we have not that or any
other pursued sir rupert what can be
done now since we have none ready
made what would you think trvino to
make one for yourselves 
i think it would be the happiest thing
in the world said lucy
 if we could do it said harry
 why not said lucy if we had
any thing to make it 
sir rupert thought that lady digby
who it seems had every thing that everybody
wanted could perhaps furnish a quite
or two silver paper
 then we can soon make a balloon 
silver paper i am sure said lucy
we have only three days more to stay
at digby castle said harry sighing profoundly

ft
only three days indeed said lucy
echoing the sigh sincerely but in a more
sprightly tone she added three whole
days and this remember is not half gone
harry but i wonder you are not more
eager even than i am about our balloon
 my dear i am eager about it said
harry very eager but i see many difficulties
 and i am afraid we should only
waste lady digby s silver paper which i
know is valuable to ladies for their cap
boxes
 i would not have you waste that my
dears or any thing else said sir rupert
smiling but i can answer for it that
lady digby for such a purpose will give
her silver paper willingly even out her
cap box if it were necessary however
ro
na to raise the merit her sacrifice
harry i can tell you that she happens to
have a store it which she bought for
edward there is much to be learned in
doing any thing this sort well and so
much ingenuity must be employed that i
am always a promoter such things i
am always for letting my young friends
try their own experiments
but do you really think sir said
harry that we can succeed
 tell me how you would set about it
and then i will give you my best opinion
said sir rupert
i do not know said harry i only
know that it is exceedingly difficult for i
recollect that when my uncle's balloon was
making he and my father were calculating
and measuring with long tables 
figures and scales and beamcompasses 
but i could not understand what they
were donors
but that was a year ago harry you
know said lucy
sir rupert took them to die library and
f 
showed them in one the plates the
edinburgh encyclopaedia the goie a
balloon with all the requisite dimensions
marked on it
lucy was awestruck at the sight a
diagram with curves and crossinglines
sand as she said with decimals innumerable
but harry's hopes began to
revive you once said he covered
a ball for me lucy and its cover was
divided into gores which were very like
this they were all different colours i
recollect and very pretty
there was no great difficulty in that
said lucy the ball was very small you
know and ready shaped for me i measured
it round and divided it into an equal
number parts and counted how many
gores such a breadth in their broadest
part would go round it and then i cut a
pattern in paper sloping it and guessing
by my eye and trying repeatedly what
would fit then i cut all the leather gores
by my paper pattern stuck them round
the ball with pins and by measuring and
cutting pulling and pushing and puckering
stretching and coaxing the ball was
at last finished
lucy showed the manner in which she
had creased her paper in various directions
in order to make her pattern but harry
thought it exceedingly difficult and incomprehensible
sir rupert to whom the
case was referred thought that lucy's
method might do if she took care to allow
sufficient margin for joining and to admit
 letting out or drawing the pieces closer
together as occasion might require to
compensate for inaccuracies
the chief difficulty now seemed to bethe
shape the pattern gore but lucy's
alarm at the innumerable decimals not
having yet subsided and harry still fearing
that a large part the three days
would be consumed in making himself
sufficiently master the subject to construct
it with mathematical accuracy sir
rupert compounded with them for a method
which he said would answer well
enough for a first attempt
 let us determine said he what is
to be the shape and size your balloon
suppose it to be a globe eighteen feet
in circumference in that case twelve
gores will probably be enough and the
greatest breadth each these must
evidently be eighteen inches or a little
more to allow for a pasting margin it is
equally clear that their length must be half
the circumference the globe or nine
feet to make your pattern i would advise
you to paste some sheets brown
paper together so as to form a narrow
parallelogram nine feet long and eighteen
inches wide this you know must be
tapered to a point at each not by
straight lines but as you observed harry
by curving the sides and as you are
doubtful accomplishing this with geometrical
precision i think we may trust to
your eye to draw the curves provided you
make the greatest quantity that they bulge
out from a straight edge about a tenth 
the extreme breadth the gore that is
in this case about one inch and threequarters

hairy and lucy were eager to begin on
the strength these directions but
now thought harry what sort a balloon
shall it be he asked sir rupert if he
had ever seen a balloon which carried up
fire with it to keep the air within rarified 
sir rupert said that he had seen several
one in particular he well recollected its
paper cover said he caught fire when
at a considerable height in the air it
seemed a globe flame and for a second or
two that retained its form it made a most
beautiful spectacle but harry said sir
rupert suddenly checking himself are
you thinking sending up fire with your
balloon
oh yes why not sir cried lucy i
should like very much to see it take fire
in the air
but sir rupert said he could not consent
to this he thought it too dangerous
there are several thatched houses and
ricks corn and hay in this neighbourhood
said he and if the balloon fell
upon them it would set them on fire
the moment that this danger was pointed
out harry abandoned all further idea a
no
fireballoon and asked whether he might
fill it with hot air 
sir rupert willingly consented to this
and told him that they should have a
chafingdish with burning charcoal by
which the balloon might be filled with
less danger setting it on fire than if they
lighted a fire straw under it sir rupert
added that though the sending up fire
with a balloon from his park would be
hazardous yet there were other situations
in which it might be done without danger
for instance when they returned to the
seashore they might if their father approved
try one when the wind blew towards
the sea sir rupert sat down immediately
and wrote for them the following
directions which were committed to
lucy's memorandumbook for a future
occasion
choose a calm dry evening and having erected
in the ground two poles at a sufficient distance apart
to prevent the balloon when inflated from touching
them pass a string through the ring at the crown 
the balloon and fasten the ends it to the tops 
hie poles then in order to inflate it place a chafingdish
with burning charcoal under the opening at
ill
the bottom it will presently swell out and consequently
rise to a greater distance from the chafingdish
which will enable you to hook on a small wirebasket
containing a sponge soaked in spirits wine 
this basket will also help to balance the balloon when
in the air the string on which the balloon is suspended
must be cut at the moment that the spirits 
wine in the sponge is lighted
there is no ancient saying vvliich the
wisdom is more cordially felt by youth
than that they who give quickly give
twice lady digby immediately ordered
for them a large deal table placed in one
 the spacious unoccupied bedchambers
where the carpet being rolled up they
might use floor or table as they liked she
also provided them with a dish good
paste two paste brushes two towels the
housekeeper's large cuttingout scissors a
pair compasses a long ruler and in
short all they could want including what
only her kindness could have suorested
two pair steady ablebodied clotheshorses
from the laundry on which to hang
their long sheets pasted paper to dry
they set to work lucy's first business
was to paste the sheets silver paper into
the narrow parallelograms while harry
was intent on his brownpaper pattern
harry's pattern ready lucy cut out all
the twelve gores in the silver paper leaving
ample room and verge enough in the
margin to compensate if necessary for inaccuracies
then came the magnum opus
 putting together the gores they proceeded
not without many little disasters too
tedious to relate lucy handled her brush
in a masterly style lightly and evenly 
ever keeping strictly within her bounds she
swept along with steady and determined
hand to the her course at last
each pair gores was pasted together
and each having been allowed time to dry
the patience necessary for which being the
greatest trial all the whole was with
a little coaxing and a little puckering
joined together it was necessary that the
balloon should open wide so that it might
be held over the fire to be filled with hot
air therefore the lower points the gores
were cut off and the bottom alas pasted round
a lio'ht hoop cane when they thought
the balloon was finished lucy put her
delighted head within it to contemplate
the inside but to her great dismay she
saw various little holes in the paper and
the remainder the day was spent in
putting patches over each detected flaw
on the morning their last day the
weary business patching was ended
each hole had its patch and every patch
was dry and never did artists contemplate
their work with more satisfaction 
lucy with a few exclamations delight 
harry with sober silent admiration they
stood before their balloon and wondered
that it had ever come together and father
and mother and lady digby and sir
rupert successively joined in the saw
surprise and admiration with sincere congratulations
in the moment success
the general gave due credit to his lieutenant
lucy without whose assistance ashe
was proud to acknowledge all his
generalship would have been no avail
he handsomely acknowledged the skill
with which all had been performed that
was left to her discretion though perhaps
he still more admired that which
those in command often prefer to ability 
prompt and mute obedience
it was a fine evening the smi just
setting out they bore their balloon to an
open space in the park it was suspended
from the top the poles which had been
prepared and the burning charcoal was
placed under the opening at the bottom
to inflate it in a few minutes the flaccid
bag began to swell out fold after fold
the last gleam sunset however disappeared
before it had completely expanded
it now pulled slightly against
the hands the holdersdown they had
orders not to let it go till the word command
should be given lucy who was
one the holders down felt that it was
hot service but harry was beside her and
emulous his fortitude she stood firmly
till she heard let go up rose the
balloon steady and majestically high
yet full in view and paused awhile hangings
in midair like a silver moon from the
blue sky the balloon again wafted upwards
and again stood still there was
now seen a beautiful light on one its
sides lucy thought it could not come
from the sun because it had disappeared
beneath the horizon it had set for them 
but as her father told her those who had
gone up in balloons had sometimes seen
the sun set twice once while on the earth
and once when raised above it this appearance
lasted but for a moment or two 
afresh breeze arose the balloon sailed
rapidly along they eagerly followed it
with their eyes but it did not sail steadily
far it wavered and turned sideways and
fell fell fell on a thornbush nevermore
to rise
it is all over said lucy but was
it not beautiful harry have we not had
a great deal pleasure harry
harry walked on in silence bearing the
mangled remains the balloon
 after all continued lucy when a
balloon does not carry any thing up with
it i do not see that it is much better thana
kite
this insulting remark roused harry from
his silence but when he had said all he
could about the ingenuity and curiosity 
the invention lucy still pressed him to
tell what use had been made it and
harry embarrassed looked to his father
and sir rupert for assistance and whatever
they could they supplied
once a balloon had been used for re
cvnnoitring that is for discovering the
situation forces and movements an hostile
army balloons have also been employed
in trying some magnetic and electrical
experiments one ingenious man
employed a balloon on purpose to try a
philosophical experiment on sound he
sent up explosive materials for this purpose
to be let off at different heights but
the shouts the crowd below prevented
these from being heard
and nothing more found out yet no
more use made balloons said lucy
oh harry what have you to say now
 that they have gone fast out favour
with you ever since you read and thought
about the danger said harry however
i must acknowledge it is surprising
that such a great invention has not yet
been more use
sir rupert observed that one reason for
this had been that it was so expensive to
make balloons that poor philosophers could
not afford it the expense however has
now been somewhat diminished by the
use coalgas in the place hydrogen
balloons he said were generally sent up
merely as shows and paid for by people
who went to see them merely for amusement
the exhibitors therefore thought only
 producing a grand effect for instance
they made one to represent meg terrifies
another was a figure clothed in a flamecoloured
robe and another was a pegasus
transporting a richlyaccoutred warrior
through the clouds
oh said lucy i wish they could
manage the balloon pegasus as the man
in the arabian tales managed his 
 by turning one peg he went
up and by turning another he came
down
that may be done yet perhaps said
harry by turning one peg to let the air
out and another to let it in if we could
but guide balloons then indeed they
would be useful
and not till then said his father
 but do you think father do you think
sir rupert said lucy that the way 
guiding them will ever be found out
harry looked eagerly from one to the
other in hopes a favourable answer
they would not say it was impossible 
they would not say they thought it probable

there was a time when it was thought
impossible to do what is now done said
harry who knows but the means 
guiding balloons are close to us and under
our eyes and hands just as the rarefied
air for raising them was ready long before
men invented how to use it
 true and sensible said sir rupert
encouraged by this acknowledgment
harry inquired what attempts had ever
been made to guide balloons he exclaimed
 what a glorious thing it would
be what signifies the danger men
must die some way or other
 well done well done harry said
sir rupert smiling i believe you have
hopes being a balloonguider yourself

harry blushed and was silent after
a pause he said in a low voice to his
father i may at least think on the subject
father
there is no reason why you should
not think it if you like it harry said his
father but many great men have thought
 it and failed there is however nothing
to be ashamed in this wish it springs
from a praiseworthy ambition
 and let his ambition take its flight
added sir rupert recollect our own
schemes when we were boys our grand
magnet scheme and our efforts to invent
perpetual motion the worst that can be
said is that though it does us no harm it
does nobody else any good
it may be a satisfaction to some kind
young heart or to some equally kind old
heart to be assured that sir rupert was
not mistaken in his good opinion his
neighbours and his neighbours children
the little balloon was brought back byone
 farmer dobson's young folks but
though farmer dobson himself accompanied
his boy to bring back this sir ay or
waif as he called it to the lord the
manor yet it was now little likely to be 
any further use and no longer worthy to
be placed among edward's valuables for
it had first stuck upon the branch a tree
that overhung higglesham ford then it
had fallen into the ford and just at the
worst place it could have fallen where
the cattle came to drink some beast had
set his foot upon it and the great halfmoon
rents even lucy could not hope to
repair
it was all over with it as a balloon but
still its remains were treated with respect
and deposited in a drawer with remnants
 other turkeycraws they might be 
service still to balloons yet unborn which
could only be mended by patches the 
same stuff
but i do not know whether my son
will care about balloons so much said
sir rupert now that his object has been
accomplished by other means
what was his object asked harry
eagerly
sir rupert told him that the seacoast
in that neighbourhood was dangerous 
vessels had been driven on shore and had
been wrecked property and lives had
been lost and edward's imagination had
been struck with the thoughts contriving
means affording assistance to these poor
shipwrecked people he knew that it was
often the utmost consequence to be able
to carry out a rope from a vessel in distress
to the shore and he had at one time had
an idea that small balloons might when
the wind served be used for this purpose 
but the object had been lately accomplished
in an ingenious manner by simpler means
a method had been invented sending a
rope from a vessel to the shore by means
 a kite which could be made to descend
at any place or time required by the
bye harry said sir rupert you cannot
vol tv g
do better than read the account this invention
 i am sorry we did not think 
it sooner that we might have tried it 
but you shall have the and take it
home with you i dare say you will be
able to make a kite this sort for yourself
it is a new and perfectly safe invention for
you to try no gas necessary no fire 
nothing dangerous and something really
within your power and present means to
accomplish for a useful purpose
harry's mind seized the idea instantly
with enthusiasm
yes added sir rupert even the
electric kite which drew down lightning
from the clouds and which led to the use
 conductors to save us from the danger
 thunderstorms could not be more useful
than such a kite as this which might
save the lives thousands
sir rupert went with harry immediately
to the library to look for this
 and some others which he and lucy
wished to borrow they were welcome
to any upon condition that they wrote
down their names in what was called the
bookbook a small volume which lay with
the catalogue upon the library table and
in which a debtor and creditor account
was regularly kept all that were borrowed
and returned
besides the st volume the transactions
 the society for the encouragement
 arts in which there was the description
 the kite harry wrote down priestley's
history vision vols in which he
particularly wanted to read about the
camera obscura lucy wished to have that
 franklin's which she had been
looking at the day they were at the electrical
machine or the sake some letters
which she had seen at the the
volume harry found the volume again
readily for lucy what she alluded to
were enticed letters to a young lady on
philosophical subjects in one which
the author says to her your observation
on what you have lately read concerning
insects is very just and solid superficial
minds are apt to despise those who make
that part the world their study as mere
g 
triflers but certainly the world has been
very much obliged to them
lucy wished also for a little volume
which she had seen in lady digby's bookcase
called nourjahad the beginning 
which had excited her curiosity lady
digby consented though it was a very
favourite as it had been given to herby
her father when she was about lucy's
age she also lent her two very interesting
accounts shipwrecks the loss
 the winterton and the voyage 
the alcestis
sir rupert's last kindness to harry and
lucy was the lending and explaining to
them the use a ientagraph an instalment
for reducing maps or drawings dr
wollaston's camera lucida he promised to
show harry the next time he came to see him
harry was very happy to hear those
words the next time
sir rupert expressed his desire to see
him and lucy again whenever their father
and mother would bring them and it was
settled that they should spend another
fortnight at digby castle making it their
way home
as lucy was listening most attentively
to this interesting arrangement she was
startled by the sound a carriage she
looked out the window and saw that it
was their own driving to the door
is it possible cried she i thought
it was much earlier oh there is mamma
with her bonnet on i did not think it
was near bonnettime yet
but alas it was come to that time and
to that last moment when she must say
goodbye
how often they said goodbye it would
be impossible to recount we are sure 
once in the drawingsroom once on the
steps the house once on the steps 
the carriage and again at the carriage
window and a goodbye as they passed
the porter's lodge to the mother astyanax

but the present moment as usual
pressed its claims to attention and had its
claims allowed harry began to settle
the books in the carriage their inconvenient
arrangement in the moment 
farewell none the party had been fully
sensible but now it hurt harry's mechanical
feelings to see parcels sliding and
slipping unable to stay in the places assigned
them as these were in direct opposition
to the laws gravity he set about
to alter their arrangement promising to
make it infinitely more convenient to everybody
how inconvenient his elbows were
to his mother during this operation need
not be represented it will readily be conceived
by all who have ever been in a
carriage with a settler
scarcely had harry packed the books
and lucy placed the great nosegay to her
satisfaction in one the pockets the
carriage than they began a comparison 
their feelings during their visit at dig by
castle
i have been very very happy said
lucy harry let me tell you all the
things which i liked and then you may
tell me what you liked best
what he or what lucy liked best it was
difficult to decide lucy seemed to think
that all was best i hope she added
 that lady digby's nephews and nieces
may be there at our next visit how happily
we shall play at hide and seek in the
annulled apartments i know a place
where you would not find me for a year if
i did not tell you up through the trapdoor
near the little staircase leading to
that observatory which you have not yet
seen
 i am to see the observatory and saturn
and his ring next time said harry if
next time ever comes
 ifs to be sure it will said lucy
 we have not seen half the park yet 
we shall have delightful walks with lady
digby she likes long rambling scrambling
walks harry is not she a nice woman
 no said harr i like her because
she is not iicey
not in the bad sense you mean not
aver nice said lucy
yes said harry i mean that she
is not one those fine ladies who have
always fine shoes and who can never stir
out the house except on a fine day she
has strong shoes and has the use her
feet and her hands and her head
 and knows where every thing can be
found that is wanted said lucy and
keeps every thing in order
 yet does not plague every body said
harry by being too exact some people
take every off the tables the moment
one leaves the room and put every thing
out the way which they call putting
things hyt
 that would not suit sir rupert said
lucy he said he did not like the look
 any room where there were no books and
no signs people being comfortably employed
i love the look the library and
the drawingroom at digby castle very
different from newport hall a fine house
aunt pierrepoint took me to last year my
dear harry you can have no idea how
tiresome it was lady newport sat or
lay on the sofa all day long without having
any thing in the world to do 
 i suppose the poor woman was a
cripple said harry
no she was not a cripple said lucy 
 she could dance though she could not
walk but i suppose that some days she
was ill though she eat and drank like
other people every day yet it was always
said that lady newport was so very delicate
 there was to be no wind in the
room and no noise all the company
talked in whispers but indeed that was
no loss for nobody ever said any thing
worth hearing nobody laughed and nobody
was allowed to yawn excepting lord
newport himself he did yawn indeed 
and aunt pierrepoint was so cruel as to
send me to bed one evening for a fit 
yawning which i caught from him so
i never looked at him aoairi in the evenings
i did not like looking at him at
any time at breakfast he was so pale
and miserable at dinner so red and cross 
and at night so stupid and sleepy i
believe he was unhappy because he had
never any thing to say
but many people are happy enough
when they have not any thing to say interrupted
harry
 are they said lucy doubtingly
g 
certainly said harry men are
often happy when they say nothing for
one i am sure i am often happiest
when 
you yes interrupted lucy but
there is a great deal difference between
saying nothing and having nothing to
say besides lord newport not only had
nothing to say but nothing to do poor
man with all his riches and his fine newcourthouse
and newportpark he was
the most unhappy person i ever saw now
i will make his face for you harry
harry could not help laughing at lucy's
imitation lord newport's dull face
she was going on mimicking his lordship's
yawn and the manner in which
lady newport lolled on the sofa and
her drawling affected voice but her
mother stopped her by saying that she
advised her not to acquire the habit 
mimickry
though it may be entertaining at the
moment lucy it is dangerous it would
make you disliked and what is worse
might lead you to say and do what is illnatured
and for which you ought to be
disliked
oh mamma i hope not said lucy
i did not mean to be illnatured but i
cannot help seeing the difference between
people who are sensible or agreeable
and those who are stupid or affected or
disagreeable how can i help mamma
seeing the difference between lord and
lady newport with their ways going
on at newporthouse and sir rupert
and lady digby and their manner 
spending their time at digby castle
you would not wish mamma would
you that i should not perceive the difference
and that i should like them all
equally 
certainly i should not my dear lucy
answered her mother i am very glad
that you can judge and distinguish what
it is in the characters and manners and
habits those you see which makes them
agreeable or disagreeable happy or miserable
and i should be very sorry by
what i say now to put any restraint upon
your expressing before me as wew as to
yciur brother your natural feelings and
opinions
oh mamma you need not fear that
said lucy i should never feel afraid to
speak before you you tell me so gently
and kindly when you think me wrong
now harry stop me pray the next time i
begin to mimick anybody and do not
laugh because that encourages me i do
not think i was quite right either mamma
in another thing which perhaps you did
not hear me say about aunt pierrepoint's
being so cruel as to send me to bed for
yawning i should not have said that
because she was very kind to me and i
should be very sorry to be ungrateful i
should not have told the only little thing
she did that was unjust
very true my dear lucy and i am
sure since you have this generous feeling
that i need say no more on the subject
mother said harry i am going to
ask you a question not on my own account
for i cannot complain anybody
having been unjust to me but when children
have been punished unjustly i want
to know how they can help recollecting
they cannot help recollecting it said
his mother but they can prevent themselves
from talking or thinking it by
which means they will avoid fixing the
impression more strongly in the memory 
and if on the other hand they try to recollect
the kindness that has been shown
to them they will avoid the danger which
lucy so justly dreads becoming ungrateful

 yes mamma said lucy i recollect
hearing that ungrateful girl miss kitty
maples who said 
her father interrupted her recollections
and gently desired her to look out at a
place they were just passing let us
talk said he things not persons
he stopped the carriage for a few minutes
that they might look at the building
which was near the road
what a strange ugly looking house
exclaimed lucy it is neither a house
nor a castle 
this was the mode building said
her father which followed the time 
gothic castles in england when fortified
castles were no longer wanted for defence
people began to build houses with walls
less thick and without the moat drawbridge
and portcullis they retained something
 the old castle appearance by way
 grandeur or because they had been
used to it but this style building
which lucy dislikes appears now to be
useless and that is one reason i think
why it looks ugly those blind towers
for instance in which there are neither
loopholes to shoot through with bow and
arrow nor windows to light even a narrow
staircase are ridiculous
a short time after this as they drove
through a town they took notice some
very old looking houses which seemed to
be built wood they had projecting
windows which in the second story jutted
out far into the street and others like
chequered frames black wood and
white plastering on one these they saw
the date such houses were common
as their father told them in the times
 elizabeth and james
did not we come through this town
on our way to digby castle said lucy
i wonder that i never took notice 
these odd looking houses did you
harry 
no said harry we were thinking
 something else i suppose
but now said lucy that we have
seen that gothic castle and chapel and
that we have learnt a little about such
think's we take more notice other buildings
and we feel interested about them
which is very pleasant
as they went on a little further they
met some loaded timbercarriages and on
one was a stone pillar which as one the
drivers told them had been brought by
water from far off they were going to
a nobleman's place near hand who is
building a fine house harry's father
found that by turning a little out their
direct road they could see it and he
ordered the postilion to drive that way
when they arrived they got out the
carriage to look at the building the
scaffoldings were up and many workmen
busy at work but enough was finished for
harry to see the style architecture it
was grecian with a portico supported by
doric columns lucy said the front looked
very like the print a temple which they
had seen the day before among the prints
at digby castle she could not recollect
the name it harry knew it was the
temple minerva but it had another
name the parthenon the architect heard
what they said and told them that this
was built after the model the parthenon
he then spoke some new buildings in
london and made use several terms
which they did not understand but harry
had now seen and heard enough to make
him anxious to learn more on these subjects
 how much there is to learn said
he in orettincr into the carriage not only
about building but about every thing 
from the greek word parthenope the virgin
 yes said lucy that puts me in
mind alps on alps arise harry do
you recollect that
alps on alps said harry what
can you mean lucy
she began to repeat some wellknown
lines pope harry recollected them 
he had learned them from her some months
before this time and he begged that she
would let him try if he could repeat them
only give me time said he when 
stop do not tell me the next word directly
very well if you are out i will not
put you in till i have counted a hundred
and that surely will be time enough for
you to think and for me to be silent 
harry began boldly 
 fired at first sight with what 
but with what or by what he was fired
he could not recollect lucy's hundred
was fairly counted and the last ten slowly
tolled out
he observed that these first lines which
he knew were something about the muse
he had always found very difficult but that
if lucy would repeat four or five he knew
he could then go on cleverly lucy repeated

fired at first sight with what the muse imparts
in fearless youth we tempt the height arts
while from the hounded level our mind
short views we take nor see the lengths behind
stop interrupted harry here is
my difficulty i never could learn this by
heart because i do not understand it nor
see the lengths behind behind i think
should be before does not the author
mean that in climbing the height the
arts we cannot see the length way before
us 
he does but the word behind is here
used in another sense
 what sense said harry
why for instance answered lucy
if you take away a little from what we
have to learn yet a great deal is left
behind
 still there is a puzzle said harry
as there always is when a word is used
that has two senses we do not know in
which to take it
well i cannot help it said lucy
let me on you must not be so exact
in poetry you will see by what is coming
that i am right
but more advanc'd behold with strange surprise

new distant scenes endless science rise
science interrupted harry now
my dear i can go on by myself
 so pleased at first the towering alps we try
mount o'er the vales and seem to tread the sky 
 th eternal snows appear already past
and the first clouds and mountains seem the last 
but those attained we tremble to survey
the growing labours the lengthen'd way 
th increasing prospect tires our wanting eyes
hills peep o'er hills and alps on alps arise
quite perfect said lucy
and very well repeated said his
mother
because i like these lines very much
said harry in this poetry there is some
sense as well as sound added he it
is true and it's pretty and its wise and it's
witty
 my dear harry that is rhyme you
will be a poet at last cried lucy
 it will be a long time first said harry
in the mean time here we are at home 
here is dame pelion's cottage
 and how well the roof looks papa
said lucy and there is dame peyton
coming out to welcome us
mamma do not you think that porch
would be much prettier if it were covered
with honeysuckle i will plant some there
tomorrow or cuttings clematis mamma
or some quickgrowing climber
it may be feared that after all the dissipation
 or if dissipation be not the proper
word all the amusement and variety they
had enjoyed during this last fortnight at
digby castle harry and lucy might find
it dull at rupert cottage it will be
feared by those who best know the nature
 boys that after the great excitement 
the workshop and the laboratory with
novelties mechanical chemical electrical
and aerial opening to his view every day
and hour harry would not be able to
settle soberly to his necessary employments
and to plod on daily through the requisite
portions greek latin and mathematics
it will and must be feared by all who
equally well know the nature girls that
after the polite praise and incessant attention
paid to her by those two most uncommonly
kind people sir rupert and
lady digby lucy would droop like a
plant suddenly removed from sunshine to
shade
harry and lucy's father and mother had
their fears on these points undoubtedly
and with some reason as all fathers and
mothers as well as masters and governesses
will confess those only excepted who have
been blessed or cursed with the care 
early prodigies prudence
it should be remarked that a few words
said by sir rupert digby to both harry
and lucy had operated on their minds to
prepare them to watch over themselves on
their return home he had shown that
uncommon degree justice which considers
not only what is agreeable to young
people at the moment but what is to happen
afterwards to them and to those who
have the everyday care providing for
their happiness
you know harry that if i were constantly
living with you could not afford
to give up to you so much my time 
and i hope you will prove to your father
and to yourself when you go home that
i have done you no mischief lucy will
i think follow your example whatever it
may be and this will be an additional
motive for your assiduity
harry had these words in his recollection
the morning after he came home and
when left entirely to himself in his own
room he went to his mathematics first
and then finished his portion greek and
latin before he tried the new glasses in
his camera obscura when lucy knew
this she could not for very shame go as
she had been desperately tempted to do
to nourjahad instead to arithmetic
after breakfast there was a new struggle
in their minds harry was tempted by
the sight the books shipwrecks and
was attracted by the titles in large characters
 the loss the alcestis and 
the winterton and a page on which she
opened in nourjahad describing the good
genius crowned with flowers was almost
irresistible to lucy
it will be an evil genius to you lucy
said her mother for if once it catches
hold you it will keep you from everything
else this i warn you for i have
myself felt the power that genius our
duties must be done first and then pleasures
can be enjoyed in comfort
i understand you mamma said lucy
 there i have put away nourjahad
but look at harry deep in the midst 
the shipwrecks though he advised me not
to touch the books
harry threw down the winterton and
ran off to his business
lucy had undertaken to make a frock
for dame peyton's grandchild but to
bay the truth it had been a oncr time
about and was in danger becoming as
yellow as certain indian muslin dresses
which the black servants who are employed
to embroider them for their mistresses
wind round their waists and trail
about the house for months working at
the flower or the leaf in the intervals 
domestic employments lucyss frock was
an example beautiful running and
equally beautiful backstitching with one
little border satin stitch smooth as any
save that which parisian fingers can perform
her mother nowe reminded her that
it ought to be completed as the christening
 the child was fixed for the next sunday
there was one row backstitching yet
to be done backstitching as every body
knows is desperately tiresome but what
will not hearty good will aided by a little
good sense and a little good example accomplish

harry has done all he promised
thought lucy and so will l mamma
shall see that i am not spoiled by all the
amusement we had at digby castle so
thinking and acting accordingly she completely
finished her work and held it up
before her mother's approving eyes
it happened that harry and lucy were
to spend that evening at home by themselves
their father and mother having
gone to drink tea with the good old vicar
at a few miles distance they had many
pleasant things to do lucy in the first
place went to try her frock on the baby
the joy that appeared in dame peyton's
eyes overpaid lucy for the labour the
work the baby was asleep in the cradle
but the grandame without ceremony took
it up to array it in its new vestments and
while harry was out digging the border
ready for the cuttings honeysuckle and
clematis round the porch the grandmother
and lucy had leisure to admire how pretty
the child looked in its christening robe
the dame only wished that its mother
were at home to see it but the mother
was gone to digby castle to visit her husband
who was a footman there
harry came into the cottage just to let
vol h
lucy know that lie had dug the border for
her and must now run off to finish a job
 his own some steps which he was
making to a bathingplace near dame
peyton's cottage he told lucy that he
should finish his work in half an hour and
that then he would come to her
 pray my dear lucy said he wait
for me at the seat do not come to see
whether i have done my work for i promise
you i will go to you as soon as i can
and then we will read the shipwreck 
the winterton together pray stay there
patiently
lucy promised to wait for him patiently
there was she thought little danger 
her not keeping this promise when she
had such a as nourjahad to read
she read and read on at last pausing at a
good restingplace just where nourjahad
sinks into his second hundred years sleep
lucy looked round her and saw the
lengthened shadows the evening there
was within view her seat a projecting
point rock whose shadow harry had
always consulted as his dial lucy now
looked at its long dark form upon the
water and said to herself 
it must be growing late very late 
i wonder harry is not come
she stood up and looked along the
path no harry nothing was to be seen
she considered what could have kept him
so long
 perhaps some the steps were wrong
said she to herself and he has stayed to
alter them i have a mind to go and see 
but no he begged that i would be patient
and particularly desired me to stay for him
here
she took up her again and read
on a little further but with divided interest
every now and then looking up to
see whether he was coming at length
unable to fix her attention any longer she
put down the for the last two
pages she did not know what she ava
reading she had been inventing all
manner things that could have befallen
harry
i must go and see what has become
h 
 him thought she why should not
i he bid me wait for him that we
might read the shipwreck here together 
but if i stay any longer it will be so dark
that we cannot read hark he is coming
no it was only the rustling the leaves
i cannot wait any longer i may be
 use to him i will go oh there he
is i see him among the trees i am
glad i stayed
it was only a dog but a boy followed
running full speed up the path towards
her dame peyton's grandson lucy
tried to go forward to meet him but she
was so much frightened that she could
not stir
 what is the matter where is my
brother oh speak cried lucy when
the boy came near enough to be heard
the boy trying to look and speak composedly
answered master harry is at
home miss by this time i met him at
the turn the road with master and mistress
and master harry sent me off hereto
tell you miss not to wait no longer
for he but to come home if you be pleased
miss
is that all said lucy relieved fora
moment from her fright but that is
not all i am sure by your look something
bad has happened tell me at once
why miss our house has been on
fire and half the roof burnt they say i
can't tell how it happened i only met
master harry and the folks as i was a
going towards home just at the turn 
the road grandmother was the first i
met and she asked me where i had been 
and i said with the cows then she told
me how our house had been all in a blaze
more than an hour ago and that the child
in the cradle would have been burnt to
death only for master harry not a soul
was near the house but he when the flames
broke out grandmother told me she was
gone to the wood to pick sticks mother
was at the castle betty had just ruined
out i can't say where 
oh never mind that tell me about
my brother cried lucy
 i can't miss for i don't know no more
than that he is badly burned i saw his
father carrying him home
canijiug him then it must be bad
indeed thought lucy
she asked no further questions but set
off running home as fast as she could
want breath forced her soon to slacken
her speed and the boy overtaking her
begged her not to be so much terrified
i cannot think master harry is very
badly hurt because he spoke quite like
himself strong and cheerful and his
face is not burned miss that i am clear
sure for i saw it quite plain as he
turned his head back over his father's
shoulder beckoning to me and sent me
off with his love to you miss and to beg
you would not be frightened which had
not time to tell you
lucy ran on while the boy was saying
this she felt as if she could not get on
fast do what she would at last she reached
the house and made her way through the
people who were standing in the passage
she tried softly to open the door her
mother's room where she heard that harry
was but it was fastened her father from
within opened it inquiring eagerly if a
messenger he had sent to the apothecary's
in the village had returned
here he comes said lucy with a
bottle in his hand
her father seized the bottle asking if
the surgeon was coming
no he was gone to a patient ten miles
off and would not be back till morning
her father had not seen lucy but she
caught hold his arm and asked if she
might see harry 
 yes you can help your mother but
can you command yourself lucy do
not come in if you cannot 
 i can i will said lucy only
tell me what i can do for him and throwing
off her bonnet and gloves she went
in it was worse than she expected when
she heard groans from harry who bore
pain so well she knew he must suffer
dreadfully going nearer she saw him
lying on his side the arm down to the
elbow covered with hue white blisters
or in some places raw and a fiery red
his whole frame writhing about in agony 
lucy could not help shrinking at this
sight but she made no exclamation she
looked at her mother to inquire what could
be done her mother was wetting some
soft linen rags with spirits turpentine
which her father poured out the
bottle these were gently laid on the
inflamed parts the arm taking great
care not to break the blisters lucy could
scarcely bear to see it done the first
touches gave harry such torture even withall
his mother's care and delicacy hand
she was now desired to take her mother's
place and to keep the linen on harry's
arm and shoulder wet with the turpentine
lucy's hands trembled when she began
but they soon became more steady the
consciousness that what she was doing
would relieve her brother gave her courage
to her unspeakable satisfaction his groans
became less frequent in a few minutes
his features which had been all drawn
up came to themselves and opening his
eyes for a moment he looked up at lucy
and said thank you dear lucy
his father and mother were employed
in melting basilicon ointment and minor
it with the oil turpentine in a small
saucepan a process that required great
caution to prevent the vapour that very
inflammable oil from taking fire this
preparation was now ready his mother
with a soft feather smeared it over the
whole surface the wound and then
spread the rest it on a large rag which
she gently laid over all scarcely was the
operation finished when harry's head sunk
upon his pillow and he dropped asleep 
this was in about fifteen minutes from the
first application the turpentine
lucy left the room by her mothers
desire to go to bed and as she was
moving very softly through the passage
she found dame peyton sitting there waiting
for some account harry when she
heard that he was easy and asleep she
went away repeating 
h 
bless him god bless lii 
for some days harry was so feverish
that the surgeon had forbidden all conversation
in his room but at last he was
allowed to talk a little and lucy being
most anxious to hear how the accident had
happened she said i left you harry
when you were going to work at the steps
go on from that
he had been at work he said very
busily finishing those steps and growing
warm had thrown off his coat when suddenly
observing a great light over the trees
near dame peyton's cottage he went up
the bank and saw flames coming from the
roof he ran on to the house the housedoor
was locked he knocked and called
in vain but hearing the cries the child
he broke the fastening a latticewindow
and sprung into the kitchen thick smoke
almost blinded him he knew however
that it was in the lite parlour and feeling
along the wall he was partly guided by
its cries till these were overpowered by
loud yells which burst out in some place
over his head he found the parlourdoor
but it stuck so fast that he could not
push it open he heard the rustling 
the flames he pushed again with all his
force and the door gave way firelight
now glared upon him from the roof harry
saw the cradle at the opposite side the
room he snatched up the infant and
made his way back through the suffocating
smoke and pieces blazing thatch which
were now falling he put the infant out
first in jumping after it he perceived
something on fire about himself and when
he came into the air he found his shirtsleeve
in a blaze he threw himself on the
ground in hopes to extinguish the flame 
but as fast as he extinguished it in one
place it appeared in another no help
was near the pain was intense 
this was all harry could tell what
had happened till he awakened again ashe
described it and heard a confusion 
voices and found himself in his fathers
arms
dame peyton had come morning noon
and night to inquire how he was and very
much wished to see him he was now
able in lucy's opinion and in his own to
see her and lucy admitted both the dame
and the mother the child who were
anxiously waiting at the door the mother
softly approached his bedside with her
infant in her arms judiciously considering
that no sight could be more gratifying to
harry their thanks were silent the
tears came into their eyes as they looked
at him and dame peyton uttered one low
and fervent god bless him not a
word more even harry with his horror
 flattery and dread being thanked
was pleased especially when the infant
stretched out its little arms towards him
and smiled
harry asked if they had found out what
the yells came from which he had heard
in the loft
the dame told him that they came from 
her cat which had been burned there with
its kittens
he then wished to know if the whole 
the new roof had been burned and how it
had caught fire 
yes the roof was all burned but not
much other damage had been done how
the house first took fire no one could tell
betsy declared that all was safe when she
went out no clothes nothing left near
the fireplace and the fire was very low
as far as they could judge the fire had
broken out in the loft
harry thought that perhaps the chimney
might have some crack in it but no it had
been examined and dame peyton repeated
that it was most extraordinary that a fire
should break out in a loft when nobody
had been in it or so much as up the stairs
which led to it for two days before 
this betsey and she were certain no
creature had been up there
 except the cat as lucy observed it
just occurred to her that the dame's favourite
tabby cat had been the cause all
the mischief lucy recollected to have
often seen her lying in the ashes almost
under the grate she thought it possible
that tabby lead gone up to her kittens in
the loft with a bit cinder sticking to
her which might have set fire to the
straw in which she and her kittens were
divino
this seemed very likely to all but dame
peyton alio could not bear that the blame
should be brought home to her poor dear
tabby jn zeal for the memory the best
 cats dame peyton forgot the undertone
proper to a sick room and she was
in loud demonstration the impossibility
 that which probably had happened when
the door opened and the surgeon entered
the room was cleared instantly even
lucy notwithstanding her protestations 
innocence and promises perpetual silence
found herself in the passage and the door
closed against her
the surgeon pronounced that harry had
still much fever and he found that though
the burn was rapidly healing yet his patient
could not raise himself nor turn in
his bed without much pain upon further
examination the surgeon discovered that
harry had received a severe strain the
consequences which might he said be
very serious he feared that it would be
necessary for harry to continue confined
to an horizontal position for some time
 how long sir said harry in an
intrepid tone
as far as the surgeon could guess it
would probably be some weeks before
harry could walk he might attempt it
sooner but if he did it would be at a great
risk on the contrary if he submitted
quietly and steadily to this confinement in
all human probability he would perfectly
recover and be as well and active as ever
the moment he was convinced the
reason and necessity the case harry
was perfectly submissive and better than
submissive resolute to bear and forbear
whatever was prescribed when the surgeon
had left the room harry looking up
and seeing his mother's anxious eyes fixed
upon him smiled and said do not be
afraid or me or me mother you shall
see how good and how well i shall be a
few weeks will soon be over and though
i am to lie fiat i may use my hands and
arms i suppose as soon as my burn is
well and i can read and entertain myself
and what is better i shall have lucy to
read to me and talk to me you need not
pity me mother i am not to be pitied at
all was not it very fortunate that i was
there and in time to save the child think
 the delight i felt when i got it safe out
 the window and the joy hearing it
squall again being certain it was alive 
i am sure that and the pleasure i have
just had in seeing the mother and child and
the old woman too are enough to pay me
for all the surgeon you know said we
might thank god it was no worse and i
thank god it is so well think mother
 my having been the means saving a
fellowcreature i am sure i do with all
my heart and soul thank god
after all this excitement his nurses
wisely left him to repose he fell into a
sound sleep how long he might have
slept none can tell for he was wakened
much to lucy's provocation by a loud
knock at the halldoor it was sir rupert
digby not he surely that gave the
thundering knock no that was his fool 
a groom for even wise men sometimes
have foolish grooms
sir rupert digby was allowed to come
into harris room and lucy was struck
by the melancholy expression his countenance
which did not clear up when
harry's own cheerful voice assured him
that he now suffered but little and that he
hoped to be quite well in a few weeks and
able to go to digby castle at these words
sir rupert shook his head sorrowfully
and said 
we shall not be there to meet you
my dear we are obliged to set out immediately
for the continent
one lady digby s nieces as they
had heard this morning had been taken
dangerously ill and they were going to
her this was a farewell visit from sir
rupert lady digby could not come 
she was too busy and too unhappy
harry and lucy were very sorry but
they were not so selfish as to think much
 their own little disappointment and
harry was grateful to sir rupert for thinking
 him at such a time sir rupert
had indeed thought every thing that
could contribute to harry's ease and comfort
in his absence and now offered the
key his library and the use his prints
and instruments which were most gladly
accepted
sir rupert promised not only to write to
harry's father but to harry himself if
he should see any thing on the continent
that he thought might amuse or instruct
him
farewell harry said he may god
bless you and keep alive in your mind
the benevolent feelings you possess and
the noble desire to improve the faculties
with which he has endowed you
during some succeeding days harry's
pulse and his own account himself
were at perpetual variance he asserting
that he was well quite well while his
pulse pronounced morning and evening
the reverse the surgeon preferred the
report the pulse and harry bound by
his wise resolutions was obliged to submit
to doctor diet and doctor quiet and to
have nothing yet to do with lucy's favourite
doctor merryman harry was
neither to talk or to be talked to neither
to read or to be read to neither to entertain
or be entertained lucy with a face
becoming the most discreet little nurses
sat by his bedside knitting for him future
comfortable or went about in silence but
never on tiptoe for that harry detested 
he always wakened when any one went on
tiptoe but moving quietly yet without
any appearance constraint she freed
him from the fear keeping her prisoner
in about a fortnight his arm healed but
from the effects the strain he was still
obliged to be a prisoner upon the sofa 
for some hours lying as required quite
flat at others raised from that tiresome
horizontal penance to a position which
with all the advantage rest restored him
to the use hands arms and eyes this
privilege he owed to the kindness his
friend sir rupert who in passing through
london saw and sent him abed invaluable
to all in his condition
the first day it came harry begged that
it might be placed in his view so that he
might examine its construction he saw
that the bedstead was hinged in the middle
and that either could be sloped to any
angle that was desired and firmly fixed
there by a supporting frame just as lucy
said like her music desk there were
various other contrivances which delighted
harry first as a mechanic and then as an
invalid he had himself raised and lowered
till he found the angle which was most
easy and convenient then lucy was
employed to make a pasteboard quadrant
and to fasten it on the side the bedframe
so that he could most accurately
as she said signify to her his inclinations
 you must allow me that pun harry
he allowed it to her in consideration 
her welldivided quadrant to say the
truth the quadrant was found little use
it was easier to say put me up to the
third notch or to the fifth notch as the
case might require but it is natural to
ingenious people especially when young
to make use superfluous inventions upon
common occasions
lucy more than ever rejoiced at having
acquired some taste for harry's pursuits 
because as she had been his best little
nurse when he was sick so now she could
be his most agreeable companion when he
was recovering
established on this most convenient 
beds his next object was to add to it a
reading and writingdesk which in its
kind he determined should be as perfect
as the bed sundry trials were made
sundry ways and at last a desk was contrived
by harry and executed by the carpenter
which was perfectly firm and yet
removeable at a moment's warning ceding
its place to the dinner breakfast or teatray

it is but justice to harry to mention
that before he thought all these conveniences
in his own establishment he had
been intent upon getting the roof repaired
for dame peyton
sir rupert had placed his carpenter
under harry's orders and had agreed to
his request that the house was now to be
slated harry looked at his old plan again
and with his father's concurrence made
some improvements in this second edition
 his roof when the ingenious and admirable
machinery mr brunei was a
few years ago burnt to the ground he
replied to a letter condolence that he
found sufficient consolation in the hopes 
materially improving it
as soon as the surgeon's permission was
obtained harry had great enjoyment in
the books which his mother brought for
him from digby castle among these were
scott's poetical works harry formerly
thought he had no taste for poetry but
now when his mother read to herr the
beginning the lay the last minstrel
he felt surprised at being so much pleased
with it as much even as lucy his mother
having refused to let him hear more than
one canto the first evening he looked forward
with eagerness to the time when
reading was to recommence this now
appeared the most delightful hour the
whole day and but for the shame not
allowing his mother time to take breath
lucy and he would willingly have listened
to canto after canto and poem after poem
from the lay the minstrel to the
lord the isles
but his mother managed their pleasures
so that they not only lasted the longer but
were relished the more keenly not swallowed
without being tasted lucy had
this art yet to learn
 mamma said she i think you are
too careful not to tire him with reading
i think he cannot have too much entertainment
it is only the stupid parts books
which tire one all that is necessary is
to pick out the plums and to have a
variety
 he would i think be soon tired 
plums my dear said her mother and
a great variety would weary him still
more
well mamma whispered lucy will
you let us try the experiment i should
like to see whether he could be tired 
plums i will pick out what i know he
likes best and never give him too much
 one thing at a time you will see
mamma
try my dear and you will see said
her mother
harry had now recovered sufficiently to
resume some his usual employments
and he begged lucy one day to bring
euclid that he might take his morning
halfhour at geometry before they did anything
else lucy was opinion that he
ought not yet to read any thing so very
serious when the surgeon came lucy
extorted a similar opinion from him and
therefore determined next day to try her
experiment accordingly at the hour
which harry had set apart for his mathematics
she stole in softly behind him and
while in the midst the square the
hypothenuse she laid beside him a fine
large butterfly who in the most obliging
manner rested there with outspread wings
 i will look at it in one instant said
harry as lucy called upon him to admire
the beautiful purple eyes on the wings
 only just wait one moment till i come
to the q e d
but as he spoke the butterfly made a
little motion as if preparing to rise
take care that it does not fly away
cried harry
there is no danger said lucy
in another instant before harry came
to his q e d the butterfly made a sudden
jump up and alighted upon harry's hand
he started when he felt its cold tail and
bony body it was no butterfly but a sort
 skipjack lucy had been at work
painting the wings from sunrise and for
all the labour bestowed on the feathertinctured
head and proboscis she was
overpaid by this start harry's emboldened
by her first success this morning
she closed euclid decidedly and drew it
from harry's hands
harry said she for the rest this
day you shall have nothing but plums and
have plenty in store for you all sorts
you will not i hope be above feasting on
such pretty and good ones as i have here
vol i
for you and she laid down a basket full
 books in each which there were
various paper marks
i am not above any thing good or
pretty said harry but i think it is too
early in the morning if you begin now
you will scarcely be able to supply me all
day long
try and we shall see as mamma
says
besides continued harry i think
plums all day long would make any body
sick
no no said lucy you shall have
such variety only trust to me give
me leave to entertain you all this day
harry will you 
let those who have tried the experiment
say which has the hardest part he who
undertakes to entertain or to be entertained
all day long lucy had made a
good beginning however having got rid 
euclid with her butterfly from her butterfly
she went on to the butterfly's ball
and the grasshopper's feast and the delightful
 peacock at home by some
strange chance harry had not yet become
acquainted with them
 mamma told me said lucy that
this little has had the honour being
quoted by a great man in the house 
commons these are the lines he repeated

for birds are like men in their contests together
and in questions right can dispute for a feather
but there is the breakfast bell said
lucy interrupting herself i must go
for your breakfast having set it before
him in order due now i must leave
you for a few minutes while i eat my own 
but i shall soon return to feed you with
plums upon her return lucy brought
up the newspaper which contained an extract
 a letter from sir thomas stamford
raffles late governor sumatra givingan
account the loss the ship fame after
describing the alarm excited by the cry 
fire and the hurry with which lady
raffles and her children were thrust into a
boat he says 
i 
ail this passed much quicker than i can write
it we pushed off as the flames were issuing from
our cabins the masts and sails now taking fire we
moved to a distance sufficient to avoid the immediate
explosion but the flames were coming out the main
hatchway and seeing the rest the crew with the
captain c still on board we pulled back to the ship
as we approached we perceived that the people were
getting into a boat we hailed her have you
all on board yes all save one johnson
sick in his cot can we save him no
impossible at this moment the poor fellow
scorched i imagine by the flames roared out most
lustily having run upon deck i will go for him
says the captain he pulled under the bowsprit 
the ship and picked the poor fellow up all lives
safe thank god pull off from the ship we then
hauled the boats close to each other and found the
captain fortunately had a compass our only chance
alas to regain bencoolen and the captain undertook
to lead no possibility being left that we could again
approach the ship for she was now one splendid
flame fore and aft and aloft her masts and sails in a
blaze and rocking to and fro the alarm had been
given about twenty minutes past eight and in less
than ten minutes she was in flames there was not a
soul on board at half past eight and in ten minutes
afterwards she was one grand mass fire
without a drop water or a grain food or a
rag covering except what we happened at that
moment to have on our backs we had embarked on
the wide ocean thankful to god for his mercies poor
sophia having been taken out her bed had nothing
on but a wrapper neither shoes nor stockings one
 the children had been snatched out his bed
after the flames had attacked it in short there was
not time for any one to think more than two
things can the ship be saved no let us
save ourselves then all else was swallowed up in
one great ruin the ship continued to burn till
about midnight when the saltpetre which she
had tons on board took fire and sent up one 
the most splendid and brilliant flames that was ever
seen illumining the horizon to an extent not less
than fifty miles and casting that kind blue light
over us which is all others most luridly horrible
rain now came on but fortunately it was not
 long continuance and the night became serene
and starlight the men behaved manfully they
rowed incessantly and never did poor mortals lookout
more anxiously for daylight and for land than wc
did not that our sufferings were any thing to what
has often befallen others about two o'clock we
landed safely and no words mine can do justice to
the expression sympathy and kindness with which
we were hailed by every one if any proof bad been
wanting that my administration had been satisfactory
here we had it unequivocally from all there was
not a dry eye and as we drove back to our former
home loud was the cry god be praised 
the property which i have lost on the most moderate
estimate cannot be less than cf but
the loss which have to regret beyond ail is mj
papers and drawings including my notes and observations
with memoirs and grammars dictionaries
and vocabularies and a grand map sumatra on
which i had been employed since my first arrival here
this however was not all all my collections in natural
history and my splendid collection drawings
upwards a thousand in number and to conclude
i will merely notice that there was scarce an unknown
animal bird beast or fish or an interesting
plant which we had not on board a living tapira
new species tiger splendid pheasants c c
all domesticated for the voyage we were in short a
perfect noah's ark all all has perished but thank
god our lives have been spared and we do not repine

harry was as much interested by this
as lucy had expected he admired the
activity and courage displayed by these
sufferers during the moment danger
and observed to his sister that the kindness
with which sir stamford was welcomed
on shore showed what a good governor
he had been he looked again at
the account and while lucy and he were
considering for which the losses they
were most sorry lucy exclaimed hark
a knock at the door that is to tell me that
my magnum bonum plum is ready and
you shall have it
she opened the door and received from
the hands the servant harry's camera
obscura in which with her father's assistance
she had fixed the new glass lucy
had prepared every thing she had a stand
ready so that harry could see and enjoy
it completely he did enjoy it as much as
she could have expected his eye was fixed
upon the landscape which he saw before
him and he admired the quiet cattle slowly
moving on the paper and the winding path
and the fresh green trees with their light
boughs dancing in the sunshine
while harry was looking at them and
considering what he saw before him lucy
exclaimed i know what you are thinking
 harry the coloured shadows we
used to see on the wall our room at
home
she darted out the room and returned
with a quarto volume now
harry cried she for blue shadows and
gi'een black shadows and red i will
read you all about them
she sat down and read 
 it is rather remarkable that so curious
an appearance as this blue shadows
should pass unnoticed near a century and
should then be hit upon by mere accident
buffon as he was busy about something
else observed that the shadows trees
which fell upon a white wall were green
here lucy read a curious but long account
 his observations upon green and
indigo shadows seen in different circumstances
ending with any person may see
a blue shadow if he will only hold his
finger before a piece white paper at sunrise
or sunset
harry said he should like to try this
 is it not all very entertaining asked
lucy
very said harry but is there not
some explanation given what is the
cause the different colours these shadows

there is a oreat deal about it in this
 replied lucy and the history 
a great many experiments which different
people have tried
let me see said harry stretching
out his hand for the 

no no said lucy they would betoo
difficult for you c besides they
would not be plums and you are to have
nothing else today i will put a mark in
the place for you and you may study coloured
shadows another time 
luc then turned over the pages quickly
to find a favourite anecdote about a poor
old woman who lived at montpelier butin
her search for the old woman she was
stopped on her way by an account a
prodigious rainbow lying on the ground
its colours almost as lively as any ever seen
in the heavens she chased the rainbow
into a chapter infinitely too deep for her
comprehension and found herself in the
midst single double and treble bows
and inverted bows in company with sir
isaac newton and bernoulli one minute
the next with m bouguer on the mountains
 peru or dr halley in chester
till neither she nor harry could tell where
she was she abandoned her chase the
rainbow but she stumbled upon her long
looked for old woman montpelier
 u
 and what her said harry has
she anything to say to the rainbow
nothing in the world my dear said
lucy quite another thing she had
bought a piece meat one day in the
market and hung it up in her bed room
dirty old woman said harry
poor old woman said lucy and at
night a very hot night it was she saw on
this meat which was hanging opposite to
the foot her bed what do you think
a bright light so bright as to illuminate the
wall the next day this luminous meat
which she thought was bewitched was
carried to henry bourbon duke conte
the governor the place who viewed it
with astonishment for some hours 
some lours harry thought that was
too much though he would gladly have
been allowed to pause upon it for a few
minutes the light as he guessed was
phosphoric and he reminded lucy a
shining light which they had once seen in
the shell a decayed lobster but lucy
rapidly turned over to a new page with an
account some experiments which boyle
tried on phosphoric substances placed in
the airpump then she went on to a
story doctor beale's cook who was
boiling some mackarel and saw the fish
and the water shining as if on fire and
the children the family diverting themselves
by running about the house with
the luminous drops which were as large as
pennypieces think that harry
she then ran on to father bourse's
voyage to the east indies during which
he noticed a wonderful luminous appearance
in the sea by which he could read in
the nioht
harry wished to know whether it proceeded
from putrescent substances or from
luminous insects he asked lucy if she
recollected having heard a captain in the
navy a friend his father's say that he
had brought to enoland and driven to sir
joseph banks some luminous animals
three inches long which he had taken up
from the southern ocean and which oave
so strong a light diet he could read a very
small print by one them which he had
put in a bucket salt water
lucy could not spare time to answer 
she wanted to read what would entertaining
as she hoped j more than asylum nous i insects
the bologna stone harry did you
ever hear this stone which gives light
in the dark and she read on for some
pages till she recollected quite a different
thing which she was sure would amuse
harry still more and throwing aside that
 she took up a description the
esquimaux houses built blocks snow
with wellturned domes and with windows
 thin ice this interested harry very
much but as lucy thought that he began
to look a little tired she hurried him out
 the house snow and read some anecdotes
 the esquimaux lady illigluk
who understood maps and drew charts so
well but whose head not being able to
bear the praises the english sailors she
became so conceited and affected that she
could do nothing but sit in her chair on
deck practising her airs
lucy again changed to something new
and travelled from the north pole to chili
and from chili to ali pacha and read the
account his delight in seeing ice made
in an air pump which had been sent out
to him from europe and in this manner
she went on almost all the morning flying
from one to another whenever she
thought she saw fatigue in harry's face
she turned to a fresh subject still fancying
that by variety entertainment she should
revive his attention and please him more
and more but at last observing his head
resting on his hand she stopped short and
said oh harry does your head ache
harry confessed it was beginning to ache
a little
i am very very sorry said lucy
 why did you not tell me sooner that you
were tired 
i did not know it till my head began
to ache said harry
i thought i was amusing you all the
time said lucy you told me that everything
i read was very entertaining
so each thing was said harry feelings
for her disappointment but altogether
they 
my dear harry say no more said
lucy sorrowfully and settling his cushions
she added there lay down your poor
head now and i will go away to mamma
harry was so much worn out that lucy
was not allowed to see him all the rest 
the morning and as she wished her mother
good night she said i see you were
quite right mamma i tired harry with
plums long before the the day
 my dear harry how do you do this
morning said lucy coming in with a
timid step and contrite look
 very well cried harry briskly perfectly
well thank you
 you have no reason to thank me said
lucy for giving you the head ache
but my head ache is gone now and it
was a good experiment after all
 a bad experiment for you i think
but good for me said lucy for now i
am convinced for life that plums all day
long will never do let them be ever so
sweet and well picked that mine were
well picked you will acknowledge harry
did you sleep well 
yes said harry and wakened this
morning as fresh as ever and then i spent
my time very happily in thinking
that is what i do sometimes when i
waken early said lucy and i think 
a hundred different things till i do not
know what i am thinking and fall
asleep again was that the way 
no said harry that was not the
way with me for i was thinking only 
one thing
what was that v asked lucy
harry hesitated i should like to tell
you lucy but perhaps it might vex you
oh no said lucy you cannot
vex me i am sure
 well then i was considering why i
was so much tired yesterday and i think i
have found it out shall i tell you
a cloud passed over lucy's brow at
this moment her mother came in with
harry's breakfast do you think
mamma said lucy there could be any
use in harry's going all over what passed
yesterday to tell me how i tired him so
much you know i am quite convinced
 my mistake
i am sure that said harry but
there were many reasons why i was so
tired i did not know them all myself till i
thought over the whole affair this morning
and it may be use to you to know them
i do not see much use said lucy
what do you say mamma 
i say that harry had better eat his
breakfast first and that afterwards as the
object a kind sister and good nurse
must be to entertain without fatiguing your
patient youhad better listen to his reasons
well mamma said lucy as i do
wish to be a good nurse i will ask him for
them as soon as he has done breakfast
accordingly the breakfast being dispatched
harry began with the comfortable
words i will be as short as lean in
the first place you know that my mind cannot
turn short round like a cranenecked
carriage whenever and wherever you
please yours can lucy therefore it
was more difficult to me than it was to you
to turn so frequently from one thing to
another from coloured shadows to luminous
insects and from the old woman at
montpelier to ali pacha but besides
this i was continually disappointed and
you know lucy disappointment tires
oh yes i allow that said lucy i
felt tired yesterday myself the moment i
was disappointed in my hopes entertaining
you but how were you disappointed
and continually too what do you
mean 
i mean that when my interest was excited
by any thing you read to me i was
disappointed in not having time to understand
it completely
i know it would have tired mc much
more said lucy if i had been obliged to
study every thing to the the chapter
i think not said harry i think
lucy we are always better satisfied when
we get to the bottom one thing before
we fly off to another
 i am afraid that is not always my case
said lucy but at all events it would not
have been good for you to have gone on
with euclid all day long
probably not said harry but i
have still another reason for you all the
time you were reading i was anxious and
i am sure anxiety tires as much as disappointment

 but what anxiety had you asked
lucy
 i was anxious not to be tired while
you were trying all you could to entertain
me and the more i wished this the more
weary i grew
and that was the very thing said
lucy that made me hurry on from one
thing to another for i thought sometimes
you looked fatigued but still harry you
see it was not the plums alone you were
tired because you were disappointed and
anxious
yes said harry but the plums in
themselves would have been too much intime
one grows tired being entertained

would it then mend the matter to read
tiresome things between the entertaining
ones said lucy
 i am not sure but it would replied
harry lucy laughed i mean continued
harry if the tiresome things are
worth reading for tiresome things often
leave useful impressions behind them besides
there is a pride in getting through
them and if there is any difficulty we have
the pleasure success
i agree to that said lucy a little
success or a little bit praise refreshes
me very much and i think harry you
will allow that you are not tired now for
i am sure you have got to the bottom 
this subject
harry was this day to arrange his occupations
and amusements in his own way
while lucy went out to her garden he applied
to euclid for half an hour that he
might as he said earn an appetite for a
story which he knew lucy had in store for
him nourjaliad he stopped her at
nourjahad's first sleep a hundred years
at a moment when he was very curious to
know what would come next what would
happen when he awakened then he went
to a translation a passage in euripides
which he said he would prepare for his father
after working at that for some time he
amused himself with the shipwreck the
winterton in which he was much interested
 but his father coming in an hour
was spent between greek and english
tolerably successfully and therefore without
fatigue the next hour was spent in
trying to complete an invention which he
had long had in contemplation lucy went
to her own affairs while he was thus occupied
and promised to return in half an
hour but at the this time when she
appeared he told her she might stay away
another half hour and then she found
him looking very much tired for he had
not been successful in his invention and
he had persisted in thinking it too
long he was however refreshed by some
more nourjahad in which he was very
happily engaged when lucy was summoned
by the sound the dressing bell 
looking at each other they both exclaimed
 so soon
we cannot pretend to say that on the
following days harry was always equally
successful in arranging his occupations so
that labour and rest should equal periods
keep much greater philosophers
than he daily fail in this attempt and
harry it seems was not always so great a
philosopher as he thought himself though
he had been very grand in resisting the
temptation reading too much nour
jahad at once yet one day temptation
came which he could not resist in the form
 baron trench's memoirs lucy began
to read it to him after his morning's mathematics
 but after reading an hour she
observed that it was time to go to her garden
harry intreated her to go on half an
hour longer if she was not tired not
in the least said lucy i am only
afraid tiring you half an hour an
hour longer she went on and then she left
him to repose but no repose could harry
take he was so anxious to know whether
the first hole that baron trench made in
his dungeon wall was discovered by his
jailor he eyed the which lucy had
left on the table as she thought out 
his reach but with the aid a pair 
lazy tongs he drew the tempting volume
to him and never stopped till it was
finished lucy coming in he asked her
voraciously for the second volume she
was astonished at his having already devoured
the first and demurred but soon
yielded to his imploring emphasis on the
persuasive little word do let me have
it my dear li short the whole day was
spent upon it when he had finished he
felt as if there was a universal blank in the
world nothing could interest him after
this strong stimulus and in the evening
he was obliged acknowledge that he was
very much tired indeed
lucy demurely observed and harry readily
agreed with her that we may tire
ourselves as much by going on too long
with one entertaining thing as by flying
about to a variety
it must be said on behalf harry that
his confinement to the sofa rendered it
somewhat difficult for him to get through
the day without fatigue mind because
he was debarred from that kind labour
 body which we call exercise and which
is found most useful in restoring the freshness
 the spirits lucyss power 
making him laugh had been often found the
best substitute for bodily exertion and she
again satisfactorily proved that laughter
holding both his sides takes and gives
exercise in the most salutary manner
mamma said lucy when they had
done laughing it was very well worth
while to listen that day to harry s reasons
i have not tired him so much since
never cried harry indeed she
has always hindered me from tiring myself

and do you know mamma continued
lucy he can do much more in the day
now than he could before because we
have arranged it rightly
harry observed that they had been
obliged to try a great many experiments
before they had brought things to this
happy conclusion
 you see mamma said lucy that
harry must have experiments some way or
other and now that he has neither balloons
or workshop or laboratory and cannot
stir from his sofa he is reduced to try them
on his own mind or on mine
and that is very convenient said
harry for we have all we want for the
purpose in ourselves mother do not you
think it is useful 
very useful my dear for by these
means you may learn to command your
own mind while at the same time you are
acquiring some insight into the minds 
others and by judiciously arranging your
occupations you may not only get more
done in the same period but you may
strengthen quicken and enlarge all the
powers your understanding
harry was now well enough to be brought
out into the common sitting room his
sofa had lahore castors which moved so
easily that lucy without any help could
roll him from room to room one eveningshe
was admiring these castors and harry
who had not failed to examine their construction
undertook to explain to her on what
their excellence depended he told her that
in common castors the upright pin round
which they turn is so short that it has no
support being only just long enough to
rivet through the lower plate the
brass socket but that in these castors the
pin is five or six inches long and tapered
to the upper which is made to play ina
little iron thimble let into the leo the
sofa so that you see lucy the long
pin is always kept in its place and as it
turns round with very little friction it allows
the wheel to take at once the direction in
which the leg is moving
father remarked that castors on the
same principle were now sold as a recent
invention by the name french castors
though a print a similar contrivance is
to be found in a dutch on windmills
printed above a hundred years ago in
vol k
this trivial circumstance harry is an example
 what i have often observed to
you that the same things are invented
in different countries by people who have
no communication with each other simply
because the same wants are felt and because
the same progress has been made in
knowledge indeed these very castors
were invented and used by a friend mine
in this kingdom thirty years ago and yet
i can readily believe that some frenchman
may have again re invented them still
more lately
but if your friend invented them first
said harry i think it is wrong that they
should be called french castors
it is not worth while for nations or individuals
to dispute about such trifles my
dear boy said his father no persons who
have much invention are meanly anxious
to contest on every petty occasion their
claims to originality their feeling is 
better invent something new than dispute
about the past
here the conversation was interrupted
by tke arrival a lady who was to drink
tea with them when tea was over she
produced from her workbag a little manuscript
 containing a collection 
riddles and charades which she had brought
for harry's amusement lucy liked them
because she found them out quickly
harry was uncommonly slow and unsuccessful
in his attempts even hints intended
to help him invariably set him more
wrong he soon came to pray tell me
and when told he could not always understand
the explanations they appeared
more difficult than the riddles themselves
especially when both lucy and the lady were
explaining them to him at once and in different
ways however he was so good
humoured and afforded so much diversion
by his strange guesses and extraordinary
misapprehensions that their visitor as she
closed her declared that for her part
she should have been quite sorry if he had
made them out better sixorseven special
favourites she left copies with lucy and
after her departure harry begged lucy to
go over these again with him one by one
k 
if he had ever known he had by this time
forgotten their meaning so that they were
to be guessed by him again with lucy's
assistance
 first said lucy comes a riddle
you eat me you drink me deny it alio can 
i'm sometimes a woman and sometimes a man
i'm sometimes a woman and sometimes
a man repeated harry and yet you are
eaten only cannibals eat men and women 
and yet this cannot be a cannibal you
may as well tell me at once lucy for i
cannot find it out
then it is a toast said lucy you
eat a toast and you drink a toast do not
you and sometimes a woman is a toast
and sometimes a man deny it who can
harry could not deny it but he observed
it was a play upon the different
meanings the word
 yes and a happy play said lucy
happy for you who found it out
said harry well i have now some notion
how to set to work i shall look in
the next for a play upon the words now
for number two which he read accordingly
with his usual deliberation
i'm latin i'm english
both one and the other 
but the latin one half
is english for t'other
but neither latin nor english half could
he make out and when lucy told him it
was a toad it was a considerable time before
he could divide toad into to and ad or
comprehend that being latin for to and
each word being composed two letters the
terms the problem were exactly fulfilled
he acknowledged that it was a shame for
him not to have found out this as his latin
should have helped him but he sheltered
himself under the change pronunciation
in both words lucy told him that such
little variations sound must be allowed
or there would be no getting on with riddles

very well i will make allowance
another time and that will help me i hope
to make out number three
inscrib'd on many a learned page
in mystic characters and sage
long time my first has stood
and though its golden age be past
in wooden walls it yet may last
till clothed in flesh and blood
 my second is a glorious prize
for all who love their wondering eyes
with curious sights to pamper
but should they chance this prize to meet
al improvise in the street
oh how twould make them scamper f
my third's a sort wandering throne
to woman limited alone
the salique law reversing 
but when th imaginary queen
prepares to act this novel scene
her royal part rehearsing
overturning her presumptuous plan
up jumps the old usurper man
the lady had said that she believed this
riddle was composed by a great statesman
charles fox and lucy thought this very
likely from his statesmanlike allusion to
the salique law but be it written by
whom it might she thought it very ingenious

while she was saying all this harry
was pondering over the manuscript lucy
advised him to leave any first and go on
ta my second because he could easily guess
what would make any body run away if
suddenly met in the street and what
would at the same time be a curious sight
he did make out that this misfht be a
wild beast a tiger or a lion lucy bid
him stick to lion and goon to consider what
could be a wandering throne for woman 
yet a throne which must be enjoyed with
the assistance man with infinite
difficulty harry at last guessed a sedan
chair but sedan chair and lion would not
make any sort sense therefore said
lucy remember up jumps the old usurper
man that may help you but all
her helps were vain
oh tell me said he groaning
 a pillion said she he stared and
looked blank till she had repeated it syllabically

he went back to the pill the mystic
characters inscribed on many a learned
page being the physician s recipe and
the allusions to the old custom gilding
pills and to their present wooden receptacles
harry acknowledged to be somewhat
ingenious but he could not pass over
the fault in the spelling there was an 
too little if the lion's share was taken from
him to complete the pill lucy assured
him that he must make some allowance in
the spelling as well as in pronunciation 
a kind poetical licence must be given
he was willing to give any licence
which the laws riddlemakers allowed
all he asked was to know the laws that
he might guide himself by them
but the laws will not guide you much
i am afraid said lucy let us go on
with the fourth and we shall see
my first doth affliction denote
which my second was born to endures
my third is a sure antidote
that affliction to soften and cure
harry had no time nor opportunity to
puzzle or blunder at this for his father
hearing the words exclaimed that is
woman is it not lucy and addressing
himself to her mother observed that this
charade reminded him fontenelle's just
and elegant description the female sex 
ce sexe sans lequel le commencement
de la vie serait sans secours le milieu
sans plaisir et la fin sans consolation
lucy now read number five 
 my first conveys the irish lass
to ballyshannon fair 
my second oft contains a mass
 gold and diamonds rare 
my third is worn by those i wot
who gold and diamonds wear 
the irish lass she wants it not
at ballyshannon fair
harry gave this up for said he i
know nothing about irish lasses or ballyshannon
fair it is quite impossible for me
to make this out so tell it me lucy
 carmine
i wot he does not know that use it
said his mother
i do mother and you do not make
that use it answered he with a knowing
smile and i am glad you do not
do you remember lucy that when i was a
k 
very little boy and going my rounds wishing
good night i had to kiss a lady that
shall be nameless who wears quantities 
rouge i did not know that and unfortunately
kissed away half her cheek and left the
oddest mark i could not help staying to
look at it and she was very angry but
now go on lucy and read your next which
is so short that i hope it will be easy 
the beginning eternity the time and
space
the beginning every and the every
place
he looked very serious it sounded so
stand that he fancied it must be something
sublime and much was he provoked
when he was told at last that what
he had been aiming so high to reach was
only the letter e
but you found it out lucy cried he
how could you 
i cannot tell said she
oh do recollect what put it into your
head that it was a letter what was your
first thought how did you go on pray
think lucy
thus urged to it lucy did her best to
recollect and after a pause deep consideration
and snuffing the candles which
did not want snuffing she said that at
first she thought as harry did that it must
be something very sublime but its being
the every place convinced me
said she that it could not be any thing
serious then the contradictions the
impossibilities showed me it could not be
any one real thing except a letter
except a letter but how did you
come to that exception
lucy said she had long ago heard a
very pretty enigma upon the letter h
beginning 
twas whispered in heaven twas muttered in
hell's
she confessed she should never have found
it out if she had not heard this
that is really a great comfort to my
stupidity said harry for i never heard
one that sort before
now my dear harry let me go on to
another which i must tell you beforehand
is quite a different kind it is a
charade 
my first is a french negative my second an
english characteristic my whole the essence 
all the charades that ever were or ever will be
written
i do believe it is nonsense exclaimed
harr
it is harry said lucy how did
you find it out 
by my english characteristic said
harry drawing himself up with a look 
mock pride
since you have found this out said
lticy perhaps you can find out the next
and it is the last now this is not a
charade it is a conundrum burke's
famous satirical conundrum
what is majesty stripped its externals
harry went to work carefully and rationally
considering what are the externals
 a king
but lucy laughing told him that all his
fine reasonings would only carry him away
from the answer
 lead me to it then said he the
way you found it out
 i did not find it out said lucy but
i will tell you how i happened to know it
once in my old copybook in large hand
there was the word majesty it was divided
this way majests with hyphens between
each syllable look harry wdiat do you
see in the middle i 
 oh i see it now said harry jest
 yes said lucy and when i showed
my copy to mamma she or somebody in
the room repeated this conundrum
 it is very good said harry m andy
are the externals and it is a jest this is
very witty i acknowledge but i never
should have discovered it it is quite
different from any the others the
worst it is that after labouring ever so
hard at one riddle it does not in the least
lead to another the next is always on
some different principle 
 yes to be sure said lucy nobody
who knows how to puzzle would give
two riddles the same kind that would
be rather too plain
 but then without something to guide
me said harry there is no getting on
 not in your regular way said lucy
you cannot go on from one riddle to
another as you do in euclid from one
proposition to another and say by the first
proposition and by the second and so on
that is the very thing i complain 
said harry
complain but my dear harry riddles
are meant only to divert one
but they do not divert me when they
only puzzle me said harry
 but the object all riddlemakers
said lucy is to make riddles as puzzling
as they possibly can
well then said harry since you
seem to be in the riddlemaker's secrets
lucy pray explain to me the ways they
take to puzzle or rather the rules by which
you guess their meaning y
i would if i could harry but i
really have no rules i can only find out
riddles by lucky guesses happy hits i
do not know how or why but all at once i
see i feel that will dos a thought flashes
 
across my mind just as quickly as the
flame that candle jumped to mamma's
taper and lighted it as if by magic did
you see the flame jump 
i did said harry and i wish the
riddlemaker's ways were as plain as that
the taper had been just blown out and
there was a little smoke which still contained
some the inflammable gas from
the melted wax this you see made a
kind road for the flame to run along
in an instant the flame seemed to dart
upon the taper
it is just in that manner said lucy
that our thoughts dart from one idea to
another and sometimes without any connection
between them
no no said harry we may not
perceive any but i dare say there always
is some sort connection between our
thoughts like the train smoke between
the candles
 but mamma said lucy all this
time i want to hear your riddle very much
the lady interrupted you and you never
told it will you give us yours now
mamma
mine my dear said her mother
it is not mine it was written by
but i will not tell you by whom i never
like to prejudice you by celebrated names
judge for yourself
she repeated to them the following
lines 
we are spirits all in white
on a field as black as night 
there we dance and sport and play
changing every changing day 
yet with us is wisdom found
as we move in mystic round
mortal would'st thou know the grains
that ceres heaps on lydian plains
or leaves that yellow autumn strews
or the stars that herschel views 
or find how many drops would drain
the widescoops bosom the main
or measure central depths below 
ask us and thou shalt know
with fairy feet we compass round
the pyramid's capacious mound
or step by step ambitious climb
the cloudcapped mountain's height sublime
riches though we do not use
tis ours to gain and ours to lose
from araby the blest we came
in every land our tongue's the same 
and if our number you require
go count the bright ionian quire
would'st thou cast a spell to find
the track light the speed wind 
or when the snail with creeping pace
shall the swelling globe embrace 
mortal our's the powerful spell 
ask us for we can tell
beautiful cried lucy
yes beautiful poetry at least said
harry whatever else it is mother
will you repeat it once more for i quite
forgot to think finding it out
after it had been repeated lucy had
several the lines by heart and harry
had all the ideas lucy made a variety
 good guesses but wonderful to tell
harry found it out first he fixed upon
one positive assertion 
from araby the blest we came
here was a clear fact by the test which
he tried all his own suppositions and all
lucy's guesses as fast as they occurred
in every clime our tongue's the same
repeated lucy that may be the alphabet

 that did not come from araby the
blest it came from phoenicia you know
my father told us said harry
 hieroglyphics then said lucy
they are in every tongue the same
they will do for what is said about the
pyramids too
but hieroglyphics came from egypt
not arabia said harry
he had thought a telescope and a
barometer and a pedometer one after another
as he heard numbering the
stars and measuring the height the
 mountains or the breadth the pyramids
but none these things came from
 araby the blest
lucy mean time had flown off as she
was bid to the muses
if our number you require
go count the bright ionian quire
 their number must be nine harry
said she
then i know what they are cried
harry the nine arabic figures we
have it mother 
yes they come from araby the blest 
and they can number the stars and measure
the earth they do all that is required
harry is right is not he mother
cried lucy i am sure he is by your
smile
her mother made no answer but repeated

we are spirits all in white
on a field as black as night
there we dance and sport and play
changing every changing day
chalk figures on a black board said
harry
 or figures on a slate said lucy 
they are white on a field black and
they change every day on my slate i am
sure
now you have it said their mother
and good night it is very late we
must roll harry back again
one moment mamma said lucy
before we go will you tell us who wrote
those lines
the same person who wrote the hymns
which you learned by heart lucy the
same person harry who wrote your favourite
 perseverance against fortune
and many other things in evenings at
home which you like so much
mrs barbauld mamma the same
person who wrote the beautiful essay you
read in that we saw at digby castle
at the which was written in sir
rupert's own hand 
 admirable morality in most elegant
and classical language i wish mrs barbald
had written more
 papa said lucy i wish you would
be so good as to give harry and me one 
your old sort puzzles
my old sort puzzles my dear 
what do you mean
such questions i mean as you used
 against inconsistency in our expectations
in miscellaneous pieces by j akin m d and
anna laetitia barbauld
to ask us sometimes when we were sittinground
the fire last winter you may remember
papa one in particular which i
found out it was sancho panza's judgment
when he was governor the island
about the old man and the ten golden
crowns which were hid in the hollow staff
can you give us some other questions like
that papa
pray do father said harry or if
you have none those ready some question
like hero's crown or the kite and
pompey's pillar
only whatever it is pray papa added
lucy let there be along with the question
some little story
but my dear children said their
father i am not a baof stories and
questions as you seem to think me into
which you can put your hand and pull
one out whenever you please you must
give me a few minutes for recollection by
the time you have finished that game 
chess perhaps i shall have thought one
in a few minutes lucy warned her father
that she should very soon be beaten
there checkmate it is all over
with me
 but you made no battle said harry 
you were not worth beating you were
in such a hurry to get to the story
may be so said lucy now papa
is going to begin and we may roll your
sofa up close to the teatable this being
done their father began as follows 
 three arab brethren a noble family
were travelling together for improvement
it happened one day that their road lay
across a great plain sand where there
was little else to be seen except a few tufts
 grass towards the close the day
they met a cameldriver who asked them
if they had seen and could give him any
tidings a camel that he had lost
 was not your camel blind an eye
said the elder brother yes said the
cameldriver it had a tooth out before
said the second brother and it was
lame said the third very true replied
the man pray tell me which way it
went did it not carry asked the
arabians a vessel oil and a vessel 
honey it did indeed answered the
cameldriver pray tell me where you
met it met it we never saw your
camel they replied
 the enraged cameldriver could not
believe this he charged them with having
stolen his camel and brought them before
the prince from their manners and the
wisdom their answers to the questions
which the prince asked them upon other
subjects he was persuaded that they were
above committing such a theft he set
them at liberty but requested that before
they departed they would inform him how
they could possibly have hit upon so many
circumstances that were true without ever
having seen the camel
the brothers could not refuse to comply
with so just a request and after thanking
him for his clemency and kindness the
eldest spoke thus 
 we are not magicians nor have weever
seen the man's camel all we know
 him was discovered by the use our
senses and our reason i judged that he
was blind an eye because 
 now harry and lucy explain if you
can the methods by which the three
brothers guessed that the camel was blind
 an eye and lame a leg that he had
lost a front tooth and was laden with a
vessel oil and another honey
harry asked whether there was anything
in the camel driver himself by which
they judged no there was nothing in
or about the cameldriver that gave any
assistance
 papa i wish you would help us a
very little said lucy
do you not recollect telling me this
morning that you knew my horse had been
at the door though you did not see it
by the tracks oh yes papa cried
lucy no other horse ever comes up
that gravelpath and as the arabians
were travelling on a sandy desert probably
they had seen no other tracks but that
one camel but how did they know that
he was lame one leg 
the camel would put the lame foot
down more cautiously than the others
said harry and the trace that footstep
would be always less deep than those
 the other three
the bled eye was a more difficult question
lucy thought the camel might have
swerved more to one side than to the
other or perhaps the footsteps might show
places where he had started out the path
and always on the same side a few other
guesses were made but nothing more was
found out this evening
the next morning lucy said she had
thought the camel and the three brothers
the moment she wakened but the more
she thought the more she was puzzled
she was just going to add papa i give
it up but harry advised her to have
patience a little longer it happened at
this instant that her mother was helping
her to some honey a drop ell on the
tablecloth and a bee which was flying
about the room settled upon the sweet
spot
lucy started with delight on observing
this and exclaimed harry harry i
have found it out the vessel honey
leaked the drops fell on the sand and
vol l
the brother observed the little collections
 bees or insects which had settled on
them i am right for papa smiles as
to the oil some that might have been
spilled by the jolting the lame camel
the loss the tooth is all that now remains
so i leave that to you harry you
look as if you had a bright thought
 i remember said harry my father
in the beginning the story told us that
there were a few tufts grass on the road 
the hungry camel for no doubt he was
hungry in the desert might have bitten
these and one the sharpeyed brothers
might have seen that in each bite a few
blades grass stood up higher than the
rest because the gap left by the want
 the tooth
now we have it all right said lucy
and we were very little helped considering
 
 but i wish we had not been helped
at all said harry i wonder whether
any body our age ever found out these
questions without any help 
his father said that the questions had
perhaps never been asked before certainly
not in the same manner in which he had put
them because he had altered them for the
present purpose in the story from which
they were taken some the questions
would have been too difficult for harry
and lucy but they were now ambitious
to try these and their father was willing
to comply with their wish warning them
however the improbability success
in the original story said he instead
 a camel it was a horse and one
 the brothers discovered that the horse
had silver shoes and a golden bit and he
also told the exact value or fineness the
silver the shoes and the gold the
bit how did he know all this
i cannot conceive said lucy yet
perhaps if you give us time papa some
accident might put us in the right road
some lucky list like the falling the
honey on the tablecloth and the bee
settling on it might lead us to invent the
thing whatever it is
no lucy said her fitlier no lucky
hit could possibly help you to this you
l
want some particular facts without which
you cannot answer the question
 then cannot you be so good as to tellus
those particular facts said harry
 no my dear answered his father
they depend on the art assaying
metals that is ascertaining their fineness
and value so i may as well tell you
at once that the wise brothers had observed
the marks which the horse's shoes
had left on some stones in the path they
had also observed the marks which the
golden bit had left on the stone trough at
a well where the horse had rubbed it in
drinking the skilful eye one the
brothers had been able to judge the
fineness and value the golden bit and
silver shoes by the different colours these
marks
harry pondered for a few moments and
then observed that the difficulty explaining
these puzzling questions sometimes
arises from our not having the particular
sort knowledge that is necessary
and sometimes from our not being able to
recollect that which we really have for
instance said he we knew all that was
necessary for answering the first four questions
 all the difficulty was just to recollect
and apply our knowledge to the
purpose
 you can hardly call it knowledge
said lucy if you mean such little observations
as those about the tracks a horse
or the bees settling on the honey everybody
knows that bees eat honey
and yet it was for want oiu recollecting
those little things which every body
knows that we were puzzled so long said
harry
well then harry said lucy if a
fairy were to give you your choice this
minute all the knowledge from all the
books in the world without ofivinof you the
power recollecting it or the power 
recollecting well whatever knowledge you
could acquire for yourself which would
you choose 
to be sure i would choose the power
 recollecting well whatever i could get
for myself said harry for what use
would it be to me to have all the knowledge
in all the books that ever were written
if your fairy forbids my ever recollecting
any it when i want it
but i did not say that there should be
any forbidding in the case you may recollect
the knowledge she gives you just as
you please or can
please or can repeated harry there
is a great difference between them to be
sure i should please to recollect if i
could but often i cannot and it would
be still more difficult if i were to have that
immensity knowledge which your fairy
offers me i should never be able to find
any one thing i wanted in such a mass i
should be my whole life getting it into any
tolerable order
ah then you would feel the use 
what you would not allow when i was
sorting my shells classification harry
no single head could contain all the
knowledge all men's heads put together
said harry whether classified or not
but suppose my fairy has the power
to make yours contain it all said lucy
 would you have it yes or no she is
waiting for an answer
no is my answer said harry no
thank you mrs fairy i would rather not
have that load learning but for the
power recollecting quickly i should be
very much obliged to you indeed i feel
every day how much i want it and i cannot
get it for myself but knowledge i can
work for and get for myself nature or
one your good fairies must give memory
i wish one would appear this minute and
offer it to me
and i said lucy would be equally
obliged to her for knowledge but mamma
is it not curious that harry would refuse
the offer the knowledge and 
should be for accepting it what would
you do mamma and what would you
papa r
her mother agreed with lucy that she
would accept the knowledge and run her
chance for recollecting what she might
want her father joined with harry in
dreading the overwhelming quantity 
learning and in preferring the gift recollection
it should be observed that his
father like harry had not a remarkably
good memory but that both lucy and her
mother had quick recollective powers 
each chose according to their sense 
their own deficiencies and each argued
according to their own view the matter
long but not loud the question was
debated on each side even till the last cup
 tea lingered and grew cold
for some time harry and his father maintained
their argument on the ground that
it was best to accept from the fairy that
which cannot be obtained by one's own
exertions but this stronghold was shaken
by the attacks the opposite party and
lucy or rather her mother doubted the
truth the principle that the powers 
memory cannot be improved at length
they all rose from the breakfast table pretty
much but not quite the same opinions
with which they began it was however
settled that no hasty answer should be
given to the fairy till the matter had been
reconsidered and that in the mean time
the business the day must proceed
after harry's business the daw was
done his pleasure was to make a model
 a machine which he had been inventing
with some cards that lucy had brought
him she sat at work beside him but
her work was often put down while they
talked
 there was something mentioned yesterday
evening said lucy about a kite
and pompey's pillar i do not know what
you meant about the kite but i do know
a story about an obelisk
 i will tell you all i know said harry
about the pillar and the kite and then
you can tell me your story 
some english sailors laid a wager
that they would drink a bowl punch on
the summit pompey's pillar now that
pillar is almost a hundred feet high and
it is quite sniootli so that there was noway
 climbing to the top even for sailors
who are such experienced climbers the

question my father asked me was how did
they get up 
 i cannot conceive how a kite could
help them said lucy
you shall see said harry they
flew their kite exactly over the pillar so
that when it came down on the opposite
side the string lay across the top the
capital by means the string they
pulled a small rope over and by this a
larger one that was able to bear the weight
 a man a pulley was then fastened to
the the large rope and drawn close
up to the upper edge the capital and
then you know lucy they could easily
hoist each other up they did more for
they hoisted the english flag on the top
 mr pompey's pillar and they drank
their bowl punch there and they won
their wager
and they deserved it for their ingenuity
said lucy but my story is
quite different one evening after a wet
day as we were standing at the window
i observed that the ropes were very
tight between the posts in the fence 
they did not hani down nearly so low
as usual papa asked me if i could
tell the reason and i said that i supposed
the wet had swelled the ropes and
shortened them it was about our hygrometer
time harry so it was easy forme
to think this then papa recollected
the obelisk story but first i should
warn you as he did me that probably it is
not true
 well well let me hear it said harry
laughing whether it be true or false 
then you must know that there is at
rome a famous obelisk egyptian granite
and prodigious weight after it had
been brought from egypt to rome it lay
on the ground a length time no one
having ventured to erect it at last a great
architect and mechanic was employed for
this purpose by the pope great preparations
were made for fear injuring the
obelisk if it should fall but my father
did not describe the machinery
i am sorry for it said harry
 i could not have remembered it for you
if he had whatever the machinery might
have been the obelisk was at last raised
so as to be very nearly but not quite upright
the men pulled and pulled at the
ropes but oh terrible disappointment it
was found that they could not be tightened
any more by any means that had been
provided or that the architect could suggest
there the obelisk huno the workmen at
a stand the spectators all silent and the
architect in despair i forgot to tell you
harry that the pope had ordered under
pain death that nobody should speak
during the operation butt the instant when
none knew what to do an english sailor
from the crowd called out with a loud voice
wet the ropes water was thrown over
them they soon shortened just sufficiently
to raise the obelisk to its right place and
it stood perfectly perpendicular
harry thought it was a pretty story
whether true or not he could scarcely
think he said that the shrinking the
ropes would have been sufficient nor could
he imagine how the people could get upto
wet them all it however reminded him
 a circumstance which he had heard his
father relate to sir rupert digby
the walls some great building in
paris were beginning to give way under
the weight the roof they were pressed
outwards and were no longer exactly perpendicular
to squeeze them in and make
them again upright was the thing to be
done for this purpose several strong iron
bars were laid across the building from
wall to wall about half way up and their
ends were left projecting on the outside fires
were then lighted underneath these iron
bars till they were nearly red hot which
caused them to expand and while in their
highest state expansion large thick
plates iron with holes in their centres
were slipped on the ends the bars
close up against the outside the walls
and secured there as firmly as possible by
great iron nuts which screwed on after
them the bars were then allowed to
cool and in cooling they contracted and
consequently the iron plates and the walls
with them were drawn a little closer together
the operation was then repeated
with another set bars and so on alternately
with the two sets till the walls
were gradually restored to their perpendicularity

lucy thought this exceedingly ingenious
she observed too that harry had recollected
it at the right moment though he
complained so much his memory
after this a honos silence ensued
what can you have been thinking 
all this time said lucy only that
model you are making 
i have been thinking a great many
other things said harry among others
 some the questions my father asked
us last winter do you remember one
about a persian painter i cannot recollect
exactly how it was
yes i remember it said lucy it
was a very simple thing and yet i could
not answer it an lilian prince a conqueror
kouli khan or nadir shah or
tamerlane or bajazet or some those
people found among his prisoners after
some great victory a persian painter now
the conquering prince whoever he was
was not remarkably handsome he was
blind an eye lame a leg and one 
his arms was shorter than the other but
this man pleased the prince so much by
drawing his portrait in an attitude which
concealed all his personal defects that he
gave him his liberty without ransom and
 course half a dozen purses gold
besides he painted him drawing a bow
kneeling on the lame knee shutting the
blind eye and pulling back the lame arm
this attitude was the question
 well done the painter said
harry but not well done lucy for
this i think was an easy question particularly
for you who draw and are used to
think attitudes for figures how happened
it that you could not find it out at
the time you wanted 
 because i was thinking something
else
what when papa asked you the
question 
yes said lucy it put me in mind
 something else at first setting out and
off went my head to that other thing and
i could not get it back again
and pray what did it go off to
said harry
oh to nonsense my dear said lucy
 first when my father spoke an indian
prince and a great conqueror i began to
think who it could be that was lame and
blind and such a frightful figure then
i thought tamerlane and then the
iron cage in which he was shut up by
bajazet and then off went my thoughts
still further to a print garrick in the
character bajazet then came his great
turban before my eyes and the little cock's
feather in front which i thought looked
like the feather spun glass that you gave
me ages ago this put me in mind 
mamma's saying it was dangerous to wear
that spun glass because the little bits
might fall into our eyes my thoughts
then jumped off to the glasshouse in
short when papa asked me for the answer
i started my head was a hundred miles
off at least
i have often done the same thing and
felt the same way said harry about
questions my father has asked us another
reason for my not finding out the right
answer is that some fixed notion has taken
possession my wise head beforehand
and which i cannot get rid did you
ever feel this lucy
 oh yes said lucy and i recollect
having often been a provokingly long time
in answering something that was quite
easy merely because i had made sure that
it was difficult for instance that easiest
 questions which you asked me once 
a herring and a half for three halfpence
how many for elevenpence i fancied
because it was so gravely asked there
must be something difficult in it
harry smiled
 and you harry yourself continued
lucy may recollect you were full as long
a time as i was about the herrings in finding
how to write fiftysix with four fives
yes said harry because i had
taken it into my head that it must be
written in roman figures and this prejudice
prevented me from thinking the
right way with common figures and fractions
in this manner but now
continued harry let me before i forget
it give you another a better or a worse
instance the same sort prejudice ina
real good question my father's sometime
ago the day my father took me into
the dockyard he showed me a ship lying
in what is called a dock the keel was
to be repaired and for this purpose it was
necessary to raise up the ship so that the
workmen might get underneath the question
my latter asjkcu ms vraa ixow lie
vessel could be raised i was an hour
puzzling about it because i was prepossessed
with a particular notion about tackles
and ropes with which i had seen sailors
raising and lowering a boat and i thought
the ship could be raised only in that sort
 way my father showed me the absurdity
 that idea and then i thought 
levers but i could get no further i went
on thinking levers and pulleys and
windlasses but never the easy way that
was before my eyes to let in the water
from outside the dock the water
you know would gradually float the vessel
and raise it up to the proper height where
it could be propped up and the water let
out again next tide
how simple said lucy just as
our boat in the lock was raised i wonder
you did not think that but harry
yesterday i heard my father talking to you
 some different way raising a ship
when it wanted to be repaired i came
into the room in the middle what you
were saying i wish you would explain
it if you can
i will try said harry you must
first all knows that when a vessel is
floated into a dock to be repaired she is
allowed to settle down with her keel upon
thick wooden blocks aloof the middle 
the dock and then i must tell you lucy
that formerly when she was to be raised
up for the people to get under the keel
two or three hundred shores or props 
timber were placed all under her bottom
nearly upright wedges were then just
pointed under the lower each 
these shores and all the workmen from
every part the dockyard being summoned
with their mauls or huge hammers
and stationed one or two to each shore
the wedges were all struck at the same
instant by word command a few blows
from all the mauls was sufficient just to
raise the ship from off the blocks which
were then taken away and the ship was
left hanging in the air supported by the
shores
 this was a very troublesome business
and wasted a great deal time and labour
but by the new way all this difficulty is
avoided the blocks on which the keel
is to lie are not solid lumps wood they
are composed three pieces two which
are wedges and when these are knocked
out the centre piece the block falls
the ship is floated into the dock as usual
and when the water subsides the keel
rests on the newfashioned blocks the forest
 shores are then firmly placed under all
parts the ships bottom in the same
way as i described to you before but
without any wedges now lucy comes
the beautiful contrivance two or three
men only are sufficient to do the rest 
they give a few knocks on the sides the
wedges which the blocks are composed
out they fly the blocks sink and the
ship hangs on the shores i do hope you
understand this lucy
yes i am sure i do said lucy but
it is such a pretty contrivance that should
like very much to see it done suppose
you make an experiment with your little
boat in our canal
so i will with pleasure when i am
well said harry it is very agreeable
to explain these things to you now lucy
added he because you do not think you
know it all before i can get my words or
thoughts out
it is a great while harry said lucy
since you called me mrs quickquick
it is a great while said harry looking
a little ashamed and i am glad 
it i think you are quite cured that
lucy added he
are you sure that i am quite cured
 yes perfectly cured he twice repeated
with emphasis and even if you
had not cured yourself i should not be so
impatient now i hope as i was then i
should be very ungrateful if i were you
who are so kind and goodnatured to me 
thinking nothing from morning till night
but what you can do to make me happy
 then if you are happy so am i said
lucy but harry i must tell you that
you are a little mistaken i am often in
too great a hurry still though you do not
see it because i have learned not to be in
such haste to speak but in thinking i
still often make sad mistakes and really
am prevented from finding things out by
being too quick
give me an instance said harry
i will said lucy about a thing
that happened very lately when we were
walking in the garden papa and i stopped
to look at the sundial which put him in
mind a story he told me that there
was a statue forget where on the statue
was this inscription whoever watches
my head and opens it on a certain day 
the year and at a certain hour that
day will if the sun shines find a treasure
the day and hour were mentioned on
the appointed day and at the appointed
hour some travellers who had read the
inscription assembled round the statue
the sun did shine but what was to be
done some were for pulling the statue
down to get at its head for it was oriaantic
height others proposed clambering upto
break open the head they did scramble
up and they did open the head but there
was nothing in it the people were very
much disappointed and they all went away
one after another grumbling at the statue
and the inscription which had made such
fools them one however wiser
than the rest stayed behind and understanding
the inscription rightly followed
its directions and found the treasure 
and how did he find it was the question
papa asked me and now i ask it you
harry
harry said he had met with the story
somewhere before the man observed
where the shadow the statue s head fell
on the plain at the appointed hour and
there he opened the ground just under
the shadow the head and found the
promised treasure was not that the
answer
exactly said lucy but i could
not find it out and all because i was too
quick
 how did your quickness hinder you 
said harry 
 i recollected another statue which
you had told me harry and as soon as i
heard the words statue and a certain hour
and the sun shining i galloped off to
your statue memnon which at a certain
hour in the day when the sun shone
on it used to send forth certain musical
sounds for the music was made as you
told me by the air when heated rushing
out holes in some pipes which were in
memnon s lyre all this i was thinking
and contriving how i could make sense 
it for i imagined that the statue's head
must be managed in the same way then
another strange thought came into my
head that the music which i had settled
this statue should play should be like our
play magical music and that it should
sound loudly or softly as the travellers
went nearer or further from the right place
and so guide them to it
very ingenious at least said harry
but it was all wrong said lucy
but i see mamma before the door with
her bonnet on cried lucy starting up
and looking out the window i daresay
she is going to walk to digby castle
and i should like to go with her if you
can spare me harry
 oh yes and thank you for the time
you have stayed said harry only
before you go give me a few large pins 
six stout pins thank you now away
with you my dear i shall be quite happy
till you come back again
when lucy returned from her walk she
brought a basket filled with flowers from
the hothouse at digby castle after
holding them for half a minute to harry to
vol m
admire and smell she began to put them
into a flowerpot telling him that she had
something solid for him at the bottom 
her basket under the flowers
 i know what it is said harry it is
a 
lucy looked immediately at the sides 
her basket to see if harry could have
spied the through the openings 
the wickerwork but that was impossible
you only guessed i suppose harry
that it was most likely that i should bring
you a 
harry said that he did not guess but
that he was quite sure it on which
lucy went to his sofa and looked from
thence out the window
but you could not while sitting here
said she see the mountain path down
which we came
i did see you said harry walking
down that path with a in your hand
and when you reached the great thornbush
i saw mamma sit down
then harry you must have got off
your sofa to look out the window
cried lucy oli fie harry you were
not to quit your sofa without leave from
the surgeon
i never stirred from the sofa said
harry
oh i have it now cried lucy 
the mirror out the camera obscura
 you are right said harry now
tell me what is the you were looking
into and where is it
 it is here in my basket said lucy
 but you shall not know its name yet i
must first tell you that in our walk to
digby castle i was giving mamma an
account what you and i had just been
talking about she said nothing or very
little only smiled now and then when
we reached the castle she went to the
library to look for some books and among
others she took down this which she put
into my hand telling me that perhaps i
should find some things in it like what you
and i had been saying to each other the
author was a most celebrated philosopher
i will not tell you his name harry but
m 
only think his having observed in his
own mind the very same sort faults
that we find in ours look at the heads
 these pages wandering attentions
that is my complaint then comes 
words abuse that means something
like what you hate in riddles harry
play upon words or using words inaccurately
which he says is a very great fault
in reasoning
i like him for that said harry whoever
he is
then said lucy here comes prejudice
and here is transferring 
thoughts by which he means not transferring
the not being able to turn them
from one subject to another easily that
you know harry is what you call your
ofreat hindrance look here it is
my picture at full length said harry
let me look at it
but it is not like you nowe said lucy
holding the fast
let me see said harry or if you
will not let me see let me hear
lucy read aloud 
men thus possessed in company that is with
their own favourite thoughts said lucy are as if
they lay under the power enchantment they see
not what passes before their eyes hear not the
audible discourse the company
like me i acknowledge on my disagreeable
day in the carriage said harry
when i did not hear what any you
were saying
 oh listen to this continued lucy
 and when by any strong application these absent
people are roused a little they are like men
brought to themselves from some remote region 
whereas in truth they come no farther than from
their secret cabinet within where they have been
wholly taken up with the puppet which was for that
time appointed for their entertainment the shame
that such dumps cause to wellbred people when it
carries them away from the company where they
should bear a part in the conversation is a sufficient
proof that it is a fault in the conduct their understanding

lucy repeated her opinion that this was
not like harry now with a very strong
consolatory emphasis on that word
but tell me said harry what were
you and my mother doing when i saw you
at the thornbush you and she opened
and shut the several times what
were you about
 looking at different parts this 
lucy replied mamma informed me
that it will tell us not our fortunes but
our faults therefore whoever does not like
to know them must not open it
i am not such a coward said harry
nor such a fool i will open it directly
then i must hold it for you said
lucy as mamma did for me
she held it between her hands and
bade him put his finger into the leaves
and take his chance
harry opened and read at the head 
the page presumption
 that is no fault your's luckily for
you said lucy let me try will you
shut and i will open
she opened at despondency
 no fault mine said lucy this
is not a good hit either but i must tell
you harry how luckily the opened
once for me when mamma held it it
opened at similies pray read what is
said about those who are always finding
similies begin here
 an aptness to jumble things together wherein
any likeness can be found is a fault in the understanding
near akin to this is letting the mind
upon the suggestion any new notion run immediately
after similies to make it the clearer to itself
 then interrupted lucy she goes onto
prove that this is wrong and he says
that these similelovers are apt to mistake
what is prettily said for sound knowledge
because they are content with their similies
which are never exact that is what long
ago harry you used to complain in my
similies do you remember 
i should like to read that said
harry
 no my dear harry i don't think you
would it is in such oldfashioned tedious
language it would tire you with its whereas a
and wherefores and parentheses and roundabout
sentences one thing however will
please you said lucy a grandissimo
panegyric that mamma showed me on mathematics
 and in the same page he says
something about the way in which young
scholars think and feel when first they begin
mathematics you can say whether he is
right or wrong there
she read the passage f to him and he
said that all about the young scholar was
true as far as he could judge now
lucy tell me the name the and
the author
 locke on the conduct the under
i have mentioned mathematics as a way to
settle in the mind a habit reasoning closely and
in train not that i think it necessary that all
men should be mathematicians but that having got
the way reasoning which that study necessarily
brings the mind to they might be able to transfer it
to other parts knowledge
t he that has to do with young scholars especially
in mathematics may perceive how their minds
open by degrees and how it is exercise alone that
opens them sometimes they will stick a long time
at a part a demonstration not for want will
and application but really for want perceiving the
connection two ideas that to men whose understanding
is more exercised is as visible as any thing
can be
standing the great locke said lucy
now harry is not it curious that we
should have thought and said to each other
some the same things which this grand
philosopher says in this but harry
it does not seem to surprise you do not
you think it extraordinary 
n o said harry it would have
been surprising indeed if we had thought
the same as the great locke about anything
else but who could know so well
as ourselves what passes in our own minds 
and there must be some likeness between
all people's minds pray does this 
tell us how to cure these faults
 mamma says replied lucy that
when i am old enough to study it attentively
 shall find a great deal excellent
advice in it but i have only read the one
page about my old disease wandering
thoughts
will you leave it on the sofa said
harry if it tires me i need not read it
 but harry said lucy before i
go i wish you would tell me why you
were so anxious about those riddles and
m 
puzzles why you made me recollect for
you step by step how i found some out
and how i failed in others 
because i thought it might teach me
to invent said harry
my dear harry to invent riddles and
puzzles do you mean 
no i do not care about them said
harry but i thought that if i discovered
what it was that puzzled me in the riddles
i could by the rule contraries prevent
myself from being puzzled in other things
well could you make out any general
rules said lucy
yes i think i have made out one said
harry you know that we found out
the figures on a slate by sticking to
araby the blest therefore in all cases
we should guide ourselves by some one
thing which is certain and thus go on from
the known to the unknown
yes and kill off the wrong guesses
that do not agree with that one fact said
lucy like the play the fourandtwenty
questions where you find out what
a person is thinking by asking is it
animal or vegetable or mineral and soon
 and each answer telling what it is not
brings you nearer to what it is till at last
you come quite to the right thing so far
so good for riddles and more good than i
expected and as for the story questions
it appears that the difficulty is less often
in the question than in ourselves in our
own minds
oxe fine sunshiny day lucy coming in
after working in the garden opened the
door the drawingroom where harry
was now daily stationed on his rolling
sofa and perceived that all the windowshutters
were shut
my dear harry what is the matter 
cried she
nothing is the matter but take care
take care cried harry do not knockdown
my little table
 i cannot see your little table said
lucy let me open a bit this shutter
 not for your life cried harry
 my father has just fixed it all for me
only walk straight to my sofa and shut
the door after you my father is going to
show me some sir isaac newton's famous
experiments on light and colours 
and my dear lucy your setting me in
pursuit the green and blue shadows is
the cause all this happiness to me my
father came in and found me at that 
he talked to me about it and found out
what i did understand and what i did not
and then he said that all my pains should
not be wasted he will give us halfanhour
a day as long as i am confined to the
sofa to show us these experiments and
perhaps he will tell us something about
the cause those colours in soap bubbles
about which we have been so curious
lucy now found that she had been mistaken
in supposing that harry could not
pursue any entertaining experiments while
out the reach laboratory and workshop
 and her father assured her that
no account is given these experiments because
they can be found in scientific dialogues and
various other publications
many most ingenious experiments have
been tried by the greatest philosophers
with the simplest apparatus he recollected
having seen a letter from sir humphrey
davy agreeing with priestley in opinion
that no man who waits to try experiments
till he has every convenience prepared
will ever make any discoveries in
chemistry
 but i hope said lucy that our
friend sir rupert digby's having such a
nice laboratory and workshop does not
prevent him from being a philosopher
not at all said her father that
does not follow what i tell you may bea
comfort to those who have not these advantages
and may prevent them from conceiving
that they are essential to success
a great deal may be done without them
but a man fortune cannot employ his
wealth better than by preparing such conveniences
for learning and science i
would say here the reverse what a peat
moralist has said upon another occasion 
dr johnson observes that it is often misery
to want what it is not happiness to possess
i should say the workshop and the laboratory
it is often happiness to have what
it is not misery to want
in repeating these experiments sir
isaac newton's his father told harry that
he had a farther object than his mere acquisition
 the facts he wished his son
early in life to observe with what care and
exactness this great philosopher had conducted
his experiments how cautious he
was to make himself certain by repeated
trials the causes the effects produced 
never venturing assertions nor trusting to
his own suppositions till they had been
verified by repeated trials never hazarding
general conclusions from a few facts and
what is perhaps the most difficult all
never taking any thing for granted
lucy having expressed some surprise
at her father's saying that this was the
most difficult he smiled and said per
have the day will not pass without your
giving me some little opportunity proving
it to you by your own practice
a little while afterwards lucy who was
making some pasteboard model for harry
went into a closet opening into the 
to look for a saucerfull paste
which she had left there but the mice had
eaten it and she was forced to wait while
a fresh supply was preparing during
this interval many were her invectives
against the whole race mice and many
her resolves to put the saucer this night
where none could reach it she stood
with an old newspaper ready spread on
the table for pasting suddenly a paragraph
in it caught her eye and she exclaimed
 now mice i defy you and all
your nibbling mamma look here i
have found an infallible receipt for preserving
paste or any thing against the
depredations mice the easiest way
in the world mamma only to surround
it with sprigs mint pray mamma read
this
i read it three months aoo mv dear
gait her mother and i tried it i surrounded
a plate paste with sprigs 
mint and next morning i found much 
the paste gone and the mint scattered
i repeated the experiment with different
things and always with equal want 
success
i
there is an then said lucy 
the infallible preservative
i do not know much about plants
said harry but i believe there are different
sorts mint they may not all have
the same properties perhaps the mint
you used mother might not be the kind
recommended in the receipt
his father observed that harry's was a
good suggestion that every circumstance
should be the same in repeating an experiment
otherwise it is not fairly tried and
the conclusion cannot be depended upon
lucy expressed a wish to try the experiment
for herself if her mamma would
not be offended but harry assured her
that nobody ever thinks being offended
about trying experiments
then i will run out to the garden
and gather plenty mint said lucy
away she ran and at night she fenced
her pasteplate round with a double row 
different kinds mint thus entrenched
she placed it on the same shelf in the
same closet and shut the door in the
morning her father and mother were at the
opening the closet to her agreeable
surprise she found that the paste had not
been touched there were no marks in it
 little feet or nibbling teeth and the
sprigs mint remained exactly in the
same order in which she had arranged
them
well mamma what do you think
now said lucy perhaps the receipt
writer may not be mistaken after all perhaps
mamma you did not join your fence
 mint as well as i did perhaps you had
not a double row or you left some little
loophole for the mouse to push his little
nose into what do you think mamma
and papa and what do you think
harry 
the door the closet being open he
could see all that passed
why do not you answer harry 
what are you looking at
i am looking at something which you
had better see before you decide said
harry
lucy followed the direction lies eyes
and saw just peeping out over the top 
a basket which stood in the corner the
closet the head a cat
oh pussy are you there all this
time cried lucy
at this instant the cat jumped out 
the basket and stretched herself as she
awakened upon inquiry it was found
that a servant who had heard lucy complain
 the loss her paste and who had
not known the mint experiment had
put the cat into the closet
then i suppose said lucy that it
was the cat frightened away the mice i
give up the mint
no said harry do not leave it to
suppose do not give it up till you have
fairly tried the experiment tonight make
sure the cat and leave the mint as
before
this was done and the result was that
the mint was found scattered and the paste
eaten
now i am convinced said lucy
 but how very extraordinary it is papa
that the mint should have succeeded for
the man in the newspaper and not for us
perhaps he never tried the experiment
said her father
oh papa cried lucy do you
think any body would publish that mint is
an infallible preservative against mice
without having tried it when i saw those
words in print papa how could i help
believing them 
her father laughed and told her that
she must not believe every thing she saw
in print a friend mine said he
once found a young man reading a romance
called amadis de gaul which is
full impossible adventures when he
asked the young man whether he believed
that it was all true he answered to be
sure sir it is in print 
 but father said harry i think
unless lucy had been very disagreeably
suspicious she could not have acted differently
how could she possibly tell that
the man in the newspaper was not to be
believed or that his experiments were inaccurate
 she has been used to live with
people who tell truth and who are accurate

 for that very reason my dear harry
 who have had experience a contrary
kind should put her on her guard against
that which at her age she could not possibly
imagine without being as you justly
say disagreeably suspicious
harry felt that this was just but still
he looked as if he had something else
sticking in his mind and which his understanding
could not swallow
 what is it harry
it is this father said harry if we
were to try all experiments over again
before we believed them we could never
get on something must be believed 
some things that are printed must be taken
for granted
 true harry said his father the
question therefore is zt we should believe
and whom we should trust you want rules
to guide you is this what you mean 
exactly said harry
here lucy was tired and went away to
make his pasteboard model leaving harry
to down to the bottom the well in
search truth
well harry said his father take for
instance sir isaac newton's experiments 
before we tried them over again you believed
in them did not you 
to be sure i did father
and why harry
because i knew said harry that
he had the character beings accurate
and that many other people had repeated
them
good and sufficient reasons they are
harry but when you do not know the
character the person who makes an
extraordinary assertion then how would
you judge 
after a few minutes reflection harry
said by considering whether the fact be
probable or improbable
 right said his father when anything
appears contrary to our experience
then it is necessary to examine the circumstances
carefully but at the same time
candidly some things in science that
appeared incredible at first sight have
been found perfectly true remember the
astonishment produced by the electrical
shock the powers steam and gas 
airballoons and steamboats suppose
you heard these things for the first time
you would probably have thought the accounts
ridiculous did you hear what
your mother was reading last night from
that new travels in mexico
 oh yes said harry you allude
to the mexican who was told by a man
from europe that by means a boiling
teakettle a thousand persons could
be safely moved a hundred miles a day
this was only exaggeration but there
was also an absurd story which the poor
mexicans were told that at birmingham
the clergymen are made castiron and
that they preach by steam now if i had
been a mexican i never could have believed
that if fifty thousand people had
told it to me because iron cannot feel or
speak or think
lucy returned to consult harry about
the pasteboard model she waited respectfully
while her father finished what
he was saying she heard these words 
then you feel harry that no assertions
could make you believe impossibilities
 and that in all cases which are contrary
to our experience it is necessary to
pause and doubt and examine i may
add that you will sometimes find it necessary
to doubt even the evidence your
own senses
 oh papa exclaimed lucy the
story you told us the celebrated instruct
and his wig is a good example
 that
 what can you mean my dear said
her mother
 your mother was not present when i
told harry and you that anecdote said
her father explain what you mean 
then mamma i will tell you there
was a famous mathematical instrumentmaker
 
 not there ives but there is interrupted
her father happily he is now living
and will i hope long live to be service
to science and an honour to his country
an englishman mamma continued
lucy and a very very famous instruct
 
say houghton that's enough whispered
harry
well then houghton said lucy
 having finished some great instrument
 which a magnetic needle formed a part
went to examine it for the last time and
found to his great surprise that the needle
pointed to different divisions at different
times having made this needle with
great care he could not believe that it did
not do its duty he thought there must be
some key or knife about him which attracted
it but no there was nothing 
the kind in his pockets he reasoned and
reasoned but in vain he could not discover
the cause he tried again and again the
same effect always took place and what
made it still more wonderful was that
when other people looked the needle was
quite steady this perplexing instrument
was the first tliino he thought when he
wakened next morning and he hurried
out bed in his nightcap to look at it
he found it quite steady yet after breakfast
when he looked again it was again
all wrong but now mamma he had a
distinct fact to guide him when wrong
he had had his wig on when right his
nightcap he immediately examined the
wig and found that it was fitted with small
sted springs to make it sit close to his
head the wig was thrown aside and the
instrument was perfect
mamma said lucy i think it was
scarcely worth while to spend so much
time and so much talking upon those little
cat and mint and paste experiments
 my dear said her mother if it be
worth while to try an experiment at all it
is worth while to try it accurately halftried
experiments are waste time indeed
they leave us no wiser than we
were before or what is worse they lead
vol n
us to reason upon wrong grounds and we
become only the more ignorant and the
more positive
you know mamma said lucy i
was willing to give up before i was quite
convinced
 yes but there is a great difference
between being willing to give up and
being convinced do you not feel that it
is more agreeable lucy more satisfactory
to be convinced
i do mamma if one gives up there
is always a sort feeling that one might
have been right if we had gone quite to
the bottom as harry says and after all
it is a very uncomfortable feeling not to be
certain whether we are right or wrong
 and j should be sorry my dear lucy
continued her mother that you were to
despise what you call little experiments
few people have the means trying
scientific ones but many little experiments
which are both instructive and amusing
are within everybody's reach your ingenuity
may be often more profitably employed
in finding out the causes common
appearances than in searching for those 
the most extraordinary wonders in nature
but mother said harry do you
really think that one can gain much scientific
knowledge by such accidental experiments

no harry said his mother certainly
not much scientific knowledge but
it has been said by a very good and sensible
man who made the human mind
his particular study that some exercises
are worth pursuing not so much for the
knowledge actually gained by them as for
the discipline they give the mind as
there are some crops which the farmer
sows not for the sake the profit they
afford but for their beneficial effect on the
sou
that is a beautiful allusion thought
lucy and the beauty the allusion added
much in her mind to the effect the
reasoning
 then mamma said she i wish you
would tell me some experiments to try 
this common sort
berkeley
n 
 what are you going to do my dear
with that piece new tape which you
have in your hand
 i am going to open it mamma and
to cut off some strings for my frock
 well before you begin consider which
is the best way to open it that you may
not tangle the piece as you did the last
which you took out my workbox
the best way to open it mamma are
there two ways 
yes said her mother some people
begin from the outside and some from the
inside
i have always taken the first i
found said lucy which was on the
outside but now i recollect mamma that
the other day you pulled the out from
the inside so i suppose since you did it
that must be the best way
 try my dear there is a little experiment
for you
oh mamma do you call that an experiment
 cried lucy yet to be sure
it is added she and a useful one too
if it settles the best way doing what we
want to do very often and though it is a
trifle it is better to do it well than ill and
better not to waste time by the necessity 
untangling it afterwards and better not
to waste temper too now i have wound
this piece upon a card without the least
difficulty and i am convinced that 
from the inside is best
there is another obvious advantage in
this method said her mother when
you have not time to wind the whole piece
upon a card you may take out as much or
as little you please and leave the rest unwound
because the outer coils protect and
keep in the rest
i shall follow the same plan with my
next ball twine said harry for that
is very good reasoning
 and there may be reasoning i see
even about such a thing as this said
lucy
at that moment lucy saw in her mother's
workbox an ambercoloured bonbonniere
 pellucid horn starred with gold
 oh i mamma i like this better than
the rubycoloured boxes harry do you
know how it is made mamma told me
that the horn is softened in boiling water
and then pressed into the proper shape by
a brass mould and those pretty little stars
harry she says are first placed in the
mould and squeezed in by the same operation
mamma may i help harry and
myself to some these manycoloured
sugarplums 
leave being granted lucy opened the
box but when the top was off she exclaimed
at the sight certain beautiful
green sugarplums do not touch them
harry stay one moment
she searched in her portfolio for a bit
 an old newspaper and said now
harry we may try a little experiment
listen she read as follows 
test for detecting the poison verdigris in
sugar plums sweetmeats pickles c
it is said that some confectioners give their
comfits and sweetmeats a green colour by means 
that dreadful poison verdigrise this as everybody
knows is produced by vinegar or any acid which
corrodes brass or copper the pickles which are
admired for their beautiful green are often made in
copper vessels and it is even said that cooks throw
halfpence into the saucepan to improve the green 
french beans
a gentleman whose children had been made unwell
by eating these green comfits wishes to make
known the following simple mode detecting the
presence copper drop on the comfits a little
liquid ammonia hartshorn if copper be present
they speedily acquire a blue colour
now mamma i am not going to take
it for granted that this man in the newspaper
is right this time i will try the
experiment before i say one word about
believing or not believing him if you
will give me some hartshorn mamma harry
and i will try it this minute
her mother directed her where she might
find the bottle having brought it and selected
from the box several the greenest
 the green sugarplums which she put on
a plate she applied to them a few drops
 hartshorn then adding more and more
to make herself and everybody else quite
sure the fact she cried they do not
change to blue mamma these comfits
then are quite safe hold your hand
harry and pouring a good supply into
it she added you may now eat them
without fear
 that i will said harry as he transferred
them to his mouth and without
the least fear because i never found that
they did me any harm and i am convinced
they have no copper in them nor
poison any kind but lucy my dear
if i had any doubt i must confess that
your experiment would not have quite
satisfied me
 not satisfied you harry why not
 because said harry you have not
proved to me the truth your test you
have not proved that hartshorn will turn
verdigrise or any thing which contains
copper to a blue colour that was the
very thing you were to prove
very true indeed said lucy
she now considered how she could try
whether her test was sufficient or not
 i must find a bit copper a halfpenny
mamma will do on it i will pour
some vinegar which will corrode the copper
 and after we have let it li sometime
if we see verdigrise on the halfpenny
as i hope we shall we will drop some
hartshorn over it and see whether it turns
blue then we shall be convinced whether
hartshorn is or is not a test for detecting
copper
harry said this would be a very fair
trial but his mother observed that the
poison copper was so dangerous that
she did not like to have lucy undertake
this experiment by herself if they could
wait till she was at leisure she would
assist them
she was at leisure or made leisure that
evening and without being reminded 
it recollected her promise she put two
or three halfpence into a saucer and
covered them with vinegar at the 
a few days she took the halfpence out
and left them some time exposed to the
air when they were most satisfactorily
covered with verdiirrise
quite green harry look at them
said lucy
 but do not touch them said her
mother a few grains verdigrise if
n 
swallowed might kill you now lucy
for your hartshorn drop a little on the
verdio'rise
she did so the green colour was instantly
turned to blue and harry was
satisfied
this evening lucy was preparing an
effervescence draught for her mother soda
and lemon juice the soda was in one
cup and she was squeezing the lemon
juice into the other at one unlucky squeeze
the lemon juice spirted on her mother's
ofown her own frock and her brother's
coat coat frock and gown were stained
in different avays her mothers gown was
 purple silk that was spotted yellow
but her mother instantly applying soda from
the cup in her hand the yellow spots
vanished and the purple reappeared lucy
tried the same remedy on the coat and on
the frock but it was not equally successful
and why 
her father now joined in the conversation
vv'hich this question produced and
lucy went to bed with her mind full 
experiments that it suggested
in days yore she had been a little
dabbler in vegetable dyes and her mother
had let her dabble on with saffron poppies
beetroot and weeds innumerable all
her dabbling was not quite in vain she
had learned some curious facts though no
general principles now recalled to the
subject she was delighted with the discovery
 a the next day in the
library at digby castle on the art 
dying wool silk and cotton from
this she hoped to learn how to take spots
out cotton silk or woollen cloth but
though the immediate object for which she
beoan to hunt through the was lost in
the chace she learned a great deal that was
more useful this told vegetable
animal and mineral dyes and those
substances which chemistry has taught the
dyer to use to brighten and to render
permanent his formerly fugitive colours
the beautiful system mordants opened
to lucy's view with her understanding
more enlarged than when she formerly
tried the dyer's trade she could
not be satisfied with mere receipts she
must know the reason for what she did
thus by degrees with her mother's assistance
and mrs market's the multitude
 separate facts classed themselves in her
mind and from these slight experiments
she gradually rose to general principles 
chemistry
we have learned more by our little
random experiments said lucy one day
than you expected have not we
yes said harry because though
they were little they were not random
experiments
fresh subjects seemed every hour to
arise and with entertaining variety but
no more shall be told enough is as good
as a feast in our opinion much better
harry have you finished the model 
the machine you were making with the
pasteboard and the large pins said
lucy what a long time you have been
about it
because i made a great many 

takes said he and was forced to alter
it several times but here it is at last
after a critical examination lucy pronounced
it to be tolerably neat considering
that it was a man's making she
thought the teeth the wheels might have
been cut rather cleaner and with fewer
jags left at the bottom each however
when the wheels were put in motion the
teeth took into each other well enough too

show the nature the contrivance it
was as harry told lucy an odometer or a
machine for measuring the lenoth road
over which a carriage passes this it was
to perform by registering the number 
turns made by the wheel the carriage
if the circumference a wheel is known
and the number turns it makes are
reckoned it becomes easy to calculate the
distance over which that wheel has rolled
but this machine fastened on the nave 
the wheel would as harry hoped save
the trouble calculation it being so
contrived as to show with two hands on a
dialplate in miles and furlongs the space
travelled over harry added that he had
been trying to invent some machine for
this purpose on the day he had been in
the dumps during their journey he could
not then hit upon any contrivance which
would answer though he had watched
the wheel so long but after thinking 
it again and again at different times and
in various ways he had at last made what
he hoped would succeed
when his father saw and had examined
the model harry pointed out exactly what
was his own and what was borrowed in
the invention very little it he said
was quite his own each part he had taken
from different machines which he had seen
at different times the first thought was
suggested by a common waywiser with
which long aso he had seen a man measuring
the road that machine you
know father measured by means a
wheel and made me first think that one
 the wheels a carriage mioht be made
to answer the same purpose the way 
connecting the turns the wheel with the
other parts my machine i took from
something i saw at the cotton mills and
an arithmetical machine that i saw at
diby castle helped me to the manner 
counting the turns and showing them in
miles and furlongs upon the dialplate
so you see father hardly any this was
my own except the putting together
his father highly approved his integrity
which he valued far above any ingenuity
 but i must observe to you
harry said he that all invention is in
fact only putting together in a new manner
or for a new purpose what we have
seen or known before
as to this little contrivance his father
said that he would have it executed for
him in the proper size and that he would
give him an opportunity putting it to
the test experiment by which means he
might see how far it would succeed and
what were its defects there is he
added a watchmaker in the village who
can i think divide this dialplate and cut
the teeth in these wheels for us and a
smith who can do the rest e work
lucy hoped that it would be ready by
the first day when harry was to go out in
the carriage and the surgeon said that
might be the following saturday
saturday came and the carriage at the
door but the demeter so far from being
finished was scarcely begun however
this was no disappointment to harry whatever
it might be to lucy on this first
day going out after his long confinement
so many pleasures such different
sorts absorbed his mind that as he acknowledged
after wards the demeter would
have been too much the freshness the
air the sight the country as they drove
along and all the old objects now new
to him he enjoyed with the keen relish 
restored health and liberty other and
more exquisitely pleasurable feelings filled
his heart gratitude to providence and
grateful affection to that dear father and
mother and sister whose sympathy and
tenderness and cheerfulness had in so
many ways made him happy he scarcely
spoke during the whole drive and recollecting
this just as they came home while
he pressed his mother's hand he said he was
afraid he had been very disagreeable i
believe mother i have hardly said a word
either to you or lucy
but his mother well knew the course
his feelings had taken and even lucy had
respected them in silence
it was if lucy counted rightly nine
days beyond the promised saturday before
harry's demeter was completed even
when the best workmen are employed
difficulties in making a new contrivance
will occur but in this remote place various
mistakes trying to the patience young
and old were committed at last however
it was completed and was fastened
on the carriage and the carriage was
driven on a road to a certain distance the
exact measure which had been previously
ascertained upon examination
it was found to answer as well as could be
expected on a first trial there were some
causes inaccuracy which harry perceived
and thought he could remedy it
was taken off and brought into the house 
and while harry and his father were considering
how it might be improved lucy
was talking in a low voice to her mother

whatever it was she was saying harry's
attention was so much distracted by it that
he could not comprehend some very simple
suggestion
is it possible that you do not understand
me harry said his father
no sir not yet said harry blushing
piteously then suddenly he looked
back at lucy and she stopped short
her last word was patois
 nonsense nonsense muttered harry
her father smiled now i perceive
said he what confused harry's understanding
so much
father i assure you cried harry
 i never thought such a thing for myself

but why should not lie papa said
lucy do not you remember the history
 the young gentleman eighteen who
had a patent for a new invention 
but i am not a young gentleman
 eighteen said harry i am only a
boy
notwithstanding harry's deepening
colour and tone discomfiture lucy now
went on because she fancied that her
father would agree with her and that it
was only harry's bashfulness which made
him oppose her so bluntly but her father
gravely and decidedly told her that
he thought harry was quite right and
that he was lad that he had good sense
enough not to have formed any such
scheme for himself lucy said no more
harry said his father a friend 
mine twelve years ago invented a measuring
machine on a new principle superior
to yours and to any i have seen
he has tried it for four years applied to
the wheel his gig and he has sent
an account it to dr brewsters new
series the edinburgh philosophical
journals
harry was very curious lo see it and
especially desirous to know the new and
better principle his father promised to
show him the description the contrivance
as soon as he could get the
journal
then yours is now no use harry 
no 
said lucy with a sigh i suppose you
will not do any thing more to it
but harry said that he should be
ashamed to leave it till he had made it
succeed at least till he had tried to mend
its faults
this resolution and his immediately
preparing to carry it into execution obtained
for him from his father a look 
affectionate approbation happy in this he
went off with his demeter to the watchmaker's
as soon as he had left the room
lucy returned to the subject the patent

papa i suppose that the reason why
you said it would be foolish to think a
patent for harry was because you knew
 this better machine
her father said that this was not his
reason
then papa perhaps there is something
about the expense a patent which
i do not understand but putting that
out the question would not you be
glad that he bad the honour and glory 
it
no i should not answered her father
 even supposing any honour and
glory were to be obtained by it
nor i lucy said her mother
though you look so credulous
lucy paused again upon this
then i see how it is said she yet
i should never have thought it you
would be afraid that it might make him
vain but i really do not think he is the
least inclined to be so
 well if he is not said her father
 why should we try to make him vain 
why put him in danger
i do not think papa said lucy that
there would be any canoer that sort
for harry
 my dear no human creature is altogether
exempt from vanity the most sensible
people are most aware the danger in
themselves and carefully guard against it
but independently the risk making
your brother conceited there are other
reasons which would prevent me as his
friend from desiring that he should be
early brought forward into public notice
if my son were really a genius if for
instance like bernini a famous italian
sculptor he had at twelve years old produced
a work to wonder at i should not
have done what his father did and should
not have set it up in the vatican to receive
the public admiration the observation
 the french wit is generally found to be
true c'est un fardeau tree pesant qu'un
nom trop tot fameux can you translate
that and apply it lucy
a name too early famous is a heavy
burthen answered lucy you mean
papa that people might afterwards expect
too much from such early fame but then
if harry could do more and more and go
beyond wiat is expected how glorious
that would be 
it would and in some few instances
that has been found to be the case for
example bernini exerted himself to support
his early fame and succeeded but in
general boywonders sink into insignificant
men
 without being a wonder however
said lucy it is surely a good thing that
a boy should be thought clever and i
have heard people say that harry is clever
for his age so have you mamma and you
like to hear him praised do not you
mamma
i acknowledge it said her mother
but this is no proof that it is good for
him
i know that you and papa must be
right said lucy but still i should like
to understand exactly all the harm it would
do him
it would probably give him the habit
 expecting praise for the slightest exertion
said her father and then he would
feel unhappy and unable to exert himself
without it this is one the first inconveniences
usually felt by those who have
been early overpraised he would afterwards
find other bad consequences more
importance he would no longer be satisfied
with the feeling doings what is useful
and good he would act not from the
right motive the desire to do his duty
but merely from the wish to obtain praise
then he would necessarily become dependent
upon the opinions and caprice 
others and might perhaps be led to do
what is foolish or wrong to obtain applause
even if his oood principles preserved
him from doing wrong and his
good sense from doing what was foolish
still he would lose that strength and vigour
 mind winch should enable him to labour
hard and long as all must do who wish
to attain eminence in any science or excellence
 any kind moral or intellectual
sir rupert digby as it may be remembered
told harry that a kite had
been lately employed for the useful purpose
 assisting in cases shipwreck
since they had lived on this coast
harry had heard instances ships
driven on the rocks in such situations that
in a storm boats could not get out to their
assistance and sometimes the vessels and
all on board had perished actually within
sight and almost within hail the people
on the shore who had no power to help
them in circumstances such as these a
kite that could carry out a line considerable
length and then drop in the
right place might effect a communication
with the shore and might be the means
 saving the lives the crew
the idea this kite had often during
harris illness flitted before his mind
he honored to know how it was contrived
he had brought home the volume containing
an account that ingenious invention
 but his father had advised him
to try if he could think any way 
effecting the purpose himself before he
read the description his father now told
him that captain danse's kite was not
made paper but light canvas
stretched upon two cross sticks and that
as those materials were to be found in
every vessel it might in case necessity
be made in a few minutes such a
kite it was said had carried out in a
strong breeze a rope half an inch in
circumference and twothirds a mile
in length
but continued his father you
vol o
know that the chief peculiarity these
kites is the ingenious apparatus for making
them suddenly descend and it is fair to
tell you that this is effected by a messenger
which travels up the string and detaches
it from the bellyband or bridle though
the string itself remains fast to the head
 the kite now harry an easy but
certain method doing this is what you
have to contrive however inferior your
method may be still it will have been a
good exercise for your invention and on
an interesting and useful subject within
your reach
to assist him a little further his father
added that the messenger was composed
 a hollow cylinder wood through
which the string passed and four cross
arms on which a small sail was stretched
all this being explained the question recurred
to harry at every spare moment 
and after devising sundry complicated
contrivances which were one after another
rejected he at last brought one his
projects to a simple form and immediately
set about its execution
 the strong wire which had been
given to him for his suspensionbridge he
had some left he bent a bit this wire
into a shape something like that a pair
 sugar tongs and about half an inch
from each the points these tongs he
again bent the wire inwards to nearly a
right angle these points however did
not meet but when the tongs were slightly
compressed they not only met but lapped
over each other he then cut a narrow hole
or slit in a thin bit wood so that when
his tongs were pushed into it they were
squeezed together and the points lapped
over the elasticity the wire prevented
the piece wood from slipping though
a slight blow would push it off and allow
the points to open so far being completed
harry carried his work to his father
and explained to him his plans
the bridle the kite said he is to
be hooked on the bent points these tongs 
and you see father they must hold it fast
till the messenger knocks off this piece 
wood the tongs will then open and the
bridle will slip off to the middle oro

handle part the tongs the main string
is to be tied but i shall also connect it
by a short loose piece to the head the
kite which would otherwise blow away
when the bridle slips off the hooks
this all sounded well but would the
force the messenger be sufficient to
drive the bit wood off the ends the
tongs this could be only proved by
experiment and harry was eager to
try it 
his father had the wooden cylinder for
the messenger turned for him on a small
scale proportioned to his kite it was
about six inches long and two inches
diameter its wooden arms about eight
inches in length the sail was made 
a square piece light linen the corners
 which being stretched out and tied to
the arms the messenger with its sail was
complete and ready for action
harry's kite was small but the same
proportions as captain danse's it was
made simply two laths tied together in the
middle crossform the cross lath being
twothirds the long one in length and
placed within onethird its length from
the top a square silk handkerchief
formed the covering he stretched it
over the laths tying one corner at top and
one at bottom over their ends then
stretching the two upper sides to the ends
 the cross lath and tying them in the
same way with twine he left the remaining
part the sides and the corners to
hang down as flaps or wings
the tail was made with coarse broad
tape and small bits wood instead 
wisps paper a coat button was tied
to the lower the kite a buttonhole
being made at one the tape so that
the tail could be buttoned on or taken oft
at pleasure this was a convenience
when it was to be carried out or put away
for entering into these trivial details
harry may be blamed by critics but perhaps
may be applauded by future kitemakers

anxiously was the wind watched every
morning now that the kite was ready for trial
at last a day came when there was happily
wind sufficient and out sallied harry
his father and his kite it was some time
before harry could get it up it fluttered
with uncertain motion rising a yard or
two then sinking it trailed on the grass
a fresh breeze raised it the whole length
 its tail which floating obliquely seemed
to struggle and writhe in the air by degrees
it rose higher flapping its silken
wings harry held in the string till he
felt that the wind had power over the kite
then he judiciously let out the line more
and more or less and less as he felt the
force slacken or the gusts increase now
running with the kite now stopping 
feeling as it were with its feelings humouring
its humours aiding its weakness
and glorying in its strength joyful at
last he saw it clear the trees rise rapidly
in the higher regions air and there
rest in steady poise
it is up cried harry
but can we bring it down said his
father
up goes the messenger the wind carrying
it swiftly along the line it appeared to
fly gladly on its errand
but will it can it do its business
for a few seconds this doubt kept
harry and harry's father breathless the
little kite reached and darted upon the
larger they struggled or seemed to
struggle for an instant like two birds in
unequal contest the little one gained
the victory
it's done it's done cried harry
the kite is falling 
and gently and safely both came down
together harry ran to the spot where
they fell to separate them and to see whether
they had done any mischief to each
other
all safe not the least damage
done cried harry
nothing could succeed better i give
you joy harry said his father
but there could be no complete joy
without lucy harry said he would run
home to tell her and his mother all about
it and to show them his good little messenger
he had kept the contrivance by
which the kite was to be brought down a
profound secret even from lucy having
determined to try it the first time with no
one by but his father and if it should
answer then he hoped to delight lucy
doubly with the pleasure the success
and the surprise
while harry had been flying his new
kite lucy's mind had been occupied with
far other thoughts she could not guess
what he and her father were about for
harry had taken out his kite by a back
way and then returning to the breakfastroom
had said in a half whisper can
you come out with me now father
 yes harry i am at your service
 so am i thought lucy yet he is
going without me
there had been for some days past
conferences and consultations between
harry and his father as lucy had remarked
to which she was not summoned 
her curiosity and some other uneasy feelings
were excited which she could hardly
suppress and yet did not like to express
she had been so much accustomed especially
 late to know and to be interested
in all that occupied harry that
she felt a sort disappointment when she
was excluded from these secret councils
her curiosity was now raised to an almost
insupportable height by the signal the
halfwhisper the abrupt exit and secret
expedition this morning they had
thrown open one the breakfast room
windows and jumped out her eyes followed
them as they walked briskly away
she then took up a to read but soon
laid it down and went to her drawingtable
 then she opened her workbox and
at last sat down near her mother after
an unusual silence lucy suddenly asked
her mother to guess what she had been
thinking all this time
it will be easier for you to tell me my
dear lucy said her mother smiling
i will mamma said lucy and
yet i do not know why but i am a little 
however i will then mamma you
must know that all this time have been
thinking or rather trying to hinder myself
from thinking something which i know
ois
not quite right but still the thoughts
come and i cannot help saying to myself
i wonder why harry did not wish me to
go with him i know this is all foolish
curiosity mamma you are going to tell
me so
i was going to remind you my dear
 the iron door said her mother
 ah yes to be sure but it was easy to
put that out my bead besides i did
not care much about the iron door but i
do care about harry and is it not natural
to be anxious about what concerns him
mamma
but if he wishes you not to know it 
i know what you are going to say
interrupted lucy that it is not right forme
to try to discover it therefore i really
want to put it out my head pray tell
me mamma how to do that
 turn your thoughts to some other subject
said her mother
indeed mamma i have been trying to
do so said lucy i took up a but
i read the same sentence over and over
again every instant i found myself looking
out the window at papa and harry
walking down the avenue the same
ideas would come back what are they
talking about what are they going to
do i cannot think anv things else
 if you cannot think do something
lucy said her mother suppose you
were to cut open the leaves that review
for me take this new motherofpearl
folding knife which your father gave me
this morning is it not pretty
 very pretty said lucy looking carelessly
at it
do you see the colours which change
continually as you move it said her
mother
they are beautiful said lucy but
i have often observed such colours in mother
 pearl
 but did you ever consider what produces
these colours said her mother
the reflection light from the polished
surface the mother pearl i
suppose mamma said lucy
then why do you not see the same
colours from the polished handle this
ivory knife said her mother placing the
two before her in the same light
lucy now began to examine the mother
 pearl more attentively she was struck
with the succession beautiful tints that
were developed by the least motion and
asked her mother if any thing was known
about the cause these changing colours
yes my dear said her mother it
has been lately discovered that the cause 
these colours depends upon a singular peculiarity
in the structure mother pearl
on its surface which to your eye and
touch appears so finely polished there are
innumerable scratches or indentures in
some places as many as two or three
thousand in the space an inch and
lying parallel to each other whether in
straight lines in waves or in circles
three or four thousand in an inch
mamma but i cannot see one all these
thousands i cannot feel even the slightest
roughness 
 but with a microscope said her mother
 and sometimes even with your
pocket magnifyingglass you would see
this exquisitely smooth surface full the
little lines or grooves that i have described
some people compare them to the delicate
texture the skin at the top an infant's
finger
lucy continuing to rub her finger over
the polished surface said but mamma
what can these scratches have to do with
the colours i have a knife with scratches
all over its handle look at it mamma 
you see it has no colours
 but the handle your knife lucy
is not mother pearl
 no mamma but if scratches are the
cause the colours in the one case why
not in the other
there is a great difference lucy the
indentures in mother pearl regularly
follow each other in all their windings 
the accidental scratches on the ivory cross
each other at random the rays light are
reflected by the edges the grooves and
the continual change colour arises from
their continual bending and turnings
then mamma said lucy by polishing
the mother pearl still more we
should get rid i suppose all these little
grooves and there would be no more
colours
polish as much and grind it down as
much as you will said her mother as
long as any the mother pearl remains
you will still find the grooves the same
structure is not only at the surface but
throughout the whole substance
 how extraordinary said lucy
 i have a still more extraordinary fact
to tell you my dear said her mother
oh what mamma
that the colours which you see on the
surface the mother pearl can be
communicated by pressure to sealingwax
and several other substances
 is it possible mamma cried lucy
 well since nothing should be taken for
granted will you be so very good as to
tell me how all that is proved
her mother told her that it was dr
brewster who first discovered the cause 
the colours seen in mother pearl and
that afterwards having stuck a piece it
on a cement made rosin and beeswax
he observed that the cement when separated
had actually acquired the property
 producing the same colours
 was not he excessively surprised 
said lucy
he was surprised and several gentlemen
who saw the experiment thought
that this unexpected phenomenon was
caused by a thin film the mother 
pearl which might have scaled off and
stuck to the cement a very simple experiment
however convinced them that this
conjecture was a mistake he made a
fresh impression the mother pearl on
black sealingwax and then plunged it
into an acid which does not affect wax
but which is known to destroy the substance
 which mother pearl is chiefly
composed f if there had been left on the
wax the slightest film mother pearl
it must have been dissolved but the acid
had no effect and the prismatic colours 
the impression remained undisturbed this
you see was a complete proof that there
nitric acid f carbonate lime
was no film mother pearl left on the
seal
 it does satisfactorily prove indeed
mamma said lucy that it was the
grooves as dr brewster thought which
caused the colours both in the mother 
pearl and in the impression on the wax
yes said her mother and he tried
similar experiments on other substances
such as tinfoil and lead and all showed
the prismatic colours in the same manner
and from the same cause so that the fact
and its cause are now quite ascertained 
and you find lucy that you may believe
them without taking any thing for
granted
lucy was quite satisfied and rejoiced at
understanding how the proof was complete
 this is another instance mamma
 the advantage trying to find out the
causes the common things we see everyday
how much dr brewster's accidental
observation led to 
and to more than you yet know said
her mother i will read to you part 
a letter your father received this morning
from him 
 there is also a very extraordinary fact respecting
the communicable colours in mother pearl
which deserves to be mentioned one set these
colours is produced by the right side the grooves
and another set by the left side and both them
are distinctly seen when the mother pearl is
polished but when the polish is removed by rough
grinding one the sets invariably disappears the
rough grinding therefore destroys the effect one
side the grooves without affecting the other
lucy's mother then told her that inconsequence
 dr brewster's discovery 
the cause the colours in mother pearl
another ingenious gentleman produced
the same appearance on glass and on different
metals by simply cutting grooved
lines on their surface the lines are so
fine she added that without a microscope
they are scarcely discernible and the glass
and the metal appear to retain their polish
yet they and the colours also may be communicated
by an impression like those from
the mother pearl to the wax
her mother then showed her a gilt button
mr barton
the lines on which had been struck by a
steel die and a bit glass on which they
had been cut by a diamond and from both
she saw the prismatic colours reflected as
beautifully as from mother pearl
 but harry exclaimed lucy all
this time i have forgotten about harry 
how very nicely you turned my thoughts
for me and quite put out my head
what i could not drive away mamma
this is all your doing i wish it had been
my own
the best part it is yours my dear
child said her mother the wish to do
right the asking for advice and assistance
was your own
i wish i could manage my thoughts
for myself in the same way said lucy
that curious discovery entertained me
so much that i forgot every thing else
mamma this is another advantage having
a taste for things this sort they
help us to turn our mind from what you
call foolish curiosity
j yes lucy they will often assist you
in managing your own thoughts and your
own mind said her mother this is
one the great benefits which women
derive from cultivating their understandings
and the best use they can make a
taste for literature and science
 mamma resumed lucy after some
pause i am very glad that you let me
go on with harry i am sure it has been
the cause great pleasure to me even
on the journey it was so pleasant to be
interested in the same think's but above
all during harry's illness it was the
greatest happiness to feel that he liked to
have me with him always reading and
talking to him and being interested in the
sorts things which he liked best mamma
i hope you do not think it has done meany
harm i hope you do not think that
i have grown careless about other things
 not in the least my dear said her
mother on the contrary i perceive that
you have become more attentive to all
which it is necessary for you to learn
 one other question mamma and i
shall be quite happy if you can answer it
as i wish i hope mamma that you do
not think that i have grown conceited
 no lucy said her mother i think
it will be with you as i have observed it
has been with others who are properly instructed
 that the more they know the less
danger there is their growing vain they
find out how infinitely much more there is
to be learned even from the most common
objects by which they are surrounded
yes mamma said lucy and i
begin to feel the truth what you have
often said to me that the more we learn
 what are called the works nature
and the wonderful inside our own
minds the better we must become and the
more pious i am not sure whether pious
is the right word or religious but you
know what i mean
 i do my dear said her mother and
as to the words it is little consequence
what words you use to express this sentiment
if you feel it as i hope and believe
you do sincerely and firmly
here he comes oh mamma here
is harry and his kite cried lucy running
to the window with a face radiant with
joy he came bearing his kite in triumph
high she threw up the sash and he sprang
in joy adding to his natural elasticity
lucy my dear lucy it does it
will do cried he i would not tell you
till i was sure it would succeed oh 
mother it does better than even my father
expected but come out lucy come out
and see it we will put it up again for
you for there is no joy without you and
my mother let me tell you about my
messenger
then eagerly he began to explain his kite
and his messenger but now when lucy
saw harry's kindness it struck her how
unjust she had been she was ashamed 
her past feelings and looked at her mother
with a consciousness and a change 
countenance which harry perceived he
became confused though in the middle 
a panegyric on his messenger and after
making some attempts to piece his story
with and so and so he stopped
and putting into her hand a knot in the
string which he had been endeavouring
to disentangle 
untie this for me will you my dear
said he his eye added what is the
matter 
nothing nothing worth telling you
i mean answered lucy it was only
that i was very very unjust and that i am
exceedingly ashamed
that you were a little foolish my
dear i will not deny said her mother 
but you need not be so exceedingly
ashamed because you did your best to
conquer your foolish feelings this is all
that the best us can do
lucy told her brother all that had passed
in her mind he regretted that she had
been vexed but was glad he said to
know how it was that he might avoid
doing the same thing again and she assured
him that it was all her own folly
and that she hoped never again to be so
weak
 there is your knot untied for you
brother she added returning the disentangled
string and now all's right
again
thank you all is right repeated
harry
and all will be rioht and will continue
so between friends who in this manner
speak openly to each other those little
feelings which perhaps they are at the
moment ashamed
this affair being cleared out lucyss
head there was some chance her understandings
harry's contrivance and she and
her mother went out and saw another
experiment the kite which succeeded
even better than the first the wind blew
stronger and with bolder wing as if better
knowing his business the messenger
darted up to the very heart the kite
and at one stroke accomplished its purpose
lucy rejoiced in the messenger's
happy performance his mission and
looked forward with still greater pleasure
to the idea seeing the kite carry out a
line from a boat to the shore she asked
her father when the experiment might be
tried and harry observed that as dame
peyton's sailorson had come home and
was permitted the use sir rupert digby's
boat they could have his assistance all
the circumstances a pretty little shipwreck
were quickly arranged and rehearsed
in lucy's imagination with the different
parts assigned which each were to act in
saving the stranded vessel harry's mind
in the mean time went to work at calculating
the proper size for a new kite which
would carry out a serviceable rope but
his mother put an to any further operations
by reminding harry that as he was
now perfectly recovered they were to leave
rupert cottage immediately and in these
circumstances the making a kite ten
feet long would not be very convenient
lucy thought that as it was only for
an experiment it might be as well tried
with the little kite all we want you
know harry is to be certain that you can
launch the kite from the boat we on shore
can make a signal when it is right over
our heads and then off you would send
your good little messenger and everybody
would see how well it did its business
a circumstance which they had left out
 their calculations but which was absolutely
essential to the experiment settled
the business during the few remaining
days their stay the wind never blew the
right way or strong enough to carry up a
kite the weathercock was every morning
watched in vain and frequently did harry
and lucy walk along the beach in hopes
 seeing a fine sea breeze curling the
water in one these walks a boat that
was rowing along the shore stopped abreast
 harry and lucy and a gentleman in
it whom harry knew asked him if he
thought his father would be so good as to
lend him his small telescope harry ran to
ask for it and his father with the telescope
in his hand walked with him to the seaside
and permitted him to accompany the
gentleman who promised to set him ashore
as he returned when he came back
harry described to lucy all he had seen 
and what was on the present occasion
more interesting to her repeated all he
had heard some people who were lately
vol p
saved from shipwreck by the use lifeboats

 a lifeboat lucy said harry is a
kind boat which cannot sink there
are several kinds that which was described
to me was lined with large copper
tubes empty and airtight so that in a
storm if it should fill with water the air
in the tubes would still buoy it up with
such a boat people can go out to a ship
in distress when none other could possibly
venture to sea
the gentleman pleased with harry's zealand
intelligence had talked to him much
on that subject and had related to him
several anecdotes a benevolent old
quaker who was in the habit going to
the sea coast every year for the recovery
 his health that part the shore was
very dangerous and hearing frequent
shipwrecks he had a lifeboat built which
cost him three hundred pounds and made
a present it to the inhabitants the
generous old quaker constantly rewarded
those who were most adventurous in going
out in it he was old infirm and very
ill when the gentleman last saw him evidently
dying but his mind was as much
alive and his feelings were as warm as if
he had been eighteen instead eighty
at that last interview the lifeboat was
talked then his enthusiasm broke out 
he seemed to forget his years and infirmities
 and conquering bodily pain he
started from his seat and took the gentleman
to his boathouse the boat was
mounted upon a carriage with wheels that
it might be ready for rolling down to the
shore they could only get up the side
by a ladder but the old man climbed up
without assistance jumped into the middle
 the boat showed every part and appeared
to feel a generous triumph m the
lives it had already saved and those which
he hoped it would yet save this was
the last time he ever saw him and the last
time this benevolent old man ever saw his
boat he died a few days afterwards 
all who knew him the whole country
flocked to his funeral and it was very
singular the gentleman added that while
p 
they were attending it the most violent
storm came on that had been known for
many years a vessel was cast upon the
rocks and the people returned just in time
to launch the lifeboat and to rescue three
persons who would otherwise have perished
the name this humane and truly
charitable man was backhouse a name
that better deserves to be remembered than
that many celebrated heroes warriors
are often famed only for the number 
lives they have destroyed but this excellent
quaker ought to be remembered for the
number lives he has saved
a day or two before they left rupert
cottage to return home harry went the
first long walk he had been allowed to
take since his release from confinement
it was to digby castle by the mountainpath
the day was bright and everything
was fresh and pleasant the path
in many places was quite as narrow as
those could desire who love the narrow
path danger there was full opportunity
also for scrambling up and down
the rocks so as to try to his heart's content
the newly recovered use his limbs
but at last the mountain path ended and
they came upon the road
here harry and lucy walked slowly
and soberly and recalled to each others
memories the first time their coming
this road the happy days they had spent
at digby castle and all sir rupert's and
lady digby s kindness to them then
they talked over what had passed at rupert
cottage in the olden times the canal
and the lock and the roof and even on the
misfortunes his broken bridges harry
could now moralize with composure he
had besides the consolation reflecting
that the failure in his bridges had led to
his learning mathematics
when once their recollections began
they went on or rather went backwards
through the whole time since they had
left home they travelled their journey
over again and tried how much they could
remember what they had seen or heard
their recollections were very different but
between them much was made out the
one supplying what the other forgot lucy
recalled a variety little entertaining
circumstances which had escaped harry's
memory and she benefited still more by
his clear remembrance the solid and
useful she was anxious to show harry
that the pains he had taken in explaining
some things to her had not been thrown
away and her father who now joined in
their conversation observed that she did
her brother credit
 then father said harry it is allowing
to those first experiments you took
so much pains in showing us when we
were quite children for instance you
made me then clearly understand the principle
 the barometer and that one thing
clear and fixed in my mind was i have
always felt the greatest help to me there
was something i was sure something
i could always go back to
lucy said she had felt the same and
that unless she had understood about the
barometer and the vacuum and the pressure
 the air harry could never have
got her on through the pumps to the
steamengine she lamented however not
remembering more the variety curious
things which she had seen on her journey
oh mamma she continued i wish
i had kept a journal then i should have
had them all safe
 your having them all safe on paper
said her mother would be useful because
you could refresh your memory from time
to time but it would be still better if you
had them all in your head so that you
could recollect them at any moment
certainly mamma but do you not
think that writing down things would fix
them better in my memory
 i am afraid not my dear said her
mother i have often found that i completely
forget those things which i had
written down
but why is that mamma said lucy
perhaps because we ease our conscience
 them said her mother and
never make any effort to recollect them
there is an english saying what is
written remains it may remain on the
paper but not the better on the memory
the italian proverb is probably more correct
 l'ho dimenticato perche i'ho script
i have forgotten it because i have written
it
perhaps said her father another
reason is that we are apt to write mechanically
that is without thought and
what we do without thought we seldom
remember
but papa said lucy if i had kept
a journal i must have tried to recollect
the things at the time i was to write their
description in my journal though after
all i dare say that i should have trusted
to harry's memory he used to ask me
every evening if i remembered such and
such a machine that we had seen in the
day and he reminded me so well all
the parts that i scarcely endeavoured to
recollect them for myself
you see said her mother that you
depended on your brother and did not
exert your own memory though yours
is perhaps naturally better his has served
him more usefully
yes mamma said lucy but i
really believe that talking what we have
seen or heard makes one remember better
than even writing down the pleasure
 talking is a great help added she
laughing
 i think there is also a pleasure in
listening said harry
 certainly said lucy when one is
listening to what is interesting or new but
otherwise i hear as it were without listening
and then the words go in at one ear
and out the other i have only the
sound left
 yes lucy said her father you hear
mechanically without attending in the same
way as you would copy with a machine
your mind is then merely passive whereas
the pleasure any successful exertion as
well as the labour thinking have the
effect fixing ideas or impressions in our
minds pain or pleasure any kind
joined or associated with our thoughts
secure them in the memory and assist us
in recollecting them if you reflect on
p 
your own mind i think you will find that
to be the case
harry drew closer to his father this
was a subject peculiarly interesting to him
as he had lately been so intent upon finding
out what he called the workings 
his own mind his father stopped short
and good humoured remarked that
though lucy knew much less than harry
did yet she had told them much more 
what she had seen and heard
harry was silent and lucy feeling for
his condition filled up the interval with
talking to give him time and she finished
with an allusion which relieved his embarrassment
and made even his gravity
smile papa harry and i are like two
bottles one full and the other with very
little in it shake the full bottle and you
hear no sound but shake the half empty
one and you hear it rattle finely
by this time they were within sight 
the castle and harry heartily glad to be
excused from further explanation came
forward to open the gates for his mother
their good friends the housekeeper had
from her turret window descried their approach
even from the farthest the
avenue and she had prepared for them a
luncheon such as might have tempted the
most determined antipuncheons to break
his resolution these were the first strawberries
 the season from the forcinghouse
which the gardener was proud to
set before his master's friends since ashe
said his master and mistress were not
at home this was the best could become
 them all were eager to offer harry
the best what the castle could afford
for the history his accident was well
known the father the child he had
saved waited upon them and lingered and
looked often and long before he could feel
convinced that master harry was quite
himself again as stout in his limbs and
as good as ever his last excuse for
coming into the room was to bring a message
from the steward about a box which
had come from sir rupert with some lamps
which he could not rightly understand
and begged to show them to harry's father
they were found to be miners safetylamps
which sir rupert before he left
england had bespoken and had given
orders should be sent to an estate his at
some distance where there were coal mines
by some mistake this box had been sent to
digby castle it was a mistake by which
harry profited once he had had a glimpse
 one these lamps in the mine which
he had seen on the journey but his father
had not then explained it to him the
ready footman carried one into the library
where harry might examine it at his
leisure his mother found for him the
description and explanation the lamp in
the philosophical transactions which he
immediately read with the lamp before
him he was struck with the simplicity
 this admirable invention by which the
lives thousands have been saved from
the destructive explosions the liredamp
in mines but what particularly delighted
harry was the account given by the inventor
 the way in which he was led
step by step to the discovery on which
the excellence this really wonderful
lamp depends first he discovered that
flame will not pass through long tubes 
less than a certain diameter then that tubes
 metal conduct away heat better than
those glass which determined him to use
metal then experiment proved to him
that it was the diameter and not the length
 the tubes that was essential to his purpose
in consequence which he shortened
and shortened them till to his great satisfaction
he found that tubes might be dispensed
with entirely and that a plate 
metal perforated with small holes or even
wire gauze with interstices the same
diameter as the tubes would answer equally
well
as harry's father observed to him there
cannot be a finer example the rise progress
and perfecting a useful philosophical
invention in the first place no part
 it was owing to accident to any lucky
bit or even to any casual observation but
all was the consequence a settled good
purpose working in the mind a man 
science genius knowledge and humane
views he had heard the destruction
caused by firedamps and determined to
try what could be done to avoid or prevent
the danger his first step was to go down
into the mines and examine into the nature
 these noxious vapours his previous
knowledge chemistry was here essential
to his success and each step was forwarded
by his philosophic habits in trying experiments
 by his observing and reasoning
on all appearances before him and employing
alternately theory and experiment
that is to say first forming a conjecture
how the thing might be done and then
impartially trying whether his suppositions
were right or wrong
how much the public his father
added and how much young people 
rising genius are obliged to inventors who
both can and will thus lay open their
minds many ingenious persons seem not
to have had the power describing their
own inventions for instance vaucanson
a celebrated french mechanic who never
could describe his own machines others
like hooke whose life harry you read
lately have been so suspicious their
rivals that during their whole lives they
would not open above half their minds
and at their death left their contrivances
locked up in enigmatical language they
seem to have taken pains to obliterate all
traces the road their minds took lest
rivals should follow in their tracks but
my dear son observe that really great men
are superior to such mean jealousy you
feel how much sir humphrey davy has in
this instance by his openness increased
our admiration and gratitude
when they were setting out on their walk
back to rupert cottage harry said to
lucy 
let me go on before with my father
i want to talk to him alone
very well said lucy this time j
shall have no foolish curiosity
you need not said harry it is no
secret if you please i will tell you my
reason for wishing that you should not
be by
 no pray do not harry i assure you
 am not curious now so go on with papa
my mother is going to make a sketch 
digby castle from this place i have
paper and pencil and i will also try what
i can do will you wait for us at the
suspension bridge
thank you my dear good lucy said
harry taking her pencil from her hand
and cutting it to a fine point but you
must let me tell you my reason it is only
that what i want to say to papa is all about
myself and you know that when one has
to talk oneself and one's own little
feelings and schemes one can speak much
more freely when nobody else is present
the fact was that the sight the
miners lamp and the account that discovery
and the admiration which his
father had expressed at the idea that thousands
 lives would be saved by this one
invention had altogether worked up harry's
enthusiasm thoughts which had been
lying quietly at the bottom his mind
were now set in motion and thrown to the
surface his father knew him better than
anybody else his father was therefore the
confidant he preferred to all others happy
the son who in like circumstances feels
that his father is his best friend
 father said harry a few words
you said to me long ago made a great
impression on me i have often thought
 them since and something the
same sort which sir rupert said to me at
the time the balloon when we were
talking great inventions do you recollect
father v
his father recollected and spared him
the difficulty repeating the words sir
rupert had prophesied that if harry's application
and diligence continued he would
hereafter distinguish himself as a man 
science
then must tell you father continued
harry that i have long had deep
down in my mind deeper i believe than
anybody sees but you a great ambition to
make some time or other in my life some
great discovery or invention i have been
long thinking this and considering how
other people have succeeded when i
was confined to the sofa i thought it
more and more and particularly how i
could manage my own mind so as to make
it do what i want in reading the accounts
 the childhood great or scientific
men i have tried to find out what
they did and said that i might compare
my thoughts and ways going on with
theirs but enough is never told these
things on the other hand father when
one thinks the millions people that
exist and the few that distinguish themselves
it does appear very presumptuous
to hope that i should succeed how many
people when young must have had the
same feelings that i have now and the
same ambition yet they have failed but
why have they failed this is what i want
to ask you father another thing puzzles
me continued harry who could now
speak fluently his thoughts flowing on
and forcing themselves into words during
our journey when we were at the glasshouse
and when we read all about the
discovery printing and since that time
when sir rupert digby was giving us the
history electricity and the invention
 balloons and more lately still in those
books which i have been reading during
my illness i have continually observed
with surprise how long it was before even
the most ingenious men hit upon those
discoveries and inventions which now
that we know them appear to us so easy
and simple and i have said to myself if
these things were so difficult to them how
little chance have i yet father i think
people have a better chance now than informer
times more discoveries have been
made in our days than in the time the
ancients
 yes said his father because knowledge
is more generally diffused more
people try experiments and all are convinced
that this is the best method 
arriving at truth or making discoveries
still father i want to find out why
now that this is known so few among the
numbers who try succeed i wish i could
find this out that i might learn how to
secure the best means for myself
some people said his father are
inaccurate in their mode trying experiments
or rash in drawing their conclusions
 or they may have some prejudice
or favourite theory which blinds the truth
from them and prevents their seeing what
is before their eyes their failure arises
from taking a wrong view the object ora
wrong road to it
harry asked his father if he knew 
any that gives directions or advice
how to get forward in science or that
points out the best ways trying experiments
 i looked over much that 
 locke's said harry to try if i could
find any thing this sort but i could not
is there any such helping 
his father mentioned bacon on the
advancement learning hooke on
the means improving natural philosophy
 mayfair's history the progress
 physical science and some others
then as soon as we get home and are
settled said harry i will begin and
read some these would you advise
it father
 i have such confidence in your good
sense and resolution harry said his father
 that i feel no apprehension discouraging
your laudable ambition by answering
 no i would not advise you to
read any those books yet they would
perhaps prevent you from working out your
own observations and from reflecting impartially
as you have begun to do upon
your own mind i advise you then my
dear son to persevere steadily and regularly
in your present course never let anyone
day pass without advancing some step
without acquiring some fresh knowledge
continue with your sister your happy
practice mutual instruction exercise
your faculties your memory your reasoning
power your invention no matter on
what so that you exercise them they
will strengthen and we can afterwards
turn them and your habits application
to whatever may be necessary for your progress
in science and virtue and for your
happiness
my happiness cried harry the
greatest possible happiness i can conceive
in this world next to doing my duty
would be to make some grand invention
some noble discovery
to this he recurred this was the chorus
 all his thoughts it was said with such
enthusiasm as strongly to excite the sympathy
 his father who paused for some
moments before he again spoke
i must not be misled by my hopes or
by yours harry said he lest i should
prepare for you bitter disappointment in
future whether you may ever distinguish
yourself or not will depend probably on
circumstances over which neither you nor
i may have any control but whether
you do or do not succeed in the object 
your ambition you may certainly my dear
boy by cultivating your taste for science
secure a large portion happiness you
may become such a man as your friend sir
rupert digby you see how useful how
respectable how happy he is you see
that it is his taste for science his indefatigable
pursuit knowledge and his constant
exertions to be use to others which
constitute his happiness a species happiness
that is independent all celebrity
and all human applause you have
seen on what it depends 
friendship books
ease and alternate labour useful knowledge
progressive virtue and approving heaven
harry stopped and looked back for
lucy sorry that she had not heard these
lines she and his mother joined them
soon afterwards just in time to hear the
words with which his father concluded the
conversation
i consider you my dear son as no
longer a child and i securely trust to your
own efforts for the continuance your own
education a celebrated person has observed
that every man has two educations
one which is given to him by his parents
or tutors while he is a child the other
which he gives to himself when he becomes
a man this latter is the greatest
consequence the two and this with
every wise and good man should go on to
the latest period his life
here ends all the history harry
and lucy that is to be published
the reader may perhaps feel relieved by
these words from certain fears which may
have arisen in his mind that the said history
might extend to a thousand and one

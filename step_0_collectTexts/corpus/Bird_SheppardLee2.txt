 chapter iv

the miser's children


it will scarcely be supposed that with the passion of covetousness
gnawing at my heart i had space or convenience for any other feeling
but abram skinner had loved his children and to this passion i was
introduced as well as to the other at first i was surprised that i
should bestow the least regard upon them seeing that they were no
children of mine i endeavoured to shake off the feeling of attachment
as an absurdity but could not in spite of myself i found my spirit
yearning towards them and by-and-by having lost my identity entirely
i could scarcely even when i made the effort recall the consciousness
that i was not their parent in reality

indeed the transformation that had now occurred to my spirit was more
thorough than it had been in either previous instance i could scarce
convince myself i had not been born the being i represented my past
existence began to appear to my reflections only as some idle dream
that the fever of sickness had brought upon my mind and i forgot that
i was or had been sheppard lee

yes reader i was now abram skinner in all respects and i loved his
children as he had done before me in entering his body i became as
i have mentioned repeatedly before the subject of every peculiarity of
being that marked the original possessor without which indeed the
great experiment my destiny permitted me to make of the comparative
good and evil of different spheres of existence must have been made
in vain what my prototype hated i was enforced to hate what he loved
i found myself compelled in like manner to love while moving in the
bodies of john h higginson and i d dawkins i do not remember that
i experienced any affection for anybody which happened doubtless
because these individuals confined their affections to their own
persons abram skinner on the contrary loved his children which i
suppose was owing to their being the worst children that ever tormented
a parent he loved them and so did i he pondered with bitterness over
the ingratitude of their tempers and the profligacy of their lives
and i--despite all my attempts to the contrary--did the same i forgot
at last that i was not their parent and my feelings showed me that i
was and i found in the anguish that attacked my spirit when i thought
of them one of the modes in which heaven visits with retribution the
worshipper of the false god of the country when the votary of mammon
has propitiated his deity let him count the children he has sacrificed
upon his altar avarice as well as wrath sows the storm only to reap
the whirlwind

i am growing serious upon this subject but i cannot help it this
portion of my history dwells on my remembrance with gloom it keeps me
moralizing over the career of my neighbours when i see or hear of a
man who is bending all his energies to the acquisition of a fortune
and is already the master of his thousands i ask what has become of
his sons or what will become of them

with the affection for the children of abram skinner that took
possession of my mind came also a persuasion exceedingly painful
that they were a triad of graceless ungrateful reprobates and what
was worse there was something whispered within me that much if not
all the evil of their lives and natures was owing to the neglect in
which their parent while engrossed with the high thought of heaping up
money had allowed them to grow up the consequences of this neglect i
felt as if it had been my own act

the first pang was inflicted by the girl alicia and i felt it
keenly--not indeed that i had any particular parental affection
for her as doubtless i should have had had she not run away so
opportunely on the contrary a vague recollection of my amour and
the inconstancy of her temper caused my feelings in relation to her
to assume a very peculiar hue so that i regarded her with sentiments
due as much to the jilted lover as the injured father but what
chiefly afflicted me was the hint she had given in the postscript of
her letter warning me of the fatal call to be made upon me within
two months space to render up an account of my guardianship and
surrender into the hands of that detestable sammy wilkins my late
cousin the rich legacy of her aunt sally which being chiefly in real
estate i--or rather my prototype before me--had without anticipating
such a catastrophe managed so prudently that it was now worth more
than double its original value the thought filled me with such rage
and phrensy that had she been twice my daughter i should have
rewarded her with execrations

my quondam uncle mr samuel wilkins of wilkinsbury hall who it
seems received the girl as well as he afterward did his daughter's
husband thought fit to pay me a visit a week after my transformation
to confer with me on the subject and receiving no satisfaction for i
was in a rage and refused to see him sent me divers notes proposing a
reconciliation betwixt myself and his daughter-in-law and these being
cast into the fire i received in course of time a letter from his
lawyer or his son sammy's in which i was politely asked what were my
intentions in relation to settlement and so forth and so forth

i received letters from the damsel also but they went into the fire
like the others and my rage waxing higher and higher as the time of
settlement drew nigh i set myself to work to frame such a guardian's
account as would materially lessen the amount of my losses

but all was in vain the married alicia was at last of age and all i
could do was to fling the matter into the lawyers hands so as to keep
the money the dear money in my own as long as possible

my reader may think this was not a very handsome or reputable way of
treating a daughter but he must recollect i was in abram skinner's
body the matter was still in suit when i departed from my borrowed
flesh but i have no doubt the execrable samuel wilkins jr got
possession of the legacy as well as ten times as much to the back of
it

but this great as was the anguish the evil inflicted was nothing
to the pangs i suffered on account of the two boys ralph and abbot
on these i showered--not openly indeed for i was crabbed enough of
temper but in my secret heart--all the affection such a parent could
feel but i showered it in vain the seeds of evil example and neglect
had taken root the prospect of wealth had long since turned brains
untempered by education and moral culture and the parsimony of their
parent only drove them into profligacy of a more demoralizing species
they were ruined in morals in prospects and in reputation and while
yet upon the threshold of manhood they presented upon their brows the
stamp of degradation and the warrant of untimely graves

the younger abbot had evidently been a favourite from his childhood
up his temper being fierce and imperious yet with an occasional dash
of amiableness that showed what his disposition might have been if
regulated by a careful and conscientious parent he possessed a fine
figure of which he was vain and being of a gay and convivial turn
there was the stronger propensity to dissipation and greater fear of
the consequences these were now lamentable enough he was already
beyond redemption--a sot and almost a madman

the elder brother was a young man to all appearance of a saturnine
mood and staid habits but this was in appearance only he was the
associate of the junior in all his scenes of frolic and an actor in
others of which perhaps abbot never dreamed a strong head and a
spirit of craft enabled him to conceal the effect of excesses which
sent his brother home reeling and raging with drunkenness i knew his
habits well and i knew that besides being in a fairer way to the
grave--if not to the gallows--he was a hypocrite of the worst order
his gravity being put on to cover a temper both fiery and malicious
and his apparent correctness of habits being the mere cover to the most
scandalous irregularities he was a creature all of duplicity and wo
to the father who made him such

the scene in the dying chamber of their father they never forgot
though perhaps i might have done so it drove the younger from all
attempts at pretended regard or concealment of his profligacy and
was i believe the cause of his final ruin he absconded out of mere
shame for a week and then returned to put a bold or indifferent
face upon the matter and to show himself as regardless of respect as
restraint

the other after concealing himself in like manner for a few days came
to me apparently in great contrition of spirit and almost persuaded
me that his brutal conduct on that eventful evening arose rather from
grief than joy he had been so much affected by my death he assured
me as scarce to know what he did when swallowing a glass of brandy
his brother gave him that he declared with half a dozen tears had
set him crazy and he knew not what he had done--only he recollected
something about going to the chamber where he believed he had
behaved very badly for which he begged my forgiveness and hoped i
would not think his conduct was owing to any want of affection

i had proof enough that the villain was telling me falsehoods and i
knew that if either should in a moment of soberness and compunction
breathe a single sigh over my death-bed he was not the one in
truth they were both bad both perhaps irreclaimable but while
the conduct of abbot gave me most pain that of ralph filled me with
constant terror nothing but the daily excitement of speculation and
gain could have made tolerable an existence cursed by incessant griefs
and forebodings it may be supposed that i frequently took the young
men to task for their excesses i might as well have scolded the winds
for blowing or the waters for running it is true that ralph heard me
commonly with great patience and sometimes with apparent contrition
but at times a scowl came over his dark features that frightened me
into silence and once giving way to his fierce temper he told me
that if there was any thing amiss or disreputable in his conduct it
was the consequence of mine that i instead of granting him the means
for reasonable indulgence and elevating him to the station among
honourable and worthy men to which my wealth gave him a claim and
which he had a right to expect of me had kept him in a state of need
and vassalage intolerable to any one of his age and spirit

as for abbot this kind of recrimination was a daily thing with him
i scarce ever saw him except when inflamed with drink and on such
occasions he was wont to demand money which being denied he would
give way to passion and load me with reproaches still more bitter of
spirit and violent of expression than those uttered by ralph nay upon
my charging him with being an abandoned profligate and ruined man he
admitted the fact and swore that i was the author of his destruction
that my niggardliness had deprived him of the opportunities that gave
other young men professions and independence that i had brought him up
in idleness and ignorance and by still refusing him his rights was
consigning him to infamy and an early grave

such controversies between us were common and perhaps expedited the
fate that was in store for him as well as his brother i thought in my
folly to punish and at the same time check his excesses by denying
him all supplies of money and by refusing to pay a single debt he
contracted a deep gloom suddenly invested him he ceased to return
home intoxicated but stalked into and out of the house like a spectre
without bestowing any notice upon me the change frighted me and in
alarm lest the difficulties under which he might be placed were driving
him to desperation i followed him to his chamber with almost the
resolution to relieve his wants let them be what they might

the absence of intoxication for several days in succession had induced
me to hope he had broken through the accursed bondage of drink were it
only from rage and shame but i was fatally mistaken as i entered the
apartment i saw him place upon the table a large case-bottle of brandy
which he had just taken from a buffet he looked over his shoulder as
i stepped in and without regarding me proceeded to pour a large
draught into a tumbler his hand was tremulous and indeed shook so
much that the liquor was spilt in the operation

i was shocked at the sight and struck dumb seeing which he laughed
with what seemed to me as much triumph as derision and said you see
this is the way we go it your health father come help yourself
don't stand on ceremony

i abbot said i as he swallowed the vile potion have you
neither respect nor shame i never drank such poison in my life

the more is the pity muttered the young man but rather as if
speaking to himself than me i should have had the sooner and freer
swing of it

you mean if it had killed me as it is killing you said i pierced
by the heartlessness of his expression oh abbot a judgment will
come upon you yet

he stared me in the face but without making a reply then pushing a
chair towards me he sat down himself and deliberately filled his
glass a second time

abbot for heaven's sake said i wringing my very hands in despair
what will tempt you to quit this horrid practice

nothing said he you have asked the question a month too late
look he continued pointing my attention again to his hand shaking
as it held the bottle as if under the palsy of age do you know what
that means

what does it mean said i so confounded by the sight and his stolid
merriment for he laughed again while exposing the fruit of his
degrading habit that i scarce knew what i said

it means said he that death is coming to make equitable division
betwixt ralph and alicia--unless the devil after all should carry
them off before me in which case you can build an hospital with your
money

he swallowed the draught and then leaning on the table buried his
face between his hands

the sarcasm was not lost upon me and the idea that he was about to
become the victim of a passion from which he might be wrested by a
sacrifice on my part greatly excited my feelings

i will do any thing said i what shall i do to save you oh
abbot can you not refrain from this dreadful indulgence what shall i
do

he leaped upon his feet and eyed me with a look full of wildness

pay my debts he cried pay my debts and make me independent and
i--i'll try

and what said i trembling with fear what sum will pay your debts

twenty thousand--perhaps said he

twenty thousand what twenty thousand dollars cried i lost in
confusion

you won't then said the reprobate

not a cent cried i in a fury how came you to owe such a sum do
you think i will believe you how could you incur such a debt what
have you been doing

gambling drinking and so forth and so forth twenty times over

he snatched up the bottle and locking it in the buffet deposited the
key in his pocket then seizing upon his hat and stepping to where i
stood transfixed with grief and indignation he said--you won't
take the bargain then

not a dollar not a dime not a cent said i

not even to save my life father

not a dollar not a dime not a cent i reiterated incapable of
saying another word

farewell then said he and good luck to you it is a declaration of
war and now i'll keep no terms with you

then giving me a look that froze my blood it was so furiously hostile
and vindictive he struck his hands together rushed from the house
and i saw him no more for nearly a fortnight i saw him no more as i
said but coming home the following evening from the club i found my
strong-box broken open and rifled of the money that i left in it

the sum was indeed but small but the robbery had been perpetrated by
my own son and the reader if he be a father will judge what effect
this discovery produced upon my mind in good truth i felt now that
i was the most wretched of human beings and was reduced nearly to
distraction

but this blow was but a buffet with the hand compared with the
thunder-bolt that fate was preparing to launch against my bosom i
cursed my miserable lot yet it wanted one more stroke of misfortune to
sever the chain with which avarice still bound me to my condition




 chapter v


the fate of the firstborn


on the eleventh day after the flight of abbot whom all my inquiries
failed to discover as i was walking towards the exchange torn by
my domestic woes and by a threatened convulsion in stocks which
concerned me very nearly i met one of my companions of the club who
noting my disturbed countenance drew me aside and told me he was
sorry i had got my foot into the fire but the club had last night
taken the matter into consideration and agreed to stand by me if it
were possible

all this was heathen greek to me and i told my friend i was in no
trouble i knew of and wanted no countenance from anybody

i am very glad to hear it said he but what are you doing with so
much paper in the market that's no good sign you'll allow

i started aghast and he proceeded to inform me that he had himself
seen two of my notes for considerable amounts and had heard of others
and finally that he had just parted with the president an intimate
friend of his of a bank not a furlong off who had asked divers
questions as to the state of my affairs and admitted there was paper
of mine at that moment in the bank

i was seized with consternation assured him all such notes must be
forgeries and running with him to the bank demanded to see any paper
they had with my name to it they produced two different notes for
large amounts which i instantly declared to be counterfeit and then
ran in search of others

the hubbub created by this declaration was great but the tumult in my
mind was greater a horrid suspicion as to the author of the forgeries
entered my soul and i became so deadly sick as to be unable to
prosecute the inquisition further my friend deposited me in a coach
and i was carried to my home but in a condition more dead than alive
my suspicions were in a few hours dreadfully confirmed by my friend
who returned with the intelligence which he had acquired the forger
was discovered and arrested--it was the elder brother ralph skinner

words cannot paint the agony with which i flew to the magistrate's
office and beheld the unfortunate youth in the hands of justice
but what was my horror to discover the extent and multiplicity of
his frauds the number of forgeries he had committed in his parent's
name was indeed enormous and it seems he had committed them with the
intention of flying for many of his guilty gains were found secreted
on his person but even after so much had been recovered the residue
to be refunded was appalling the thought of making restitution drove
me almost to a phrensy while the idea of seeing him carried to jail
to meet the doom of a felon was equally distracting my misery was
read on my face and some one present perhaps with a motive of
humanity cried out

why persecute the young man here is his father who acknowledges the
notes to be genuine

ah said the magistrate does he so why then we have had much
foolish trouble for nothing

i looked at the amount of the forgeries a list of which some one put
into my hands

it is false i cried i will not pay a cent

i cast my eyes upon ralph he reached over a table behind which he
stood and waved his hand to and fro as if had he been nigh enough
he would have buffeted me on the face his look was that of a demon
and he spat the foam from his lips as if to testify the extremity of
hatred

let him go i cried i will pay it all

you can undoubtedly do so if you will said the magistrate who had
marked the malice that beamed from the visage of the young man but do
not dream that that will discharge the prisoner from arrest or from
the necessity of answering the felony of which he now stands accused
before a court and jury the extent of the forgeries and the temper
displayed by the accused are such that he must and shall abide the
fruits of his delinquency he stands committed--officer remove him

i heard no more my brain spun round and round and i was again carried
insensible to my miserable dwelling




 chapter vi


the catastrophe of a tragedy often performed on the great stage of life


it may be supposed that the misery now weighing me to the earth was
as much as could be imposed upon me but i was destined to find and
that before the night was over that misery is only comparative and
that there is no affliction so positively great that greater may not
be experienced in the dead of the night when my woes had at last
been drowned in slumber i was roused by feeling a hand pressing upon
my bosom and starting up i saw for there was a taper burning on a
table hard by a man standing over me holding a pillow in his hand
which the moment i caught sight of him he thrust into my face and
there endeavoured to hold it as if to suffocate me

the horror of death endowed me with a strength not my own and the
ruffian held the pillow with a feeble and trembling arm i dashed it
aside leaped up in the bed and beheld in the countenance of the
murderer the features of the long missing and abandoned son abbot
skinner

his face was white and chalky with livid stains around the eyes and
mouth the former of which were staring out of their orbits in a manner
ghastly to behold while his lips were drawn asunder and away from his
teeth as in the face of a mummy he looked as if horror-struck at
the act he was attempting and yet there was something devilish and
determined in his air that increased my terror to ecstasy i sprang
from the bed threw myself on the floor and grasping his knees
besought him to spare my life there seemed indeed occasion for all my
supplications his bloated and altered visage the neglected appearance
of his garments and person and a thousand other signs showed that the
whole period of his absence had been passed in excessive toping and
the murderous and unnatural act which he meditated manifested to what a
pitch of phrensy he had brought himself by the indulgence as i grasped
his knees he put his hand into his bosom and drew out a poniard a
weapon i had never before known him to carry at the sight of which i
considered myself a dead man but the love of life still prevailing i
leaped up and ran to a corner of the room where i mingled adjurations
and entreaties with loud screams for assistance he stood as if rooted
to the spot for a moment then dropping his horrid weapon he advanced
a few paces clasped his hands together fell upon his knees and burst
into tears and all the while without having uttered a single word but
now my cries still continuing he exclaimed but with a most wild and
disturbed look--father i won't hurt you and pray don't hurt me

by this time the housekeeper barbara having been alarmed by my
outcries came into the chamber and her presence relieving me of the
immediate fear of death i gave vent to the horror that his unnatural
attempt on my life justly excited and thus made the woman acquainted
with his baseness

the poor old creature who had always loved him was greatly affected
especially when in reply to my reproaches he began to talk
incoherently admitting the fact one instant attempting to justify
it by preferring some strange and incoherent complaint and the next
assuring me in the most piteous manner that he would do me no harm
to barbara's upbraidings he replied with a like inconsistency and when
she reproached him for meditating violence at such a moment while i
was mourning the baseness of his brother he paid little attention to
what she said seeming not only ignorant of ralph's delinquency but
apparently indifferent to it

for this reason i began to fear his brain was touched of which
indeed i had soon the most fatal proof for barbara having led him
to his chamber came back assuring me that he was going mad that
his mind was already in a ferment and in a word that that horrible
distraction which sooner or later overtakes the confirmed drinker
was lighting the torch in his brain that could only go out with life
itself a physician was sent for our fears were but too just and
before dawn the miserable youth was raving distracted

the day that followed was one of distraction not only to the wretched
abbot but to myself and i remember it as a confused dream the
only thing that dwells on my recollection apart from the outcries
in abbot's chamber and the tumult in my own heart is that some one
who owed me a sum of money due that day came and paid it into my
hands with great punctiliousness and that i received and wrote the
acquittance for it with as much accuracy as if nothing were the matter
though my thoughts were far from the subject before me

at eleven o'clock at night a messenger came to me from the prison
and his news was indeed frightful the wretched ralph had just been
discovered with his throat cut from ear to ear having made way with
himself in despair

a few moments after i was summoned to the death-bed of his brother

i shall never forget the horror of that young man's dissolution he
lay at times the picture of terror gazing upon the walls along
which in his imagination crept myriads of loathsome reptiles with
now some frightful monster and now a fire-lipped demon stealing out
of the shadows and preparing to dart upon him as their prey now he
would whine and weep as if asking forgiveness for some act of wrong
done to the being man is most constant to wrong--the loving the
feeble the confiding and anon seized by a tempest of passion the
cause of which could only be imagined he would start up fight foam
at the mouth and fall back in convulsions once he sat up in bed and
looking like a corpse began to sing a bacchanalian song on another
occasion after lying for many minutes in apparent stupefaction he
leaped out of bed before he could be prevented and uttering a yell
that was heard in the street endeavoured to throw himself from the
window

but the last raving act of all was the most horrid he rose upon his
knees with a strength that could not be resisted caught up his pillow
thrust it down upon the bed with both hands and there held it with
a grim countenance and a chuckling laugh none understood the act but
myself no other could read the devilish thoughts then at work in his
bosom it was the scene enacted in the chamber of his parent--he was
repeating the deed of murder--he was exulting in imagination over a
successful parricide

in this thought he expired for while still pressing upon the pillow
with a giant's strength he suddenly fell on his face and when turned
over was a corpse he gave but a single gasp and was no more

the horror of the spectacle drove me from the chamber and i ran to
my own to fall down and die when the blessed thought entered my
mind that the wo on my spirit the anguish the distraction were
but a dream--that my very existence as the miser and broken-hearted
father was a phantasm rather than a reality since it was a borrowed
existence--and that it was in my power to exchange it as i had done
other modes of being for a better i was sheppard lee not abram
skinner and this was but a voluntary episode in my existence which i
was at liberty to terminate

the thought was rapture i resolved to sally out and fasten upon the
first body i could find being certain i could be in none so miserable
as i had been in that i now inhabited nay the idea was so agreeable
the execution of it seemed to promise such certain release from a load
of wretchedness that i resolved to attempt it without even waiting for
morning

i seized upon my hat and cloak and for fear i might stumble into some
poor man's body as i had done in the case of dawkins's i opened my
strong-box and clapped into my pockets all the money it contained
designing to take precautionary measures to transfer it along with my
spirit to the new tenement i seized upon the loaned money that had
been repaid that day together with a small sum that had been in the
box before and had there been a million in the coffer i should have
nabbed it all without much question of the right i actually possessed
in it the whole sum was small not exceeding four hundred dollars all
being in bank-bills i should have been glad of more but was too eager
to exchange my vile casing with its miseries for a better to think
of waiting till bank-hours next day

taking possession therefore of this sum and a dozen silver spoons
that had been left in pledge a few days before i hastened to put my
plan into execution i slipped down stairs let myself out of the door
as softly as if i had been an intruder and set out in a night of
february to search for a new body




 chapter vii


in which it is shown that a man may be more useful after death than
while living



the reflection that i possessed the power already thrice successfully
exercised to transfer my spirit whenever i willed it from one
man's body to another and so get rid of any afflictions that might
beset me was highly agreeable and under the present circumstances
consolatory but there was one drawback to my satisfaction and that
was a discovery which i now made that men's bodies were not to be
had every day at a moment's warning this was the more provoking
as i knew there was no lack of them in the world between eighty and
ninety thousand men women and children having given up the ghost in
the natural way that very day whose corses would be on the morrow
consigned to miserable holes in the earth where they could and would
be of no service to any person or persons whatever the young doctors
only excepted

and here i cannot help observing that it is an extremely absurd
practice thus to dispose of--to squander and throw away as i may call
it--the hosts of human bodies that are annually falling dead upon our
hands whereas with the least management in the world they might be
converted into objects of great usefulness and value

according to the computation of philosophers the population of the
world may be reckoned in round numbers at just one thousand millions
of which number the annual mortality at the low rate of three in
a hundred is thirty millions--and that without counting the extra
million or two knocked on the head in the wars let us see what benefit
might be derived from a judicious disposition of this mountain of
mortality--i say mountain for it is plain such a number of bodies
heaped together would make a chimborazo the great mass of mankind
might be made to subserve the purpose for which nature designed them
namely--to enrich the soil from which they draw their sustenance
according to the economical chinese method each of these bodies could
be converted into five tons of excellent manure and the whole number
would therefore produce just one hundred and fifty millions of tons
of which one hundred and fifty thousand being their due proportion
would fall to the share of the united states of america enabling
our farmers in the course of ten or twelve years to double the
value of their lands this therefore would be a highly profitable
way of disposing of the mass of mankind such a disposition of their
bodies would prove especially advantageous among american cultivators
in divers districts as a remedy against bad agriculture and as
the only means of handing down their fields in good order to their
descendants such a disposition of bodies should be made upon every
field of victory so that dead heroes might be made to repair some
of the mischiefs inflicted by live ones the english farmers it is
well known made good use of the bones left on the field of waterloo
and though they would have done much better had they carried off the
flesh with them they did enough to show that war may be reckoned a
good as well as an evil and a great battle looked upon as a public
blessing a similar disposition to continue the subject of their
mortal flesh might be with great propriety required in this land
of all politicians and office-holders from the vice-president down to
the county collector who being all patriots would doubtless consent
to a measure that would make them of some use to their country as for
the president we would have him reserved for a nobler purpose we
would have him boiled down to soap according to the plan recommended
by the french chymists to be used by his successor in scouring the
constitution and the minds of the people

in this manner i repeat the great bulk of human bodies could be
profitably appropriated but other methods should be taken with
particular classes of men who might claim a more distinguished and
canonical disposition of their bodies the rich and tender would esteem
it a cruelty to be disposed of in the same way with the multitude i
would advise therefore that their bodies should be converted into
adipocire or spermaceti to be made into candles to be burnt at the
tops of the lamp-posts whereby those who never shone in life might
scintillate as the lights of the public for a week or two after their
bones might be made into rings and whistles for infant democrats to
cut their teeth on

the french and italian philosophers as i have learned from the
newspapers have made sundry strange and as i think useful
discoveries in relation to the practicability of converting the human
body into different mineral substances one man changes his neighbour's
bones into fine glass a second turns the blood into iron while a
third more successful still transforms the whole body into stone if
these things be true and i have no reason to doubt them seeing that
i found them as i said before in the newspapers they offer us new
modes of appropriation applicable to the bodies of other interesting
classes lovers might thus be converted into jewels which although
false could be worn with less fear of losing them than happens with
living inamoratos or in case of extreme grief on the part of the
survivers into looking-glasses where the mourners would find a solace
in the contemplation of their own features the second process namely
the conversion of blood into iron would be peculiarly applicable in
the case of soldiers too distinguished to be cast into corn-fields
and indeed nothing could be more natural than that those whose blood
we buy with gold should pay us back our change in iron the last
discovery could be turned to equal profit and would do away with the
necessity of employing statuaries in all cases where their services are
now required but i would confine the process of petrifaction to those
in whom nature had indicated its propriety by beginning the process
herself none could with greater justice claim to have their bodies
turned into stone than those whose hearts were of the same material
and i should propose accordingly that such a transformation of bodies
should be made only in the case of tyrants heroes duns and critics

but this subject though often reflected on i have had no leisure to
digest properly for which reason begging the reader's pardon for the
digression i shall now leave it and resume my story




 chapter viii


sheppard lee's search for a body--an uncommon incident


i was provoked i say to think there were so many millions of dead
bodies thrown away every year for which i in the greatest of my
difficulties should be none the better such was the extremity
to which i was reduced that i should have been content to change
conditions with a beggar

it was a night in february the day had been uncommonly fine with a
soft southern air puffing through the streets the frost was oozing
from the pavement and the flags--i beg their pardon the bricks--were
floating in the yellow mud so that one walked as if upon a foundation
of puddings such had been the state of things in the day such also as
late as at nine o'clock p m

but it was now eleven the wind had chopped round to the northwest and
northeast and perhaps some half a dozen other points beside for it
seemed to blow in all directions and the thermometer was galloping
downward towards zero a savage snow-storm had just set in and with
such sharp and piercing gusts of wind and such fierce rattling of
hail that had not my mind been in a ferment i should have hesitated
to expose myself to its fury but i reflected that i was flying from wo
and terror and the hope of diving into some body that might introduce
me to a life of sunshine rendered me insensible to the rigours of the
tempest

having stumbled about in the snow for a while i began to inquire of
myself whither i was going and the answer or rather the want of an
answer somewhat confounded me where was i to look for a dead body
at such a time of night it occurred to me i had better refer to a
newspaper and see what persons had lately died in town and were yet
unburied i stepped accordingly into a barber's shop that happened
to be open and snatched up an evening paper the first paragraph i
laid my eyes on contained an account of the forgeries of my son ralph
skinner it was headed unheard-of depravity and it blazoned in
italics and capitals the crime the unnatural crime of committing
frauds in the name of a father

the shock with which i beheld the fatal publication renewed my horror
and sharpened my desire to end it i threw down the paper without
consulting the column of obituaries and ran towards the hospital
where it appeared to me i should certainly find one or more bodies
which the doctors had no longer occasion for but my visit was at
a highly unseasonable hour and the porter being knocked out of a
comfortable nap got up in an ill humour whose cow's dead now i
heard him grumble from his lodge--i wonder people can't break their
necks by daylight

but my neck was not broken and he listened to my eager
inquiry--whether there were no dead bodies in the house--with rage
and indignation

i tell you what mister said he we takes no mad people in here
except they comes the regular way

and with that he shut the door in my face leaving me to wonder at his
want of civility

but the air was growing more frigid every moment and the hour was
waxing later and later i ran to the alms-house not doubting as that
was a more democratic establishment that i should be there received
with greater respect but good-breeding is not a whit more native to a
leather shirt than to a silk stocking my cerberus here was cut from
the same flint as the other his civility had been learned in the same
school and his english studied from the same grammar

i tell you what uncle barebones said he without waiting to be
questioned we takes no paupers here except they comes with an order

and so saying he slapped to the door with an energy that dislodged
from the roof of his den a full hundred weight or more of snow which
fell in my face and had wellnigh smothered me

the case began to look desperate but the difficulty of finding what i
wanted only rendered my wits more active i resolved to run to one of
the medical schools make my way into its anatomical repositories and
help myself to the best body i could find for indeed i was in such a
rage of desire to be released from my present tenement that i did not
design to stand upon trifles

i set out accordingly with this object in view but fate willed i
should seek my fortune in another quarter

the storm had by this time begun to rage with uncommon violence
the winds were blowing like so many buglers and trumpeters on a
militia-day and the snow that had already fallen was whisked up
every moment from the ground and driven back again into the air to
mingle in contention with that which was falling the atmosphere was
thickened or rather wholly displaced by the whirling particles so
that in a short time the wayfarer could neither see nor breathe in
the white chaos around him it was in truth a savage inclement
night the watchman betook him to his box to snooze away the hours in
comfort the lamps went out being of a spirit still more economical
than their founders and thinking with great justice that the streets
which could do with them could do equally well without them the dogs
were no longer heard yelping at the corners and the pigs--the only
spectres of philadelphia--that run squeaking and gibbering up and down
the streets in the night to vanish at early cock-crowing provided the
hog-catchers are in commission were one by one retreating to their
secret strongholds leaving the street to solitude the snow-storm and
me

i plodded on as well as i could and with such effect that after a
quarter hour's trudging i knew not well whither i stopped at last
i knew as little where instead of being in the heart of the city as
i supposed i found myself somewhere in the suburbs wedged fast in a
snow-drift one single lamp and one single wick of that single lamp
had escaped the puffs of the tempest it shone from aloft through the
rack of snow like a fire-fly in a fog dividing its faint beam betwixt
my frozen visage and a low open shed hard by the only objects beside
itself that were visible

i perceived that i was lost and being more than half dead with cold i
dragged myself into the shed to shelter me from the fury of the storm
and lament the ill fate that attended my efforts

as i stepped into the wretched hole i stumbled over a man lying coiled
up on the ground and so exposed to the air that his legs were already
heaped over with snow there was just light enough to discern a black
jug lying broken at his side from which arose the odour of corn-juice
but by no means of the true monongahela savour

i was struck by the fellow's appearance he had evidently been lying
there all the evening the stumble i had made over him did not disturb
him in the least and my hand chancing to touch his face i found it
could as marble i perceived he was dead a discovery that filled me
with uncommon joy for my eagerness to change my condition was such
that i only saw in him a body to be taken possession of without
reading in the broken jug and the miserable corner in which its victim
had breathed his last the newer wretchedness and degradation upon
which i was rushing such is the short-sightedness of discontent such
the folly of the man who deems himself the unluckiest of his species

with a trembling hand i thrust into the pockets of the corse the money
and the silver spoons i had brought with me being so far prudent that
i was resolved not to trust the transfer of such valuables to my new
body to accident this being accomplished i uttered the wish that had
thrice served my turn before

i wished however in vain i muttered the charm a dozen times over
but with no more effect than if i had pronounced it to the lamp-post
the body lay unmoved and i remained unchanged

i became horribly disconcerted a fear seized me that my good angel if
i had ever had one had deserted me or that the devil if it was from
him i derived my power of passing from body to body had suddenly left
me in the lurch--in a word that i had consumed all my privileges of
transformation and was chained to the body of abram skinner for life

i beat my breast in despair and then changing from that to wrath i
began to belabour the ribs of the dead man with all the strength of my
foot as if he were answerable for my disappointment perhaps indeed
the reader will think that he was for at the third kick the corpse
became animated and to my astonishment rose upon its feet saying in
accents tolerably articulate though somewhat thick and tumultuous
i say charlie odd rabbit it none on your jokes now and none on
your takin of folks up cause how folks is not half so drunk as you
suppose and so good night and let's have no more words about it and
i'll consider you werry much of a gentleman

with these words the corpse picked up that fragment of the jug that had
the handle to it leaving the others as well as his hat behind him
and staggering out of the shed he began to walk away i was petrified
he was stalking off with my money and a dozen of mrs smith's silver
spoons

you villain said i running after him give me back my property

i'm a free man said the sot i'm no man's property and so
charlie don't go for to disturb me for i knows my way home as well as
anybody

but the four hundred dollars and the silver spoons said i seizing
him by the shoulders and endeavouring to empty the pockets i had but a
moment before filled if you resist you rogue i'll put you in jail

i won't go to jail for no charlie in the liberty said the man of
the jug who to the last moment seemed to have no other idea than
that he had fallen into the hands of a guardian of the night and was
in danger of being introduced to warmer quarters than those he was
leaving he spoke with the indignation of a freeborn republican who
felt his rights invaded and was resolute to defend them and lifting
up the fragment of his jug he suddenly bestowed it upon my head with
such good-will that i was felled to the earth he took advantage of my
downfall to decamp carrying with him the treasure with which i had so
bountifully freighted him i pursued him as well as i could calling
upon the watch for assistance and shouting murder and robbery at the
top of my voice but all was in vain the watch were asleep or i had
wandered beyond their jurisdiction and after a ten minutes chase i
found myself more bewildered than before and the robber vanished with
his plunder




 chapter ix


in which the author makes the acquaintance of a philanthropist


i should have cursed my simplicity in mistaking a drunkard for a dead
man but i had other evils to distress me besides chagrin i was lost
in a snow-storm fainting with fatigue shivering with cold and afar
from assistance there not being a single house in sight it was in
vain that i sought to recover my way i plunged from one snow-bank into
another and i believe i should have actually perished had not succour
arrived at a moment when i had given over all hopes of receiving it

i had just sunk down into a huge drift on the roadside where i lay
groaning unable to extricate myself when a man driving by in a chair
hearing my lamentations drew up and demanded in a most benevolent
voice what was the matter

who art thou friend said he and what are thy distresses if thou
art in affliction peradventure there is one nigh at hand who will
succour thee

i am said i the most miserable wretch on the earth

heaven be praised said the stranger with great devoutness of
accent for in that case i will give thee help and the night shall
not pass away in vain yea verily i will do my best to assist thee
for it is both good and pleasant a comeliness to the eye and a
refreshment to the spirit to do good deeds among those who are truly
wretched

and besides said i i am sticking fast in the snow and am
perishing with cold

be of good heart and hold still for a moment and i will come to thy
assistance

and with that honest broadbrim for such i knew by his speech he must
be descended from the chair and helped me out of the drift all which
he accomplished with zeal and alacrity showing not more humanity as
i thought than satisfaction at finding such a legitimate object for
its display he brushed the snow from my clothes and perceiving i was
shivering with cold for i had lost my cloak some minutes before he
transferred one of his own outer garments of which i believe he had
two or three to my shoulders plying me all the time with questions
as to how i came into such a difficulty and what other griefs i might
have to afflict me and assuring me i should have his assistance

hast thou no house to cover thy nakedness he cried verily i will
find thee a place wherein thou shalt shelter thyself from snow and
from cold art thou suffering from lack of food verily there is a
crust of bread and the leg of a chicken yet left in my basket of cold
bits and thou shalt have them with something further hereafter hast
thou no family or friends verily there are many humane persons of my
acquaintance who will like myself consider themselves as thy brothers
and sisters art thou oppressed with years as well as poverty verily
then thou hast a stronger claim to pity and it shall be accorded thee

he heaped question upon question and assurance upon assurance with
such haste and fervour that it was some minutes before i could speak
i took advantage of his first pause to detail the latest and at that
moment the most oppressive of my griefs

i have been robbed i cried of four hundred dollars and a dozen
silver spoons by a rascal i found lying drunk under a shed but i'll
have the villain if it costs me the half of his plunder and--

be not awroth with the poor man said my deliverer it was a
wickedness in him to rob thee but thou shouldst reflect how wickedness
comes of misery and how misery of the inclemency of the season be
merciful to the wicked man as well as to the miserable for thereby
thou showest mercy to him who is doubly miserable but how didst thou
come by four hundred dollars and a dozen silver spoons thou canst not
be so poor as to prove an object of charity

no said i i am no beggar but i won't be robbed for nothing

verily i say unto thee again be not awroth with the poor man thou
shouldst reflect if thou wert robbed how far thou wast thyself the
cause of the evil for having four hundred dollars about thee thou
mightst have relieved the poor creature's wants in which case thou
wouldst have prevented both a loss and a crime--the one on thy part
the other on his talk not therefore of persecuting the poor man
hunt him up if thou canst administer secretly to his wants and give
him virtuous counsel and then peradventure he will sin no more

i was struck by the tone and maxims of my deliverer they expressed an
ardour of benevolence an enthusiasm of philanthropy such as i had
never dreamed of before i could not see his face the night being
so thick and tempestuous but there was a complacency a bustling
self-satisfaction in his voice that convinced me he was not only a
good but a happy man i regarded him with as much envy as respect
and a comparison which i could not avoid mentally making betwixt his
condition and my own drew from me a loud groan

art thou hurt said the good samaritan i will help thee into my
wheeled convenience here and take thee to thy home

no said i i will never go near that wretched house again

what is it that makes it wretched said the quaker

you will know if you are of philadelphia i replied when i tell
you my name i am the miserable abram skinner

what abram skinner the money-lender said my friend with a severe
voice friend abram i have heard of thy domestic calamities and
verily i have heard of those of many others who laid them all at
thy doors as the author and cause thereof thou art indeed the most
wretched of men but if thou thinkest so thyself then is there a hope
thou mayst be yet restored to happiness thou hast made money but
what good hast thou done with it thou hast accumulated thy hundreds
and thy thousands and thy tens of thousands--but how many of thy
fellow-creatures hast thou given cause to rejoice in thy prosperity
truly i have heard much said of thy wealth and thy avarice friend
abram but verily not a word of thy kind-heartedness and charity and
know that goodness and charity are the only securities against the
ills both sore and manifold that spring from groaning coffers i say
to thee friend abram hast thou ever given a dollar in alms to the
poor or acquitted a single penny of obligation to the hard-run of thy
customers

my conscience smote me--not however that i felt any great remorse
for not having thrown away my money in the way the quaker meant but
his words brought a new idea into my mind it was misery on the one
hand and the hope of arriving at happiness on the other which had
spurred me from transformation to transformation each change had
however been productive of greater discontent than the other and the
woes with which i was oppressed in my three borrowed bodies had been
even greater than those that afflicted me in my own proper original
casing it was plain that i had not exercised a just discretion in the
selection of bodies since i had taken those of men whose modes of
existence did not dispose to happiness what mode of existence then was
most likely to secure the content i sought such i inferred from the
quaker's discourse as would call into operation the love of goodness
and of man--such as would cause to be cultivated the kindly virtues
unknown to the selfish--such as would lead to the practice of charity
and general philanthropy i was grieved therefore that i had entered
so many bodies for nothing my conscience accused me of a blunder and
i longed to enter upon an existence of virtue not that i had any great
regard for virtue itself but because i valued my own happiness had my
deliverer chanced to break his neck while discoursing to me i should
have reanimated his corse to try my hand at benevolence as for being
good and charitable in the body i then occupied i felt that it was
impossible the impulse pointed to another existence

the quaker's indignation soon abated he looked upon my silence as the
effect of remorse and the idea of converting me into an alms-giver and
a friend of the poor like himself took possession of his imagination
and warmed his spirit by such a conversion his philanthropic desires
would be doubly gratified it would make me happy and as i was
a rich man some hundreds of others also he helped me into the
chair and driving slowly towards the city attempted the good work
by describing the misery so prevalent in the suburbs and dilating
with uncommon enthusiasm upon the delight with which every act of
benevolence would be recorded in my own bosom

it seems that he was returning from a mission of charity in one of
the remotest districts where he had relieved the necessities of
divers unhappy wretches and he gave me to understand it was his
purpose to make one more charitable visitation before returning home
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the fury of the tempest
and this visit he felt the more urged to make since it would afford a
practical illustration of his remarks and show how doubly charity was
blessed both to the giver and receiver

thou shalt see said he even with thine own eyes what power he
that hath money hath over the afflictions of his race--what power to
dry the tear of the mourning and to check the wicked deeds of the
vicious he that i will now relieve is what thou didst foolishly call
thyself--to wit the most miserable of men for he is both a beggar and
a convicted felon having but a few days since been discharged from the
penitentiary where he had served out his three years for i believe
the third time in his life

surely said i he is then a reprobate entirely unworthy pity

on the contrary said the philanthropist he is for that reason the
more to be pitied since all regard him with distrust and abhorrence
and refuse him the relief without which he must again become a
criminal the very boys say to him get up thou old jail-bird and
men and women hoot at him in the streets poverty made him a criminal
and scorn has hardened his heart yet is he a man with a soul and
verily thou shalt see how that soul can be melted by the breath of
compassion in this little hovel we shall find him said the quaker
drawing up before a miserable frame building which was of a most
lonely aspect and in a terrible state of dilapidation the windows
being without shutters and glasses and even the door itself half torn
from its hinges

it is a little tenement that belongeth to me said my friend and
here i told him he might shelter him until i could come in person and
relieve him a negro-man whom i permitted to live here for a while
did very ungratefully that is to say very thoughtlessly--destroy
the window-shutters and other loose work for fire-wood i having
forgotten to supply him with that needful article and he poor man
being too bashful to acquaint me with his wants verily i do design to
render it more comfortable but in these hard times one cannot find
more money than sufficeth to fill the mouths of the hungry descend
friend abram and let us enter i see the poor man hath a fire shining
through the door this will warm thy frozen limbs while the sound
of his grateful acknowledgments will do the same good office for thy
spirit




 chapter x


containing an affecting adventure with a victim of the law


my benevolent friend leaving his horse standing at the door led the
way into the hovel the interior of which was still more ruinous than
the outside it consisted of but a single room below with a garret
above a meager fire which furnished the only light was burning on
the hearth to supply which the planks had been torn from the floor
leaving the earth below almost bare there was not a single article
of furniture visible save an old deal table without leaves a broken
chair and a tattered scrap of carpet lying near the fire which seemed
to have served as both bed and blanket to the wretched tenant

how is this said the friend in surprise verily i did direct my
man abel to carry divers small comforts hither which have vanished as
well as the poor man john smith

john smith it seems was the name of the beneficiary and that
convinced me he was a rogue i ventured to hint to our common friend
that john smith having disposed of those small comforts he spoke of
to the best advantage was now engaged seeking others in some of our
neighbours houses and that the wisest thing we could do in such a
case would be to take our departure

verily said my deliverer with suavity it is not possible john can
do the wicked things thou thinkest of for first it is but three days
since he left the penitentiary and secondly i sent him by my helper
and friend abel snipe sufficient eatables to supply him a week so
that he could have no inducement to do a wicked thing still it doth
surprise me that he is absent nevertheless we will tarry a little
while lest peradventure he should return and be in trouble with none
to relieve him it wants yet ten minutes to midnight continued the
benevolent man drawing out a handsome gold watch and five of these
at least we can devote to the poor creature

i was about to remonstrate a second time when a step was heard
approaching at a distance in the street

peradventure it is john himself said my friend and peradventure it
will be better thou shouldst step aside into yonder dark corner for an
instant that thou mayst witness without restraining by thy presence
the feelings of virtue that remain in the spirit even when tainted and
hardened by depravity

i crept away as i was directed to a corner where i might easily
remain unobserved the room being illumined only by the fire and that
consisting of little besides embers and ashes from this place i saw
mr john smith as he entered which he declined doing until after he
had peeped suspiciously into the apartment and been summoned by the
voice of his benefactor

he was as ill-looking a dog as i had ever laid eyes on and his
appearance was in strange contrast with that of his benevolent patron
the latter was a tall and rawboned man of fifty with an uncommonly
prepossessing visage rather lantern-jawed perhaps but handsome and
good-natured the other was a slouch of a fellow short of stature
but full of fat and brawn with bow legs gibbon arms and a hang-dog
visage he sidled up to the fire hesitatingly and indeed with an air
of shame and humility while the philanthropist laying his watch upon
the table extended his hand towards him

be of good heart friend john he said i come not to reproach thee
for thy misdeeds but to counsel thee how thou shalt amend them and
restore thyself again to the society of the virtuous

es sir grumbled john smith dodging his head in humble
acknowledgment rubbing his hands for warmth over the fire and
casting a sidelong look at his benefactor werry good of you sir
shall ever be beholden werry hard times for one what's been in the
penitentiary--takes away all one's repurtation and lord bless us
sir a man's but a ruined man when a man hasn't no repurtation

and with that worthy john drew his sleeve over his nose which
convinced me he was not so much of a rascal as i thought him

john thou hast been but as a sinner and a foolish man

es sir said john with another rub of his sleeve at his nose but
hard times makes hard work of a poor man always hoped to mend and be
wirtuous but lord bless us mr longstraw beg pardon--can't think of
making so free to say friend to such a great gentleman one can't be
wirtuous with nothing to live on

verily thou speakest in a measure the truth said my friend
and i intend thou shalt now be put in some way of earning an honest
livelihood

es sir said john and sure i shall be werry much beholden

but it is not my intention to record the conversation of the worthy
pair i am writing a history of myself and not of other people and
i therefore think it proper to pursue no discourses in which i did
not myself bear a part it is sufficient to say that my deliverer
said a thousand excellent things in the way of counsel which the
other received very well and many indicative of a disposition to be
charitable which mr john smith received still better and in the end
to relieve the pressing wants of the sufferer which mr john smith
feelingly represented drew forth a pocketbook and took therefrom a
silver dollar at the sight of which i thought mr john smith looked
a little disappointed nay it struck me that the appearance of the
pocketbook ancient and ill-looking as it was had captivated his
imagination in a greater degree than the coin i had before observed
him steal several affectionate looks towards the gold watch lying on
the table which now however the sight of the well-thumbed wallet
seemed to have driven from his thoughts entirely nevertheless he
received the silver dollar with many thanks and with still more the
assurance that the philanthropist would procure him employment on the
morrow and mr longstraw's eyes as he turned to beckon me from the
corner began to twinkle with the delight of self-approbation

i was myself beginning to feel a sentiment of pleasure and to picture
to my mind the unfortunate felon converted by a few words of counsel
and still fewer dollars of charity into an honest and worthy member of
society when--oh horror of horrors--the repenting convict suddenly
snatched up a brand from the fire and discharged it with a violence
that would have felled an ox full upon the head of his patron

the sparks flew from the brand over the whole room and my friend
dropped upon the floor on his face followed by the striker who
seizing upon his cravat twisted it tightly round the unfortunate man's
throat thus completing by strangulation the murder more than half
accomplished by the below

the whole affair was the work of an instant and had i possessed
the will or courage to interfere i could not have done so in time
to arrest the mischief but in truth i had not the power to stir
horror and astonishment chained me to the corner where i stood as if
transformed to stone unable even to vent my feelings in a cry i was
seized with a terrible apprehension on my own account for i could
not doubt that the wretch who would thus murder a benefactor for a
few dollars would have as little hesitation to despatch me who had
witnessed the deed i feared every moment lest the villain should
direct his eye to the corner in which i stood separated from him only
a few yards but he was too busy with his horrid work to regard me
and terrified as i was i looked on in safety while my deliverer was
murdered before my eyes

how long mr john smith was at his dreadful work i cannot say but i
saw him after a while relax his grasp from his victim's throat and
fall to rummaging his pockets then leaping up he seized upon the
watch and clapped it into his bosom saying with a most devilish
chuckle and grin

damn them ere old fellers what gives a man a dollar and preaches
about wirtue i reckon old slabsides there's none on your people will
hang me for the smash much beholden to you for leaving the horse and
chair it makes all safer

with these words the wretch slipped out of the hovel and a moment
after i heard the smothered roll of the vehicle as it swept from the
door


 chapter xi


in which the plot thickens and the tragedy grows deeper


i supposed that mr john smith had taken himself away with as much
speed as was consistent with the strength of his horse and the safety
of his bones and i recovered from the fears i had entertained on my
own account i crept up to the philanthropist to give him assistance
if such could be now rendered but it was too late he was already
dead mr john smith had not taken his degrees without proper study
in his profession and i must say that his practice on the present
occasion did not go far to confirm me in the love of benevolence

nevertheless the appearance of the defunct threw my mind into a
ferment i had been hunting a body and now i had one before me i had
come to believe that if i wished for happiness i must get possession
of one whose occupant had previously been happy and i had seen enough
of the deceased to know that he had been an uncommonly comfortable and
contented personage

the end of all this was a resolution which i instantly made to
take advantage of the poor man's misfortune and convert his body
to my own purposes i had seen him for the first time that night i
did not remember ever to have heard his name mentioned before and i
consequently knew nothing of him beyond what i had just learned where
he lived who were his connexions what his property c c were
all questions to which i was to find answers thereafter it appeared
to me that a philanthropist of his spirit and age the latter of which
i judged to be about fifty could not but be very well known and that
all i should have to do after reanimating his body would be to seek
the assistance of the first person i should find and so be conducted
at once to the gentleman's house after which all would go well enough
but in truth i took but little time for reflection or perhaps i
should not have been in such a hurry to attempt a transformation a
little prudence might have led me to inquire into the consequences of
the change inferred from the condition of the body suppose his scull
should prove to be broken who was to stand the woes of trepanning i
do say it would have been wiser had i thought of that--but unluckily
i did not i was in too great a hurry to think of any thing save the
transformation itself and the result was that i had a lesson on the
demerits of leaping before looking which i think will be of service to
me for the remainder of my life as it might be to the reader could
the reader be brought to believe that that experience is good for any
thing which costs nothing

my resolution was quickened by a step which i heard approaching along
the street it is a watchman thought i to myself i will jump into
the body and run out for assistance

i turned to the defunct

friend longstraw said i or whatever your name is if you are
really dead i wish to occupy your body

that moment i lost all consciousness the reader may infer the transfer
of spirit was accomplished

and so it was i came to my senses a few moments after just in time
to find myself tumbling into a hole in the earth beneath the floor of
the hovel with mr john smith hard by dragging to the same depository
the mortal frame i had just deserted i perceived at once the horrible
dilemma in which i was placed i was on the point of being buried and
what was worse of being buried alive

i conjure and beseech thee friend john smith i cried--but cried no
more the villain had just reached the pit dragging the body of the
late abram skinner he was startled at my voice but it only quickened
him in his labours he snatched up the corse and cast it down upon me
as one would a millstone and the weight though that was not very
considerable and the shock together jarred the life more than half
out of me

what old slabsides said he ar'n't you past grumbling

with that the bloody-minded miscreant seized upon a fragment of plank
and began to belabour me with all his strength

i had entered the philanthropist's body only to be murdered i uttered
a direful scream but that was only a waste of the breath which mr
john smith was determined to waste for me he redoubled his blows with
a vigour that showed he was in earnest nor did he cease until his work
was completed in a word he murdered me and so effectually that it
is a wonder i am alive to tell it he assassinated me and even began
to bury me by tumbling earth down from the floor when as my good
fate would have it the scene was brought to a climax by the sudden
entrance of a watchman who running up to the villain served him the
same turn he had served me by laying a leaded mace over his head and
so knocking him out of his senses

it seems for i scorn to keep the reader in suspense by indulging in
mystery that this faithful fellow having made a shorter nap than
was warranted by the state of the night had taken a stroll into the
air to look about him that he had passed the hovel and seeing the
chair standing at the door had looked through a crack and perceived
mr longstraw with whose person and benevolent character he was
acquainted and myself--that is my late self--warming ourselves by the
convict's fire and that after pursuing his beat for a while he was
about to return by another way when to his surprise he lighted upon
the vehicle at more than a square's distance from the house and the
horse being tied to a post it was evident he had not strayed thither
this awaking a suspicion that all was not right he determined to pay
a second visit to the hovel and was on the way thither when i set up
the scream mentioned before then quickening his pace he arrived in
time to witness the awful spectacle of mr john smith thrusting the two
bodies into the pit which operation the courageous watchman brought to
a close by knocking the operator on the head as i have related

what had brought mr john smith back again and why he should have
troubled himself to conceal the victim of his murderous cupidity must
be conjectured as well as the amazement with which doubtless he
found he had two bodies to bury instead of one he perhaps reflected
that the visit of his patron was known to other persons who upon
finding his body would readily conjecture who was the murderer and
therefore judged it proper to conceal the evidence of assassination
and leave the fate of his benefactor in entire mystery

as it happened his return had wellnigh proved fatal to me and it
was any thing but happy for himself it caused him to take up his
lodgings for a fourth time in the penitentiary and there he is sawing
stone i believe to this day unless pardoned out by the governor of
pennsylvania according to the practice among governors in general
the visitation was however thus far advantageous to me that it
caused me to be conducted to the dwelling of mr longstraw with all
due expedition and care whereas had it not happened i might have
remained lying on the floor of my miserable tenement until frozen to
death for the night was uncommonly bitter

as for my late body it found its way to abram skinner's mansion
whence having been handsomely coffined it was carried to the grave
which but for me it would have filled three months before

the philanthropist's family


if my first introduction to the life of the philanthropic zachariah
longstraw for that was his name was attended with circumstances of
fear and danger i did not thereby escape those other evils which as
i hinted before might have been anticipated had i reflected a moment
on the situation of his body it was covered with bruises from head to
foot and there was scarce a sound bone left in it so that as i may
say i had in reanimating it only exchanged anguish of spirit for
anguish of body and which of these is the more intolerable i never
could satisfactorily determine philosophers indeed contend for the
superior poignancy of the former but i must confess a leaning to the
other side of the question what is the pain of a broken heart to that
of the toothache the poets speak of vipers in the bosom what are
they compared to a bug in the ear be this however as it may it is
certain i had a most dreadful time of it in mr longstraw's body and
it would have been much worse had not the blows i had received on the
head kept me for a long time in a delirium and therefore in a measure
unconscious of my sufferings the truth is the body which i so rashly
entered was in such a dilapidated condition so bruised and mangled
that it was next to an impossibility to restore its vital powers and
it was more than two weeks after lying all that time in a state of
insensibility more dead than alive before i came to my senses and
remembered what had befallen me and it was not until four more had
elapsed that i was finally able to leave my chamber and snuff the
early breezes of spring

as soon as i began to take notice of what was passing about me i
perceived that i lay in a good though plainly-furnished chamber and
that besides the physicians and other persons who occasionally bustled
around me there were two individuals so constantly in attendance
and so careful and affectionate in all their deportment that i did
not doubt they were members of my new family indeed i had no sooner
looked upon their faces and heard their voices than i felt a glow of
satisfaction within my spirit which convinced me they were my very
dear and faithful friends and that i loved them exceedingly

they were both young men the one perhaps of twenty-five the other
six or seven years older both were decked in quaker garments the
elder being uncommonly plain in his appearance wearing smallclothes
shoe-buckles and a hat with a brim full five inches wide which he
seldom laid aside these gave him a patriarchal appearance highly
striking in one of his youth which was much increased by an uncommon
air of gravity and benevolence beaming from his somewhat swarthy and
hollow visage

the younger had no such sanctimonious appearance there was a janty
look even in the cut of his straight coat he had a handsome face and
seemed conscious of it he swung about the room at times with a strut
that excited his own admiration and any three moments out of five he
might be seen before the looking-glass surveying his teeth inspecting
the sweep of his shoulders and brushing up his hair with his fingers
his plain coat was set at naught by a vest and trousers of the most
fashionable cut and pattern he had a gold guard-chain worn abroad
and his watch which in all likelihood was gold also was stuck in
his vest-pocket in the manner approved of by bucks and men of the
world instead of being deposited according to the system of the wise
in a fob over the epigastrium and to crown his list of vanities he
had in his shirt a breastpin which he took care to keep constantly
visible containing jewels of seven or eight different colours it
was manifest the young gentleman if a quaker as his coat showed him
to be was quite a free one and indeed the first words i heard him
utter which were also the first that i distinguished after rousing
from my long sleep of insensibility set the matter beyond question i
saw him peer into my face very curiously and directly heard him call
out to his companion--i say snipe by jingo uncle zack's beginning
to look like a man in his senses

these words imparted a sensation of pleasure to my breast but i felt
impelled to censure the young man for the freedom of his expressions
my tongue however seemed to have lost its function and while i was
vainly attempting to articulate a reprimand the other rushed up and
giving me an earnest stare seized upon one of my hands which he fell
to mumbling and munching in a highly enthusiastic manner crying out
with inexpressible joy and fervour blessed be the day and does thee
open thee eyes again verily this shall be a day of rejoicing and
not to me only the loving abel snipe but to thousands does thee
feel better zachariah my friend and patron verily the poor man
that has mourned for thee shall be now as one that rejoices for thee
shall again speak to him the words of tenderness and open the hand of
alms-giving yea verily and the afflicted shall mourn no more

these words were even more agreeable than those uttered by the junior
and i experienced a feeling of displeasure when the latter suddenly
cut them short by exclaiming come snipe none of thee confounded
nonsense i reckon uncle zack has had enough philanthropy for the
season and don't thee go to humbug him into it any more thee has made
thee own fortune and should be content

verily friend jonathan said the fervent abel snipe addressing the
junior but still tugging at my hand thee does not seem to rejoice
at thee uncle's recovery as thee should but thee jokes and thee jests
sha'n't make my spirit rejoice the less

verily said jonathan so it seems but if thee tugs at uncle zack
in that way and talks so loud thee will do his business

verily said abel--

and verily said jonathan interrupting him thee will say it is
thee business to do his business which is very true--but not in
the sense of murder so let us hold our tongues and do thou uncle
zachariah he added addressing me keep thyself quiet and take this
dose of physic

it was unspeakable how much my spirit was warmed within me by this
friendly contest between the two young men and by their looks of
affection i longed to embrace them both but had not the strength
and indeed it was three or four days more before i felt myself able
or was allowed by the physicians to indulge in conversation

at the expiration of that period i found myself growing stronger the
twenty thousand different pangs that had besieged my body from the
crown of my head to the sole of my foot whenever i attempted to move
were less racking and poignant and waking from a slumber that had
been more agreeable than usual and finding no one near me save the
ever faithful abel snipe i could no longer resist the impulse to speak
to him

abel snipe said i

blessed be thee kind voice that it speaks again said abel snipe
devouring my hand as before and blubbering as he devoured

thy name is abel snipe said i

verily and surely it is abel snipe and no other said he i hope
thee don't forget me

why really said i i can't exactly say friend abel seeing that
there has a confusion come over my brain but art thou certain i am no
longer abram skinner

at this question abel snipe's eyes jumped half out of his head and
they regarded me with wo and horror i saw he thought my wits were
unsettled and i hastened to remove the impression

don't be alarmed friend abel but of a verity i think i was killed
and buried

yea said abel yea verily the vile ungrateful malicious john
smith did smite thee over the head with a club so that the bone was
broken and thee was as one that was dead but oh the villain we have
him fast in jail and oh the unnatural rascal we'll hang him

verily said i feeling uncommon concern at the idea we will do no
such wicked deed but we will admonish the poor man of the wickedness
of his ways and relieving his wants discharge him from bondage

yea said abel snipe with an air of contrition so will we do as
becometh the merciful man and christian but verily the flesh did
quarrel with the spirit and the old adam cried out to me blood for
blood and the thing that is flesh said vengeance on the wicked man
that smote the friend of the afflicted but now thy goodness reproves
me and teaches me better things wherefore i say be not hard with the
miserable man for such is the wicked and such is john smith who is
now mourning over his foolish acts in the county prison yea verily
we will be exceeding lenient--and so forth and so forth

i do not think it needful to repeat all the wise and humane things
said by abel snipe they convinced me he was the most benevolent of
beings and warmed a similar spirit that was now burning in my breast
and which burnt on until it became at last a general conflagration of
philanthropy yea the transformation was complete i found within
me on the sudden a raging desire to augment the happiness of my
fellow-creatures and wondered that i had ever experienced any other
passion the generous abel discoursed to me of the thousands i--that
is my prototype the true zachariah--had rescued from want and
affliction and of the thousands whom i was yet to relieve my brain
took fire at the thought and i exulted in a sense of my virtue i
perceived in imagination the tear of distress chased away by that
of gratitude i heard the sob of sorrow succeeded by the sigh of
happiness and the prayer of beseeching changed to the prayer of praise
and thanksgiving a gentle warmth flowed from my bosom through the
uttermost bounds of my frame and i felt that i was a happy man yea
reader yea and verily i was at last happy my only affliction was
that the battered condition of my body prevented my sallying out at
once and practising the noble art of charity the tears sprang into my
eyes when abel recounted the numbers of the miserable who had besieged
my doors during my two weeks of insensibility crying for assistance

why didst thou not relieve them abel snipe i exclaimed

verily said abel turning his eyes to heaven with a look of fervent
rapture i did relieve the sorrowing and destitute even to the
uttermost penny that was in my pocket blessed be the deed for i have
not now a cent that i can call my own as for thine zachariah it
became me not to dispense it without thy spoken authority the more
especially as thy nephew jonathan did hint and vehemently insist
that thou hadst bestowed too much already for thy good and his

these words filled me with concern and displeasure

surely said i the young man jonathan is not averse to deeds of
charity

verily said abel clasping his hands and looking as if he would
have wept the excellent and beloved youth doth value money more than
the good which money may produce and of that good he esteemeth chiefly
the portion that falleth to his own lot of a surety i do fear he hath
an eagerness and hankering a fleshly appetite and an exceeding strong
desire after the things of the world he delighteth in the vanity of
fine clothes and his discourse is of women and the charms thereof
he hath bought the picture of a french dancing-woman and hung it in
his chamber swearing for he hath a contempt for affirmation that
it is a good likeness of the maiden ellen wild and yesterday i did
perceive him squeaking at a heathenish wind-instrument called a flute
and thereupon he did avow an intention to try his hand at that more
paganish thing of strings called a fiddle and oh what grieved me
above all and caused the spirit within me to cry avaunt and get thee
away jonathan he did offer me a ticket of the cost of one dollar
to procure me admission into the place of sin and vanity called the
theatre swearing by jingo and by gemini there was great fun
there and offering to lend me a coat hat and trousers so that the
wicked should not know me yea verily the young man is as a young
lion that roameth up and down--as a sheep that wandereth from the
pinfold into the forbidden meadows--and as for charity peradventure
thee will not believe me but he averred the only charity he believed
in was that which began at home

these confessions of the faithful abel in relation to the young man
jonathan caused my spirit to wax sorrowful within me but it is
fitting before pursuing such conversations further that i should
inform the reader who the faithful abel and the young man jonathan
were

the latter as abel himself informed me was my--or if the reader
will my prototype's--nephew the only and now orphan son of a
sister who had married as the phrase is out of meeting and dying
destitute left her boy to the charge of the benevolent zachariah
who being himself childless adopted him as his son and heir and had
treated him as such from his childhood up the great wish of zachariah
was to make the adopted son a philanthropist like himself in which
however he was destined to disappointment for jonathan was of a wild
and worldly turn fond of frolic and amusement and extremely averse to
squander in works of charity the possessions he designed applying in
future years to his own benefit nevertheless he was greatly beloved
by his uncle and i who was imbued with that uncle's spirit and
destined to love and abhor what he had loved and abhorred whether i
would or not soon began to regard him as one of the two apples of my
eyes




 chapter ii


some account of the worthy abel snipe


the faithful abel snipe it seems his history was told me by
jonathan was a man whom zachariah some years before while playing
the howard in a neighbouring sovereignty had found plunged in deep
distress and making shoes in the penitentiary to this condition he
had been reduced by sheer goodness for being an amateur in that
virtuous art of which zachariah was a professor and having no means
of his own to relieve the woes of the wretched he had borrowed from
the hoards of his employers the president and directors of a certain
stock-company in whose office he had a petty appointment and thus
perforce made charitable an institution that was chartered to be
uncharitable he committed the fault however of borrowing without
the previous ceremony of asking--either because he was of so innocent
a temper as to think such a proceeding unnecessary or because he knew
beforehand that the request would not be granted and the consequence
was that the president and directors as aforesaid did very
mercilessly hand him over to the prosecuting attorney the prosecuting
attorney to a grand jury the grand jury to a petit jury the petit
jury to a penitentiary and the penitentiary to the devil--or such
at least would have been the ending of the unfortunate amateur had
not the philanthropist who always ordered his shoes for charity's
sake at the prison been struck with the uncommon excellence of a pair
constructed by abel's hands

he sought out the faithful maker for sure a man must be faithful to
make a good pair of shoes in a penitentiary was melted by his tale
of wo even as the wax through which abel was then drawing a bunch of
ends was melted by the breath thereof and shedding tears to find the
poor creature's virtue so shabbily rewarded ran to the prosecutors
with a petition which he induced them to sign transmitted it to the
governor with a most eloquent essay on the divine character of mercy
and in less than a week walked abel snipe out of prison a pardoned
man

the charity of the professor did not end with abel's liberation
enraptured with the fervour of his gratitude touched by the
artlessness of his character and moved by the destitution to which a
pardon in the winter-time exposed him he carried him to his own land
and house fed clothed and employed him upon a new pair of shoes
and discovering that he had talents for a nobler business advanced
him in time to the rank of accountant or secretary collector of
rents dispenser of secret charities and in general factotum and
fiduciary at large such a servant was needed by the humane zachariah
his philanthropy left him no time to attend to his own affairs and his
nephew jonathan had fallen in love and become incompetent to their
management

never was experiment more happy for subject and object abel snipe
was made an honest and useful man and zachariah longstraw obtained a
friend and servant without price the gratitude of abel was equal to
his ability humility fidelity and religion were the least of his
virtues--he became a philanthropist like his master he managed his
affairs with such skill that zachariah had always pennies at hand
for the unfortunate which it seems had not always happened before
and what was equally charming the zealous abel dived into every
lane alley and gutter to discover new objects of charity for his
patron to crown all he felt moved in the spirit to profess the faith
so greatly adorned by his protector and after due preparation and
probation appeared in the garb of peace and humility and even went so
far as to hold forth once at meeting

in a word abel snipe was a jewel of the first water who supplied
the place of the idle jonathan in all matters of business and almost
in the affections of his kinsman if not equally beloved he was more
highly esteemed and his shining worth consoled the philanthropist for
many of the derelictions of his nephew he became the confidant the
coadjutor and the adviser of zachariah and zachariah never found
occasion to lament the be nevolence that had redounded so much to his
own advantage




 chapter iii


in which the young man jonathan argues several cases of conscience
which are recommended to be brought before yearly meeting



my nephew jonathan had no great love for poor abel and he did not tell
me his story without passing sundry sarcasms on him as well as myself
for bestowing so much confidence on the poor unfortunate man i rebuked
the youth for his freedom and uncharitableness and remembering what
abel had told me of his own idle and trifling course of life i felt
impelled by the new spirit of virtue that possessed me to take him
to task which i did in the following manner and it is wondrous how
completely and how soon for i was yet lying on my back groaning with
my unhealed wounds and bruises my spirit assumed and acted upon all
that was peculiar in the nature of zachariah longstraw

nevvy jonathan said i the uncharitableness of thy spirit afflicts
me trouble not thyself to censure the worthy abel snipe but think
how thou shalt amend thine own crying faults it has been said to me
jonathan my son and verily i fear it is true that thou squeakest
upon flutes and that thou makest profane noises with fiddles and
furthermore that thou runnest after and dost buy the vanity of
pictures and triest thy hand at painting the same

i do said jonathan and i find nothing against them in the
scripture

verily said i but dost thou find nothing against them in thine own
spirit

not a whit said jonathan my heart says love them and my head
approves the counsel where's the harm in these things i know thee
don't say they are in themselves sinful

verily no said i but they are indirectly so for being wholly
useless the time bestowed upon them is time lost and wasted and that
nevvy jonathan i think thee will allow to be sinful

not i said jonathan stoutly i don't believe the wasting of time
to be any such heinous matter as thee supposes had it been so man
would not have been made to waste a third of his existence in slumber
but granting this for the sake of argument i deny thy premises
uncle zachariah the time bestowed upon these things is not wasted
heaven has given to nine men out of ten a capacity to enjoy both music
and painting it has done more--it has set an example of both before
our eyes and thus laid the foundation of the divine arts in nature
what is the world around us but a great concert-hall echoing with the
music of bird and beast of wind water and foliage what but a great
gallery of pictures painted by the hand of providence nature is a
painter--nature is a musician and her sons can do nothing better
than follow her example but were nature neither it is not the less
evident that these arts are lawful and sinless they can be proved so
uncle zachariah upon thine own system of philanthropy for they add
to the happiness of our existence and they do so without corrupting
our morals or injuring our neighbours i say uncle quoth jonathan
who had pronounced this defence with much enthusiasm and now concluded
with a grin of triumph i have thee there dead as a herring

verily said i more pleased than offended at the young man's
ingenuity for my spirit yearned over him the more at every word thee
has a talent for argument which i would thee would cultivate for then
thee could get into the assembly and finally perhaps into congress
and do much good to thy fellow-men by reforming divers crying abuses

verily said he the first thing i should reform would be thy
philanthropy

don't be funny nevvy said i for i have not done with thee thee
was dancing last night in the house of the vain man ebenezer wild

i was said jonathan i was shaking my legs and i can't see the
harm of it for the flies do the same thing all day long

verily thee should remember that a reasonable being that hath a
brain should rather exercise that than his heels

i grant thee said jonathan but thee knows brains are not so
abundant as heels and thee should expect the mass of people to conduct
according to their endowments

jonathan said i if thee thinks to make me laugh thee is mistaken
of a verity i will not be rigid with thee but verily i must speak to
thee of what i hold thy faults thou hast a vain and eager hankering
after the society of giddy women

i have said jonathan with great fervour heaven made women to be
loved and i love them--especially ellen wild

sure said i i have heard that name

sure said jonathan it would be odd if thee had not for thee knows
her well--thine old friend ebenezer's daughter

a giddy girl jonathan i fear me a giddy girl

as giddy as the dev--that is as giddy as a goose said jonathan

what said i thee meant something worse verily i have heard thee
uses bad language jonathan

by jingo said the youth indignantly there is no end to the
slanders people will say of one i use bad language by jingo

why thee is at it now said i let thy yea be yea and thy nay nay
for all beyond is profanity or folly but thee will allow jonathan
that when thee is among the people of the world thee uses the language
thereof forgetting the language of simplicity and sobriety which
would best become thy lips

ay there i plead guilty and with good reason too said jonathan
when i was a boy thee had thoughts of making me a merchant and thee
compelled me to study french and german now when i meet a frenchman
or a german unacquainted with the english tongue in what language does
thee suppose i address him

why french or german to be sure

verily i do said the youth and when i get among the people of the
world i speak to them in the language of the world for poor ignorant
creatures they don't understand quaker moreover uncle does thee
know ellen wild is of opinion we friends don't speak good grammar now
she and i spent a whole hour the other evening trying to parse thee
is thee does thee loves and so on and we could not work
them according to murray i say uncle does thee know of any command
in scripture to speak bad grammar

no said i but it is not forbidden and the phrases mentioned thou
knowest have crept into our speech as corruptions and are only used
for conversational purposes

truly said jonathan and the language of the world is used for
conversational purposes also i say uncle zachariah that now's a
clincher

i won't quarrel with thee on this account jonathan but how comes it
thou wert seen in that wicked place the theatre

by jingo said he snipe has been blabbing there too

what said i does thou strive to conceal it

yea said jonathan for when we do our good deeds we should do them
in secret uncle zachariah i went to the theatre in charity

thee did said i charmed more than i can express at the thought of
the young man's virtue

yes uncle said the youth and great need have the actors of
charity for a poorer set of fellows i think i never saw got together
and here the rogue fell a laughing in my face and so thee need not
distress thyself for i sha'n't go there again until they get a better
company but uncle zachariah thee has exhorted me enough for one
time and it is my turn now so do thou be conformable and answer my
questions for i can tell thee i have a fault to find with thee
according to thine own system of philanthropy it is thy duty to make
thy fellow-creatures happy now i ask thee whether thou dost not
think it thy duty to make me thy loving nephew happy as well as a
stranger

verily said i i do

why then said jonathan there is a short way of doing it uncle
zachariah i want to be married ellen and i have talked the matter
over and she says she'll have me now uncle thee did once talk of
giving me a counting-house and ten or twenty thousand dollars as the
case might be to begin a commission business and mr wild talked
of doing as much in the way of dowry to ellen and now i say uncle
zachariah as the shipwrecked sailor did when he prayed among the
breakers if thee means to help me now's the time

what said i have i so much property

thee is joking said the youth thee is a rich man and thee knows
thee can afford it but thee must do it soon or it may be too late
for i can tell thee folks begin to talk of thy philanthropy and say
thou art flinging away so much money that presently thou wilt have
nothing left to give me mr wild is of this mind and he has hinted
some things to me very plainly in a word uncle if thee does not
permit me to marry ellen soon he will break the match and so if thee
will make me a happy man--

i will said i with uncommon fervour thee shall marry the maiden
and i will straightway see what i can do for thee verily what is
wealth but the dross of the earth unless used to purchase happiness
for those that are worthy

at these words jonathan leaped for joy seized my hand and kissed it
vowed i was his dear old dad for all i was only his uncle and ran
from the room--doubtless to impart the happy tidings to his mistress




 chapter iv


containing little or nothing save apostrophes exhortations and
quarrels



how happy was i to think i had conferred happiness upon another how
agreeable my sensations how delightful the approbation of my own
heart how much i rejoiced that my soul had at last found a habitation
equal to its wishes an abode of peace a dwelling of content if i am
zachariah longstraw said i to myself i will show myself worthy of
the name i will spend his money in the great cause of philanthropy i
will make the afflicted smile i will win the blessings of the poor
i will do more good than even zachariah longstraw himself yea of a
surety i will devote myself to a life of virtue

while i was making these virtuous resolutions the faithful abel snipe
came to my bedside and told me there were divers suffering creatures
widows with nine small children widowers with fourteen sick old
women and starving old men in great need of relief and so affecting
was the picture he drew of their griefs that the tears rolled from my
eyes and i bade him if there was any money he could honestly lay his
hands on carry comfort to them all

verily said he i have just collected the quarter's rent of the
house in market-street and it will be enough and more

relieve the poor afflicted creatures then and hark thee abel
snipe does thee consider me a rich man if so let me know where i
can find twenty thousand dollars to set up the young man jonathan in
business and marry him to the maiden ellen wild

alas said abel snipe of a verity the young man is in a hurry and
alas for of a verity if thee takes away at this time such a great
sum from thee possessions thee will cut off the right hand of thee
charity

and thereupon the benevolent creature after showing me which it was
easy to do that with the mere revenue of the sum demanded if kept
in our own hands we could carry smiles and rejoicing into at least a
hundred families every year exhorted me not to forget that i was the
friend of the afflicted nor to faint in the good work of philanthropy
jonathan was a very young man he said--only twenty-five--happy in
his youth happy in his affections happy in the certain prospect
he enjoyed of sooner or later arriving at the fullest felicity
why should he not then consent like us to forego for a while his
selfish desires contribute his portion to the wants of the poor
and by labouring a few years in their cause approve himself worthy
of fortune how much better that he should endure a fancied ill than
that a hundred afflicted families should be given up to actual want he
contended that the young man's request was untimely and selfish and
that i would only harden his heart while breaking a thousand others
if i granted it in short he said so many things and painted so many
affecting pictures of the miseries of my fellow-creatures and the
beauties of charity that my mind was quite changed on the subject and
i perceived it was my duty to resist the young man's wishes

this change on the morrow being the first day that i was able to sit
up i explained to jonathan exhorting him with a feeling enthusiasm
to tear all narrow selfish feelings from his heart and embark with
me like a virtuous youth in the great enterprise of philanthropy
he fell into a passion told me my philanthropy was a fudge and abel
snipe a rogue and hypocrite vowed i had a greater regard for knaves
and paupers than for my own flesh and blood and was flinging away my
money only to encourage vice and beggary it was in vain i sought to
pacify the indignant youth an evil spirit seized upon him he did
nothing for three days but scold reproach and complain he abused
the faithful abel to his face calling him a fox viper cormorant
harpy and i know not what beside all which abel endured with patience
and resignation for he was of a meek and humble spirit nay not
content with this he proceeded on the third day to greater lengths
and did very intemperately fall upon the said abel snipe tweaking
him by the nose and ears until the poor man yelled with pain--and
even endeavoured to kick him out of the house after which being
censured for the same and i siding with abel as justice demanded in
the controversy his resentment grew to such a pitch that he left the
house declaring he would live with me no longer but leave me to ruin
myself at my leisure

this was an occurrence that caused me much pain for verily i had an
exceeding great love for the young man and i perceived that he was
treating me with ingratitude i was however greatly comforted by the
increased zeal and affection of the ever-faithful abel who coming to
me with tears in his eyes declared that he could not bear the thought
of being a cause of dissension between me and my nephew and therefore
besought me that i would discard him from my presence when i could
again live happily with my jonathan

i resisted while duly appreciating the good man's friendship and
fortunately there needed no such sacrifice on my part for on the
eleventh day jonathan returned of his own accord and confessing his
folly and entreating abel's forgiveness as well as mine was restored
again to favour his return itself was grateful to my feelings but
the reader may judge how great was my rapture when jonathan avowed
a change in his sentiments on the subject of philanthropy and
declared that the spirit at last moved him to think of his suffering
fellow-creatures he entreated to be conducted to the abodes of
affliction and there the conversion was completed he became a changed
man and in a few days was almost as zealous an alms-giver as myself i
took him to my arms and said--

now jonathan thee is a man in whom i no longer fear the seductions
of the flesh thee shall marry the maid ellen and be set up in
business

nay said jonathan not so i am yet but as a youth in years and
the time sufficeth for all things let not the whirl of business and
the joy of the honey-moon disturb the virtue that is yet young and
frail in my bosom of a verity ellen wild will wait till the fall and
if she don't and my heart should be broken verily i shall then be
better enabled to sympathize with the wretched

such was the lofty though new-born virtue of my jonathan

but of that as well as our works of benevolence i shall speak in the
following chapters




 chapter v


which is short and moral and can therefore be skipped


i have already said that the mere presence of the philanthropic
feeling now infused into my spirit filled me with happiness even
while i lay upon my back aching with wounds and bruises it may be
inferred therefore that my soul was ecstasy itself when restored at
last to health and strength i stalked into the air dispensing charity
with both hands

of a verity it was--at least for a time and i will say that
during the first month of my new existence i experienced a thousand
agreeable sensations such as had never occurred to me in my whole life
before and here let me observe that if what i have to add shall
show that there are offsets of inconvenience and tribulation even
to the satisfaction of the benevolent i do not design to throw any
discredit on the virtue of benevolence itself which i truly regard
as one of the divinest of endowments angelic in its nature and
blessed in its effects when practised with discretion and amiable
if not lovely even in its folly i believe indeed that if heaven
looks with peculiar indulgence on the errors of any man it is in
the case of him who has the softest judgment for the errors and the
readiest reparation for the miseries of his fellows what i wish to
be understood is that man is an unthankful animal and of such rare
inconsistency of temper that he seldom foregoes an opportunity to
punish the virtue which he so loudly applauds

i was now a philanthropist and i will say which i think i may do
without shame the merit being less attributable to me than to that
worthy deceased personage whose body i inhabited that a truer
purer or more zealous one never walked the earth i should fill a
book as big as a family bible were i to record all the good things
i did or attempted while a tenant in zachariah longstraw's body
all my feelings and desires were swallowed up in one great passion
of philanthropy universal benevolence was the maxim i engraved upon
my heart i had no thought but to relieve the distresses meliorate
the condition and advance the happiness of my species my generosity
extended equally to individuals and communities i toiled alike in the
service of the beggar and the million putting bread into the mouth of
the one and infusing moral principles into the breasts of the others
in a word i was as i have called myself already a philanthropist
and if my virtue was somewhat excessive in degree it proceeded from
the sincerest promptings of spirit




 chapter vi


an inconvenience of being in another man's body when called upon to
give evidence as to one's own exit


it may be supposed that the treatment i for of a verity i myself
came in for some share of the hard usage that killed the true
zachariah had received from the base and brutal john smith must
have cooled my regard for him if it did not affect my feelings of
philanthropy in general i confess that i did regard that personage
with sentiments of disgust and indignation but nevertheless i was
very loath to appear against him when summoned as i was soon after
leaving my sick-bed to give evidence on the charges preferred against
him these were two in number and afforded matter for as many separate
endictments in the first--and verily i was startled when i heard
it--john smith was charged with the murder of abram skinner in the
second with an assault with intent to kill upon myself--that is my
second self zachariah longstraw--and also with robbery

now if the reader will reflect a moment upon the relation in which i
stood to these charges he will allow that the necessity of testifying
on them reduced me to a quandary in the first place i knew very well
that mr john smith rogue and assassin as he was had not killed
abram skinner but that i had finished that unhappy gentleman myself
and i knew also in the second that my admitting this fact would
without doing mr john smith any good produce a decided inconvenience
to myself--not that there was any fear i should be arraigned for
murder but because nobody would believe me i remembered how my
telling the truth to my friend john darling the deputy attorney in
regard to my first transformation had caused him to believe me mad
and i foresaw that telling the truth on the present occasion would
reduce me to the same predicament and perhaps the friends mad-house
into the bargain

there was the same difficulty in relation to the second charge
accompanied by another still greater for whereas john smith was
there only accused of assault with intent to kill he had in reality
committed a murder which if i had affirmed as i must have done had i
affirmed any thing at all i should have been a living contradiction of
my own testimony and thus considered madder than ever

the truth is i was in a dilemma out of which the truth could not
extract me and the more i thought the matter over the greater was
my embarrassment a feeling of integrity within me for zachariah
longstraw was a man of conscience urged me to speak the truth while
common sense showed me how much worse than useless truth would be in
such an extraordinary conjuncture

i received a visit from the prosecuting attorney who very naturally
expected a clear and satisfactory account of mr john smith's doings on
the night of the murder and the difficulty i had with him that is
the attorney gave me a foretaste of what i was to expect when summoned
into the witness's box in court i remember that the gentleman after
plying me with many questions to which he got that sort of replies
invidiously termed quaker answers flew into a huff and threatened
me with what would be the consequence if i should prove backward in
court and sure enough his prediction was verified for not giving a
straight answer to any one question when the trial came on i received
divers reprimands from the court and was finally committed for a
contempt to prison where i lay two or three days until called into
court again to give evidence on the second endictment mr john smith
having been found not guilty on the first this was owing in part
i presume to the testimony of several surgeons who deposed that
there were no marks of violence upon abram skinner's body although
the evidence of the watchman who had seen him alive through the
window and afterward found john smith burying his dead body in the
same hole with myself went rather hard with him i say the acquittal
was perhaps owing in part to the testimony of the surgeons though
much of it might be attributed to the marvellous humanity that reigns
in the criminal courts of the city of brotherly love to the great
benefit and encouragement of that proscribed and injured class of men
namely--murderers

i made little better work of the second attempt at witnessing but
as i have matters of much greater importance to demand my attention
and the reader can easily infer what i did and what i did not affirm
i must beg to despatch the second trial by relating that i was packed
off a second time to prison for contempt but that the evidence of the
watchman and my late wounds and bruises were esteemed sufficient
to secure the prisoner's conviction and accordingly john smith was
convicted and accommodated with lodgings in the penitentiary for the
fourth time

my own incarceration was of no long duration my contumacy as it
was called was considered extraordinary but it was generally
thought to be owing to a mistaken humanity and a perverted quixotic
conscientiousness such as are common enough among persons of the
persuasion i then belonged to this and perhaps the circumstance that
i was yet in feeble health for the trial as i said took place soon
after i left my bed caused me to be treated with lenity and in a few
days i was liberated

all this i beg the reader to understand happened before the
reconciliation with my nephew jonathan and of course before i had
well begun my career of philanthropy of that career of some of my
deeds of goodness and of the consequences they produced i shall now
speak




 chapter vii


the sorrows of a philanthropist


my benevolence was of a two-fold character being both theoretic and
practical in the latter sense is to be regarded the relief which i
granted with my own hands to such suffering persons as i could lay them
on and there was no way in which i did not personally relieve some one
wretch or other by the former i understand a thousand schemes which
i devised and framed to enlist the sympathies of communities and so
relieve the afflicted in a mass besides a thousand others which were
designed to bestow upon the poor and vicious that virtuous knowledge
and those virtuous principles which are better than alms of gold and
silver i instituted some half a dozen charitable societies to supply
fuel clothing food and employment to the suffering poor as well as
others to exhort them to economy industry prudence fortitude and
so forth i formed societies even among themselves classing divers
isolated creatures into bands who wrought in common and disposed of
their wares either in a shop kept for the purpose or at fairs i
established schools to keep the children of the poor out of mischief
and one in particular i supported solely from my own that is to say
zachariah longstraw's pocket

i bestowed much of my regards upon the poor wretches in prison doing
all that i was permitted to effect a reformation in their habits and
feelings and i took uncommon pains to scatter light and sentiments of
a civilized character among the worthy representatives of the green
island who make up so large a portion of our suffering population

and let it not be supposed that i neglected that other class of poor
creatures called negroes whom although allowed the name and most
of the privileges of freemen their white brethren refuse to take to
their bosoms merely because they have black faces woolly heads and
an ill savour of body for myself verily if they were not comely in
my sight nor agreeable to my nostrils i said heaven hath made them
so and although my nephew jonathan insisted that heaven had done the
same thing with other animals and that upon my principles men should
be as affectionate with pigs and badgers as they were with cats and
lap-dogs i perceived that they were my brethern and that it became me
to conquer the prejudices lying only in my eyes and nostrils i girded
my loins to the work and verily i prevailed over the weakness of the
old adam of a verity i was the african's friend

but oh the wickedness of the world and the ingratitude thereof the
heart of man is even as the soil of the earth which the more it is
stirred up by cultivation the more barren and worthless it becomes it
is as the fields of the ancient dominion where if a man soweth barley
and corn he shall reap a harvest of jamestown weed poke-berries and
scrub pines it is as the bulldog that one feedeth with beef and other
wholesome viands who the moment he has done his dinner snaps for
his dessert at the feeder's heel it is as the tender flowers which
in the winter-time a man taketh from the cold to warm by night
in his chamber and which smother him with foul air before morning
verily it was my lot to find even as my nephew jonathan had once
foolishly contended that even philanthropy is not secure from the
sting of unthankfulness--that benevolence is in one sense the great
parent of ingratitude--since it begets it for a period of full seven
months for so long did i remain in zachariah's body after recoving my
health i laboured to do good to my fellows and verily i laboured
with might and main yet had i toiled with the same energy to injure
and oppress i almost doubt whether i should have been rewarded with
more manifold outpourings of wrath and fury verily as i said before
the world is a wicked world and i begin to doubt whether man can make
it better

one of the first mishaps that befell me was of the following nature
stepping one morning into the mayor's office which was a favourite
haunt with me seeing that misery doth there greatly abound i fell
upon a man whom the magistrate was about to commit to jail for being
drunk and beating his wife and children he being unable to pay the
fine imposed upon him and to find surety for his future good behaviour

the spirit stirred within me as i beheld the contrite looks of the
culprit and i said to myself--while he lies in jail his poor wife
and his infants may perish with hunger i paid the fine and though
the mayor did very broadly hint to me that a little punishment would do
the man good and his wife too seeing that he was a barbarous fellow
i offered myself for his security and thus sent him back to his
rejoicing family i said to myself--this very night will i witness
the happiness i have created i went accordingly to the man's house
where i found the wicked fellow raving with drink and beating his
wife as before his children screaming with terror and the neighbours
crying out for a constable i did but say a word of reprehension to
him when the brutish ingrate leaving his rib fell foul of myself
mauling me cruelly and i believe he would have beaten me to death had
i not been rescued by the timely appearance of a constable thee sees
the end of thy humanity said the mayor when i entered his office
the next morning that my black eye and bruised visage might testify
against the ungrateful man thee will not object to my committing the
fellow now

nay said i it is drunkenness that has made the poor man mad
therefore lock him up in prison until his madness hath departed

i will said the mayor and thee will have the goodness to pay over
to the clerk the hundred dollars in which thee bound thyself that the
rascal should keep the peace

verily said i it is not just i should pay the money for the
beating was upon my own body

truly said the mayor and so it was and therefore it is the harder
that thee should have to pay it but pay it thee must the man having
broken the peace as much in beating thee as if it had been any other
citizen of the commonwealth

and so much satisfaction i had for befriending the sot the charity
which did more harm than good even to the man's poor family since it
exposed them a second time to his fury costing me without counting
the fine paid on the first day a sore beating and one hundred dollars

my next misadventure was the being cheated in a very aggravated way by
a poor man to whom i loaned money without exacting bond or voucher
the same being loaned to re-establish him in a gainful business which
had been interrupted by an unfortunate accident for having prospered
in his business and i requiring that he should now repay the money
that i might devote it to the service of others he very impudently
averred that he had never had any thing of me except advice and a good
word of recommendation here and there swore that he never paid away or
received a cent without giving or taking a receipt defied me to prove
my claim and concluded his baseness by threatening to kick me out of
his workshop

these instances of ingratitude were followed by others of a still
deeper die and so numerous that i can mention only a few of them

walking one day to that infant school which i had established to
keep children out of mischief while their hard-working parents were
at their daily labours i perceived the urchins standing at the door
pelting the passers-by with mud reproving them for this misconduct
the graceless vagabonds did speedily turn their battery upon myself
and not content to plaster and bespatter me with mud-balls from head
to foot they fell upon me and being very numerous did actually roll
me about in a gutter where was a deep slough so that i had nearly
perished with suffocation being sorely bruised into the bargain to
crown all having expelled from my school the ringleaders in this
marvellous outbreaking of precocious ingratitude i was visited by
their parents all of them abusing me for my tyrannical usage of their
children although of a truth the tyranny was all on the side of the
juveniles and impudently demanding that i should pay them for their
boys time at the rate of twenty-five cents a week each for as many
weeks as i had had them at school of a surety some people are very
unreasonable

it was also my misfortune to offend divers tailors and shopkeepers
by benevolently taking part in the efforts of their poor unfortunate
needle-women to obtain better wages and one day in the streets these
angry men did hustle me and tear a tail from my coat but i consoled
myself for this violence by thinking of the gratitude of the poor
creatures i was defending when making my way the following evening
to their place of assembly i was set upon by the whole crew for that
i did hint that as their difficulties did chiefly proceed from their
numbers there being more hands at the business of sewing than were
required they would greatly benefit themselves and the community
too by going two thirds of them at least into service there being
ever a great want of domestics in our respectable families i say i
did but hint this reasonable and undeniable truth together with a
friendly remark upon the exposed state of their morals when there
arose such a storm among them as was never perhaps witnessed by any
other human being hear the old hunks said one he wants to make
niggur servants of us us that is freeborn american girls--yes
ladies said another and he is insinivating we are no better nor we
should be--turn the old rip out said a third and turn him out
cried the other three hundred and fifty there present of a verity
they did assail me with both tongue and nail testifying such vigour of
spirit and strength of arm that were i a philanthropist now which
i fortunately am not and were i moved to consult their interests as
before i should endeavour to form them into a regiment of soldiers
not doubting that they would at any moment prevail over twice their
numbers of male fighting men of a verity i say they did violently
pull me about thrusting me at last from the apartment and their
ingratitude was a sore wound to my spirit




 chapter viii


the same subject continued


another evil that befell me about the same time was equally
afflicting a negro-man that had fled from bondage in a neighbouring
state being sharply hunted and about to be captured by the person
that called him his property i carried him to my house and there
concealed him for three days and mights until his master had departed
for said i of a surety slavery is a bitter pill and one that
cures neither the rheumatism nor the ague and therefore why should
my brother pompey be compelled to swallow it my brother pompey
having eaten drunk and slept at my expense for the three days
mentioned disappeared on the morning of the fourth before daylight
carrying with him twenty-seven pounds of silver in spoons teapots
and other vessels the three watches belonging to myself my nephew
and abel snipe as well as jonathan's best coat and trousers verily
i was confounded at the fellow's ingratitude and the loss of my
valuables all of which however though broken up it was my good
fortune to recover together with the three watches the thief himself
being taken was clapped into jail for a while and then surrendered
to his master and carried back to bondage and this stirring up the
choler of the free africans in town they did naught but cry out upon
me as the author of his misfortune surrounding my house with a mob
and proceeding to the length of even burning it down at least the
house taking fire and manifestly by the act of an incendiary it was
charged by my friends upon these raging foolish people though i was
never able to prove it upon any one in particular as my good fortune
would have it abel snipe had taken out a policy of ensurance so that
i recovered the money from the company but not without going to law
the company averring that my humanity rendered me careless

i caused another dwelling to be built and in building it received
another strong and inconvenient proof not merely of man's ingratitude
but of his natural hostility to the charity which benefits his
neighbours i bought my marble out of the prison in order to encourage
industry among the prisoners and thus lighten the load of taxation on
the community at large this being known the marble-cutters fell into
wrath denounced me as the friend of villany and the enemy of honest
industry and being joined by the shoemakers who had put me down in
their character-book as a patron to none but prison-workmen and by
divers other mechanics that had some grudge of the same kind they
seized upon me as i stood surveying my rising mansion and bedaubed
me from head to foot with thick whitewash painting in great black
letters on the broad of my back the following words namely--the
rogue's friend which caused me after i had escaped from their hands
to be hooted at by boys and men along the street and to be bitten by a
great cur-dog that was amazed at my appearance

another misfortune still more distressing befell me one day as i
walked among the western suburbs seeking whom i might relieve i
espied a company of men surrounding a ring made with stakes and ropes
in which two wretched creatures were stripping off their garments with
the intention to do battle upon one another with their fists these
were gentlemen of the fancy as it is called though imagination can
paint nothing of a more grossly animal and brutish character afar
from all that is fanciful than that very class that calls itself of
the fancy i was shocked that the poor creatures should in their
ignorance agree to maul and beat one another for the amusement of
a mob and i was concerned that a mob containing so many rational
beings should be willing to harry on two such silly fellows to harm
each other for their pastime i stepped among them therefore and
addressed them exhorting them to peace and harmony and this producing
but little effect on them i upbraided them with breaking the laws
both human and divine and assured them i would go hunt up the police
to prevent the mischief they meditated alas how ungratefully they
used me there was a man at a distance who was heating a great pot of
tar to pay the bottom of a canal-boat and just a moment before a
carter had stopped to look on the affray leaving on the roadside his
cart on which among other articles of domestic furniture was an old
feather-bed lying on the top of all the devil had surely brought
these things upon the ground that his sinful children the gentlemen
of the fancy might be at no loss how to testify their hatred of
humanity the very combatants themselves were the first to seize me
and cry out tar and feather the old bother'em douse down the bed
and dab the pot off the fire and daub him well they cried all the
while that their wretched companions drowning the cries i made for
assistance with savage yells of rage and merriment covered me from
head to foot with the nasty pitch and then tearing the bed to pieces
emptied its contents over my reeking body then having feathered me
all over and so transformed me that i looked more like an ostrich than
a human being they tied me to a post where i was forced to remain
looking upon the fight that immediately ensued between the champions a
horrid sight it was but i was so devoured with shame and indignation
that i should have cared little had they dashed each other's brains
out so much i endured for exhorting men to live together in peace and
amity

the very beasts seemed to conspire to treat me with ingratitude
my first effort in their cause was an attempt i made one day on
the tow-path near the water-works to protect a poor broken-down
barge-horse which the driver was cruelly beating my interference
cost me a dip in the basin the man who was both savage and strong
pitching me in headlong and what i deemed still more provoking a
kick from the horse who let fly at me with his heels merely because
mine as they were tripped into the air came in contact with his
hind-quarters so that i was both lamed and half drowned for my charity

in the same way i was scratched half to death and much more savagely
than i had been before by the needle-women by a cat that i took out
of a dog's mouth--without counting upon a nip that i had from the cur
also and to end this small catalogue of animal ingratitude i may
say that within a fortnight after i was served in the same way by a
rat that i strove to liberate from the fangs of my own gray tabby for
while tabby was clawing at my fingers the rat took me by the thumb
and between them i was near perishing with lockjaw the weather being
uncommonly hot and the time midsummer

there were a thousand other mischances of a like nature which befell
me but which i have not leisure to describe nor even to enumerate
some few of them however i think proper to record but to save
space i will clap them into a short list along with those already
mentioned where they may be examined at a glance and where in that
glance the reader may perceive what are sometimes the rewards of
philanthropy

 i beaten by a drunkard whom i had taken out of
 prison and bailed to keep the peace

 ii mulcted out of surety-money because
 my gentleman broke the peace by beating me

 iii driven and almost kicked out of a man's
 workshop because i asked payment of a loan
 made without bond or voucher

 iv my nose pulled by a merchant to whom i
 had out of charity to the latter who was
 unfortunate recommended a customer who
 swindled him

 v rolled in the mud by the boys of my own
 charity-school whom i had exhorted not to daub
 the passers-by

 vi abused by their parents for not paying them
 cents per week for the time i had the boys
 at school

 vii hustled by tailors slop-shopkeepers and
 others for taking part with the needle-women
 in a strike

 viii scolded scratched and tumbled down
 stairs by the needle-women for advising them
 to go into domestic service and take care of
 their morals

 ix robbed by a fugitive slave whom i had
 concealed three days and nights in my house
 from his master

 x house burnt down by the free blacks or so
 it was suspected for putting the thief as
 aforesaid into jail so that his master got him

 xi whitewashed and libelled on my own back by
 the stonecutters for buying wrought marble out
 of the prison

 xii tarred and feathered by a gang of the
 fancy whom i exhorted at the ring to peace and
 amity

 xiii scalded at my own house which i had
 converted at a season of suffering into a
 gratis soup-house and with my own soup by a
 beggar because there was too little meat and
 too much salt in it

 xiv soused in the canal by a boat-driver for
 rebuking his cruelty to an old barge-horse

 xv kicked by the horse for taking his part

 xvi scratched by a cat for taking her out of
 a dog's mouth item bitten by the dog

 xvii bitten by a rat which i rescued from a
 cat item scratched by the cat

 xviii gored by a cow for helping her calf out
 of the mire item the calf splashed me all
 over with mud

 xix beaten about the ears with a half-skinned
 eel by a fishwoman whom i reproved for
 skinning it alive


such were some of the unhappy circumstances that rewarded a seven
months life of philanthropy but there were others to follow still
more discouraging and afflicting




chapter ix


containing a difficulty


it is a common belief among those who are more religious than wise
that a man never catches a cold going to church of a wet sunday or
being baptized in midwinter i am myself of opinion the belief of
such good people to the contrary notwithstanding that many devout
persons by wading to church in the slush or washing out their sins
in snow-water have gone to heaven much sooner than they expected in
the same way and on the same principle of distrusting all miraculous
interposition of heaven in cases where human reason is sufficient
for our protection i have my doubts in the truth of another maxim
of great acceptation in the world--namely that a man never grows
poor by giving i believe indeed that the charity of a discreet and
truly conscientious man never injures his fortune but may in many
instances actually tend to its increase since the love of benevolence
may stimulate him to new labours of acquisition that he may have the
greater means of doing good but i am also of opinion and i think it
may be demonstrated by a good accountant that a man who has a revenue
of a thousand a year and bestows fifteen hundred in charity will in
due course of time find himself as poor as his pensioners when a man
hath a goose with golden eggs whatever he may do with the eggs he
should take great care of the goose

the reader may infer from these remarks that my philanthropy was as
little profitable to my pocket as it proved to my person and such
indeed was the truth i am of opinion i should myself in a very few
years have consumed the whole estate of zachariah longstraw ample as
it was in works of charity how much faster it went with my nephew and
my friend abel to assist me may be imagined my nephew became a very
dragon of charity and dispensed my money upon such objects of pity as
he could find for he soon began to practise the profession upon what
abel called his own hook with a zeal little short of fury so that
to supply his demands i was sometimes obliged even to stint myself
had abel snipe been equally profuse there is no saying how soon i
might have found myself at the end of my estate but abel snipe was a
jewel his charity was great but his conscientiousness was greater he
had ever a watchful eye to my good and his solicitude to husband and
improve my means kept his benevolence within the bounds of discretion

but notwithstanding all his care abel perceived that our philanthropy
was beginning to eat holes into my possessions and coming to me one
day with a long face he assured me that unless some means were
devised to increase my income we should soon find ourselves driven to
resort to the capital

verily and of a truth said i not a whit frighted at this
communication and why should that chill us in the good work abel
snipe of a surety all that i possess is it not the property of the
poor

verily said abel verily and yea but if we betake us to the
capital verily it will happen that sooner or later it shall be
consumed and nothing left to us wherewithal to befriend the afflicted
i say to thee zachariah thy wealth is as thou sayest the property
of the poor and it becomes thee as a true and faithful servant
thereof to see that it be not wasted but on the contrary husbanded
with care and foresight and put out to profit so that the single
talent may become two and peradventure three whereby the poor as
aforesaid shall be twice and it may be thrice benefited

thou speakest the words of sense and seriousness said i struck by
the new view of the case but how shall this happy object be effected
what shall we do abel snipe to make the one talent three and thereby
increase our means of doing good

thee nephew jonathan said abel snipe with a look of devout joy is
now a changed man a man of seriousness and virtue a scorner of vain
things and a giver of alms--a man whom we can trust i say to thee
zachariah thee shall establish thee nephew in a gainful business and
he shall make money thee shall give him what is thee property for
his capital remaining theeself but as a sleeping partner and thus
it shall happen that thee capital shall be turned over three times a
year producing on each occasion dividends three times as great as
now accrue from thy investments and thus zachariah and verily it
is pleasant to think upon where thee now has a thousand dollars of
revenue thee shall then have nine and where thee now relieves nine
afflicted persons thee shall there-upon relieve nine times nine which
is eighty-one

i need not assure the reader that this proposition of abel's fastened
mightily upon my imagination and that i was eager to embrace it and
jonathan coming in at the moment i repeated the conversation to him
assuring him that if he thought himself able with abel's assistance
to undertake such a business he should have my money to begin upon
instanter and marry the maiden ellen into the bargain

nay verily said jonathan i will not marry and i will not do
this thing whereof thee speaks uncle zachariah thee may think me
light of mind thus to speak of ellen wild who is much lighter but
of a surety i find the spirit moves me to regard her as one not to be
regarded any longer in the matter of the money-making i say let abel
snipe be thy merchant or whatsoever it may be thee has determined on
for abel snipe is a good business man and he knows how to make money
he shall have my advice and assistance as far as may be in my power
but truly my thoughts now run in the paths of the unfortunate and
thither let my footsteps follow also

to this proposal the faithful abel with tears in his eyes for he
was moved that jonathan should express such confidence in him at
last demurred averring that it would be better and more seemly
for jonathan himself to undertake the affair he abel snipe giving
help and counsel according to his humble ability jonathan objected
as before and again declared that abel and abel alone was as he
expressed it the man for my money in short the two young men
now the best friends in the world contested the matter each arguing
so warmly in favour of the other that it was plain the thing could
never be determined without my casting vote which i seeing that
jonathan was positive and bent upon a life of virtue gave in abel's
favour and it was resolved accordingly that abel should be made the
money-maker




 chapter x


in what manner mr zachariah longstraw determined to improve his
fortune


and now the question occurring to me i demanded into what kind of
business we should enter

that said jonathan is a question more easily made than answered
seeing that there are so many ways of making money in this wicked
world that an honest man can scarce tell which to choose among them
and then proceeded with great gravity to indicate divers callings
which he pronounced the most gainful in the world and all or any of
which he thought abel could easily turn his hand to

the first he advised was quackery--the making and vending of nostrums
to cure all manner of diseases including corns and the toothache
which was a business that had the merit of requiring no previous study
or education a tinker or cobbler being just as fit to follow it as
a man that had read paracelsus and which besides as was evident
from the speed with which its professors in general stepped from the
kitchen-pot to the carriage was the quickest way of making a fortune
that could be imagined i should have thought the young man was joking
for he had that vice in him to the last had it not been for the
fervour with which he pointed out the advantages of the vocation a
great recommendation he averred was that it required no capital
beyond a few hundred dollars to be laid out in bottles and logwood
or some other colouring material pump-water he said was cheap and
as for the other sovereign ingredient it was furnished by the buyer
himself yes said jonathan faith is furnished by the buyer who
pays us for the privilege of swallowing it we sell men their own
conceits bottled up with green red and brown water and thereby we
make them their own doctors who then can say the calling of the quack
is not honest--nay even philanthropic he is a public benefactor--a
friend even of physicians for he frees them from the painful necessity
of killing by making men their own executioners

and thus he went on until i cut him short by averring that the whole
business was little better than wholesale cheating and murder he then
recommended we should make abel a tailor solemnly declaring that
next to quackery tailoring which was a quackery of another sort was
the most profitable trade that could be followed the mere gain from
cabbaging considering that an ingenious tailor got at least one inch
of cloth out of every armhole without counting the nails cribbed from
other parts of a coat being immense and his profits seeing that he
lost nothing by a bad customer that he did not charge to a good one as
certain and immutable as the laws of the medes and persians

in short my nephew jonathan was in the mood for expatiating on the
merits of all money-making vocations in which i should follow him
were i not urged by the exigencies arising from limited time and space
to adhere to my story he made divers recommendations none of which i
thought of weight and upon abel who had heard him with gravity and
attention i was at last forced to call for advice and assistance it
was his opinion and he advised accordingly that all the money i could
raise should be thrown into the stock-market where being applied to
purchase and sale in the usual way he had no doubt it could be made
to yield a revenue of at least twenty per cent and perhaps twice as
much and this proposal strange as it may seem to the reader after
the experience abram skinner had given me in such matters i did after
sundry doubts and hesitations finally agree to

verily said i this is a gainful business friend abel but of a
surety neither honest nor humane seeing that it is practised at the
expense of the ignorant and often the needy

verily no said abel snipe with fervour it shall be at the
expense of the rich and niggardly--the man that is a miser and
uncharitable--the broker and the gambler--the bull and the bear our
dealings shall not be with the poor and ignorant man that dabbleth
in stocks but him will we charitably pluck from the grasp of the
covetous and thus protect while drawing from the covetous man those
alms of benevolence which he would never himself apply to the use of
the afflicted

verily said i pleased with the idea if we can make the covetous
man charitable it will be a good thing and if we can protect the
foolish ignorant person from his grasp it will be still better but
of a surety abel snipe this business will be as gambling

yea and verily said abel snipe it is as gambling when a gambler
follows it but in the hands of an honest man it is an honest
profession is not money bagged up in stocks and other investments as
merchandise and as merchandise shall it not be lawfully bought and
sold

and moreover said jonathan with equal earnestness if it be no
better than cheating and swindling this same buying and selling are
we not embarking in it out of charity verily uncle zachariah in
such a case as this the end sanctifies the means behold what is the
crying evil arising from money that is chartered in stocks whether it
be in banks rail-roads loans or otherwise this is money that is
not taxed for charitable purposes it is money appropriated solely to
the purposes of gain why is it that a private man should be taxed to
support the poor and a bank that has greater facilities for making
money be not taxed for the purpose at all verily uncle zachariah
we will do what the commonwealth should be doing we will impose a tax
upon the gains of chartered money and distribute the proceeds among
the needy

to make short work of the matter i will not pursue our debate further
but merely state that i was soon brought to consider abel snipe's
scheme the best honestest and most philanthropic in the world and
to agree that he should open an office as a stock-broker turning a
penny or two in that way while making much more by buying and selling
on his own account to this i was brought in a great measure by
the representations and arguments of jonathan among which i esteem
as still worthy of consideration that which stands above expressed
in his own words i am still of opinion that a tax and a round one
should be imposed upon the profits of all banks and other money-making
corporations the same to be specifically appropriated to hospitals
and other charitable foundations and perhaps also to public schools
in this way evil might be made productive of good and our avarice
rendered the parent of benevolence and knowledge of a verity my
philanthropy is not yet got out of me

the aforementioned arrangement was made at an early period of my new
existence that is to say at the close of spring and the faithful
abel soon began to render a good account of his stewardship by handing
me over divers handsome sums of money the profits of his speculations
which jonathan and myself disbursed with rival enthusiasm the
experiment was continued in a prosperous manner until the month of
september when there happened a catastrophe not less unexpected than
calamitous




 chapter xi


in which a catastrophe begins


the various mischances and afflictions as narrated in the preceding
chapter which rewarded my virtue had begun to affect my mind with
sundry pangs of melancholy and misgiving i perceived that the world
was ungrateful and i had my doubts whether it was a whit the better
for my goodness these doubts and this persuasion were confirmed by
the experience of each succeeding day and by the month of september
as aforesaid i found myself becoming just as miserable a man as i
had ever been before and perhaps more so being pierced not merely
with the ingratitude of those i had befriended but convinced that the
unworthiness of man was a thing man was determined to persevere in

it was at the moment of my greatest distress that the catastrophe
alluded to before happened and this was nothing less than the
sudden bankruptcy of abel snipe whereby i was reduced in a moment
from affluence to destitution and what made the calamity still more
painful was a conviction forced upon me by my own reflections as
well as the representations of others that the failure could not have
happened without a fraudulent design on the part of the fiduciary
it is true this worthy gentleman was the first to inform me of his
mishap which he did with tears in his eyes and with divers outbreaks
of self-accusation and despair he declared that his imprudence had
ruined me his benefactor and implored me his benefactor to knock
him on the head with a poker i had begun to embrace in my agitation
but how he had effected such a catastrophe i could not bring him
clearly to explain the only answers i could get from him were
speculation speculation--bad speculation--ruined my benefactor
might as well have murdered thee and so on and having given vent to
some dozen or more of such frantic interjections he ran out of the
house

enter jonathan the very next moment the sight of him renewed my grief
he poor youth was ruined as well as myself yet not wholly for
as good luck would have it i had a week or two before after long
cogitation on the subject resolved to marry him to the maid ellen
wild and so secure his happiness more certainly than it appeared
to me it could be secured by a life of philanthropy to effect this
desirable purpose i bestowed upon him the only property which i had
not thought fit to put into abel snipe's hands being the new house i
was then building promising also to add a sum of money as soon as it
could be conveniently withdrawn from the concern he received the gift
and the promise with much joy and gratitude but betrayed surprising
indifference on the score of matrimony saying that he was in no great
hurry and in fact giving me to understand that there was a difference
between him and the maiden

jonathan said i as soon as i saw him thee is a ruined young man
abel has broken

all to smash said jonathan i know all about it horrible pickle
we're in but i say uncle if thee can borrow twenty thousand dollars
we can save friend abel yet

does thee say so said i is it true

verily said jonathan i have looked over the demands and twenty
thousand dollars by nine o'clock to-morrow will make all straight but
where will thee get twenty thousand dollars

where said i fairly dancing for joy it was but two days since
that thy friend ebenezer wild did offer me exactly the sum of twenty
thousand dollars for the new house as it stood not knowing i had
conveyed it to thee until i told him the same as a reason why i could
not take such a handsome offer

well said jonathan opening his eyes what then

surely said i if he would give twenty thousand then he will give
twenty thousand now and so jonathan--

and so said jonathan thee wants me to sell the house does thee
and give thee back the money uncle zachariah thee should be a little
more reasonable thee must remember that the house is mine and as
it seems to be all i am ever to get why uncle thee must excuse me
but--i have no notion of parting with it

if jonathan had picked up the poker and served me the turn abel snipe
had so piteously entreated me to serve him--that is knocked me on the
head i could not have been more shocked and horror-struck than i was
by these words

what jonathan said i does thee refuse to save me from ruin--me
who have been a father to thee and given thee all that thou hast

no said jonathan coolly i am not so bad as that but as this
house is all i have i can't think of running too much risk with it
suppose thee borrows that twenty thousand dollars that ebenezer wild
has so handy he is thy friend as well as mine or suppose thee tries
some of thy other friends thee has often loaned to them and not often
borrowed sure thee has many friends who can spare money better than i
can

oh thou ungrateful young man said i

don't go to call me hard names said the perfidious and unfeeling
youth for if thee comes to that uncle zachariah i can tell thee
thee is the ungrateful man--though not a young one haven't i been
as a son to thee for eighteen long years haven't i humoured all thy
foolish old notions even to the point of giving alms talking about
virtue and philanthropy and so on haven't i given up ellen wild to
please thee and hasn't thee after all my pains choused me out of
the portion i had a right to expect of thee except a poor beggarly
unfinished house only worth twenty thousand dollars yes thee
has uncle zachariah thee can't deny it don't thee talk to me of
ingratitude

thou art a viper said i

if i am said jonathan in a huff i won't stay to be trodden on

and with that the heartless creature tossing up his head like an
emperor stalked out of the house leaving me petrified by the enormity
of his baseness




 chapter xii


in which the catastrophe is continued


i was indeed so shocked so overwhelmed by ingratitude coming
from such a quarter that it was some time before i could recover
myself sufficiently to think of the steps necessary to be taken for
my preservation i remembered however that he even he my thrice
unfeeling nephew had recommended me to borrow of my friends what would
be enough to retrieve my affairs from ruin i ran from the house not
doubting that i could easily raise the sum fifty paces distant was my
new house--that is jonathan's my old friend ebenezer the father of
the maid ellen was standing before it looking up to the carpenters
who were nailing the shingles on the roof

ebenezer said i thee is my friend--does thee know i am on the
brink of ruin

very sorry said ebenezer--all the town-talk looked for nothing
better perhaps thee will sell the house--pho i forgot thee gave it
to jonathan

ebenezer wild said i if thee is my friend lend me that twenty
thousand dollars it will save me from ruin

really mr longstraw said ebenezer wild who was no quaker though
his father had been before him i am surprised a reasonable man
should make such a request i have told you twenty times you would ruin
yourself by your cursed philanthropy--can't consent to be ruined with
you pity you mr longstraw--awfully swindled wonder you could trust
such a knave as abel snipe--sorry to hear matters look so black for
jonathan--thought better of him--quite unnatural to be defrauded by
one's own flesh and blood

what ebenezer meant by his concluding remarks i did not at that
moment understand but i comprehended them well enough when i had run
to five or six other friends rich men like him all of whom treated
my request to borrow with as little respect while all wound up their
commonplace condolings by assuring me first that abel snipe had
swindled me and secondly that there was much reason to believe my
nephew jonathan had done the same thing

reader this is a very wicked world we live in my philanthropy did not
make me as philanthropy often does selfish with my friends i felt as
much pleasure in obliging one who happened to be in a difficulty with
a loan of any sum within my reach as in relieving actual distress of
twelve different persons whom i now sought in my dilemma i had in this
manner at different times obliged no less than eleven of not one
of whom could i now borrow a dollar every man pitied my misfortune
every one inveighed with becoming severity against the villany of those
by whom i was ruined but every one was astonished that a reasonable
man like me should expect another reasonable man to part with his
money in short it was evident that my friends loved borrowing better
than lending and i left the door of the twelfth with the agreeable
conviction on my spirit that human nature was of the nature of a
stone i being the only man of the thousand million in the world that
had actually a heart in my bosom

this consideration was racking enough but it made a small part of my
distress every man had charged my friend honest abel snipe with
having swindled me as ebenezer wild had charged before and every one
in like manner swore that my nephew jonathan had borne a part in the
nefarious transaction this seemed to me incredible enough but when
i remembered jonathan's late behaviour his unexpected defection his
hard unfeeling nay his treacherous selfishness i felt prepared to
believe almost any wickedness that might be said of him

i ran to abel's office resolved to sift the affair to the bottom the
work was already done to my hands i found the office full of people
some of whom were officers of the police who had seized upon books and
papers and awful to be said the body of abel snipe and all raging
with vociferation and confusion except the latter worthy who looked
as if astounded out of his senses it's a clear case of swindling
cried a dozen voices as i entered a design to defraud--fraud from
beginning to end flagrant scandalous scoundrelly swindling-- nay
worse than swindling--it is a conspiracy jonathan has confessed
it--been going on this three months--jonathan has confessed it

jonathan had confessed it confessed what why confessed as every one
gave me to understand and confessed in the hands of justice for it
seems he had been arrested that he and abel snipe had entered into a
conspiracy to defraud me of my property which had been carried on from
the moment that the latter was established in business and was now
completed by a long-designed bankruptcy

let the reader imagine my feelings at this disclosure of ingratitude
and villany so monstrous

my best friend--a man whom i had wrested from the extremity of poverty
and disgrace and my only relative--a youth whom i had adopted and
reared as my son who was my heir at law and the living partner as
i may say in all my possessions--had leagued together feloniously to
deprive me of what i never denied them the privilege to share--to rob
to fleece to reduce me to beggary

words cannot paint my grief i crept away from the scene of confusion
ashamed of my manhood ashamed even of my philanthropy i reached the
door of my house it was just dusk a poor man standing at the door
implored my charity for a miserable creature as he called himself go
to the devil said i

you are zachariah longstraw said another man tapping me on the
shoulder i am said i supposing he was a beggar like the other
and you may go to the devil too

very much obliged to you said the man but you're my prisoner and
so come along if you please and with that he took me by the arm and
began to march me down the street




 chapter xiii


the dănouement of the drama


why i was arrested and at whose instance i knew not i was too
downcast and spirit-broken to inquire i had doubtless divers small
debts due to persons with whom i was accustomed to deal and it seemed
to me natural enough as all men were ungrateful rascals that all
such persons now that i was known to be penniless should fall upon
me without shame or mercy demanding their dues i say i thought such
a consummation was natural enough and i asked no questions of my
captor i let my head drop upon my bosom and without resisting or
remonstrating and looking neither to the right nor the left suffered
him to conduct me whither he would

our progress was rapid our journey short in a few moments i found
myself led into a house and ushered into a lighted apartment

i looked up to see into what alderman's hands i had fallen the reader
may judge of my surprise amounting almost to consternation when i
beheld myself in an elegant saloon brilliantly lighted and surrounded
by a dozen or more gayly-dressed people of both sexes among whom was
my friend ebenezer wild and two or three others whose countenances
seemed familiar but whom in my surprise and confusion i did not
immediately recognise

a maiden beautiful as the morning and smiling as if her little heart
was dancing out of her eyes ran from the throng and seized me by the
hands crying--

now uncle zachariah thee shall pay me what thee owes me or be
turned over to some other creditor

i looked upon her in astonishment and began to fancy i was in a dream

what said my friend ebenezer don't you know my little ellen and
thereupon he added other expressions but what they were i retain no
remembrance of my wits being utterly amazed and confounded

to make my confusion still greater the door suddenly opened and in
rushed my nephew jonathan dressed like a dandy of the first water
in a blue cloth coat with shining buttons white trousers and satin
waistcoat and exclaiming bravo and victoria as if a very demon
of joy and exultation possessed him as soon as he beheld me he ran
forward snatched one of my hands from the maiden and dropping on his
knees cried with a comical look of contrition--

forgive me all my sins uncle zachariah and i'll behave better for
the future

oh thou ungrateful wretch said i how canst thou look me in the
face having ruined me

don't say so cried ellen wild you don't know how jonathan has
saved you

the deuse he don't said jonathan jumping up why then we've got
the play all wrong i say uncle don't look so solemn and wrathful
you are no more ruined than i am and you are out of the clutches of
the harpy

haven't i been swindled said i

unutterably said jonathan but as the swindler has been swindled
also there's no great harm done uncle zachariah a'n't you satisfied
abel snipe is a rascal

i am said i but what shall i say of thee

that i have broken the spell the villain cast over your senses said
jonathan and so saved you from the ruin your confidence invited him
to attempt uncle zachariah you think i am as bad as abel now listen
to my story i knew that abel snipe was a rogue and hypocrite but
could not make you believe it i saw that he was daily fleecing you
of sums of money under pretence of giving to the poor that he was
artfully goading and inflaming your benevolence into a passion nay
into a monomania for uncle everybody said you were mad for his
own base purposes and that sooner or later he would strip you of
every thing this i could not make you believe i resolved you should
see it i turned hypocrite myself and began to fleece you ten times
harder than abel the rogue was alarmed he perceived i was ousting him
from his employment--that i had greater facilities for cheating having
more of your affection than himself his alarm added to another
feeling which you shall hear all about brought him into the trap from
which cautiousness at first secured him i convinced him i was as great
a rogue as himself and he then agreed with me--yes uncle formally
agreed--to join in a plan to strip you of fortune we arranged the
whole scheme from beginning to end--the business the speculations the
bankruptcy abel was to play sir smash--his reputation could stand it
the sums received from you were to be handed over to me and accounted
for as lost in bad speculations to make which appear straight his
books were filled with fictitious sales and purchases very ingeniously
got up after the grand crash we were to make a division of the
plunder he being content honest man to receive one fourth of which
he considered himself secure enough as long as i had any value for
good name or fear of the penitentiary now you may wonder how such a
cautious rogue could be so easily gulled here stands the fairy said
jonathan pointing to the maid ellen who dazzled the eyes of his
wisdom yes uncle would you believe it the impudent the audacious
fellow had the vanity to think he had found favour in her eyes at a
time when i had lost favour in those of her father you must know we
had a coolness--that is father wild and i it was about you--that
confounded philanthropy--but we'll say nothing of that i used to
communicate with ellen by letter and abel was often my ganymede now
you must know ellen is a coquette--

fy jonathan said the damsel it was all that vicious abel's
presumption and folly because i was glad to see him and treated him
well just because he brought me letters--oh the monster i soon saw
what was running in his head

yes said jonathan ellen's a much smarter girl than people suppose
her

oh you great quaker bear said the maiden

well continued jonathan she boasted her conquest and then i saw
i had the ogre by the nose it was this put me upon turning swindler
i had a talk with father wild who approved my plan and ellen agreed
to cultivate abel's good opinion as far as a smile or two we affected
to quarrel i began to coquet with another abusing poor ellen to abel
as hard as i could until he was persuaded the breach between us was
incurable ellen gave him a smile--her papa became condescending in a
word the rascal thought nothing was wanting to make him the happiest
man in the world save the one full fourth of his patron's estate and
as much more as he could cheat me of here was the rock upon which abel
split and split he has he is now safe the moment matters came to
a crisis which was this afternoon i ran to a magistrate--my friend
jones there pointing to an elderly gentleman who had entered with
him and made confession of our roguery deposed the whole matter
accused myself and abel of conspiracy to defraud and so forth and so
forth and was admitted to the honourable privileges of evidence for
the commonwealth and allowed to walk about on bail while my rascally
colleague takes up his lodgings in prison there's the whole story i
have exposed snipe's rogueries and secured his conviction and what
is equally agreeable i have saved your property here uncle--you
called me a viper--i only wanted to make you believe i could be
ungrateful as well as others by-the-way that was a plan of father
wild's to have your friends refuse to assist you they were let into
the secret and i recommended you to apply to them here uncle you'll
see what a viper i am he continued a little impetuously here are
the deeds for the house here is a roll of bank-notes i cheated you
of to play the philanthropist you will be surprised at the amount
but i did spend some i confess for there are wretches who deserve
our charity and here and here and here you have the property out of
which abel and i conspired to cheat you--at least the chief part of
it the rest we will soon get possession of having laid the villain in
limbo here uncle zachariah take them and be as philanthropic as you
please we have no fear of you now your familiar is tied up take your
property and much good may it do you as for me i am content to take
ellen--that is if you have no objection

this was a turn of circumstances that confounded me more than ever
and verily i knew not whether i was standing on my head or feet i
stood staring jonathan in the face without saying a word until the
youth was seized with the idea that the surprise of the thing had
turned my wits at which being alarmed he took me again by the hand
and said with the tears in his eyes--

oh my dear uncle do consider it is nothing more than a joke and
that i never meant to offend thee

no said i thee did not therefore thee shall have it all and thee
shall marry the maiden

and with that being seized with uncommon generosity or perhaps not
well knowing what i did i put into his hands the conveyance of the
house the bank-bills and other papers which he had given me but a
moment before and turned to leave the house

stay uncle--i am just going to be married said he and stay
zachariah said a dozen others when some one suddenly calling
out let him go he is afraid of being turned out of meeting if he
witnesses the ceremony i was suffered to obey the impulses of the
spirit within me and walk out of the house which i did without
exactly knowing what i was doing

to tell the honest truth--as indeed i have been trying to do all
along--i was in a kind of maze and bewilderment of mind which the
first shock of ruin had produced and which jonathan's story rather
increased than diminished the effect of this was divided in my brain
with the impression of the various proofs of ingratitude and baseness
to which the day had given birth the latter however being greatly
preponderant of one feeling only i had entire consciousness and that
was a hearty disgust of philanthropy coupled with a sense of shame at
having been so basely cheated as i seemed to have been on all sides i
had been cheated out of my senses as the saying is and the only cure
for me was to be cheated into them again which was not an agreeable
reflection the whole affair being a reproach on my good sense

on the whole i felt very melancholy and lugubrious and began to
have my thoughts of leaving zachariah longstraw's body at the first
convenient opportunity the great difficulty was however to find a
tenement in which i might promise myself content the disappointment i
had experienced in my present adventure having filled me with doubts
as to the reality of any human happiness at least said i to myself
i will henceforth look before i leap i will cast mine eyes about me
i will gird up my loins and look abroad into the human family and
peradventure i shall find some man whose body is worth reanimating
yea verily i will next time be certain i am not putting my soul as
the pickpocket did his hand into a sack of fish-hooks

with this resolution on my mind i walked towards my house and was just
about to pass the door when an adventure befell me which knocked the
aforesaid resolution entirely on the head but before i relate it my
conscience impels me to make one remark which i beg the reader if he
be a man of fortune and blood to peruse without excusing himself on
the score of its dulness




 chapter xiv


a remark in which the author appears as a politician and abuses both
parties


there are other persons besides zachariah the philanthropist who
have experienced the ingratitude of the poor and truth to say if
we can believe the accounts of those who profess to have the best
means of judging there is more of it among that class of beings in
the united states than in any other christian land if it be so let
not the reader wonder at its existence it springs like a thousand
other evils of a worse because of a political complexion from that
constitution of society which notwithstanding its being in opposition
to all the interests of the land and the character of our institutions
is founded in and perpetuated by the folly of the richer classes it
lies not in the natural enmity supposed to exist between the rich
and the poor but in the unnatural hatred provoked in the bosoms of
the one by the offensive pride and arrogance of the other the poor
man in america feels himself in a political view as he really is
the equal of the millionaire but this very consciousness of equality
adds double bitterness to the sense of actual inferiority which the
richer and more fortunate usually do their best as far as manners
and deportment are concerned to keep alive why should the folly of
a feudal aristocracy prevail under the shadow of a purely democratic
government it is to the stupid pride the insensate effort at pomp and
ostentation the unconcealed contempt of labour the determination
manifested in a thousand ways and always as unfeelingly as absurdly
to keep the base mechanical aware of the gulf between him and his
betters--in a word to the puerile vanity and stolid pride of the
genteel and refined that we owe the exasperation of those classes in
whose hands lie the reins of power and who will use them for good or
bad purposes according as they are kept in a good or bad humour it
is to these things we trace besides the general demoralization ever
resulting from passions long encouraged besides the unwilling and
unthankful reception of benefits coming from the hands of the detested
all those political evils which demagoguism agrarianism mobocracism
and all other isms of a vulgar stamp have brought upon the land
there is pride in the poor as well as the rich the wise man and the
patriot will take care not to offend it

reader if thou art a rich man and despisest thy neighbour remember
that he has a thousand friends of his class where thou hast one of
thine and that he can beat thee at the elections if thou art a
gentleman remember that thy cobbler is another or thinks himself
so--which is all the same thing in america at all events remember
this--namely that the poor man will find no fault with thy wealth
if thou findest none with his poverty




 chapter xv


an uncommon adventure that befell the author


i said that just as i arrived at the door of my dwelling an adventure
befell me and truly it was such an extraordinary one as has happened
to no other individual in the land since the days of the unfortunate
william morgan as i passed towards the door a man whose countenance i
could not see for it was more than two hours after nightfall and who
seemed to have been lying in wait on the stoop suddenly started up
exclaiming in accents highly nasal and somewhat dolorous

well i guess if there's no offence there's no mistake i rather
estimate that you're mr zachariah longstraw

well friend and what is that thy business said i in no amiable
tone

well not above more than's partickilar said the stranger but
i've heern tell much on your goodness and i'm in rather a bit of the
darnedest pickle jist now with a sick wife and nine small children
the oldest only six years old that ever you heerd tell on and so i
rather estimated--

thee may estimate theeself to the devil said i how can the oldest
child of nine be only six years old

oh darn it said the fellow there was three on em twins but if
you'll jest step round to my wife she'll tell you all about it always
heern you was a great andyfist or what-d-ye-call-it

then thee has heard a great lie said i and so thee may go about
thee business for i'll give thee nothing

well now do tell said the man with a tone of surprise that
conveyed a part of the emotion to myself particularly when by way
of pointing his discourse with the broadest note of admiration he
suddenly clapped a foot to my heels and laid me sprawling on the broad
of my back

my astonishment and wrath may well be imagined but they were nothing
to the terror that beset me when recovering a little from the
stunning effects of the fall i opened my mouth to cry aloud and found
it instantly stuffed full of handkerchiefs or some such soft material
which the pretended beggar took that opportunity to gag me with the
next moment i felt myself whipped up from the ground and borne aloft
like a corpse on the shoulders of two men who trudged along at a
rapid pace and apparently with the greatest unconcern possible for
some of the people in the street hearing my groans which were the only
sounds i could make and demanding what was the matter were answered
by my cool captors oh nothing more than's partickilar--only a poor
mad gentleman that broke hospital guess he won't do it again raving
mad and hollers a gag out i say sam hold fast to his legs and
don't let him jump for i rather estimate if he gets loose he'll kill
some on these here people

the villain i had begun to hope my moans and struggles which i made
for the purpose as loud and furious as i could having no other way of
calling for help would cause some of the persons collected to arrest
the rogues and inquire into the matter a little more closely but no
sooner had the villain expressed his fears of the mischief i might do
than all inquiries ceased and a horrible scraping and rattling of feet
told me that assistance and curiosity had scampered off together

in three minutes more i found myself clapped into a little covered
or rather boxed wagon such as is used by travelling tinmen and
held fast by one of the rogues while the other seized upon the reins
and whipping up a little nag that was geared to it we began to roll
through the streets at a round gait and with such a rattle of wheels
and patty-pans that there was little hope of making myself heard had
i possessed the voice even of an oyster-man my companion took this
opportunity to secure my wrists in a pair of wooden handcuffs and
to lock my feet in a sort of stocks secured against the side of the
wagon then overhauling the handkerchiefs and arranging them more to
his liking though not a whit more to mine he opened his mouth and
spoke saying

now uncle longlegs i estimate we'll be comfortable so keep easy
or if you will grunt just grunt in tune and see what sort of a
bass you'll make to old hundred

with that the rascal after pitching his voice so as to accommodate
mine as much as possible began to sing a song of which all that i
recollect is that it related the joys of a travelling tinman--tricks
rogueries and all--that it began somewhat in the following fashion--

 when i was a driving along down east
 i met old deacon dobbs on his beast
 the beast was fat and the man was thin--
 i'll cheat deacon dobbs says i to the skin--

that it was as long and soporific as a state constitution or a
governor's message--that it was actually sung to a psalm-tune or
something like it--and that during the eleventh twelfth thirteenth
and half of the fourteenth stanza the little wagon rolled leisurely
over a long and hollow-sounding bridge which i had no doubt was one of
the wooden rialtos of the schuylkill--having passed which the driver
whipped up and away we went at a speed of at least six miles an hour




 chapter xvi


in which sheppard lee takes a journey and discovers the secret object
of his captors


verily reader the thing was to me as an amazement and a marvel and
the wonder thereof filled my spirit with anguish and perturbation
but if i was dismayed at my seizure and abduction at my involuntary
journey prolonged through the space of a whole night how much greater
was my alarm to find it continued for five days and nights longer
during which i was never allowed to speak or breathe the fresh air
except when my captors halted to rest and eat which they did at
irregular intervals and always in solitary places among woods and
thickets it was in vain that i demanded by what authority they treated
me with such violence what purpose they had in view and whither
they were conducting me the rogues assured me they were very honest
fellows who made their living according to law and had no design to
harm me and as to what they designed doing with me that they said
i should know all in good time recommending me in the meanwhile
to take things patiently i studied their appearance well they were
common-looking personages with a vulgar shrewdness of visage and
would have been readily taken for yankee pedlers of the nutmeg and
side-saddle order--that is of the inferior branch of that adventurous
class--as indeed they were there was nothing of the cut-throat about
them whatever and i soon ceased to feel any apprehension of their
doing me a personal injury but what did the villains mean what was
their object in carrying me off what did they design doing with me
to these questions which i asked myself and them in vain i had on
the sixth day of my captivity an answer and verily it was one that
filled me with horror and astonishment oh the wickedness of man
the covetousness the depravity the audacity the enterprise and
originality thereof

during the first three days of my captivity my roguish captors had
taken great pains to conceal me from and to prevent any noises i might
make from being heard by any persons they met on the road on the
fourth day they relaxed somewhat from their severity on the fifth they
unbound my arms and on the sixth they even removed the gag from my
mouth assuring me however that it should be replaced if i attempted
any outcries and giving me moreover to understand that i was now
in a land where outcries would be of no service to me whatever and
indeed i had soon the most mournful proof that in this particular
they spoke nothing but the truth

the evening before i heard while passing by a farmhouse a great
sawing of fiddles and strumming of banjoes with a shuffling of feet
as of people engaged in a dance while a voice which i knew by its
undoubted congo tang could be none but a negro's sang in concert
with the fiddles--

 ole vaginnee nebber ti--ah
 kick'm up juba a leetle high--ah--

or something to that effect and while i was marvelling what could
make a negro in pennsylvania chant the praises of virginia having
rolled a little further on i heard far in the distance while our
little nag stopped to drink from a brook the sound of many voices
which i knew also were those of negroes they were labourers husking
corn in the light of the moon and singing as they laboured and
verily there was something uncommonly agreeable in the tones now
swelling now dying in the distance as many or fewer voices joined
in the song there was a pleasing wildness in the music but it was
to me still more enchanting as showing the light-heartedness of the
singers verily said i forgetting my woes in a sudden impulse of
philanthropy the negro that is free is a happy being--not doubting
that i was still in pennsylvania

but oh how grievously this conceit was dispersed on the following
morning i was roused out of sleep by the sound of voices and clanking
of chains and looking from the door of my prison which my conductors
had left open to give me air i spied just at the tail of the cart a
long train of negroes men women and children of whom some of the
males were chained together the children riding for the most part in
covered wagons while two white men on horseback armed with great
whips and pistols rode before and behind keeping the whole procession
in order

what said i filled with virtuous indignation and thrusting my head
from the cart so as to address the foremost rider what does thee
mean friend are these people slaves or freemen and why dost thou
conduct them thus in chains through the free state of pennsylvania

pennsylvanee cried the man with a stare i reckon we're fifty
miles south of mason's and dixon's and fast enough in old virginnee

virginia said i seized with dismay before i could add any thing
farther one of my captors jumping from the front of the cart where
he had been riding with the other clapped to the door of the box
swearing at me for an old fool who could not keep myself out of
mischief

hillo stranger i heard the horseman cry to my jailer what white
man's that you've got locked up thaw

oh darn it was the answer it's an old fellow of the north jist
as mad as the dickens

friend cried i from my prison seized with a sudden hope of escape
the man tells thee a fib if thee is an honest man and a lover of the
law i charge thee to give me help for these men are villains who
have dragged me from my home contrary to law and now have me fastened
up by the legs

i say strange-aw by hooky cried the horseman in very emphatic
tones addressing himself to my captor as i saw through a crack while
his companion rode up to his assistance what's the meaning of all
this he-aw what aw you doing toting a white man off in this style
like a wild baw

what a wild baw was i could not conveniently comprehend but i saw
that i had lighted on a friend who had the power to deliver me from
thraldom

my name said i is zachariah longstraw and i can reward thee for
thy trouble

you hear him said my jailer with all imaginable coolness well
now darn it if i must tell it is zachariah longstraw the famous
zachariah longstraw you understand and here he nodded and winked at
the questioner with great significancy but as it appeared all in
vain

never heard of the man in my life said my friend and i've followed
niggur-driving ever since i could hold a two-year-old bo pig

what cried my jailer never heard of zachariah longstraw the
famous abolitionist

abolitionist cried the two horsemen together and they cried it
with a yell that made my hair stand on end can't say ever heard the
name but reckon he's one of them aw new-yorkers and yankees what
sends cendiary things down he-aw i say strange-aw is it a true
right up-and-down no-mistake abolitionist

darn it i think you'd say so if you had ever read the papers

jist open the box then and if i don't take the scalp off him call me
a black man

you won't do no sitch thing meaning no offence said my jailer
didn't go to the expense to fetch him so far for nothing and don't
mean him for the virginnee market bound down to louisianee stranger
that's the best market for abolitionists seen a public advertisement
offering fifty thousand dollars for fellers not half so bad i rather
estimate we'll get full price for our venture

with that my jailers whipped up and succeeded in putting a proper
distance betwixt them and that ferocious person who had such a desire
to rob me of my scalp




 chapter xvii


containing other secrets but not so important


reader if thou art an abolitionist and verily i hope thou art
not thou wilt conceive the mingled wo and astonishment with which
i listened to these words of the chief kidnapper--whose christian
name by-the-way was joshua though as for his surname i must
confess i never heard it--and appreciate even to the cold creeping
of the flesh the terrible situation in which i was placed i was an
abolitionist--or at least my captors chose so to consider me and
they were now carrying me down south to sell me on speculation for
this they had kidnapped me for this they had fastened me up by the
legs like a wild baw for this--but it is vain to accumulate phrases
expressive of their villany and my distresses what mattered it to my
captors if after all i was no abolitionist for of a verity
though opposed in principle to the whole institution of slavery my
mind had been so fully occupied with other philanthropic considerations
that i had had no time to play the liberator--it was all one to my
captors the genius which could convert a hemlock-knot into a shoulder
of bacon a bundle of elder twigs into good havana cigars and bags of
carpet-rags into bologna sausages could be at no fault when the demand
was only to transform a peaceable follower of george fox into a roaring
lion of abolition i felt that they had got me into a quandary more
dreadful than any that had ever before afflicted my spirit i knew we
were already far south of mason's and dixon's

the moment my vile kidnappers slackened their speed a little having
ridden hard to escape the negro-drivers i called a parley in the
course of which two circumstances were brought to light which greatly
increased the afflictions of my spirit i began by remonstrating with
the villains upon the wickedness cruelty and injustice of their
proceedings to which joshua made answer that times was hard--that
a poor man was put to a hard shift to get a living--that for his
part he was an honest man who turned his hand to any honest matter--
that he knew what was lawful and what was not--that he was agin all
abolition which was anti-constitutional and clear for keeping the
peace betwixt the north and south--and twenty other things of a like
nature of which the most important was a declaration that the good
people of some parish or other in louisiana had offered a reward of
fifty thousand dollars for either of two individuals whose names i have
forgotten though they were very famous abolitionists and although
joshua to settle the matter at once showed me their names in the
advertisement which he had cut from a newspaper

friend said i i don't see that these foolish people have offered
any reward for me

well darn it i know it said joshua but i rather estimate they'll
give half price for you and that will pay us right smart for the
venture for you see what they want is an abolitionist and i rather
estimate they're not over and above partickilar as to who he may be
now i have heern tell of a heap of incendiary papers you sent down
south to free the niggurs--

i never did any such thing

oh well said joshua it's all one them there sugar-growing
fellers will think so and so it's all right and there's them runaway
niggurs you phil'delphy quakers are always hiding away from their
masters i rather estimate we'll make a good venture out of you

what said i will you sell my life for money

no said the vile joshua it's a mere trade in flesh and
blood--wouldn't take a man's life on no consideration

friend thee shall have money if thee will permit me to escape

well said joshua with an indifferent drawl i estimate not abel
snipe told me you was cleaned out as clear as a gourd-shell

abel snipe said i is thee a friend of that villain abel snipe

a sorter said joshua or rather sam is him and abel was friends
together at sing--

oh blast your jaw said sam speaking for almost the first time on
the whole journey for he had been until then uncommonly glum and
taciturn where's the difference where it was says abel snipe to
me says he if you want's an abolitionist there's my old friend
zachariah he's your true go and so d'ye see that's what made us
snap you for we was thinking of snapping another

oh the wretch the base ungrateful hypocritical wretch

come blast it said sam don't abuse a man's friends

fellow said i hast thou no human feeling in that breast of thine
wilt thou sell me to violent men and madmen who will wrongfully take
my life

think what thou doest hast thou no conscience thou art selling a
fellow-being hast thou no fear of death and judgment of the devil and
the world of torment

oh hold your gab said the ruffian as for selling fellow-critters
why that was once a reggelar business of mine for d'ye see i was
a body-snatcher and i reckon i was more skeared once snapping up a
dead body than ever i shall be lifting a live one you must know i
was snatching for the doctors over there in jarsey for d'ye see
i'm a jarseyman myself i reckon it was some fourteen months ago it
was summer what the devil-be-cursed the doctor wanted with a body in
summer i don't know but it was none on my business so we went me
and tim stokes and the doctor to an old burying-ground where they had
just earthed a youngster that the doctor said would suit him well
d'ye see when we came to the grave up jumps a blasted devil as big
as a cow or it might ha been a ghost and set up a cry so we takes
to our heels but the doctor said twas a man's cry and no ghost's
and so d'ye see blast it we was for going back again after having a
confab when what should we do but find a poor devil of a feller lying
dead by a hole under a beech-tree the doctor said he would do better
nor the other and so blast it d'ye see we nabbed him

of a surety said i eagerly it was the beech-tree at the
owl-roost and that was the body of poor sheppard lee

well they did call him summat of that like and they made a great
fuss about him in the papers but i'm hanged if i wasn't skeared after
that out of all body-snatching

friend said i can thee tell me what the doctor did with that body

why cut him up blast him and made a raw-head-and-bloody-bones of
him the doctor was so cussed partickilar he wouldn't let us even
knock the teeth out though that was no great loss for jarseymen
hasn't no great shakes in the tooth way

alas what an ending for poor sheppard lee his body subjected to
the knife of an anatomist his bones scraped boiled bleached hung
together on wires and set up in a museum while his spirit was
wandering about from body to body enduring more afflictions in each
than it had ever mourned even in that unlucky original dwelling it
was so glad to leave i am not of a sentimental turn and i cannot
say that as zachariah longstraw i felt any peculiar sorrow for the
woes of sheppard lee nevertheless i did not hear this account of the
brutal way in which his body had been stolen and anatomized without
some touch of indignation and grief which perhaps i should have
expressed had not there arisen before the brutal samuel had quite
finished his remarks on jerseymen's teeth an occasion to exercise
those feelings on my own immediate behalf

this was produced by the vile joshua who had then the reins telling
a brace of horsemen whom we met that he had the great abolitionist
the celebrated zachariah longstraw in his cart and was carrying him
to be lynched in louisiana a confession that threw the strangers into
transports of satisfaction one of them swearing he would accompany my
captors to the mississippi or to the end of the earth for the mere
purpose of seeing me get my deservings




 chapter xviii


in which the author approaches a climax in his adventures


and now arose a train of incidents by which i was taught three things
namely--first the manner in which my merchants designed giving a value
to their merchandise not inherent and intrinsic to it for of a truth
my abolition principles as i said before had never been carried to
the point of notoriety or even notice secondly the love with which
a southron regards those pious philanthropists who will have him good
and virtuous against his own will and thirdly the religious respect
for law and order which is so prominent a feature in the american
character

to make me valuable it was necessary i should be made famous and this
was easily accomplished in a land where men make up their opinions for
themselves according as they are instructed it was only necessary
to assure some half dozen or more independent sovereigns that i was
famous to ensure their making me so and this my kidnappers did they
told everybody they met that they had secured zachariah longstraw the
famous abolitionist the very life and soul of northern incendiarism
whom they were carrying to louisiana to be lynched according to law
and as the circumstance would of course get into every patriotic
newspaper along the way it was certain i should be made famous enough
before i got there and they thus enjoy the advantage of advertising
their commodity without paying a cent to the printer

it was astonishing and to none more than myself to witness the
suddenness with which i was exalted from obscurity to distinction and
the readiness with which every living soul upon being told my name
character and reputation remembered all about me and my misdeeds
yes cried one worthy personage shaking at me a fist minus two
fingers and a half i have heerd of him often enough he lives in
new-york and he sells sendary pictures packed up between the soles
of niggur shoes--yes cried another who had but one eye i have
read all about him he lives in boston keeps a niggur school and
prints sendary papers a hundred thousand at a time to set niggurs
insurrecting in short they remembered not only all that the unworthy
joshua told them to my disparagement but a thousand things that the
imagination of one suggested to the credulity of another it was in
vain that i endeavoured to say any thing in denial or defence ridicule
and revilement threats and execrations were my only answers it
was clear that by the time we reached the mississippi i should be
the most important personage in america and that if my value as an
article of merchandise was to be determined by the distinction i won on
the road my friends joshua and samuel would make their fortunes by
the speculation but it was not my fate to travel beyond the bounds of
the ancient dominion

it happened that on this day an election was held in the district
through which we were travelling to return a representative to
congress in lieu of one who had fought his way into the shoes of a
chargăš all the world--that is all the district--was therefore in
arms and men and boys americans and irishmen were making their way
to the polls as fast and comfortably as two-mile-an-hour hard-trotting
horses could carry them and thither also as it appeared or in that
direction we were ourselves bending our course as we advanced
therefore we found ourselves gliding into a current of human
bodies--honest republicans moving onward to the polls all of whom
were ready to add their approval to my claims or those the kidnappers
made for me to the honour of lynchdom the word was passed from one
to another that the yankee cart contained the famous abolitionist
zachariah longstraw they pressed around to look at and revile me to
discourse with the kidnappers on my demerits and to express their
delight that such a renowned member of the incendiary gang as they
called that class of conscientious people should at last be on the
road to justice

and thus i was rolled along attended by sundry groups which grew fast
into crowds consisting of persons who rejoiced over my capture and
painted to my ears in words uncommonly rough and ferocious the fate
that awaited me when arrived at my place of destination

that place as it chanced was nearer than i either expected or
desired as the crowd thickened the sounds of wrath and triumph
increased becoming more terrible to my auditories a new idea came
into the minds of the sovereigns a villain seven feet and a half
high mounted on a horse just half that altitude who had a great
knife-scar across his nose and cheek and a dozen similar seams on his
hands rode up to the cart and giving me a diabolical look cried out
whaw what aw the use of carrying the crittur so faw i say vawginnee
is the place for lynching atter all i say gentlemen and vawginians
i go for lynching right off-hand old vawginnee for evvaw

loud and terrible was the roar of voices with which the throng
testified their approbation of the barbarian's proposal it was agreed
i ought to be and should be lynched on the spot the kidnappers
appealed to the justice of virginians requesting them not to invade
the sacred rights of private property--they could not think of
giving up their prisoner for nothing they meant him solely for the
louisiana market but things were coming to a crisis and that my
conductors perceived they whipped up to escape the throng but in
vain the further they went the more they became involved in the
crowd having now arrived at the village where the favourite candidate
was stumping among his constituents and promising them worlds of
reform retrenchment and public virtue provided they would send him
to congress i could hear from my box my friend joshua having taken
care to lock me up at the first sign of danger as we entered the
village the distant cries of hampden jones for ever mingled with
those nearer ones of my persecutors lynch the abolitionist and the
loudly-expressed remonstrances of my friends against invasion of their
rights coupled with threats to have the law of any one who robbed them
of their property

but threats and appeals were alike wasted on the independent freemen
of that district joined by the voters and others already assembled at
the polls who at the cry of lynch the abolitionist had deserted
their orator to join in the nobler sport of lynching they increased
in wrath and enthusiasm and stopping the cart and breaking open my
prison-house they dragged me into the light of day one man calling
for a pistol another a knife a third a rope and a fourth a cord
of good dry wood and a coal of fire to burn the villain alive
such a horrible clamour never before afflicted my ears or soul i saw
that abolitionist or not it was all over with me and so saw honest
joshua and samuel whose only solace for this unlucky interruption to
their speculation was a call some one generously made to take up a
subscription for their benefit seeing that it was beneath the dignity
of the chivalry of virginia to cheat even a yankee of what was justly
his due




 chapter xix


containing a specimen of eloquence with some account of the dangers of
lynchdom


at this moment the orator and candidate of the day stalking up in
high dudgeon to find what superior attraction had robbed him of his
audience laid eyes upon me i thought i had seen him before and
verily i had he was that identical gentleman the master of the
fugitive slave whom i had concealed in my house in philadelphia and
then clapped into prison for robbing me whence his master recovered
him there was no mistaking the gentleman he was a young man of
twenty-six or seven six feet high and one foot wide long-limbed with
small feet and huge hands a great shock of indian-looking hair vast
solemn black eyes a mouth wide and square and a brow that might have
suited a patriarch it was so wide and lofty and wrinkled he was
evidently a man destined to shake the walls of the capitol and cause
stenographers to groan the tully shone in his eye the demosthenes
moved on his lip--there was genius even in the shape of his nose

i recollect the man said he with a voice that might have come from
the bowels of a double-bass it was so deep rolling and sonorous
he hid my boy pompey his name is longshanks he is a quaker a
philanthropist--an abolitionist

hampden jones for ever cried the delighted sovereigns we'll hang
him meaning me however and not the orator over the poll-window
and then vote for hampden jones the friend of the law the friend of
the constitution the friend of the south

stay friends said hampden jones and his voice stilled the tumult
i have a word to say on the subject of abolition

hampden jones for ever cried the republicans and hampden jones
stepped up on the head of a barrel and stretched forth his right arm
he stretched forth his left also and then clinching both fists and
pursing his brows together until the balls beneath them looked like
rolling grape-shot he said--

gentlemen--fellow-freemen of virginia the bulwarks of a nation's
liberties are the virtues of her children compared with these what is
wealth what is grandeur what even are power and glory these--riches
and greatness power and renown--are the possessions of the old world
yet what have they availed her look around that ancient hemisphere
and tell me where among its blood-stained battle-fields where
under its polluted palaces where in its haunts of the despot and the
slave you can find the love of liberty the love of law the love of
order the love of justice that give permanence to the institutions
they adorn and like the laurel crown of the cesars guard from
the thunderbolt the temples they bind in the wreath of honour look
for them in the old world but look in vain the mighty colossus of
christendom once vital with virtue lifts its decrepit bulk beyond
the verge of the atlantic a vast and mournful monument of decay
age and the shocks of the elements the wash of the tempest and the
lightning-stroke have ploughed its marble forehead with wrinkles
mosses hang from its brows and the dust of its own ruin--dust animated
only by insects and reptiles the offspring of corruption--moulders
over its buried feet the virtues that once distinguished--that almost
deified--the immortal colossus have fled from the old to find their
home in the new world i look for them only in the bosoms of americans

here the orator who had pronounced this sublime exordium with
prodigious earnestness and effect paused while the welkin rung with
the shouts of rapture its complimentary close was so well fitted to
inspire as for me i felt a doleful skepticism as to the justness of
the compliment having the very best reason to distrust that love of
liberty law order and justice which was about to consign me to
ropes and flames without asking the permission of a judge and jury
moreover i could not exactly see how mr hampden jones's remarks
on the old and new world had any thing to do with the subject of
abolition which he had risen to discuss and indeed this difficulty
seemed to have beset others as well as myself several crying out with
great enthusiasm let's have something on abolition and then to the
lynching while others exclaimed let's have the lynching first and
the speech afterward

abolition my fellow-citizens said the orator it is my intention
to address you on the subject of abolition but first let me apply
what i have already said i have said and i repeat that the love of
liberty of law of order of justice belongs peculiarly to the free
sons of america let me counsel let me advise let me entreat you to
have this noble truth in remembrance on this present occasion beware
lest in what you now intend to do you give occasion to the enemies of
freedom to doubt your virtue to suspect the reality of your love of
law order and justice to stigmatize you as friends only of riot and
outrage

these words filled me with joyful astonishment i began to believe
the youthful tully was about to interfere in my favour to rebuke
the violence of his adherents and so save them from the sin of
blood-guiltiness

so also thought the indignant sovereigns themselves and many
elevating their voices demanded furiously if he meant to protect the
bloody abolitionist

by no means said mr hampden jones with great emphasis what i
have to advise is that if we are to do execution upon the wretch
we shall proceed about it in an orderly and dignified way resolve
ourselves into a great and solemn tribunal and so adjudge him to death
with a regularity and decorum which shall excite the admiration and win
the approbation of the whole world

hampden jones for ever cried the sovereigns and so it appeared that
all the benefit i was to derive from his interference was only to be
despatched in an orderly manner




 chapter xx


in which sheppard lee reaches the darkest period of his existence


seeing this i became horribly frightened--indeed so much so that
i was incapable of observing properly what ensued i have a faint
recollection that mr hampden jones resumed his discourse and harangued
those who would listen on the subject he had promised to discuss and
i remember that his auditors echoed every tenth word with tremendous
shouts but what i remember better than all was a spectacle that soon
attracted my attention being nothing less than the apparition of
five or six stout negroes climbing up a tree hard by dragging a rope
after them and tying it round a branch all which they executed with
uncommon spirit and zeal shaking their fists at me all the time and
calling me a cussed bobolitionist

what was to become of me now had i entered the body of the most
generous and humane of men only to be hanged a cold sweat broke over
me my knees knocked together the men who held me held me faster my
judges the members of the great and solemn tribunal began to decide
upon my fate with the regularity and decorum advised by their orator
which were to win the approbation and admiration of the whole world--
that is to say by each man marching up to the orator's barrel where
stood a committee appointed to receive the votes pronouncing his name
and voting to hang the incendiary

all this while i believe i was endeavouring to say something in my
defence but i have not the slightest recollection of what it was
matters were coming--i may say had come--to a crisis and my life
hung upon a thread when suddenly a negro who had been among the
most active and zealous of the volunteers on the tree fell from a
high branch to the ground and besides breaking his own neck as i
understood by the cry that was set up crushed two or three white men
that stood below

this produced a great hubbub and those who had stationed themselves
about me as guards ran forward to see what mischief had been done as
they ran one way i betook me to my heels and ran another i rushed
into the nearest house but being instantly pursued and ousted i fled
into a garden from which i was as quickly chased by men and dogs the
first screaming and the second howling and barking so that the uproar
they made was inexpressible

fear lent me wings but i was surrounded and run whithersoever
i might i always found myself brought up by some party or other
presenting itself in front the exercise while it inflamed my own
terrors only exasperated the rage of my persecutors and i was
persuaded they would tear me to pieces the moment they caught me judge
of my feelings then when i found myself hemmed in on all sides in a
little field on the skirts of the village with a party close at my
elbow on which i had stumbled without seeing it until roused by its
cries

i looked up and saw that it consisted of about a dozen negroes who
were carrying the body of their companion the unlucky volunteer who
had broken his neck falling from the tree but which body they now
threw upon the ground and with loud screams of he-ah mossa john
and he-ah mossa dickey began to scamper after me with all their
might

there was but one resource left me and that let the reader determine
hereafter of how deplorable a character i made a successful dodge
followed by a dash right through the screaming africans who perhaps
hesitated to lay a rough hand on one of my colour and reaching
the body of their companion cried half to myself and half to the
insensible clay it is better to be a slave than a dead man and
the scourge whatever romantic persons may say to the contrary is
preferable at any time to the halter if thou art dead my sable
brother yield my spirit a refuge in thy useless body

that was the last i remember of the adventure for i had no sooner
uttered the words than i fell into a trance




book vi


containing a history and a moral


 chapter i

in which sheppard lee finds every thing black about him


when i opened my eyes i found that i was lying in a hovel very mean
of appearance yet with a certain neatness and cleanliness about it
that prevented it from looking squalid it is true that the floor
which was of planks was somewhat awry and dilapidated that the little
window which with the door furnished or was meant to furnish its
only light was rather bountifully bedecked with old hats and scraps
of brown paper and that the walls of ill-plastered logs displayed
divers gleaming chinks and vistas through them of the sunny prospects
without nevertheless the place did not look amiss for a poor man
and in my experience as a philanthropist i had seen hundreds much
more miserable

an old woman sat at the fireplace nodding over a stew the fumes of
which were both savoury and agreeable the old woman was however as
black as the outside of her stew-pan--in other words a negress and
this circumstance striking upon the chords of association i began to
remember what had lately befallen me a terrible suspicion flashed
into my mind had i not--but before i could ask myself the question
my hand which i had raised to scratch my head came into contact with
a mop of elastic wool such as never grew upon the scalp of a white
man i started up in bed and looked at my hands and arms they were of
the hue of ebony--or to speak more strictly of smoked mahogany i
saw a fragment of looking-glass hanging on the wall within my reach
i snatched it down and took a survey of my physiognomy miserable
me my face was as black as my arms--and indeed somewhat more
so--presenting a sable globe broken only by two red lips of immense
magnitude and a brace of eyes as white and as wide as plain china
saucers or peeled turnips

whaw dah cried the old woman roused by the noise i made whaw dat
you nigga tom what you doin dah lorra bless us if a nigga break a
neck can't a nigga hold-a still

alas and had my fate brought me to this grievous pass was there no
other situation in life sufficiently wretched but that i must take
up my lot in the body of a miserable negro slave how idle had been
all my past discontent how foolish the persuasion i had indulged
five different times that i was on each occasion the most unhappy
of men i had forgotten the state of the bondman the condition of
the expatriated african now i was at last to learn in reality
what it was to be the victim of fortune what to be the exemplar of
wretchedness the true repository of all the griefs that can afflict
a human being already i felt in imagination the blow of the
task-master on my back the fetter on my limb the iron in my soul and
when the old woman made a step towards me perhaps to discover why i
made no reply to her questions i was so prepossessed with the idea of
whips and lashes that i made a dodge under the bedclothes as if to
escape a thwack

golly matty is de nigga mad cried the jezebel i say you nigga
tom what you doin how you neck feel now

my neck thought i recollecting that it had been broken and
wondering in what way it had been mended i clapped my hands to it
it was very stiff and sore while i felt at it the old woman told me
some great doctor had twisted a great kink out of it but i bestowed
little notice on what she said my mind ran upon other matters i could
think of nothing but cowhides and cat-o-nine-tails that were to
welcome me to bondage

aunty said i--why i addressed the old lady thus i know not but i
have observed that negroes always address their seniors by the titles
of uncle and aunt and i suppose the instinct was on me--am i a
slave

what a fool nigga to ax a question said she what you gwying to be
den but old massa jodge's nigga-boy tom what you git up faw ha
--i was making an attempt to rise--

massa docta say you stay a-bed what you git up faw ha

i intend to run away said i and truly that was the notion then
uppermost in my mind and it is very likely i should have made a bolt
for the door that moment had i not discovered an uncommon weakness in
my lower limbs which prevented my getting out of bed

that very castigation of which i stood in such horror




 chapter ii


in which sheppard lee is introduced to his master


just at this moment to make my anguish more complete in stepped a
tall and dignified person bearing a huge walking-stick with which i
was so certain he would proceed to maul me that i made a second dive
under the bedclothes loudly beseeching him for mercy

to my surprise however instead of beating me he spoke to the old
woman whom he called aunt phoebe and who in return entitled him
massa jodge asked if i was not light-headed said that it was a
great pity i had so hard a time of it that i was very much hurt
that he would be sorry to lose me and so on and in fine expressed
what he said in accents so humane and gentle that i was encouraged
to steal a peep at him seeing which he sat down on a stool felt my
pulse and giving me quite a good-natured look asked me if i felt in
much pain

i was astonished that he should treat me thus if my master but
surveying him more intently i perceived there was little in his
appearance to justify any fears of cruelty he was an aged man with
a head of silver that gave him an uncommonly venerable air and
though his visage was grave it expressed a native good-humour and
amiableness my terrors fled before his soothing accents and benevolent
looks but being still confused i was unable to reply in proper terms
to his questions so that when he asked me as he soon did what i
meant by crying for mercy i made answer oh lord sir i was afraid
you was going to beat me at which he laughed and said my conscience
was growing tenderer than common adding that there was no doubt i
deserved a trouncing as did every other boy on his estate for a set
of greater scoundrels than his was not to be found in all virginia and
if they had their deserts they would get a round dozen apiece every
day

he then began to ask me particularly about my ailments and i judged
from his questions and certain occasional remarks which he let fall
that i had been lying insensible for several days that my neck had
been put out of place or dislocated and reduced again by some
practitioner of uncommon skill and here lest the reader should think
such a circumstance improbable i beg leave to say that i have lately
seen an account of a similar operation performed by an english surgeon
on the neck of a fox-hunting squire and as the story appeared in the
newspapers there can be no doubt of its truth

while the gentleman--my master--was thus asking me of my pains and
betraying an interest in my welfare that softened my heart towards him
there came into the hovel a young lady of a very sweet countenance
followed by two or three younger girls and a little boy all of whom
seemed glad to see me the little boy in particular shaking me by the
hand while his youthful sisters for all were my master's children
began to drag from a basket and display before my eyes the legs of
a roasted chicken a little tart a jelly and divers other dainty
viands which they had brought with them as they said for poor sick
tom and insisted upon seeing him eat on the spot as for the young
lady the eldest sister she smiled on them and on me for i was not
backward to accept and dispose of the savoury gifts but told me i
must not be imprudent nor eat too much and i would soon be well
what thought i does a slave ever eat too much

it is astonishing what a revolution was effected in my feelings by the
gentle deportment of my master and the kindly act of his children
i looked upon them and myself with entirely new eyes i felt a sort
of affection for them steal through my spirit and i wondered why i
had ever thought of them with fear i took a particular liking to the
little boy who by-the-by was a namesake of mine he being massa
tommy and i plain tom and i had an unaccountable longing come over me
to take him on my back and go galloping on all-fours over the grass at
the door i had no more thoughts of running away to avoid the dreadful
lash and the shame of bonds and my master and his children presently
leaving the hovel having first charged me to keep myself quiet and
easy i fell sound asleep and dreamed i lay a whole day on my back on
a clay-bank eating johnny-cake and fried bacon




 chapter iii


an old woman's cure for a disease extremely prevalent both in the
coloured and uncoloured creation


the next day i was visited again by my master and by other members of
his family whom i had not seen before and of whom i shall say nothing
now having occasion to mention them hereafter the children brought me
goodies as before and little tommy told me to make haste and get
well for there were none of the other boys--meaning negroes--who
knew how to gallop the cock-horse half so well as i in short i was
treated like a human being and fed like a king and began to grow
wondrous content with my situation the doctor also came and having
fingered about my neck for a while declared my case to be the most
marvellous one ever known and concluded by telling me i was well
enough to get up and that i might do so whenever i chose

now this was a matter of which i was as well satisfied as he could be
being quite certain i never was better in my life but i felt amazing
delight in lolling a-bed doing nothing except feeding on the good
things with which my master's children so liberally supplied me and
i believe had they left the matter to be decided by my own will i
should have been lying on that bed luxuriating in happy laziness to
this day it is certain i fabricated falsehoods without number for
the mere purpose of keeping my bed for whenever my master who came
to inquire about me at least once a day ventured to hint i was well
enough to get up if i would but choose to think so i felt myself
unaccountably impelled to declare with sighs and groans that i could
scarce move a limb and that i suffered endless pangs all which was
false for i was strong as a horse and without any pain whatever

well well my venerable master used to say i know you are cheating
me you rascal but that's the way with you all a negro will be a
negro and sure i have the laziest set of scoundrels on my estate
that ever ate up a good-natured master

unhappily for so i then thought it old aunt phoebe who had been
appointed to nurse me and who was very conscientious about her
master's interest in all cases where her own was not involved was
by no means so easily imposed upon as the old gentleman and on the
seventh day after i opened my eyes she dispelled a pleasing revery in
which i was indulging by bidding me arise and begone i began to plead
my pains can't play possum with me said she good-for-nothin
nigga not worth you cawn and not deigning to employ any other
argument she took a broomstick to me and fairly beat me out of the
hovel i thought it was very odd i should get my first beating of a
fellow-slave and i was somewhat incensed at the old woman for her
cruelty but by-and-by when i had taken a seat in the sunshine
snuffed the fresh autumn air and looked about me a little i fell into
a better humour with her and--if that were possible--with myself




 chapter iv


some account of ridgewood hill and the author's occupations


my master's lands lay on and near the potomac and his house was
built on a hill which bore his own name and gave name also to the
estate--that is ridgewood hill it overlooked that wide and beautiful
river being separated from it only by a lawn which in the centre was
hollow and ran down to the river in a ravine while its flanks or
extremities sloping but gently in their whole course suddenly fell
down to the shore in wooded bluffs that looked very bold and romantic
from the water in the hollow of the lawn was a little brook that
rose from a spring further up the hill and found its way to the river
through the ravine where it made many pretty little pools and cascades
among the bushes while a creek that was wide but shallow swept in
from the river above and went winding away among the hills behind

my master's house was ancient and i must say not in so good repair
as it might have been but there were so many beautiful trees about
it that one would not think of its defects the more especially as it
appeared only the more venerable for them it looked handsome enough
from the river and even from the negro-huts which were nearer the
creek it had an agreeable appearance particularly when the children
were playing together on the lawn which they did and sometimes white
and black together nearly all day long they were thus engaged in
their sports when aunt phoebe drove me from the hovel and i remember
how soon my indignation at the unceremonious ejection was pacified by
looking on the happy creatures thus enjoying themselves on the grass
while my master and his eldest daughter sat on the porch regarding
them with smiles

how greatly i had changed within a few short days instead of being
moved by the sight of juvenile independence and happiness to think of
my own bitter state of servitude i was filled with a foolish glee and
little tommy running up to me with shouts of joy down i dropped on my
hands and knees and taking him on my back began to trot and gallop
and rear and curvet over the lawn to the infinite gratification of
himself his little sisters and the children of my own colour all of
whom rewarded my efforts of horseship with screams of approbation now
the reader will be surprised to hear it but i tom the slave i never
remember to have heard myself called any thing but tom enjoyed this
foolish sport just as much as tommy the rider to whom i felt i think
some such feelings of affection--i know not how i got them but feel
them i did--as a father experiences while playing the courser to his
own child nay i was thrown into such good-humour and felt so content
with myself that when my master came to me and bade me take care
lest i should hurt myself by my exertions i told him in the fervour
of my heart i was doing very well and that i was as strong as ever i
had been which caused him to laugh and say i was growing marvellous
honest of a sudden

about this time the field-hands returned from their daily labour and
having despatched their evening meal they came the women and children
with them under the trees before the door with banjoes fiddles and
clacking-bones that is a sort of castanets made of the ribs of an
ox and began to sing and dance as was their custom always every fair
evening for my master greatly delighted as he said to see the poor
devils enjoy themselves in which the poor devils were ever ready to
oblige him they had no sooner begun the diversion than i was seized
with an unaccountable desire to join them which i did dancing with
all my might and singing and clapping my hands the merriest and
happiest of them all and this sort of amusement i may as well now
inform the reader we were in the habit of repeating so long as the
mildness of the weather permitted




 chapter v


in which the author further describes his situation and philosophizes
on the state of slavery


having thus shown myself to be perfectly cured of my broken neck it
followed that as a slave i was now compelled to go into the fields
and labour this i did at first very reluctantly but by-and-by i
discovered there was but little toil expected of me or indeed of
any other bondman for the overseer was a good-natured man like his
employer and lazy like ourselves i do not know how it may be with the
slaves on other estates but i must confess that so far as mere labour
went there was less done by and less looked for from my master's
hands than i have ever known to be the case with the white labourers
of new-jersey my master owned extensive tracts of land from which
although now greatly empoverished and almost exhausted he might have
drawn a princely revenue had he exacted of his slaves the degree of
labour always demanded of able-bodied hirelings in a free state but
such was not the custom of virginia or such at least was not the
custom of my master he was of a happy easy temper neglectful of his
interest and though often--nay i may say incessantly--grumbling at
the flagrant laziness of all who called him master and at the yearly
depreciation of his lands he was content enough if the gains of the
year counterbalanced the expenses and as but a slight degree of toil
was required to effect this happy object it was commonly rendered and
without repugnance on the part of his slaves his great consolation
and he was always pronouncing it to himself and to us was that his
hands were the greatest set of scoundrels in the world--which if
unutterable laziness be scoundrelism was true he was pretty generally
beloved by them which i suppose was because he was so good-natured
though many used to tell me they loved him because he was their
right-born master--that is put over them by birth and not by
purchase for he lived upon the land occupied by his fathers before
him and his slaves were the descendants of those who had served them

the reader who has seen with what horror and fear i began the life
of a slave may ask if after i found myself restored to health and
strength i sought no opportunity to give my master the slip and make
a bold push for freedom i did not a change had come over the spirit
of my dream i found myself for the first time in my life content
or very nearly so with my condition free from cares far removed
from disquiet and if not actually in love with my lot so far from
being dissatisfied that i had not the least desire to exchange it for
another

methinks i see the reader throw up his hands at this crying what
content with slavery i assure him now i ponder the matter over
that i am as much surprised as himself and that i consider my being
content with a state of bondage a very singular and unaccountable
circumstance nevertheless such was the fact i was no longer sheppard
lee zachariah longstraw nor anybody else except simply tom thomas
or tommy the slave i forgot that i once had been a freeman or to
speak more strictly i did not remember it the act of remembering
involving an effort of mind which it did not comport with my new habits
of laziness and indifference to make though perhaps i might have
done so had i chosen i had ceased to remember all my previous states
of existence i could not have been an african had i troubled myself
with thoughts of any thing but the present

perhaps this defect of memory will account for my being satisfied
with my new condition i had no recollection of the sweets of liberty
to compare and contrast with the disgusts of servitude perhaps my
mind was stupified--sunk beneath the ordinary level of the human
understanding and therefore incapable of realizing the evils of my
condition or perhaps after all considering the circumstances of my
lot with reference to those of my mind and nature such evils did not
in reality exist the reader may settle the difficulty for himself
which he can do when he has read a little more of my history in
the meanwhile the fact is true i was satisfied with my lot--i was
satisfied even with myself the first time i looked at my new face
i was shocked at what i considered its ugliness but having peeped at
it a dozen times or more my ideas began to alter and by-and-by i
thought it quite beautiful i used to look at myself in aunt phoebe's
glass by the hour and i well remember the satisfaction with which i
listened to the following rebuke of my vanity from her namely all
you pritty young niggurs with handsome faces is good for nothin not
wuth so much as you cawn in short i was something of a coxcomb and
nothing could equal the pride and happiness of my heart when of a
sabbath morning dressed in one of my master's old coats well brushed
up a bran-new rabbit-fur hat the gift of little tommy a ruffled
shirt and a white neckcloth with a pair of leather gloves swinging in
one hand and a peeled beechen wand by way of cane in the other i went
stalking over the fields to church in the little village near to which
my master resided

i say again i cannot account for my being so contented with bondage
it may be however that there is nothing necessarily adverse to
happiness in slavery itself unaccompanied by other evils and that
when the slave is ground by no oppression and goaded by no cruelty he
is not apt to repine or moralize upon his condition nor to seek for
those torments of sentiment which imagination associates with the idea
of slavery in the abstract

of one thing at least i can be very certain i never had so easy and
idle a time of it in my whole life my little master tommy had grown
very fond of me it is strange anybody should be fond of a slave but
it is true it appears i was what they call a mere field-hand that
is a labourer and quite unfit for domestic service nevertheless to
please tommy i was taken from the tobacco-fields and without being
appointed to any peculiar duty about the house was allowed to do what
i pleased provided i made myself sufficiently agreeable to young
master so i made him tops kites wind-mills corn-stalk fiddles and
little shingle ships with paper sails gave him a trot every now and
then on my back and had in return a due share of his oranges and
gingerbread

in this way my time passed along more agreeably than i can describe my
little master it is true used to fall into a passion and thump me now
and then but that i held to be prime fun particularly as--provided
i chose to blubber a little and pretend to be hurt--the little rogue
would relent and give me all the goodies he could beg borrow or
steal to make up with me as he called it

little tommy and his sisters four in number were the children of my
master by a second wife who had died two years before the oldest was
the young lady of whom i have already spoken and she was i believe
not above seventeen her name was isabella and she was uncommonly
handsome a young gentleman of the neighbourhood named andrews was
paying court to her indeed she had a great many admirers and there
was much company came to see her

my master's oldest son the only child left by his first wife lived
on a plantation beyond the creek being already married and having
children his name was george like his father and the slaves used
to distinguish them as massa cunnel jodge and massa maja jodge
for all the gentlemen in those parts were either colonels or majors
the major's seat being at so short a distance and the plantation he
cultivated a part of the colonel's great estate of ridgewood hill
we used to regard him as belonging still to our master's family and
the slaves on both plantations considered themselves as forming but
a single community nevertheless we of the south side had a sort
of contempt for those of the north for massa maja though a good
master was by no means so easy as his father he exacted more work
and when he rode into the fields on our side as he often did he used
to swear at us for lazy loons and declare he would some day or other
turn over a new leaf with us




 chapter vi

recollections of slavery


i must again repeat what i have said namely that i was contented with
my servile condition and that i was so far from looking back with
regret to my past life of freedom that i ceased at last to remember
it altogether i was troubled with no sense of degradation afflicted
with no consciousness of oppression and instead of looking upon my
master as a tyrant who had robbed me of my rights i regarded him as a
great and powerful friend whose protection and kindness i was bound to
requite with a loyal affection and with so much of the labour of my
hands as was necessary to my own subsistence what would have been my
feelings had my master been really a cruel and tyrannical man i will
not pretend to say but doubtless they would have been the opposite of
those i have confessed

the above remarks apply equally to my fellow-bondmen of whom there
were young and old and men and women together more than a hundred
on the two estates the exact number i never knew but i remember
there were above twenty able-bodied men or full hands as they were
called when all were mustered together there were many especially
among the women who were great grumblers but that was their nature
such a thing as serious discontent was i am persuaded entirely
unknown the labours of the plantation were light the indulgences
granted frequent and many there was scarce a slave on the estate
who if he laboured at all did not labour more for himself than his
master for all had their little lots or gardens the produce of which
was entirely their own and which they were free to sell to whomsoever
they listed and hard merchants they were sometimes even to my master
when he would buy of them as he often did i remember one day seeing
old aunt phoebe to whom he had sent to buy some chickens fall into a
passion and refuse to let the messenger have any because her master
had forgotten to send the money go tell old massa jodge said she
with great ire i no old fool to be cheated out of my money and i
don't vally his promise to pay not dat--snapping her fingers--he
owe me two ninepence already and the old gentleman was compelled to
send her the cash before she complied with his wishes

the truth is my master was in some respects a greater slave than
his bondmen and all the tyranny i ever witnessed on the estate was
exercised by them and at his expense for there was a general
conspiracy on the part of all to cheat him as far as was practicable
out of their services while they were all the time great sticklers
for their own rights and privileges he was as i have said before
universally beloved but his good-nature was abused a thousand times a
day

there existed no substantial causes for dissatisfaction and there was
therefore the best reason for content singing and dancing were more
practised than hard work in a word my master's slaves were an idle
worthless set but as happy as the day was long i may say the same
of myself i certainly was a very merry and joyous personage and my
companions who envied me for being the favourite of young master used
to call me giggling tom

but there is an end to the mirth of the slave as well as the joy of
the master a cloud at last came betwixt me and the sun a new thought
awoke in my bosom bringing with it a revolution of feeling which
extended to the breasts of all my companions it was but a small cause
to produce such great effects but an ounce of gunpowder may be made to
blow up an army and a drop of venom from the lip of a dog may cause
the destruction of a whole herd





 chapter vii


a scene on the banks of the potomac with the humours of an african
improvisatore


beneath the bluff and at the mouth of the creek which divided the two
plantations was a wharf or landing where our fishing-boats for we
had a good fishery hard by used to discharge their cargoes and where
also small shallops coming with supplies to the plantation put out
their freight here one day some seven or eight of the hands were
engaged removing a cargo of timber which had just been discharged by
a small vessel my master having bought it for the express purpose of
repairing the negro-houses and building a new one for a fellow that
was to be married for it seems his crops of corn and tobacco had
turned out unusually well and when that happened the slaves were the
first who received the benefit

hither i strolled having nothing better to do to take a position
on the side of the bluff where i could both bask in the sunshine
which was very agreeable for it was now the end of october though
fine weather and overlook the hands working--which was still more
agreeable for i had uncommon satisfaction to look at others labouring
while i myself was doing nothing

having selected a place to my liking i lay down on the warm clay
enjoying myself while the others intermitted their labour to abuse
me crying cuss lazy nigga gigglin tom dah why you no come down
work having employed themselves at which for a time they resumed
their labours and i turning over on my back and taking a twig that
grew nigh betwixt my teeth began to think to myself what an agreeable
thing it was to be a slave and have nothing to do

by-and-by hearing a great chattering and laughing among the men below
i looked down and beheld one of them diverting himself with a ludicrous
sport frequently practised by slaves to whom the lash is unknown he
was frisking and dodging about pretty much as aunt phoebe had done
when endeavouring to show me how the whip was handled in mississippi
and like her he rubbed his back now here now there now with the
right now with the left hand now ducking to the earth now jumping
into the air as though some lusty overseer were plying him whip in
hand with all his might the wonder of the thing was however that
governor for that was the fellow's name had in his hand a pamphlet
or sheet of printed paper the contents of which he was endeavouring
both to convey to his companions and to illustrate by those ridiculous
antics the contents of the paper were varied for varied also was the
representation

dah you go nigga he cried leaping as if from a blow slap on'e
leg hit right on'e shin yah yah yah--chah chah ch-ch-ch-ch-ah
chah chah massa--oh de dam overseeah dat de way he whip a nigga
then pausing a moment and turning a leaf of the book he fell to
leaping again crying--what dat dat you rose what you been
doin stealin sugah

 jump you nigga gal
 hab a hard massa
 so much you git for stealin sugah
 so much for lickin lassa

dem hard massa licky de gals

 ole vaginnee nebber ti-ah
 what e debbil's de use ob floggin like fia-ah

then came another scene yah yah yah--what dat massa maja kickin
de pawson i say whaw pawson jim you jim pawson he-ah you git'em
and then another--lorra-gorry what he-ah he-ah a nigga tied up in a
gum--

 oh de possum up de gum-tree
 coony in de hollow
 two white men whip a nigga
 how de nigga holla

jump nigga jump yah yah yah did you ebber see de debbil jump
nigga jump two white men whip a nigga gib a nigga fay-ah play

 when de white man comes to sticky sticky
 lorra-gorr he licky licky

gib a nigga fay-ah play

and so he went on describing and acting what he affected to read
to the infinite delight of his companions who ceasing their work
crowded round him to snatch a peep at the paper which i observed no
one got a good look at without jumping back immediately rubbing his
sides and launching into other antics in rivalry with governor




 chapter viii


the author descends among the slaves and suddenly becomes a man of
figure and an interpreter of new doctrines


i was moved with curiosity to know what they had laid their hands
on and i descended the bank to solve the mystery the paper had
passed from the hands of governor to those of a fellow named jim or
parson jim as we usually called him for he was fond of praying and
preaching which he had been allowed to do until detected in a piece
of roguery a few weeks before by master major who besides putting a
check on his clerical propensities for the future saluted him with
two or three kicks well laid on on the spot it was to this personage
and his punishment that governor alluded when he cried what he-ah
massa maja kickin de pawson as mentioned above although a great
rogue he was a prime favourite among the negroes who had a great
respect for his learning for he could read print and was even thought
to have some idea of writing this fellow was employed on the present
occasion at the ox-cart and as it is no part of a slave's system to
do the work of others he had been sitting apart singing a psalm while
the others were loading his cart and apart he had remained until
a call was made upon him to explain so much of the paper being the
printed portion as governor could not the paper it is here proper
to observe had been found by governor among the boards and scantling
though how it got there no one knew nor was it ever discovered it
was a pamphlet or magazine i know not which and the name i have
unfortunately forgotten containing besides a deal of strange matter
about slavery some half a dozen or more wood-cuts representing
negroes in chains under the lash exposed in the market for sale and
i know not what other situations and it was these which had afforded
the delighted governor so much matter for mimicry and merriment
there was one cut on the first page serving as a frontispiece it
represented a negro kneeling in chains and raising his fettered hands
in beseeching to a white man who was lashing him with a whip beneath
it was a legend which being or being deemed explanatory of the
picture and at the same time the initial sentence of the book parson
jim was essaying to read and thus it was he proceeded--

t-h-e the--dat's de f-a-t-e fat--de fat o-f ob--de
fat ob t-h-e de--de fat ob de s-l-a-v-e slave--de fat ob
de slave my gorry what's dat brederen i can't say as how i
misprehends dat

yah yah yah roared governor plain as de nose on you face de
fat ob de slave--what he mean heh why gorry you dumb nigga he
mean--massa dah is whippin de fat out ob de nigger dem hard massa
dat-ah heh whip de fat out

lorra-gorry massa don't like you whippy
don't sell gubbe'nor down a mississippi

let me read it said i

you read you nigga whar you larn to read cried my friends it
was a question i could not well answer for as i said before the
memory of my past existence had quite faded from my mind nevertheless
i had a feeling in me as if i could read and taking the book from
the parson i succeeded in deciphering the legend--the fate of the
slave

whaw dat said governor de chain and de cowhide does de book say
dat's de luck for nigga don't b'leeb m dem lie massa cunnel
nebber lick a nigga in m life

the reading of that little sentence seemed i know not why to have
cast a sudden damper on the spirits of all present until that moment
there had been much shouting laughing and mimicking of the pains of
men undergoing flagellation every picture had been examined commented
on and illustrated with glee it associated only the idea of some idle
vagabond or other winning his deserts a new face a new interpretation
was given to the matter by the words i had read the chain and scourge
appeared no longer as the punishment of an individual they were to be
regarded as the doom of the race the laughing and mimicry ceased and
i beheld around me nothing but blank faces it was manifest however
that the feeling was rather indignation than anxiety and that my
friends looked upon the ominous words as a libel upon their masters and
themselves

what for book say dat cried governor who from being the merriest
had now become the angriest of all who ebber hear of chain a nigga
escept nigga runaway or nigga gwyin down gin will to mississippi
who ebber hear of lash a nigga escept nigga sassbox nigga thief
nigga drunk nigga break hoss leg

brudders said parson jim this here is a thing what is portant to
hear on for blessed be gorra-matty there is white men what writes
books what is friends of the vaginnee niggur

all cuss bobbolitionist said governor with sovereign
contempt--don't b'leeb in m who says chain nigga in vaginnee who
says cowhide nigga in vaginnee de fate ob de slave cuss lie an't
i slave hah who chains gubbe'nor who licks gubbe'nor little book
big lie

and little book big lie echoed all in extreme wrath the parson
took things more coolly he rolled his eyes hitched up his collar
stroked his chin and suggesting the propriety of reading a little
farther proposed that brudder tom who had an uncommon good hidear
of that ar sort of print should hunt out the root of the matter and
lamented that it was a sort of print he could not well get along
with without his spectacles




 chapter ix


what it was the negroes had discovered among the scantling


thus called upon i made a second essay and succeeded though not
without pain in deciphering enough of the text to give me a notion of
the object for which the tract had been written it was entitled an
address to the owners of slaves and could not therefore be classed
among those incendiary publications which certain over-zealous
philanthropists are accused of sending among slaves themselves to
inflame them into insurrection and murder no such imputation could be
cast upon the writer his object was of a more humane and christian
character it was to convince the master he was a robber and villain
and by this pleasing mode of argument induce him to liberate his
bond-men the only ill consequence that might be produced was that the
book might provided it fell into their hands convince the bondmen
of the same thing but that was a result for which the writer was not
responsible--he addressed himself only to the master it began with the
following pithy questions and answers--or something very like them--
for i cannot pretend to recollect them to the letter

why scourgest thou this man and why dost thou hold him in bonds is
he a murderer a house-burner a ravisher a blasphemer a thief no
what then is the crime for which thou art punishing him so bitterly he
is a negro and my slave

then followed a demand how he became and by what right the master
claimed him as a slave to which the master replied by right of
purchase exhibiting at the same time a bill of sale at this the
querist expressed great indignation and calling the master a robber
cheat and usurper bade him show as the only title a christian would
sanction a bill of sale signed by the negro's maker who alone had
the right to dispose of man's liberty and he concluded the paragraph
by averring that the claim was fraudulent that the slave was
unjustly treacherously unrighteously held in bonds and that he was
or of right should be as free as the master himself

here i paused for breath my companions looked at me with eyes staring
out of their heads astonishment suspicion and fear were depicted in
their countenances a new idea had entered their brains all opened
their mouths but governor was the only one who could speak and he
stuttered and stammered in his eagerness so much that i could scarcely
understand him

wh-wh-wh-wh-what dat he cried hab a right to fr-fr-fr-freedom
case gorra-matty no s-s-s-sell me why den wh-wh-wh-who's slave
gorra-matty no trade in niggurs i say you pawson jim wh-wh-wh-what
you say dat doctrine the parson was dumb-founded the difficulty
was solved by an old negro who rolled his quid of tobacco and his eyes
together and said

whaw de debbil's de difference massa cunnel no buy us we born
him slave ebbery nigga he-ah

unluckily the very next paragraph was opened by the quotation from the
declaration of independence that all men were born free and equal
which was asserted to be true of all men negroes as well as others
from which it followed that the master's claim to the slave born in
thraldom was as fraudulent as in the case of one obtained by purchase

whaw dat said governor decoration of independence say dat
gen'ral jodge washington him make dat and gen'ral tommie jefferson
him put hand to it all men born free and equal a nigga is a man
who says no to dat how come massa cunnel to be massa den

that question had never before been asked on ridgewood hill but all
now asked it and all for the first time in their lives began to
think of their master as a foe and usurper the strangely-expressed
idea in the pamphlet namely--that none but their maker could
rightfully sell them to bondage and that other in relation to natural
freedom and equality had captivated their imaginations and made an
impression on their minds not readily to be forgotten black looks
passed from one to another and angry expressions were uttered and i
know not where the excitement that was fast awaking would have ended
had not our master himself suddenly made his appearance descending the
bluff

for the first time in their lives the slaves beheld his approach with
terror and all darting upon the timber began to labour with a zeal
and bustling eagerness which they had never shown before but first
the pamphlet was snatched out of my hands and concealed in a hollow of
the bank our uncommon industry for even parson jim and myself were
seized with a fit of zeal and gave our labour with the rest somewhat
surprised the venerable old man but as the timber was destined to
contribute to our own comforts he attributed it to a selfish motive
and chiding us good-humouredly and with a laugh said that's the
way with you you rogues you can work well enough when it is for
yourselves

dat's all de tanks we gits muttered governor hard by wonder if we
ha'n't a better right to work than massa jodge to make us




 chapter x


the effect of the pamphlet on its reader and hearers


we had seen the last day of content on ridgewood hill that little
scrap of paper thrown among us perhaps by accident or as i have
sometimes thought dropped by the fiend of darkness himself had
conjured up a thousand of his imps who one after another took
up their dwelling in our breasts until their name was legion my
fellow-slaves cared little now for singing and dancing their only
desire in the intervals of labour was to assemble together below the
bluff and dive deeper into the mysteries of the pamphlet and as i
was the only one who could explain them and was ready enough to do
so i often neglected my little friend tommy to preside over their
convocations

nor were these meetings confined to the original finders of the
precious document the news had been whispered from man to man and
the sensation spread over the whole estate so that those who lived
with the major were as eager to escape from their labours and listen to
the new revelation as ourselves nay so great was the curiosity among
them that many who could not come when i was present to expound the
secrets of the book would betake themselves to the bluff to indulge a
look at it and guess out its contents as they could from the pictures
and by-and-by the news having spread to a distance we had visiters
also from the gangs of other plantations

it was perhaps a week or more before the composition was read through
and understood by us all and in that time it had wrought a revolution
in our feelings as surprising as it was fearful and now lest the
reader should doubt that the great effects i am about to record should
have really arisen from so slight a cause as a little book i think it
proper to tell him more fully than i have done what that little book
contained

it was as i have said an address to the owners of slaves and its
object purported to be to awaken their minds to the cruelty injustice
and wickedness of slavery this was sought to be effected in the
first place by numerous cuts representing all the cruelties and
indignities that negro slaves had suffered or could suffer either in
reality or in the imaginations of the philanthropists some of these
were horrible many shocking and all disgusting and some of them
i think were copied out of fox's book of martyrs though of that i
am not certain the moral turpitude and illegality of the institution
were shown or attempted to be shown now by arguments that were
handled like daggers and broad-axes and now by savage denunciations
of the enslaver and oppressor who were proved to be murderers
blasphemers tyrants devils and i know not what beside the vengeance
of heaven was invoked upon their heads coupled with predictions of
the retribution that would sooner or later fall upon them these being
borne out by monitory allusions to the servile wars of rome syria
egypt sicily st domingo c c it was threatened that heaven would
repeat the plagues of egypt in america to punish the task-masters of
the ethiopian as it had punished those of the israelite and that
in addition the horrors of hayti would be enacted a second time and
within our own borders it was contended that the negro was in organic
and mental structure the white man's equal if not his superior and
that there was a peculiar injustice in subjecting to bondage his
race which had been or so the writer averred in the earlier days of
the world the sole possessors of knowledge and civilization and there
were many triumphant references to hannibal queen sheba cleopatra
and the pharaohs all of whom were proved to have been woolly-headed
and as bright in spirit as they were black in visage in short the
book was full of strange things and among others of insurrection and
murder though it is but charitable to suppose that the writer did not
know it

there was scarce a word in it that did not contribute to increase the
evil spirit which its first paragraph had excited among my companions
it taught them to look on themselves as the victims of avarice the
play-things of cruelty the foot-balls of oppression the most injured
people in the world and the original greatness of their race which
was an idea they received with uncommon pleasure and its reviving
grandeur in the liberated hayti convinced them they possessed the
power to redress their wrongs and raise themselves into a mighty
nation

with the sense of injury came a thirst for revenge my companions began
to talk of violence and dream of blood a week before there was not one
of them who would not have risked his life to save his master's the
scene was now changed--my master walked daily though without knowing
it among volcanoes all looked upon him askant and muttered curses
as he passed a kinder-hearted man and easier master never lived
and it may seem incredible that he should be hated without any real
cause imaginary causes are however always the most efficacious in
exciting jealousy and hatred in affairs of the affections slaves and
the members of political factions are equally unreasonable the only
difference in the effect is that the one cannot while the other can
and does change his masters when his whim changes

that fatal book infected my own spirit as deeply as it did those of
the others and made me as sour and discontented as they i began to
have sentimental notions about liberty and equality the dignity of
man the nobleness of freedom and so-forth and a stupid ambition a
vague notion that i was born to be a king or president or some such
great personage filled my imagination and made me a willing listener
to and sharer in the schemes of violence and desperation which my
fellow-slaves soon began to frame it is wonderful that among the many
thoughts that now crowded my brain no memory of my original condition
arose to teach me the folly of my desires but and i repeat it again
the past was dead with me i lived only for the present

a little incident that soon befell me will show the reader how
completely my feelings were identified with my condition and how
deeply the lessons of that unlucky pamphlet had sunk into my spirit
my little playmate master tommy who was not above six years old
being of an irascible temper sometimes quarrelled with me on which
occasions as i mentioned before he used to beat me a liberty i
rather encouraged than otherwise since i gained by it--though my
master strictly forbade the youth to take it now as soon as my
head began to fill with the direful and magnificent conceptions of a
malecontent and conspirator i waxed weary of child's play and master
tommy who falling into a passion with me for that reason proceeded
on a certain occasion to pommel my ribs with a fist about equal in
weight to the paw of a gadfly i was incensed i may say enraged at
the poor child and repaid the violence by shaking him almost to death
indeed i felt for a while as if i could have killed him and i know
not whether i might not have done it for the devil had on the sudden
got into my spirit had not his father discovered what i was doing
and run to his assistance

i then pretended that i had shaken him in sport and thus escaped
a drubbing of which i was at first in danger the threat of this
however sank deeply into my mind and i ever after felt a deep hatred
of both father and son this may well be called a blind malice for
neither had given me any real cause for it




 chapter xi


the hatching of a conspiracy


in the meanwhile the devil was doing his work among the others and
disaffection grew into wrath and fury that were not so perfectly
concealed but that my master or rather his eldest son who was of a
more observant disposition began to suspect that mischief was brewing
and in a short time it was reported among us that our master had
marked some of us as being dangerous and was resolved to sell us to a
mississippi trader who was then in the county this was reported by a
spy a house-servant who professed to have overheard the conversation
and who reported besides that our master and his son were furbishing
up their fire-arms and laying in terrible supply of balls and powder

now whether this account was true or not i never knew and i suppose i
never shall until i am in my grave it was enough however to drive
us to a phrensy those in particular who had been indicated as the
intended victims of the mississippi trader and the more especially
as those men had wives and children from whom they were told they
were to be parted one of these was the blacksmith of the estate
who being a resolute and fierce-tempered fellow instantly began to
convert all the old horseshoes and iron hoops about his shop into a
kind of blades or spear-heads which we fastened upon poles and hid
away in secret places there were among us three or four men who had
muskets with which they used to shoot wild fowl on the river there
being great abundance at this season these weapons were also put into
requisition besides which we stored away butcher-knives and bludgeons
old scythe-blades and sickles beaten straight until we could boast
quite an armory and here i may observe that the faster these weapons
increased upon our hands the more deadly became our resolutions the
more fierce and malignant our desires until having at last what we
thought a sufficiency for our purpose we gave a loose to our passions
and determined upon a plan of proceedings that may well be called
infernal

i believe that when we began to collect these offensive weapons
we had but vague ideas of mischief thinking rather of defending
ourselves from some meditated outrage on the part of our master than
of beginning an assault upon him ourselves but now the armory being
complete and several cunning fellows who had been spying out among
the surrounding plantations bringing us word that the gangs so they
sometimes call the whole number of hands on a farm of most of them
were ready to strike with us for freedom another having brought us
word that a great outbreaking had already taken place south of james
river which however was not true a third reminding us that we were
more numerous than our masters and a fourth bidding us remember that
the negroes had once as the little book told us been the masters of
all the white men in the world and might be again i say these things
being represented to us as we were handling our arms and thinking what
execution we could do with them we shook hands together and kissing
the little pamphlet for which we had conceived a high regard as we
had seen white men kiss the book in courts of law we swore we would
exterminate all the white men in virginia beginning with our master
and his family




 chapter xii


how the spoils of victory were intended to be divided


the chief men in the conspiracy were by all consent the fellow called
governor of whom i have said so much before parson jim who although
a little in the background at first had soon taken a foremost stand
and was indeed the first to propose murder myself--not that i was
really very active or fiery in the matter but because i had become
prominent as the reader of the little book cesar the blacksmith
and a fellow named zip or scipio who was the chief fiddler and
banjo-player and had been therefore in great favour with the family
until he lost it by some misconduct

the parson having uttered the diabolical proposal i mentioned before
and seeing it well received got up to make a speech to inflame our
courage there was in his oration a good deal of preaching with a
considerable sprinkling of scraps from the bible such as he had picked
up in the course of his clerical career what he chiefly harped on was
that greatness of the negro nation spoken of before and he discoursed
so energetically of the great kings and generals the great faroes and
cannibals as he called them who had distinguished the race in olden
time that all became ambitious to figure with similar dignity in story

what you speak faw pawson said governor interrupting him and
looking round with the air of a lord i be king hah and hab my
sarvants to wait on me

what you say dah gub'nor cried zip the fiddler with equal spirit
you be king i be president

i be emp'ror like dat ah nigga in high-ty said another

i be constable cried a fourth

you be cuss you no go for de best man cried governor in a heat
i be constable myself and i lick any nigga i like who say me no
hah i smash him brain out--dem nigga governor was a tyrant already
and all began to be more or less afraid of him i'll be de great man
and i shall hab my choice ob de women what you say dat i sall hab
missa isabella faw my wife who say me no dah

berry well cried scipio i hab missa edie--that is miss edith
the next in age who was however not yet thirteen and therefore but
a poor little child

brudder zip said jim the parson i speak fust dah the labourer is
wordy ob his hiah--i shall put my hand to de plough and i shall hab
missa edie for my wife arter me if you please brudder zip

hold you jaw zip said king governor to the fiddler who was ready
to knock the parson down you shall hab massa maja's wife and you
shall cut his head off fust as faw de oder niggas he-ah what faw use
ob quar'lin we shall have wifes enough when we kills white massas
gorry we shall hab pick

and thus my companions apportioned among themselves in prospective
the wives and daughters of their intended victims and thus doubtless
they would have apportioned them in reality had the bloody enterprise
been allowed the success its projectors anticipated i remember that my
blood suddenly froze within my veins when the conspiracy had reached
this point and the idea of seeing those innocent helpless maidens
made the prey of brutal murderers was so shocking to my spirit that i
lost speech and could scarce support myself on my feet

while i stood thus confused among them the conspirators determined
upon a plan of action by which as far as i understood it the houses
of my master and his son the two being previously murdered were to
be set on fire at the same moment on the following night and at the
sight of the flames the slaves on several neighbouring plantations were
to fall upon their masters in like manner after which the gangs from
all the burnt estates were to meet at a common rendezvous and march
in a body against the neighbouring village the sacking of which they
joyously looked forward to as the first step in a career of conquest
and triumph--in other words of murder and rapine

who would have thought that a little book framed by a philanthropist
for the humane purpose of turning his neighbour from the error of his
way should have lighted a torch in his dwelling only to be quenched
by blood i am myself a witness that the pamphlet was not one of those
incendiary publications of which so much is said as being designed
for the eyes of slaves themselves to exasperate them to revolt by no
means it was addressed to the master and of course was only designed
for him why the pictures were put in it however i cannot imagine
since it may be supposed the master could understand the argument and
exhortation of the writer well enough without them perhaps they were
intended to divert his children

the book however whatever may have been the object for which it was
written had the effect to make a hundred men who were previously
contented with their lot in life and perhaps as happy as any other men
ordained to a life of labour the victims of dissatisfaction and range
the enemies of those they had once loved and in fine the contrivers
and authors of their own destruction




 chapter xiii


the attack of the insurgents upon the mansion at ridgewood hill


i said that when the conspiracy reached the crisis mentioned before
i was suddenly seized with terror i began to think with what kindness
i had been treated by those i had leagued to destroy and the baseness
and ingratitude of the whole design struck me with such force that
i was two or three times on the point of going to my master and
revealing it to him while he had yet the power to escape but my fears
of him and of my fellow-ruffians deterred me i thought he looked
fierce and stern and as for my companions i conceited that they were
watching me dogging my every step prepared to kill me the moment i
attempted to play them false it was unfortunate that my rudeness to
master tommy had caused me to be banished the house for although my
master did not beat me he was persuaded my violence in that case was
not altogether jocose and therefore punished me by sending me to the
fields hence i had no opportunity to see him in private unless i had
sought it which would have exposed me to observation

the night came and it came to me bringing such gloom and horror that
my agitation was observed by governor and others who railed at me for
a coward and threatened to take my life if i did not behave more like
a man this only increased my alarm and truly my disorder of mind
became so great that i was in a species of stupid distraction when the
moment for action arrived for which reason i retain but a confused
recollection of the first events and cannot therefore give a clear
relation of them

i remember that there was some confusion produced by an unexpected act
on the part of our master who it was generally supposed designed
crossing the creek to visit the major having ordered his carriage and
the ferry-boat to be got ready and it was resolved to kill him while
crossing the creek on his return after which we were to fire a volley
of guns as a signal to the major's gang and then assault and burn our
master's dwelling instead of departing however when the night came
he remained at home shut up with the overseer and young mr andrews
his daughter's lover and it was reported that they had barred up the
doors and windows and were sitting at a table covered with loaded
pistols thus making it manifest that they suspected our intentions
and were resolved to defend themselves to the last

for my part i have never believed that our master suspected his
danger at all he perceived indeed that an ill spirit had got among
his people but neither he nor any of his family really believed that
mischief was intended had they done so he would undoubtedly have
procured assistance or at least removed his children the windows were
barred indeed and perhaps earlier than usual which may have been
accidental and as for the fire-arms on the table i believe they were
only fowling-pieces which my master mr andrews and the overseer
who was a great fowler and therefore much favoured by my master who
was a veteran sportsman were getting ready to shoot wild ducks with in
the morning

my companions however were persuaded that our victims were on their
guard and the hour drawing nigh at which they had appointed to strike
the first blow and give the signal to the neighbouring gangs they
were at a loss not knowing what to do for they were afraid to attack
the house while three resolute men armed with pistols stood ready to
receive them in this conjuncture it was proposed by governor who
from having been a fellow notorious for nothing save monkey tricks and
waggery was now become a devil incarnate he was so bold cunning and
eager for blood to fire the pile of timber where it stood near the
quarters or negro-huts the burning of which would serve the double
purpose of drawing our intended victims from the house and giving the
signal to the neighbouring estates

the proposal was instantly adopted and in a few moments the pile of
dry resinous wood was in a flame burning with prodigious violence
and casting a bright light over the whole mansion the lawn and even
the neighbouring river at the same moment and just as we were about
to raise the treacherous alarm we heard a sudden firing of guns and
shouting beyond the creek at the major's house which made us suppose
the negroes there had anticipated us in the rising

emulous not to be outdone our own party now set up a horrid alarm of
fire accompanied with screams and yells that might have roused the
dead and ran to the mansion door as if to demand assistance of their
master

never shall i forget the scene that ensued i stood rooted to the
ground not twenty steps from the house when the door was thrown
open and my master rushed out followed by andrews and the overseer
they had scarce put foot on the porch before six or seven guns being
all that the conspirators could muster and which the owners held in
readiness were discharged at them and then they were set upon by
others with the spears the light of the fire illuminated the porch
so that objects were plainly distinguishable yet so violent was the
rush of assailants so wild the tumult so brief the contest that i
can scarce say i really witnessed the particulars of the tragedy i
beheld indeed my master's gray hairs for he was of towering stature
floating an instant over the heads of the assailants but the next
moment they had vanished and i saw but a single white man struggling
in the hall against a mass of foes and crying out to miss isabella
by name to escape with the children vain counsel vain sacrifice
of safety to humanity the faithful overseer for it was he who made
this heroic effort to save his master's children his master and young
andrews lying dead or mortally wounded on the porch was cut down on
the spot and the shrieks of the children as they fled some into the
open air by a back door and others to the upper chambers and the
savage yells of triumph with which they were pursued told how vainly
he had devoted himself to save them




 chapter xiv

the tragical occurrences that followed


while i stood thus observing the horrors i had been instrumental in
provoking as incapable of putting a stop to as of assisting in them
i saw two of the children little tommy and his youngest sister lucy
a girl of seven or eight years running wildly over the lawn several
of my ruffian companions pursuing them the girl was snatched up by old
aunt phoebe who with other women had come among us wringing her
hands and beseeching us not to kill their young misses and was thus
saved as for the boy he caught sight of me and sprang into my arms
entreating me not to let them kill him and he would never hurt me
again in all his life and would give me all his money

poor child i would have defended him at that moment with my life for
my heart bled for what had already been done but he was snatched out
of my hands and i saw no more of him i heard afterward however that
he was not hurt having been saved by the women who had protected in
like manner his two little sisters jane and lucy as for the others
that is isabella and edith i witnessed their fate with my own eyes
and it was the suddenness and horror of it that by unmanning me
entirely prevented my giving aid to the boy when he was torn from my
arms

the fire had by this time spread from the timber to an adjacent cabin
and a light equal to that of noon though red as blood itself was
shed over the whole mansion on the roof of which was a little cupola
or observatory open to the weather where was room for five or six
persons to sit together and enjoy the prospect of the river and
surrounding hills and on either side of this cupola was a platform
though without a balustrade on which was space for as many more

the observatory being strongly illuminated by the flames and my
eyes being turned thitherward by a furious yell which was suddenly
set up around me i beheld my master's daughter isabella rush into
it--that is into the observatory--from the staircase below hotly
pursued as was evident from what followed she bore in her arms or
rather dragged after her for the child was in a swoon her sister
edith who was but small of stature and light and as she reached this
forlorn place of refuge she threw down the trapdoor that covered its
entrance and endeavoured to keep it down with her foot there was
something inexpressibly fearful in her appearance independent of the
dreadfulness of her situation separated only by a narrow plank from
ruffians maddened by rage and carnage from whom death itself was a
boon too merciful to be expected and from whom she was to guard not
only herself but the feeble unconscious being hanging on her neck
her hair was all dishevelled her dress torn and disordered and her
face as white as snow yet there was a wild energy and fierceness
breathing from every feature and she looked like a lioness defending
to the last her young from the hunters from whom she yet knows there
is no escape

the trapdoor shook under her foot and was at last thrown violently
up and up with screams of triumph darted the infuriated governor
followed by jim and others to grasp their prey their prey had fled
without uttering a word or scream she sprang from the cupola to the
platform at its side and then with a fearlessness only derived from
desperation and still bearing her insensible sister she stepped upon
the roof which was high and steep and ran along it to its extremity

even the ferocious governor was for a moment daunted at the boldness of
the act and afraid to follow until the parson--well worthy he of the
name--set him the example by leaping on the shingles and pursuing the
unhappy girl to her last refuge he approached--he stretched forth his
arm to seize her but he was not destined to lay an impure touch on the
devoted and heroic creature i saw her lay her lips once on those of
the poor edith--the next instant the frail figure of the little sister
was hurled from her arms to be dashed to pieces on the stones below
in another the hapless isabella herself had followed her having
thrown herself headlong from the height to escape by death a fate
otherwise inevitable

of what followed i have but a faint and disordered recollection i
remember that the fall of the two maidens caused loud cries of horror
from the men and of lamentation from the women and i remember also
that these were renewed almost immediately after but mingled with the
sound of fire-arms discharged by a party of foes and the voices of
white men among which i distinguished that of my master's son the
major calling upon one another to give no quarter to the miscreants
a party of armed horsemen had in fact ridden among us and were now
dealing death on all hands from pistols and sabres from one of the
latter weapons i myself received a severe cut and was at the same time
struck down by the hoofs of a horse and left insensible




 chapter xv


the results of the insurrection with a truly strange and fatal
catastrophe that befell the author


when i recovered my senses i found myself a prisoner bound hand
and foot and lying with six or seven of my late companions in a
cart in which groaning with pain for most of us were wounded and
anticipating a direful end to our dreams of conquest and revenge we
were trundled to the village and there deposited in the county jail
to repent at leisure the rashness and enormity of our enterprise

the power of that little pamphlet of which i have said so much to
produce an effect for which we must charitably suppose it was not
intended was shown in the numbers of wretches by whom the prison
was crowded for it had been used to inflame the passions of the
negroes on several different estates all of whom had agreed to rise
in insurrection although as it providentially happened the revolt
extended to the length of murder only on ridgewood hill the conspiracy
was detected--i believe confessed by a slave--on a plantation adjacent
to that of my master's son who being informed of it and assisted
by a party that brought the news proceeded to seize the ringleaders
in his own gang some of whom attempting to make their escape were
fired on and this was the cause of the volley which we had heard
and supposed was fired by our fellow-conspirators beyond the creek
the major then crossed over to his father's estate but too late to
avert the tragedy which i have related his father his eldest sister
and her lover were already dead as for the younger edith she was
taken up alive but cruelly mangled and she expired in a few hours
the faithful and devoted overseer i have the happiness to believe
ultimately escaped with his life for although covered with wounds
and at first reported dead he revived sufficiently to make deposition
to the facts of the assault and murder as far as he was cognizant of
them and i heard he was expected to recover

of those who perished the father the children and the gallant
friend there was not one who was not a fortnight before respected
and beloved by those who slew them and at their death-hour they were
as guiltless of wrong and as deserving of affection and gratitude
as they ever had been how therefore they came to be hated and why
they were killed i am unable to divine all that i know is that we
who loved them read a book which fell in our way and from that moment
knew them only as enemies--objects on whom we had a right to glut our
fiercest passions

as for ourselves--my deluded companions at least--their fate can be
easily imagined some were killed at the scene of murder among others
the chief leader governor who was shot on the roof of the house
parson jim was wounded on the same place and rolling from the roof
was horribly crushed by the fall but lingered in unspeakable agonies
for several days and then died scipio the fiddler was taken alive
tried condemned and executed with many others whose participation in
the crime left them no hope of mercy

with these i was myself put upon trial and adjudged to death for
although it was made apparent that i had not lifted my hand against any
one it was proved that i was more than privy to the plot--that i had
been instrumental in fomenting it and the known favour with which i
had been treated added the double die of ingratitude to my offence i
was therefore condemned and bade to expect no mercy nor did i expect
it for the fatal day appointed for the execution having arrived a
rope was put round my neck and i was led to the gibbet

and now i am about to relate what will greatly surprise the reader--i
was not only found guilty and condemned--i was hanged escape was
impossible and i perceived it the anguish of my mind--for in anguish
it may be supposed i looked forward to my fate--was increased by the
consciousness--so long slumbering--that flashed on it as i was driven
to the fatal tree that i was in reality not tom the slave but
sheppard lee the freeman and that i possessed a power of evading
the halter or any other inconvenience provided i were allowed but
one opportunity to exercise it but where was i now to look for a
dead body it is true there were bodies enough by-and-by when my
accomplices were tucked up around me but what advantage could i derive
from entering any one of them since my fate must be equally certain to
be hanged

my distress i repeat was uncommonly great and in the midst of it i
was executed which put an end to the quandary




 chapter xvi


in which it is related what became of the author after being hanged


here it would seem that my history should find its natural close
but i hope to convince the world that a man may live to record his own
death and burial i say burial for from all i have heard i judge
that i was buried as well as hanged and that i lay in the earth in a
coarse deal coffin from two o'clock in the afternoon of a november
day until nine at night when certain young doctors of the village
who were desirous to show their skill in anatomy came to the place of
execution and dug up the three best bodies of which as my good luck
would have it my own was one--zip the fiddler's being another while
the third was that of a young fellow named sam notorious for nothing
so much as a great passion he had for butting with his head against
brick walls or even stone ones provided they were smooth enough

the young anatomists previous to hacking us resolved to try some
galvanic experiments on us having procured a battery for that purpose
and they invited a dozen or more respectable gentlemen to be present
and witness the effects of that extraordinary fluid galvanism on our
lifeless bodies

the first essayed was that of the unfortunate scipio who being well
charged began to the admiration of all present to raise first one
arm and then the other then to twist the fingers of his left hand in
a peculiar way as if turning a screw inclining his head the while
towards his left shoulder and then to saw the air sweeping his right
hand to and fro across his breast with great briskness and energy
the fingers of his left titillating at the air all the while so as to
present the lively spectacle of a man playing the fiddle and indeed
it was judged so natural was every motion that had the party been
provided with a fiddle and bow to put into his hands they would have
played such a jig as would have set all present dancing

the next experiment tried was upon the body of sam whose muscles
were speedily excited to exercise themselves in the way to which they
had been most accustomed though not in one so agreeable to the chief
operator for in this case the lifeless corse suddenly lifting up its
head bestowed it with a jerk of propulsion equal in force to the but
of a battering-ram full against the stomach of the operator whereby
he was tumbled head over heels and all the breath beaten out of his
body

the reader may suppose as it was proved to be the virtue of galvanism
to set the dead muscles doing those acts to which the living ones had
been longest habituated that i upon being charged could do nothing
less than throw myself upon my hands and knees and go galloping about
the table as i had been used to do over the lawn when master tommy
was mounted upon my back

such however was not the fact the first thing i did upon feeling the
magical fluid penetrate my nerves was to open my eyes and snap them
twice or thrice the second to utter a horrible groan which greatly
disconcerted the spectators and the third to start bolt upright on
my feet and ask them what the devil they were after in a word i
was suddenly resuscitated and to the great horror of all present
doctors and lookers-on who fetching a yell that caused me to think
i had got among condemned spirits in purgatory fled from the room
exclaiming that i was the devil and no niggur what was particularly
lamentable though i was far from so esteeming it one of them a
young gentleman who had come to the exhibition out of curiosity being
invited by one of the doctors was so overcome with terror that before
he reached the door of the room he fell down in a fit and being
neglected by the others none of whom stopped to give him help expired
on the spot

as for me the cause of all the alarm i believe i was ten times
more frightened than any of the spectators especially when i came
to recollect that i had just been hanged and that i would in all
probability be hanged again unless i now succeeded in making my
escape as for the cause of my resuscitation and the events that
accompanied it i was then entirely ignorant of them and indeed
i must confess i learned them afterward out of the newspapers i
knew however that i had been hanged and that i had been by some
extraordinary means or other brought to life again and i perceived
that if i did not make my escape without delay i should certainly be
recaptured by the returning doctors

i ran towards the door and then for the first time beheld that
unfortunate spectator who had fallen dead as i mentioned before and
lay upon the floor with his face turned up i recollected him on the
instant as being a young gentleman whom i had once or twice seen at
my late master's house all that i knew of him was that his name was
megrim that he was reputed to be very wealthy and a great genius or
as some said eccentric and that he was admired by the ladies and
doubtless because he was a genius

as i looked him in the face i heard in the distance the uproar of
voices which had succeeded the flight of the doctors suddenly
burst out afresh with the sound of returning footsteps and a
loud bully-like voice which i thought very much like that of the
under-turnkey at the prison--a man whom i had learned to fear--cried
out let me see your devil for may i be cussed up hill and down
hill if i ever seed a bigger one than myself

horrible as was the voice i was not dismayed i saw at my feet a city
of refuge into which my enemies could not pursue me my escape was
within my own power

master said i touching my head for i had no hat to the corpse
if it is all the same to you i beg you'll let me take possession of
your body

as i pronounced the words the translation was effected and that so
rapidly that just as i drew my first breath in the body of mr megrim
it was knocked out of me by the fall of my old one which--i not
having taken the precaution to stand a little to one side--fell down
like a thunderbolt upon me bruising me very considerably about the
precordia

in this state being half suffocated and somewhat frightened i was
picked up and carried away by my new friends and put to bed where
having swallowed an anodyne i fell directly sound asleep

and here before proceeding farther i will say that the doctors and
their friends were greatly surprised to discover my late body lying
dead having expected to find it as animated as when they left it but
by-and-by having reflected that the galvanism or artificial life
infused into its nerves had been naturally exhausted at last whereupon
it as naturally followed that the body should return to its lifeless
condition they began to aver that the most surprising part of the
business was that it had kept me alive so long and enabled me after
groaning and speaking as i had actually done to walk so far from the
table on which i had been lying

on the whole the phenomenon was considered curious and wonderful
and an account of it having been drawn up by the doctors and headed
extraordinary case of the effects of galvanism on a dead body it was
printed for the benefit of scientific men throughout the world in a
medical journal where i doubt not it may be found at this day

a young gentleman of fortune





 chapter i


containing an inkling of the life and habits of mr arthur megrim


having been carried from the scene of my late transformation as i
mentioned before physicked put to bed and allowed to sleep off
my troubles i awoke late on the following morning feeling very
comfortable notwithstanding the bruises on my ribs and with an
uncommonly agreeable though lazy sense of the enjoyment of lying
a-bed indeed this was my only feeling i woke to a consciousness
though a vague one of the change in my condition and this together
with what i saw around me when i had succeeded after some effort in
getting my eyes a little opened it may be supposed would have filled
me with surprise and excited in me a great curiosity to inquire into
matters relating to mr arthur megrim

such however was not the case i looked upon the elegantly-adorned
chamber in which i lay and the sumptuous robes of my bed with as much
indifference as if i had been accustomed to them all my life and as
for the happy destiny that now seemed opening upon me i scarce thought
on it at all

nor can i say that i felt in any way elated at my fortunate escape
from the hangman and the anatomists i remembered that affair with a
drowsy indifference as being a matter of no further consequence to me
and as for mr arthur megrim's friends and kinsmen his interests and
relations in life i thought to myself with a yawn i shall know them
all in good time

i was content to take things as they might come and eschew labours of
mind as well as efforts of body curiosity i felt was a tumultuous
passion and i therefore resolved to avoid it in this mood i turned
over on the other side and took a second nap

from this i was roused after a time by some one tugging at my
shoulder who proved upon examination to be a very elegant-looking
mulatto-boy--that is a boy of twenty-five years or thereabouts--who
signified in language as genteel as his person that it was exactly
half past eleven o'clock and therefore time for me to get up

augh--well said i taking about thirty seconds to gape out each
word it seemed such tiresome work to articulate what do you want

want you to get up sah missie ann says it does you no good to sleep
so long

augh--who is missie ann

lar bless us said the gentleman turning up the white of his eye
missie ann is massa's sister

who is massa

you massa--massa arthur

augh--well and who are you

paminondas massa coat very nicely brushed very fine day will do
you good sah to get up and taste the air regular indian summer sah

you may go to the devil

yes sah

with that i turned over for another nap which i should undoubtedly
have taken had i not been interrupted just as i was falling asleep
by the entrance of a lady of a somewhat starched and venerable
appearance though not more than six or seven years older than myself
i being perhaps twenty-five or six

a'n't you ashamed of yourself arthur said she do tell me--do you
intend to lie a-bed for ever

augh--pshaw said i pray madam be so good as to inform me who you
are and--augh--what you want in my chamber

come said the lady don't be ridiculous and fall into any of
your hyppoes again don't pretend you don't know your own sister ann
megrim

i won't said i but--augh--sister if you have no objection i
should like--augh--to sleep till dinner is ready

dinner screamed my sister ann megrim don't suppose you will ever
be able to eat a dinner again you know the doctor says it is your hard
eating and your laziness together that have destroyed your digestive
apparatus and that if you don't adhere to the bran bread and hickory
ashes tea you'll never be cured in the world

what said i am i sick

undoubtedly said my sister ann your digestive apparatus is all
destroyed and your nerves too did not you faint last night when they
were galvanizing the bodies have you not lost all muscular power so
that you do nothing but lie on a bed or sofa all day long oh really
brother arthur megrim i am ashamed of you a man like you--a young man
and a rich man a man of family and genius a gentleman and a scholar
a man who might make himself governor of the state or president of
the nation or any thing--yet to be nothing at all except the laziest
man in virginia a man with no digestive apparatus a poor nervous
hyppo--oh it is too bad do get up and stir yourself mount your
horse or go out in the carriage exercise you know is the only thing
to restore strength to the digestive apparatus

sister ann said i the more you speak of my digestive apparatus
the more--augh--the more i am convinced you don't know what you are
talking about i am resolved to get up and eat my dinner--

of bran bread and hickory ashes said my sister

of canvass-back ducks and terapins said i at which miss ann megrim
expressed terror and aversion and endeavoured to convince me that such
indulgence would be punished by a horrible indigestion as had been the
case a thousand times before

but cogent as were her arguments i had or felt one still stronger
on my side being a savage appetite which was waking within that very
digestive apparatus she held in such disesteem and which became the
more eager the more she besought me to resist it

the discussion was so far advantageous that it set me wide awake and
by-and-by the zealous epaminondas having made his second appearance
i succeeded with his assistance in getting on my clothes and
descending to the dining-room where to the great horror and grief
of my affectionate relative i demolished two ducks and a half being
the true canvass-backs or white-backs as they call them in that
country and a full grown tortoise of the genus emys and species
palustris and in this operation i may say i found the first
excitement of pleasure which i had yet known in my new body and
displayed an energy of application of which i did not before know that
i was capable nor am i certain that any ill consequences followed the
meal i felt indeed a strong propensity to throw myself on a sofa and
recruit after the labours of eating but this miss megrim resisted
insisting i should get into my carriage for it seems i had one and a
very handsome one too and drive about to avoid a surfeit

in this i consented to gratify her wishes whereby i gratified one of
my own for i fell sound asleep within five minutes after starting and
so remained until the excursion was over

then being as hungry as ever and not knowing what else to do i
picked my teeth over a newspaper and nodded at a novel until supper
was got ready which disregarding miss megrim's exhortations as
before i attacked with the good-will i had carried to my dinner
eating on this occasion two terapins and a half and one whole duck of
the genus anas and species vallisneria

the only ill consequences were that i dreamed of the devil and his
imps all night and that i awoke in a crusty humour next morning


footnote i had these learned names of a scientific doctor in the
village and i have see them also in the newspapers




 chapter ii


the happy condition in which sheppard lee is at last placed


if there be among my readers any person so discontented with his lot
that he would be glad to exchange conditions with another i think had
he been acquainted with mr arthur megrim he would have desired an
exchange with him above all other persons in the world for mr megrim
possessed all those requisites which are thought to ensure happiness to
a human being he was young rich and independent of a good family
he boasted the chivalrous blood of the megrims of a sound body
and serene temper and with no appetite for those excesses which ruin
the reputation while they debase the minds and destroy the peace of
youth his years as i have mentioned already were twenty-five or six
his revenues were far above his wants and enabled him to support his
town-house which was the most elegant one in the village where he
lived remote from the care and trouble of his plantations and as for
independence that was manifestly complete he being a bachelor and
the sole surviver of his family excepting only his sister miss ann
megrim who managed his household and thus took from his mind the only
care that could otherwise have disturbed it

what then in the whole world had mr megrim to trouble him nothing
on earth--and for that reason to speak paradoxically he was more
troubled than any one else on earth labour pain and care--the
evils which men are so apt to censure providence for entailing upon
the race--i have had experience enough to know are essential to the
true enjoyment of life serving like salt pepper mustard and
other condiments and spices which are by themselves ungrateful to
the palate to give a relish to the dish that is insipid and cloying
without them who enjoys health--who is so sensible of the rapture of
being well as he who has just been relieved from sickness who can
appreciate the delightful luxury of repose so well as the labourer
released from his daily toil who in fine tastes of the bliss of
happiness like him who is introduced to it after a probation of
suffering the surest way to cure a boy of a love of cakes and comfils
is to put him apprentice to a confectioner the truth is that the
sweets of life enjoyed by themselves are just as disgusting as the
bitters and can only be properly relished when alternated or mingled
with the latter

but as this is philosophy and the reader will skip it i will pursue
the subject no further but jump at once from the principle to the
practical illustration as seen in my history while a resident in the
body of mr arthur megrim

i was on the sudden a rich young man with nothing on earth to
trouble me i had lands and houses rich plantations a nation or two
of negroes herds of sheep and cattle with mills fisheries and some
half dozen or more gold-mines which last--and it may be considered
out of virginia a wondrous evidence of my wealth--were decidedly the
least valuable of all my possessions with all these things i was made
acquainted by my sister ann or otherwise it is highly probable i
should have known nothing about them for during the whole period of my
seventh existence i confined myself to my property in the village not
having the least curiosity to visit my plantations which as everybody
told me were in good hands

in the village itself i had every thing about me to secure happiness--a
fine house abundance of servants the whole under the management of
the best of housekeepers my sister ann with horses and carriages--for
which however i cared but little thinking it laborious to ride and
as tedious to be driven--and above all friends without number who
treated me with a respect amounting to veneration for it must be
remembered i was the richest man in the county and with a degree of
affection little short of idolatry but whom however i thought very
troublesome tiresome people seeing that they visited me too often
and wearied me to death with long conversations about every thing

among them all there was but one for whom i felt any friendship and
he was a young doctor named tibbikens for whom my sister ann had a
great respect and who had been retained by her to assist in taking
care of my digestive apparatus--that same digestive apparatus of mine
being a hobby on which my sister lavished more thought and anxiety than
i believe she did upon her own soul--not meaning to reflect upon her
religion however for she was a member of the presbyterian church and
quite devout about the time of communion the cause of her solicitude
as she gave me frequent opportunity to know by her allusion to the
fact was her having been once afflicted in her own person with a
disorder of the digestive apparatus which it had been the good fortune
of doctor tibbikens to cure by a regimen of bran bread and hickory
ashes water and hence her affection for the doctor and the remedy i
liked the doctor myself because he had the same solicitude about my
health without troubling me with advice except when i asked it or
finding much fault when i did not follow it because his conversation
was agreeable except when he was in a scientific humour and did not
require any efforts on my part to keep it up because he liked terapins
and white-backs as well as myself and was of opinion they were
wholesome provided one ate them in moderation and in fine because
he took pains to help me to amusement and was of great assistance in
dissipating somewhat of that tedium which was the first evil with which
i was afflicted in the body of mr arthur megrim i believe the doctor
had a strong fancy for my sister but she used to declare she could
never think of marrying and thus being drawn from what she felt to
be the chief duty of her existence namely--the care of my digestive
apparatus




 chapter iii


the employments of a young gentleman of fortune


and now having mentioned tedium of existence as being an evil to
which i soon felt myself subject i will say that it was one i found
more oppressive than the reader can readily imagine i had nothing
in the world to do and as it happened my disposition did not lead
me to seek any thing i was in a word the very man my sister had
so reproachfully called me in our first conversation--that is the
laziest man in all virginia and upon reflection i can think of
no person in the world who would bear a comparison with me in that
particular except myself none but himself can be his parallel as
somebody or other says i don't know who a sentiment that is supposed
to be absurd inasmuch as it involves an impossibility but which
becomes good sense when applied to me in my original condition in
the body in which i was first introduced to life i certainly had a
great aversion to all troublesome employments whether of business or
amusement being supposed by many persons to be then what as many
considered me now--to wit the laziest man in my state whether i was
lazier as sheppard lee the jerseyman or arthur megrim the virginian
i am not able to say in both cases indolence was at the bottom of
all my troubles there was this difference however between the two
conditions that whereas i had felt in one the evils of laziness to a
poor man i was now to discover in the other what were its evils to a
man of fortune

my chief employments in the body of mr arthur megrim were eating and
sleeping and i certainly should have done nothing else had i been
allowed to follow my own humours eating and sleeping therefore
consumed the greater portion of my time but it could not consume all
nor could the residue be filled up by the occasional excursions in my
curricle and the still more unfrequent strolls through the village
into which i was driven by my affectionate sister or cajoled by her
coadjutor the doctor in their zealous care of my digestive apparatus
as for visits and visitations i abhorred them all whether they
related to the bustling young gentlemen of the neighbourhood or the
loquacious ladies old and young who cultivated the friendship of my
sister

employ myself however as i might there always remained a portion
of each day which i could not get rid of either in bed or at the
table on such occasions i was devoured by ennui and thought that even
existence was an infliction--that it was hard work to live according
to my sister's account i was a scholar and a genius in which case i
ought to have found employment enough of an intellectual nature either
in books or the reflections of my own mind i certainly had a very
large and fine library in my house and there was scarce a week passed
by in which i did not receive a huge bundle of the newest publications
from a book-seller who had long had it in charge thus to supply me
of these i usually read the title-pages and then turned them over to
my sister or which was more common lent them to my neighbours who
male and female together came flocking to borrow the day after and
sometimes the day before the arrival of each package taking good care
to rob me of those that were most interesting the truth is if i ever
had had the power of reading i had now lost it books only set me
nodding

as for exercising my mind in reflections of its own that was even more
laborious than reading and i contracted a dislike to it particularly
as my mind wore itself out every night in dreaming that being a result
of the goodly suppers i used to eat it is true that i one day fell
into a sudden ferment and being inspired actually seized upon pen and
paper and wrote a poem in blank verse forty lines long with which i
was so pleased that i read it to tibbikens and my sister both of whom
were in raptures with it the former carrying it off to the editor of
the village paper who printed it with such a eulogium upon its merits
as made me believe byron was a fool to me while all the young ladies
immediately paid my sister ann a visit that they might tell me how
they admired the beautiful piece and lament that i wrote so seldom i
forget what the poem was about but i remember i was so delighted with
the praise bestowed on it that i resolved to write another which
however i did not do having unfortunately begun it in rhyme which
was difficult and my fit of inspiration and energy having left me
before i got through with my next dinner it was my writing verses i
suppose that caused me to be called a genius but it seems i was too
lazy to be inspired more than once or twice a year

i relapsed into ennui and truly i became more tired of it before it
was done with me than was ever a labourer of his hod or mattock




 chapter iv


some account of the inconveniences of having a digestive apparatus


but ennui was not the worst of the evils that clouded my happy lot
some touches of that diabolical disorder the curse of the rich man
which as my sister so often gave me to know had threatened the peace
of mr arthur megrim several times before now began to assail my own
serenity and threw gall and ratsbane over my dinners i had slighted
her warnings and despised her advice and now i was to pay the price
of indiscretion in a word that very digestive apparatus on which she
read me a lecture at least thrice a day began to grumble refuse to do
duty and strike though unlike the industrious artisans who were
in all quarters setting it the example it struck not for high wages
of which it had had a surfeit but for low ones in which however its
master was scarce able to oblige it having an uncommonly good appetite
most of the time and even when he had not not well knowing how to
dispose of his time unless at the table

my faithful sister who had been so constant to predict was the first
to detect the coming evil and step by step she pointed it out to my
unwilling observation

arthur said she one morning as we sat at breakfast your eyelid is
winking

augh-- said i yes it is winking

it is a sign said she your digestive apparatus is getting out of
order

augh said i hang the digestive apparatus for i was tired of
hearing it mentioned

arthur said she the next day you are beginning to look yellow and
bilious

yes said i on which she declared that the alkalis of my biliary
fluids--she had studied the whole theory and nomenclature of dyspepsy
out of a book the doctor lent her--were beginning to fail to coalesce
in the natural chymical way with the acids of the chymous mass and
that no better argument could be desired to prove that my digestive
apparatus was getting out of order and she concluded by recommending
me to regulate my diet and fall back upon bran bread and hickory ashes

in short my dear sister assailed me with a pertinacity equal to the
disease itself so that i came in a short time to consider her as one
of its worst symptoms

to add to my woes dr tibbikens began to go over to her opinion to
talk of my digestive apparatus and to drop hints in relation to bran
bread and hickory ashes which would decidedly have robbed him of my
friendship had i not at last found myself unable to do without him

to make a long story short i will omit a detailed history of my
tribulations during the winter and skip at once to the following
spring at the opening of which i found myself young rich and
independent as i was the bond-slave and victim of a malady to which
the woes of age and penury are as the sting of moschetoes to the teeth
of raging tigers

reader i have in the course of this history related to thee many
miseries which it was my lot on different occasions to encounter
and some of them of a truly cruel and insupportable character could
i however give thee a just conception of the ills i was now doomed
to suffer which of a certainty i cannot do unless thou art at this
moment the victim of a similar infliction i am convinced thou wouldst
agree with me that i had now stumbled upon a grief that concentrated
in itself all others of which human nature is capable

dost thou know what it is to have thy stomach stuffed like an
ostrich's with old iron hoops and brickbats--or feeling as if it were
to have it now drowned in vinegar now scorched as with hot potatoes
thy head filled with achings dizziness and streaks of lightning thy
heart transformed into the heels of a hornpipe-dancer and plying thy
ribs lungs and diaphragm with the energy of an artiste in the last
agony

if thou dost then thou wilt know that bodily distress of which the
above miseries form but a small portion is the least of the evils of
dyspepsy--that its most horrible symptoms develop themselves in the
mind what care those devils falsely called blue for they are as
black as midnight or the bile which engenders them for the youth
the wealth the independence the gentility of a man whose digestive
apparatus is out of order the less cause he may have in reality to
be dissatisfied with his lot the more cause they will find him the
greater and more legitimate his claims to be a happy man the more
fierce and determined their efforts to make him a miserable one

the serenity of my mind gave way before the attacks of these monsters
sleeping and waking by day and by night they assailed me with equal
pertinacity and fury if i slept it was only to be tormented by demon
and caco-demon--to be ridden double by incubus and succuba under whose
bestriding limbs i felt like a shetland pony carrying two elephants my
dreams indeed so varied and terrific were the images with which they
afflicted me i can compare to nothing but the horrors or last delirium
of a toper hanging drowning and tumbling down church-steeples were
the common and least frightful of the fancies that crowded my sleeping
brain now i was blown up in a steamboat or run over by a railroad
car now i was sticking fast in a burning chimney scorching and
smothering and now head downwards in a hollow tree with a bear
below snapping at my nose now i was plastered up in a thick wall with
masons hard at work running the superstructure up higher and now i was
enclosed in a huge apple-dumpling boiling in a pot over a hot fire
one while i was crushed by a boa constrictor another perishing by
inches in the mouth of a bengal tiger and again i was in the hands
of dr tibbikens and his scientific coadjutors of the village who
were dissecting me alive in short there was no end to the torments
i endured in slumber and nothing could equal them except those that
beset me while awake

a miserable melancholy seized upon my spirits in which those very
qualifications which everybody envied me the possession of were
regarded with disgust as serving only the purpose of adding to my
tortures what cared i for youth when it opened only a longer vista of
living wretchedness what to me was the wealth which i could not enjoy
which had been given me only to tantalize and as for independence
the idea was a mockery the servitude of a galley-slave was freedom
unlimited license compared with my subjection to dyspepsy and--for
the truth must be confessed--the doctor to whom i was at last obliged
to submit nolens volens




 chapter v


the same subject continued with an account of several surprising
transformations


whether dr tibbikens treated me secundum artem or not i cannot
say but true it is that instead of getting better i grew gradually
worse until my melancholy became a confirmed hypochondriasis and
fancies gloomy and dire wild and strange seized upon my brain and
conjured up new afflictions

getting up early one morning i found to my horror that i had been
in my sleep converted into a coffee-pot a transformation which i
thought so much more extraordinary than any other i had ever undergone
that i sent for my sister ann and imparted to her the singular secret

oh said she bursting into tears it is all on account of your
unfortunate digestive apparatus but oh brother arthur don't let
such notions get into your head a coffee-pot indeed that's too
ridiculous

i was quite incensed at her skepticism but still more so at the
conduct of dr tibbikens who being sent for hearing of my
misfortune and seeing me stand in the middle of the floor with my
left arm akimbo like a crooked handle and the right stretched out
in the manner of a spout seized me by the shoulders and marched me
towards a great hickory fire that was blazing on the hearth

what do you mean tibbikens said i

to warm you said he i like my coffee hot and so i intend to
boil you over again on that very fire

at these words i started trembled and awoke as from a dream assuring
him i had made a great mistake and was no more of a coffee-pot than
he was an assurance that doubtless prevented my undergoing an ordeal
which i was neither saint nor fire-king enough to endure with impunity
indeed i was quite ashamed of having permitted such a delusion to
enter my brain

the next day however a still more afflicting change came over me for
having tried to read a book in which i was interrupted by a great dog
barking in the street i was seized with a rage of a most unaccountable
nature and falling on my hands and feet i responded to the animal's
cries and barked in like manner being quite certain that i was as
much of a dog as he nay my servant epaminondas coming in i seized
him by the leg and would have worried him had he not run roaring out
of the chamber and my sister ann coming to the door i flew at her
with such ferocity that she was fain to escape down stairs the doctor
was again sent for and popping suddenly into the chamber he rushed
upon me with a great horsewhip he had snatched up along the way and
fell to belabouring me without mercy crying out all the while get
out you rascal get out

villain said i jumping on my hind legs and dancing about to avoid
his lashes what do you mean

to whip you down stairs you cur said he flourishing his weapon
again

on which i assured him as earnestly as i could that i was no cur
whatever and indeed i was quite cured of the fancy

my next conceit was the morning being cold and my fire having gone
out that i was an icicle which fancy was dispelled by the doctor
saluting me with a bucket of water on pretence of melting me and i
was doubtless melted all the sooner for being drenched in water exactly
at the freezing-point

after this i experienced divers other transformations being now
a chicken now a loaded cannon now a clock now a hamper of
crockery-ware and a thousand things besides all which conceits the
doctor cured without much difficulty and with as little consideration
for the roughness of his remedies being a chicken he attempted to
wring my neck calling me a dunghill rooster fit only for the pot he
discharged the cannon from my fancies by clapping a red-hot poker to
my nose and the crate of crockery he broke to pieces by casting it on
the floor to the infinite injury of my bones the clock at first gave
him some trouble until pronouncing it to have a screw out of order
he seized upon one of my front teeth with a pair of pincers and by a
single wrench dissipated the delusion for ever




 chapter vi


an account of the woes of an emperor of france which have never before
appeared in history


in short for i do not design particularizing my transformations
further there was no conceit entered my brain which dr tibbikens
did not cure by a conceit until one morning by some mysterious
revelation the nature and means of which can only be guessed at i
found that i had been elected the emperor of france and announced my
intention to set sail for my government immediately in the first ship
of the line which the american executive could put at my disposal

this fancy quite disconcerted dr tibbikens and i heard him say to
my sister he is a gone case now--quite mad i assure you which
expression so much offended me that i ordered him from my presence
and told him that were it not for my respect for the american
government whose subject he was i would have his head for his
impertinence

but wo betide the day the doctor returned to me in less than an hour
bringing with him every physician in the village who having looked
at me a moment went into another apartment where they argued hotly
together for another hour at the expiration of this they returned led
by tibbikens who to my great satisfaction now fell on his knees
and begged my imperial majesty's pardon for presuming to request that
i would allow myself to be dressed in my imperial majesty's robe of
state which robe of state although i was surprised at its plainness
for it was of a coarse linen texture without gold lace or jewels
and of a very strange shape--closed in front and open in the rear i
immediately consented to put on so pleased was i with the homage of
the doctor

if i was surprised at the appearance of the imperial garment much more
was i astonished when having slipped my arms into its sleeves i found
them--that is my arms--suddenly pinioned buried sewed up as it
were among the folds of the robe so that when it was tied behind me
as it immediately was i was as well secured as when i was tied up for
execution on a former occasion alas the disappointment to my pride
i understood the whole matter in a moment my imperial robe of state
was nothing less nor more than a strait waistcoat constructed upon the
spur of the moment but still on scientific principles

and now being entirely at the mercy of the deceitful tibbikens i was
seized upon with a strong hand my head shaved and thrust into a sack
of pounded ice from which it was not taken until after a six days
congelation and then only to be transferred to a nightcap of spanish
flies exceedingly comfortable on the first application but which
within a few hours i had every reason to pronounce the most execrable
covering in existence and what made it still more intolerable i never
complained of it that tibbikens did not assure me it was the imperial
coronet of france and then exclaim in the words of some old play
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

and then i was physicked and starved phlebotomized soused in cold
water and scalded in hot rubbed down with rough blanket cloths and
hair-brushes as stiff as wool-cards scorched with mustard plasters
bombarded by an electrical machine and in general attacked by every
weapon of art which the zeal of my tormentors could bring into play
against me

in this way if i was not cured of my disease i was at least brought
into subjection i ceased complaining which i did at first and with
becoming indignation of the traitorous and sacrilegious violence done
to my anointed body for such i at first considered it the arguments
of my persecutors however to prove the contrary were irresistible
being chiefly syllogisms of which the major proposition was calomel
and jalap the minor mustard plasters and blisters and the conclusion
cold water phlebotomy and flax-seed tea the same arguments varied
categorically according to circumstances convinced me that if my
imperial elevation or the notion thereof was not sheer insanity on my
own part my doctors thought so--which was the same thing in effect
and i therefore took good care when bewailing my hard fate not to
charge it as i at first did to the democratic wrath and jealousy of
my tormentors




 chapter vii


in which sheppard lee is convinced that all is not gold which glistens


this conversion of mine to their own opinion--or if the reader
will so have it my return to rationality--had a favourable effect
on my doctors they removed very circumspectly indeed the strait
jacket from my arms and then seeing i made no attempt to tear them
to pieces but was on the contrary very quiet and submissive and
that instead of claiming to be charlemagne the second of france i
was content to be mr arthur megrim of virginia they were so well
satisfied of the cure they had effected that they agreed to free me of
their company and so left me in the sole charge of tibbikens and my
affectionate sister

in this manner i was cured of hypochondriasis for although i felt
ever and anon a strong propensity to confess myself a joint-stool
a greek demigod or some such other fanciful creature i retained so
lively a recollection of the penalties i had already paid for indulging
in such vagaries that i put a curb on my imagination and resolved
for the future to be nothing but plain mr megrim a gentleman with a
disordered digestive apparatus

i was cured of my hypochondriasis--i may say also of my
dyspepsy--being kept by tibbikens and my sister in such a starved
condition that it was impossible i should ever more complain of
indigestion but i was not yet cured of my melancholy nothing but
canvass-backs and terapins could cure that--and these alas were never
more to bless my lips tibbikens had pronounced their fate and with
them mine thenceforth and for ever my diet was to be looked for in
those--next to my digestive apparatus--chief favourites of my sister
bran bread and hickory ashes my stomach he solemnly assured me would
never be able to sustain any thing else

i say therefore i was melancholy and great reason had i to be so
condemned to live a life of ascetic denial with the means in my hand
to purchase all the luxuries in the world and which was worse an
eternal desire to enjoy them

to banish this melancholy--alas never to be banished--and perhaps to
give me a little appetite for my bran bread and ashes for which i
never could contract a relish the friendly tibbikens again seduced me
into the open air and my carriage and carried me about to different
places in which he thought i might find amusement in this way he had
conducted my prototype the true arthur megrim before me whenever
indolence and the luxuries of the table brought him too near to
dyspepsy and it was this uncommon kindness of the physician in
dragging the unfortunate gentleman to witness the galvanic experiments
on the bodies of the executed felons which had helped him so suddenly
out of his own dr tibbikens was not indeed very choice whither he
carried me lugging me along with equal alacrity to a horse-race a
barbacue or to the bedsides of his patients

all his efforts however were vain the memory of what i had suffered
with the anticipation of what i was yet to endure with doubtless
the addition of the ills for the time being preyed upon my spirit
i followed him mechanically and in a sort of torpor incapable of
enjoying myself incapable almost of noting what passed before me
i was tired of the life of the young and affluent mr megrim and i
should have been glad to exchange his body for some one's else but
unluckily my mind was so weighed down with indolence melancholy and
stupefaction that i really did not think of so natural a means of
ending my troubles

in this condition greatly to the concern of my friendly physician
i remained until towards the end of march when an incident happened
which gave an impulse to my spirit greater than it had ever before
experienced




 chapter viii


in which the author stumbles upon an old acquaintance


the doctor being accustomed to lead or drive me whithersoever he would
and i half the time following without question i found myself led
one day to a house in the town where was a remarkable exhibition or
show as our people called it which had for two days kept the whole
village in an uproar so great however was the abstraction and
indifference of my mind to all objects ordinary and extraordinary
alike that i had paid not the least attention to the accounts of the
matter which my sister and other persons and especially the faithful
epaminondas had during these two days poured into my ears hence
when i entered the exhibition-room i was ignorant of its nature and
indeed indifferent as to making myself better acquainted with it

tibbikens however appeared to be unusually delighted and saying
now megrim my lad you shall see a wonderful proof of the strides
that science is making led me through a crowd of the villagers
old and young and male and female who were present up to a large
table where truly enough in glass cases placed upon the same was a
spectacle quite remarkable though i must confess it did not make so
strong an impression upon me as tibbikens expected

it consisted of an infinite variety of fragments from the bodies of
animals and human beings imitations as i supposed at first in wax
or some other suitable substance and done to the life but tibbikens
assured me they were real specimens taken from animal bodies and
converted by scientific processes known only to the exhibiter into
the substances we now saw some being stony and harder than flint some
again only a little indurated while others retained their natural
softness elasticity and other peculiarities of texture there were
a dozen or more human feet as many hands three heads one of which
was a woman's with long hair and another a child's a calf's head
a dog's leg the ear of a pig the nose of a horse an ox's liver and
heart a rat a snake and a catfish and dozens of other things that i
cannot now remember all of which were surprisingly natural to behold
especially the head of the woman with the long hair which looked as
if it had just been cut off--or rather not cut off at all for there
was no appearance of death about it whatever the lips and cheeks being
quite ruddy and the eyes open and bright though fixed

so much for science said tibbikens look at that boy's head it
don't look so well as the others but who would believe it was solid
stone sir it is stone and silicious stone too for last night i
did myself knock fire out of its nose with the back of my knife and
that's the cause of the nick there on the nostril well now there's
the man's head its texture is ligneous or to speak more strictly
imperfectly carbonaceous though the doctor calls it calcareous but
the wonder of all is the woman's head look at that that sir is
neither silicious nor carbonaceous but fleshy--i say sir fleshy
it remains in its natural condition the skin is soft and resilient
you see the naturalness of the colour of the lips and above all
of the eyes and yet sir that head that flesh is indestructible
unless indeed by fire and strong acids or alkalis it is embalmed
sir embalmed according to the new process of this doctor with the
unpronounceable dutch name and i can tell you sir that the man
is a chymist such as was never heard of before davy lavoisier
berzelius--sir i presume to say they are fools to him and will be
as soon forgotten as their stupid uncivilized system how little
they knew of the true science of chymistry they stopped short at the
elements--our doctor here converts one element into another

tibbikens spoke with an air of consequence and some little oratorical
emphasis for he was surrounded by spectators who listened to what
he said with reverence as for me the little interest excited in my
bosom by the novelty of the exhibition had begun to wear away and i
was sinking again into apathy--the faster perhaps for the doctor's
conversation of which i had a sufficiency every day--and i suppose i
should in a few moments have lost all consciousness of what was going
on around me when suddenly a buzz began and a murmuring of voices
saying here comes the doctor now we shall have the grand show
at the same moment a grinding organ began its lugubrious grunting
and squeaking and the master of the exhibition stalking up to the
table and making his patrons a sweeping semicircular bow cried in a
rumbling bass voice and in accents strongly foreigh--

zhentlemens and leddees--i peg you will excuse me for keep you
waiting vat you see here zhentlemens and leddees is very
strange--pieces of de poddies human and animal shanged py a process
of philosophie very astonish misty and unknown to de multitude some
hard shtone some shtone not so hard and some not shtone at all but i
shall show you de representation vich is de triumph of art de vonder
of science de excellence of philosophie for zhentlemens and leddees
i am no mountepank and showmans put a man of de science a friend of
de species human and a zhentleman of de medical profession and vat i
make dese tings for is not for show nor for pastime nor for de money
but for de utilitie of de vorld

surely thought i to myself i have heard that voice before

i looked into the man's face as soon as the spectators had cleared away
a little--for i was too indifferent to put myself to any trouble--and
i said to myself--nay i said aloud to tibbikens surely i have seen
that man before

where said tibbikens

in jersey i replied hastily for i could not forget the tall
frame the hollow jaws the solemn eyes and the ever-grinning mouth
of feuerteufel the german doctor who had made himself so famous in
my native village and who was one of the last persons i remembered to
have seen upon that day when i bade farewell to my original body

come said tibbikens looking alarmed at my last words you don't
pretend to say you were ever out of virginia in your whole life

augh--oh said i recollecting myself i wonder what i was talking
about what--augh--what is the man's name

feuerteufel said tibbikens




 chapter ix


containing an account of the wonderful discoveries of the german doctor


i was not then mistaken it was feuerteufel himself only he had
learned a little more english this was the first and only one of my
original acquaintances whom i had laid eyes on since my departure from
new-jersey nearly two years before i felt some interest therefore
in the man but it was accompanied with a feeling of dislike and even
apprehension the truth is i never liked the german doctor though
why i never could tell but what was he doing--what could be his
object going about the country with petrified legs arms and heads
i had scarce asked myself the question before it was answered by the
gentleman himself who had been speaking though i know not what all
the time i was talking with tibbikens and while i was cogitating
afterward

he had worked himself into a fit of eloquence warming with enthusiasm
as he dwelt upon the grandeur and usefulness of his discovery he made
antic gestures with hands head and shoulders he rolled and snapped
his eyes in the most extraordinary manner in the world and as for his
mouth there is no describing the grimaces and contortions which it
made over every particularly bright idea or felicitous word

zhentlemens said he i have discover de great art to preserve de

 chapter x


containing a more wonderful discovery on the part of sheppard lee with
perhaps the most surprising adventure that ever befell him


having thus completed his lecture or oration of which i must confess
i had begun to grow tired the german doctor suddenly stepped to a
great round box like a watchman's box that stood at the further end
of the room and unlocking the folding leaves of which it was composed
swung them round with a jerk exhibiting an inner case evidently
of glass but entirely covered over with a thick curtain this he
proceeded to remove by tugging at a string which hoisted it to the
ceiling and as it ascended there was disclosed to the eyes of the
wondering spectators a human figure within the case clad loosely in a
sort of roman garment and for all the world looking entirely like a
living being except that the eyes were fixed in a set unnatural stare
and the attitude was a little stiff and awkward

a murmur with twenty or more faint shrieks from the females present
attested the admiration with which the spectators caught sight of this
wonderful triumph of skill and science but i--heavens and earth
what were my feelings what was my astonishment when i beheld in
that lifeless mummy my own lost body the mortal tenement in which i
had first drawn the breath and experienced the woes of life the
body of sheppard lee the jerseyman this then was its fate--not to
be anatomized and degraded into a skeleton as the vile samuel the
kidnapper had told me but converted into a mummy by a new process for
the especial benefit of science and the world and dr feuerteufel
the man for whom i had always cherished an instinctive dislike and
horror was the worthy personage who had stolen it what time i had
myself interrupted his designs upon the body of the farmer's boy in
the old graveyard near the owl-roost i looked upon my face--that is
the face of the mummy--and a thousand recollections of my original home
and condition burst upon my mind the tears started into my eyes with
them what had i gained by forsaking the lot to which providence had
assigned me in a moment the woes of higginson of dawkins skinner
longstraw tom the slave and megrim the dyspeptic rushed over my
memory contrasted with those lesser ones of sheppard lee which i had
so falsely considered as rendering me the most miserable man in the
world

what other notions may have crowded my brain what feeling may have
entered my bosom i am now unable to describe the sight of my body
thus restored to me and in the midst of my sorrow and affliction
inviting me as it were back to my proper home threw me into an
indescribable ferment i stretched out my arms i uttered a cry and
then rushing forward to the astonishment of all present i struck my
foot against the glass case with a fury that shivered it to atoms--or
at least the portion of it serving as a door which being dislodged
by the violence of the blow fell upon the floor and was dashed to
pieces the next instant disregarding the cries of surprise and fear
which the act occasioned i seized upon the cold and rigid hand of the
mummy murmuring let me live again in my own body and never--no
never more in another's

happiness of happiness although while i uttered the words a boding
fear was on my mind lest the long period the body had lain inanimate
and more especially the mummifying process to which it had been
subjected might have rendered it unfit for further habitation i had
scarce breathed the wish before i found myself in that very body
descending from the box which had so long been its prison and stepping
over the mortal frame of mr arthur megrim now lying dead on the floor

indescribable was the terror produced among the spectators by this
double catastrophe--the death of their townsman and the revival of the
mummy the women fell down in fits and the men took to their heels
and a little boy who was frightened into a paroxysm of devotion
dropped on his knees and began fervently to exclaim

 now i lay me down to sleep
 i pray the lord my soul to keep

in short the agitation was truly inexpressible and fear distracted
all but on no countenance was this passion mingled with a due degree
of amazement more strikingly depicted than on that of the german
doctor who thus compelled to witness the object of a thousand cares
the greatest and most perfect result of his wonderful discovery
slipping off its pedestal and out of his hands as by a stroke of
enchantment stared upon me with eyes nose and mouth speechless
rooted to the floor and apparently converted into a mummy himself as
i stepped past him however hurrying to the door with a vague idea
that the sooner i reached it the better his lips were unlocked and
his feelings found vent in a horrible exclamation--der tyfel which
i believe means the devil--der tyfel i have empalm him too well

then making a dart at me he cried in tones of distraction stop my
mummy mine gott which has cost me so much expense--stop my mummy

i saw that he designed seizing me and being myself as much overcome
with fear as the others i made a bolt for the door knocking down my
friend tibbikens and half a dozen other retreating spectators as i left
it darted into the air and in a moment was flying out of the village
on the wings of the wind

i had a double cause for terror for first before i had got twenty
steps from the exhibition-room for my roman garments were in the way
of my legs and i did not run so fast as i managed to do afterward
i heard certain furious voices cry from the room--it is all a cheat
the mummy was a living man let us lynch him and the doctor and
secondly i could also hear close at my heels the voice of the doctor
himself who had escaped close behind me eagerly vociferating stop
my mummy and i will pay twenty dollare stop my mummy--by both which
noises it was made apparent that i was in danger of being lynched or
subjected to a second process of mummification

nerved therefore by my fears i gathered the skirts of my toga about my
arms and fled with all my might blessing my stars that i had at last
recovered that mortal tenement which with all its troubles i was now
convinced was the best for my purposes in the whole world

containing the conclusion of the history




 chapter i


sheppard lee flies from the german doctor and finds himself again in
new-jersey


the faster i fled the faster it seemed to me i was followed by the
german doctor who i have always believed was driven crazy by the
sudden loss of his beloved mummy and who i had therefore the greatest
reason to fear would if he succeeded in retaking me be content with
nothing short of clapping me again into his glass case were it even
a needful preliminary as in truth it must have been to kill and
embalm me over again and indeed i think the reader will allow that
the fact of his following me three days and three nights still calling
me a mummy charging everybody he met to stop me and persisting to
claim me as his property even after i had got among my own friends
was a proof not only of insanity but of a desperate determination to
rob me of life and liberty

of this determination on his part i was myself so strongly persuaded
and in consequence so overcome by terror that i am inclined to think
i was for a time nearly as mad as himself and i fled from before him
with a speed which the reader can only conceive when i tell him that
i ran from the scene of my transformation on the banks of the potomac
to my native village in new-jersey a distance which i estimate at full
one hundred and eighty miles in the short space of three days and
three nights during which period i rested but once and that on the
second night when being very faint and weary i lay down on the earth
and slept two hours

this may be justly esteemed a truly wonderful exploit and it exceeds
that of the great daniel boone of kentucky of whom it is related that
he ran before a band of wild indians the same distance or thereabouts
in four days time but it must be remembered that i was fleeing from
a raging madman whose speed was so nearly equal to my own that if i
chanced but to flag a little in my exertions at any time i was sure to
see him make his appearance on the rear or to hear his voice screaming
on the winds to stop his mummy indeed i ran with such haste that
i took no note of the road upon which i travelled and to this day i
am ignorant how i succeeded in passing the three great rivers the
potomac the chesapeake and the delaware which lay in my route and
which i must have crossed in some way or other and for the same
reason i am ignorant in what manner i sustained existence during those
three days having not the slightest recollection of eating a single
meal on the whole journey

all that i can remember of the journey is that i ran i knew not
whither but with an instinctive turning of my face towards the north
that i was closely followed by the german doctor and that about
sundown on the third day i found myself to my unspeakable joy
rushing through the owl-roost swamp across the meadow and by that
identical beech-tree where i had first lost my body in full view of
my own house the sight of that once happy home of my childhood filled
me with rapture i rushed towards it hailed by a shout from old jim
jumble my negro-man backed by another from his wife dinah that might
have waked the dead they were so loud and uproarious and found myself
in the arms of my dear but long-neglected sister prudence who with
her husband alderwood and her three young children was standing on
the porch

then being wholly overcome by exhaustion of body and mind and having
endured such fatigues and sufferings from hunger and thirst without
speaking of terror as have seldom oppressed a poor feeble human
being i fell into a swoon from which i awoke only to be assailed by
a violent fever and delirium the direct consequences of my superhuman
exertions that kept me a-bed in a condition between life and death
for more than two weeks

during all this period i recollect being tormented by the hateful
visage of the german doctor who having followed me like a bloodhound
daily forced himself into my chamber claimed me as his property and
would doubtless have carried me off had it not been for my sister my
brother-in-law and the faithful jim jumble the first of whom watched
at my bedside like an angel while the two others opposed themselves
to the enemy and drove him from the room his persecutions indeed
affected me to a degree i cannot express and were the cause that at
the end of the two weeks as above mentioned i suddenly fell into a
lethargy or trance the crisis of my disease in which i lay two days
and then awoke in my full senses free from fever and convalescent

how great was my satisfaction then to behold myself surrounded by my
friends and in my own house how much greater to know i was no longer
to be persecuted by the odious german doctor who my brother-in-law
gave me to understand in reply to my anxious questions had not only
given over all designs on my person but had actually departed from the
neighbourhood and from the state of new-jersey satisfied doubtless
that i was a living man and no longer a mummy




 chapter ii


what had happened at watermelon hill during the author's absence


this intelligence was balm to my spirit and medicine to my body and
the consequence was that i recovered so rapidly as to be able to leave
my bed in less than a week and receive the visits and congratulations
of many old friends who seemed really glad of my return and recovery
though i have no doubt they were moved as much by curiosity to learn
where i had been and what adventures had befallen me during the long
period of my exile in which however i did not think it advisable to
gratify them

and now it was that i discovered that many changes personally
interesting to myself had happened during my absence when i first
got upon my porch and looked about me i almost doubted whether i
was really on the forty-acre my house had been carefully reparied
both within and without a new and substantial stable with other
outbuildings had been erected new fences had been put up around my
fields and orchards cattle were lowing on my meadows and horses
whinnying in the stable to be let loose with them upon the early
grass in a word the forty-acre now looked more prosperous and
flourishing than it had ever before looked mean and empoverished it
looked almost as well as it had done in the days of my father

how was all this change brought about i demanded of my
brother-in-law who with my sister had accompanied or indeed
rather led me to the porch

by the magic of money industry and a little common sense said
alderwood who although a plain and bluff man was a sensible one and
a most excellent farmer you must know my dear sheppard said he
that when we found you were so far gone--

how said i in surprise how did you know i had gone far i thought
the general opinion was that i was murdered

oh yes said my sister nodding at her husband it was just as you
say

with that alderwood smiled and nodded back again saying

prue is right when we discovered your condition--that is when we
found you had been murdered as you say and that there was no one to
look to the poor forty-acre except the sheriff and the mortgagee it
was agreed between your sister and myself that i should take the matter
in hand for we were loath the property should go into the possession
of strangers besides prudence insisted upon being near you--

that is said prudence near to where we supposed the murderers must
have concealed your body

exactly so said alderwood for this reason i left my own farm
in the hands of my young brother robert came down hither bag and
baggage applied a little of my loose cash for i believe i have been
somewhat more prosperous than you to stopping the mouth of your
mortgagee building fences banking meadows spreading marl and so on
and the consequence is that we are getting the forty-acre into good
condition again so that in a few years it will pay the debts and
perhaps begin to make the fortune of its owner

i grasped my brother-in-law's hand i was moved by his kindness and
remembering how after quarrelling with him as related in the first
book of this history i had refused a reconciliation and rejected his
offers of assistance his friendship and generosity appeared still more
worthy of my gratitude

poh said he interrupting my thanks and professions of regard but
looking well pleased that i should be disposed to make them i was
persuaded you would come to some day--that is i mean come back

that is said prudence we always had a notion you were not really
dead and that we should see you again some time alive and happy

i trust said i you will long see me so for i am now a changed
i hope a wiser man--disposed to make the best of the lot to which
heaven has assigned me and to sigh no longer with envy at the supposed
superior advantages of others i think brother alderwood i shall
now be contented with my condition humble and even toilsome as it
may be i have seen enough of the miseries of my fellows--those even
whom i most envied--during the two years of my absence to teach me
that every man has his share of them that there is nothing peculiarly
wretched in my own lot and that i can be happy or not just as i
may choose to make myself for this reason i shall now bid adieu to
indolence and discontent the vile mother and viler daughter together
and do as my father did before me that is cultivate these few acres
which my folly has left me with my own hands nor will i rest from my
labours until i have discharged every claim against it your own my
dear alderwood first of all though i am sensible i can never repay
the debt of kindness i owe you and this is really your intention
demanded alderwood looking prodigiously gratified your possessions
are now limited indeed yet you have enough with a little industry
and care to render you independent for life and if you will really
apply yourself to the farm--

i will said i if labour and perseverance can do it i will attain
the independence you speak of i will remove every encumbrance on the
forty-acre and then trust to pass such a life as modest wishes and a
contented temper can secure me

you may begin to pass it immediately then said alderwood for the
forty-acre is already clear of every encumbrance yes he continued
seeing me look surprised i tell you nothing but the truth aikin
jones your old friend and overseer--

he is a villain said i and he defrauded me

so it is pretty commonly supposed but as we have no legal proof
of his dishonesty the less we say of it the better he has gone to
settle his accounts at a tribunal where craft and policy can avail him
nothing he died eight months ago and they say who know best in great
agony and fear of spirit now whether he was moved by old feelings of
friendship or was struck with remorse at seeing the condition to which
he had reduced you--

what condition said i

oh said my sister the ruin of your affairs nothing more and
alderwood nodded his head by way of assent to the explanation

in short said he mr aikin jones whatever may have been his
motive thought fit to bequeath you a legacy--

what said i how could he leave a legacy to a man universally
considered dead

oh said my sister he never would believe that there were a good
many people had their doubts on that subject

yes said alderwood and mr aikin jones was one of them and so
finding himself dying and being seized perhaps with compunction for
the wrongs he had done you he left you a legacy--no great matter
indeed considering how much of your estate he died possessed of it
sufficed however to pay off your mortgage principal and interest
and to improve and stock the forty-acre just as you now see it so you
see my dear sheppard you are not so badly off as you supposed your
farm is small yet your father drew from it a fortune and i believe a
good farmer might do the same thing a second time but you are not very
learned in agricultural matters i will remain with you a while--at
least until your health is re-established--and be your teacher when
you find yourself competent to the management of the farm i will bid
you farewell assured that you will lead a happier life than you ever
knew before

this intelligence with regard to my little homestead was highly
agreeable to me nor was i less pleased with my brother-in-law's
resolution to remain with me for a time while i acquired a knowledge
of agriculture and confirmed myself in new habits of industrious and
active application




 chapter iii


containing the substance of a singular debate betwixt the author and
his brother with a philosophic defence of the author's credibility


and now having arrived at the close of my adventurous career i have
but a few additions to make to my story before concluding it entirely

i took an early opportunity to impart to my brother-in-law a faithful
account of my adventures as well as a resolution which i had already
formed to commit them to writing and publish them for the benefit of
the world for i was persuaded they contained a moral which might prove
of service to many persons who like myself had fallen into the error
of supposing they were assigned to a harsher lot than their fellows

this resolution alderwood opposed with all his might being concerned
lest such an enterprise as writing a book should divert my mind from
the labours of the farm and indeed seduce me again into habits of
idleness besides he was afraid the strangeness of my adventures
would cause them to be received with incredulity whereby i might
suffer in reputation and be looked upon only as a dreamer and teller
of falsehoods his chief reasons however i doubt not were the two
first mentioned for he was anxious i should now think of nothing but
my farm his dislike to my design was in truth so great that having
exhausted all the arguments he could muster in the vain design to
overcome it he had resort to a new mode of opposition an expedient
highly ingenious but not a little ridiculous he endeavoured to
shake my own faith in my story--to convince me that i had imagined
all i have related and that in a word i had never encountered any
adventures at all i protest i am diverted to this day when i think of
the mingled anxiety and address which he displayed on the occasion he
assured me and that quite plumply that during the whole two years
to speak strictly it was only twenty months of my wanderings i had
never once been off the forty-acre farm that i had never been in any
body besides my own and that the whole source of the notion on my
part lay in a hallucination of mind which had suddenly attacked me
filling me with ridiculous conceits of various transformations such
as never had happened and never could happen to any human being
and this absurd account he persisted in as long as he could with any
decency giving me repeated hints that my mother had died insane
and that it was not therefore strange i should have been a little
odd once in my life i showed him the place where i had been digging
under the beech-tree where by-the-way i was weak enough afterward
to make jim jumble sink a pit twelve feet deep to satisfy myself that
captain kid's money really did not lie there which place however
he averred was as great a proof of the truth of his story as of mine
for said he none but a madman would dig for captain kid's money
i led him to the willow-bushes and the old worm fence in the marsh
where i had found squire higginson's body which he allowed i might
have done but protested that other persons had found it also and that
instead of going home alive in squire higginson's barouche it had
been carried to philadelphia in a coffin and as for higginson's being
clapped into prison for my murder it was i he said who had been
confined on suspicion of having been concerned in his until as he
said it was found that i was out of my wits and that higginson had
died of an apoplexy

i then referred to a circumstance that had happened during my late
sickness as affording the fullest confirmation of my story the
circumstance was this while still lying tormented with fever but at
a moment when my mind was sound and lucid jim jumble put a newspaper
into my hand in which by a singular coincidence appeared an account
of my late transformation in virginia with an allusion to the fate
of zachariah longstraw by which i learned for the first time what
had become of his body after i left it from the article which
strangely and yet naturally enough was headed outrageous humbug
and fatal consequence thereof it seemed to be universally believed
that dr feuerteufel's mummy was no mummy at all but a living man as
i myself had heard it called in the village with whom he had leagued
in a conspiracy to hoax and swindle the good people of the south out
of their money and that the imposture had been detected by mr arthur
megrim who proceeding to force the glass box was knocked down by
the pretended dead man and so unfortunately killed the mummy and
his accomplice the doctor making their escape in the confusion the
editor of the paper after noticing a second account by which it
was asserted that the unfortunate megrim though overturned by the
pretended mummy in his flight had received no injury from him but on
the contrary had died of sheer fright and horror being of a nervous
hypochondriacal turn and acknowledging that this account was more
probable inveighed warmly against the villany and audacity of the
swindlers who he said were more legitimate objects on whom to wreak
the vengeance of lynchdom than the people of that district had found in
zachariah longstraw the philanthropist and here the editor reminded
his readers of the fate of that excellent and distinguished individual
who had died in the lynchers hands the preceding autumn against the
ringleaders of whom his nephew mr jonathan truelove had so vainly
attempted to establish legal proceedings

to this account i say i referred as containing an argument of my
truth not to be resisted but unfortunately the paper had by some
means or other vanished and alderwood said my story went for nothing
without it that paper i have always thought he had himself got
possession of and secreted but had i even retained and shown it to
him i doubt whether it would have affected him in the least for he
was one of those skeptical men who believed a thing none the sooner for
finding it in a newspaper

in a word there is no expressing the obstinacy of my brother in
rejecting my story nor the adroitness with which he met such proofs
as i could give him of the truth of it the last instance of it
which i shall relate was his taking the part of the german doctor
feuerteufel who he declared had not only never made a mummy of me
but had not laid claim to me as his property though he himself that
is my brother-in-law had been present at least a dozen times when
the german doctor did so in my sick-chamber from which alderwood was
so instrumental in expelling him he even insisted that this man
having made a second and last visit to our village to hunt plants and
reptiles had been employed and at his own instance too to cure me
of that very malady he so ridiculously would have me believe i had
been afflicted with and that it was to him under heaven i owed my
restoration to health nay he even went the length of showing me what
he called the doctor's bill and true enough it was a bill with a
receipt in full upon it but the amount being prodigiously great i saw
at once into the whole affair which was nothing less than a masked
contract betwixt my brother-in-law and the doctor whereby the latter
secretly covenanted in consideration of the large sum received from
the former to persecute me no longer with his claims and perhaps to
leave the country altogether

besides all this my brother attacked me by demanding by what means
it was that i had transferred my spirit so often and so easily from
one body to another and this being a question on which the reader
may require satisfaction as well as my brother i must allow that it
presents a difficulty and a very great one all that i can say to
this is first that i did transfer my spirit from body to body
and no less than seven different times secondly that these seven
translations of spirit indicated in me the possession of a peculiar
power to make them and thirdly that the existence of such a peculiar
power however wonderful it may appear is not beyond the bounds of
philosophic probability

no man can be so ignorant or skeptical as to deny that there are
several different faculties of a most marvellous nature with which a
few individuals in the world are mysteriously endowed while the great
mass of men are entirely without them and to the number of these
supernatural endowments there is scarce a year passes by without adding
a new one what can be or ought to be considered a more surprising
faculty than that of ventriloquism--the art of throwing the voice
into places and things afar from the operator of taking as it were
the lungs glottis c from his body and clapping them into a chest
log stone wall or other inanimate substance or into the body of
another and how few are there in the world who possess the power of
doing so one man thumps his chin with his fingers and draws from it
pure and agreeable musical tones and another whistles a melody in
parts while men in general might thump and whistle till their teeth
fell out without producing any music worth listening to what can be
more wonderful than the faculty recently developed by the advocates and
practitioners of a new system of medicine who by shaking a bottle in
a peculiar way give to its contents a medical virtue which did not
exist before and which another man--the patient for example--might
shake till doomsday without imparting

the natural bonesetter is one instance of the possession of a faculty
both rare and astonishing and so is any old woman who can pow-wow the
fire out of a burn not to multiply inferior instances however i will
ask the reader if any faculty can be deemed more incredible than that
of the magnetizer who by flourishing his digits about your body
now cures your rheumatism and now sets you sound asleep--unless it
be that of the magnetized slumberer who reads a sealed letter laid
on his epigastrium sees through millstones and men's bodies and
renders oraculous responses to any question that may be proposed him
even though it be upon subjects of which while awake he is entirely
ignorant

in fine granting all these things to be true and who shall dare to
doubt them why should it not be granted that an individual should
possess the power of transferring his spirit from body to body at
will--a power but little more extraordinary if indeed it be more
extraordinary than the other faculties which are admitted to have
actual existence

to me it seems that the thing is natural enough though still i
grant extremely wonderful many persons are thought to possess the
ventriloquial and even the magnetic power without being conscious of
the endowment accident having been in all cases the cause of their
being made acquainted with its existence in the same way it is not
improbable that other persons besides myself may possess the faculty
of reanimating dead bodies without suspecting it for i can scarce
believe the faculty should be confined entirely to myself




 chapter iv


being the last chapter of all


i never could succeed in convincing my brother-in-law of the truth of
my relation--or rather--for i have always thought his incredulity
was assumed for the purpose mentioned--i never could overcome his
opposition to the design i formed of writing and committing it to the
press for this reason i ceased talking of it more and even affected
to believe the foolish story he had told me of my having conceived
my adventures in a mere fit of delirium this i did not so much out
of compliment to him as from a desire to have him believe i would
let nothing divert me from the business of my farm which indeed i
immediately addressed myself to in such good earnest as secured his
hearty approval and zealous congratulations

in secret however and in the intervals of toil i employed myself
recording my adventures while their impression was still strong on my
memory and now having happily brought them to a conclusion i commit
them to the world confident that if they surprise nobody else they
will cause some astonishment to my brother alderwood

it is now some time since i have been deprived of his and my sister's
company at watermelon hill they having retired to their own farm as
soon as my brother was well convinced i was capable of managing my own
affairs my only society now consists of honest jim jumble his wife
dinah and my sister's oldest son sheppard lee alderwood for he was
named after me a lad of fourteen years but uncommonly shrewd and
sensible for whom i have contracted a strong affection and to whom
if i should die unmarried as is quite probable i design bequeathing
my little patrimony

jim jumble is as independent and saucy as ever but i can bear with his
humours he is so faithful industrious and as i may add so happy
to see his master once more prospering in the world he and dinah are
singing all day long

my estate is small and it may be that it will never increase i am
however content with it and content is the secret of all enjoyment i
am not ashamed to labour in my fields on the contrary i have learned
to be grateful to providence that it ordained me to a lot of toil
wherein i find the truest source of health self-approbation and
happiness my only trouble is an occasional stiffness and sluggishness
of joints and muscles which jim jumble tells me is all owing to my
being naturally a lazy man but which i myself suppose was caused by
my remaining so long a mummy to counterbalance this evil however i
find in myself an astonishing hardiness of constitution particularly
in resisting quinsies catarrhs and defluxions on the breast to which
i was formerly very liable and this immunity i know not how to account
for unless by supposing that my body was hardened by the process of
mummifying and that it still continues to be water-proof

at all events--be my body what it may hardy or frail stiff or supple
i am satisfied with it and shall never again seek to exchange it for
another

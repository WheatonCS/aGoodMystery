i have often debated in my mind whether i should give to the world
or for ever lock up within the secrecy of my own breast the history
of the adventures which it has been my lot in life to experience the
importance of any single individual in society especially one so
isolated as myself is so little that it can scarcely be supposed
that the community at large can be affected by his fortunes either
good or evil or interested in any way in his fate yet it sometimes
happens that circumstances conspire to elevate the humblest person
from obscurity and to give the whole world an interest in his
affairs and that man may safely consider himself of some value in his
generation whose history is of a character to instruct the ignorant
and inexperienced such a man i consider myself to be and the more
i reflect upon my past life the more i am convinced it contains a
lesson which may be studied with profit while at the same time
if i am not greatly mistaken the lesson will be found neither dry
nor repulsive but here and there on the contrary quite diverting
the psychologist i hate big words but one cannot do without them
and the metaphysician will discover in my relation some new subjects
for reflection and so perhaps will the doctor of medicine and the
physiologist but while i leave these learned gentlemen to discuss what
may appear most wonderful in my revealments i am most anxious that the
common reader may weigh the value of what is at least in appearance
more natural simple and comprehensible

it will be perceived that many of the following adventures are of a
truly extraordinary character there are some men and to such my story
will seem incredible enough who pride themselves on believing nothing
that they do not know and who endeavour very absurdly to restrict
the objects of belief to those that admit of personal cognizance there
are others again who boast the same maxim but have a more liberal
understanding of the subjects of knowledge and permit themselves
to believe many things which are susceptible of satisfactory proof
but not of direct cognition now i must declare beforehand in order
to avoid all trouble that from the very nature of the life i have
led consisting of the strangest transitions and vicissitudes it is
impossible i should have laid up proofs to satisfy any one of the truth
of my relation who is disposed to be incredulous if any one should
say i doubt all the answer i could make would be doubt and be
hanged not however meaning any offence to anybody though it is
natural one should be displeased at having his veracity questioned
i write for the world at large which is neither philosophic nor
skeptical and the world will believe me otherwise it is a less
sensible world than i have all along supposed it to be




chapter ii


the birth and family of sheppard lee with some account of his temper
and complexion of mind


i was born somewhere towards the close of the last century but
the register-leaf having been torn from the family bible and no one
remaining who can give me information on the point i am not certain as
to the exact year in the state of new-jersey in one of the oldest
counties that border upon the delaware river my father was a farmer
in very good circumstances respectable in his degree but perhaps
more famous for the excellent sausages he used to manufacture for the
philadelphia market than for any quality of mind or body that can
distinguish one man from his fellows taking the hint from his success
in this article of produce he gradually converted his whole estate
into a market-farm raising fine fruits and vegetables and such
other articles as are most in demand in a city in which enterprise
he succeeded beyond his highest expectations and bade fair to be
as in the end he became a rich man the only obstacle to a speedy
accumulation of riches was a disproportionate increase in the agents
of consumption his children multiplying on his hands almost as fast
as his acres until he could count eleven in all a number that filled
him at one time with consternation he used to declare no apple could
be expected to ripen on a farm where there were eleven children and
as for watermelons and sugar-corn it was folly to think of raising
them longer but fate sent my father relief sooner and more effectually
than he either expected or desired nine of the eleven being removed
by death in a space of time short of six years three two of whom
were twin sisters were translated in the natural way falling victims
to an epidemic and were buried in the same grave a fourth was soon
after killed by falling out of an apple-tree my eldest brother then a
boy of fourteen years old upon some freak ran away from home for he
was of a wild madcap turn and getting into an oyster-boat made a
voyage into the bay where he was lost for having fallen overboard
and not being able to swim a clumsy fellow who thought to save him
in that way clutched him round the neck with a pair of oyster-tongs
and thereby strangled him two others were drowned in a millpond where
they were scraping for snapping-turtles another who was the wag of
the family was killed by attempting to ride a pig which running
in great alarm through a broken fence into the orchard dashed his
brains out against a white-oak rail and the ninth died of a sort of
hysterical affection caused by this unlucky exploit of his brother
for he could not cease laughing at it notwithstanding its melancholy
termination and he died of the fit within twenty-four hours

thus in a few years there remained but two of all the eleven
children to wit my oldest sister prudence and myself my mother
from whom i had my christian name sheppard that being her maiden
name died several years before this last catastrophe her mind having
been affected and indeed distracted by so many mournful losses
occurring in such rapid succession she fell into a deep melancholy
and died insane

being one of the youngest children i grieved but little for the loss
of my brothers and sisters nor was i able to appreciate the advantage
which in a worldly point of view their death must prove to me my
father however perceived the difference for having now so few to
look after and be chargeable to him he could with great propriety
consider himself a rich man he immediately resolved as i was now his
only son that i should have a good education and it was not his fault
if in this particular i fell short of his expectations i was sent
to good schools and in course of time was removed to the college at
nassau hall in princeton where i remained during three years that
is until my father's decease when i yielded to the natural indolence
of my temper and left the college or rather for i had formed no
resolution on the subject procrastinated my return from day to day
until it was too late to return

my natural disposition was placid and easy i believe i may say
sluggish i was not wanting in parts but had as little energy or
activity of mind as ever fell to the share of a jerseyman and how
my father ever came to believe i should make a figure in the world
i cannot conceive unless it was because he knew he had a fortune to
leave me and saw me safely lodged in a college it is very certain he
encouraged a strong belief that i should one day be a great man and
i fancy it was for this reason he showed himself so favourable to me
in his will he left me the bulk of his property bestowing upon my
sister who had recently married little beyond a farm which he had
purchased in a neighbouring county but which was a valuable one and
quite satisfied her husband

but my father was a better judge of sausages than of human character
besides being deficient as i humbly confess in all those qualities
that are necessary to the formation of a great man i had not the
slightest desire to be one ambition was a passion that never afflicted
my mind and i was so indifferent to the game of greatness which was
playing around me that i seriously declare there was a president
of the united states elected to office and turned out again after
having served his regular term without my knowing any thing about it
i had not even the desire so common to young men who find themselves
in possession of a fortune to launch out into elegant expenses to
dash about the country with fine horses servants and clothes and
to play the spendthrift in cities on the contrary i no sooner found
myself arrived at my majority which was a few months after my father's
death than i sat down very quietly on the farm resolved to take the
world easily which i supposed i might easily do i had some idea of
continuing to conduct the estate as my father had done before me but
it was a very vague one and having made one or two efforts to bear
myself like a man of business i soon found the effort was too tiresome
for one of my disposition and i accordingly hired an overseer to
manage the property for me




chapter iii


the pleasures of having nothing to do some thoughts on matrimony


having thus shuffled the cares of business from my shoulders to
another's my time began to weigh a little heavily on my hands and i
cast about for some amusement that might enable me to get rid of it as
there was great abundance of small game such as quails partridges
and rabbits in the neighbourhood i resolved to turn sportman and
in consequence i bought me a dog and gun and began to harry the
country with some spirit but having the misfortune to shoot my dog the
first day and soon after a very valuable imported cow belonging
to a neighbour for which i was obliged to pay him enormous damages
and meeting besides with but little luck i grew disgusted with the
diversion my last shot was soon fired for having forgotten the
provisions of our game-laws i killed a woodcock too early in the
summer for which on the information of a fellow who owed me a grudge
i was prosecuted although it was the only bird i ever killed in all my
life and soundly fined and this incensed me so much that i resolved
to have nothing more to do with an amusement that cost so much money
and threw me into so many difficulties

i was then at a loss how to pass my time until a neighbour who bred
fine horses persuaded me to buy a pair of blooded colts and try my
luck on the turf and this employment though rather too full of cares
and troubles to suit me exactly i followed with no little spirit
and became more proud of my horses than i can well express until i
came to try them on the race-course where it was my luck what with
stakes and betting together to lose more money in a single day than
my father had ever made in two years together i then saw very clearly
that horse-racing was nothing better than gambling and therefore both
disreputable and demoralizing for which reason i instantly gave it up
heartily sick of the losses it had occasioned me

my overseer or steward for such he may be considered whom i always
esteemed a very sensible fellow for he was shrewd and energetic
and at least ten years my senior then advised me as i was a young
man with money enough to travel a little and see the world and
accordingly i went to new-york where i was robbed of my luggage and
money by a villain whose acquaintance i made in the steamboat and
whom i thought a highly intelligent gentlemanly personage though
as it afterward appeared he was a professor from sing-sing where he
had been sawing stone for two years the governor of new-york having
forgiven him as is the custom the five other years for which he was
committed for i believe a fraud committed on his own father

this loss drove me home again but being re-encouraged by my overseer
i filled my purse and set out a second time passing up the hudson
river with which i was prodigiously pleased though not with the
overslaugh where we stuck fast during six hours i then proceeded
to saratoga where i remained for two weeks on account of its being
fashionable but i declare to heaven i was never so tired of any
place in my life i then went to niagara which in spite of the great
noise it made i thought the finest place in the world and there i
think i should have continued all summer had it not been for the
crowds of tiresome people that were eternally coming and going and
the great labour of climbing up and down the stairs however i was so
greatly pleased with what i saw both at niagara and along the way
that i should have repeated my travels in after years as the most
agreeable way of passing time had it not been for the dangers and
miseries of such enterprises for first the coaches were perpetually
falling over or sticking in the mud or jolting over stones so that
one had no security of life or limb and secondly the accommodations
at the inns along the road were not to my liking the food being cooked
after the primitive systems of shem ham and japheth and the beds
stuck together in the rooms as if for boys at a boarding-school it
is possible that these things are better ordered now but from what
i have since seen and heard i am of opinion there is a fine field
for cooks carpenters and chamber-maids in the agricultural regions
of america in those days i loved ease and comfort too well to submit
to such evils as could be avoided and accordingly after a little
experience in the matter i ceased travelling altogether the pleasures
bearing no sort of proportion to the discomforts

my time still weighing upon my hands i was possessed with a sudden
idea which my steward however endeavoured to combat namely
that the tedium of my existence might be dispelled by matrimony and
i resolved to look around me for a wife after much casting about
i fixed my eyes upon a young lady of the village for i must inform
the reader that my farm was on the skirts of a village and a very
respectable one too although there were many lazy people in it who
i thought was well fitted to make me comfortable and as she did not
seem averse to my first advances i began to be quite particular until
all the old women in the country declared it was a match and all the
young fellows of my own age as well as all the girls i knew became
extremely witty at my expense these things however rather encouraged
me than otherwise i believed i was advancing my happiness by the
change i contemplated in my condition and i was just on the point of
making formal proposals to the young lady when an accident set me to
considering the enterprise entirely in a new light

my charmer lived in the house of a married sister who had a large
family of children a pack of the most ill-bred imps i verily
believe that were ever gathered together in any one man's house but
for politeness sake during the first weeks of my courtship the young
sinners were kept out of my way and what with cuffing and feeding
with sugarplums were preserved in some sort of order so that i was
not annoyed by them after a while however and when matters had
proceeded some length it was thought unnecessary to treat me longer
as a stranger the children were suffered to take care of themselves
and the consequence was that in a short time i found myself in a
kind of pandemonium whenever i entered the house with such a whining
and squeaking and tumbling and bawling and fighting among the young
ones as greatly discomposed my nerves and to make the matter worse
the mother made no difficulty at times when the squabbling grew to a
height of taking a switch to one and boxing the ears of another and
scolding roundly at a third to reduce them to order and all this in
my presence and under the nose of my charmer

i began to fancy the married life could not be altogether so agreeable
as i had pictured it to my imagination and in this belief i was
confirmed by a visit to my sister who had three children of her own
all of whom as i now perceived for i had not noticed it before
having no particular inducement to make me observant were given to
squabbling and bawling just like other children while my sister did
her share of boxing and scolding i thought to myself what should i
do with a dozen children squeaking all day and night in my house and a
scolding wife dragooning them into submission

the thought disconcerted me and the fear of such a consummation
greatly chilled the ardour of my affection so that the young lady
observing my backwardness and taking offence at it cast her eyes upon
another wooer who had made her an offer and to my great satisfaction
married him on the spot

i was never more relieved in my life and i resolved to reflect longer
upon the subject before making advances of that nature a second time
my overseer who had from the first for i made him my confidant been
opposed to the match on the ground that i ought to enjoy my liberty
at least until i was thirty was greatly rejoiced at the rupture and
swore that i had made a lucky escape for he had always thought in his
own mind that the lady was at bottom though she concealed it from
me a tartar and fire-eater in this however he was mistaken for
from all i have heard of her since she has proved a most amiable and
sweet-tempered woman and her husband is said to be very happy with her




chapter iv


how to conduct a farm to the best advantage and steer clear of the
lawyers


it is not my intention to dwell longer upon the history of this period
of my life nor to recount in detail how my easy and indolent temper at
last proved the ruin of me i gave myself up to laziness neglecting
my affairs to such a degree that they soon became seriously entangled
and to make a long story short i found myself before i had completed
my twenty-eighth year reduced from independence and almost affluence
to a condition bordering upon actual poverty my farm under the
management of mr aikin jones for that was my steward's name went
gradually to ruin my orchards rotted away without being replanted my
meadows were converted into swamps my corn-fields filled with gullies
my improvements fell into decay and my receipts began to run short of
my expenses then came borrowing and mortgaging and by-and-by the
sale of this piece of land to remove the encumbrance upon that
until i suddenly found myself in the condition of my father when he
began the world that is to say the master of a little farm of forty
acres the centre and nucleus of the fifteen hundred which he had
got possession of and bequeathed to me but which had so soon slipped
through my fingers there was this difference however between us the
land when my father obtained it was in good condition it was now
so well had it prospered under jones's hands entirely worn out and
empoverished and not worth a fourth part of its original value

to add to my chagrin i discovered that mr aikin jones whom i had
treated rather as a friend than servant had abused my confidence in
other words that he was a rogue and villain who had taken advantage
of my disinclination to business and my ignorance as i believe i
must call it to swindle me out of my property which he had the best
opportunities to do whether he effected his purpose by employing
my own funds or not i cannot say but it is very certain all the
different mortgages in which i was entangled came some how or other
by hook and by crook into his hands and he took care to make the
best use of them in a word mr jones became a rich man and i a poor
one and i had the satisfaction every day when i took a walk over my
forty-acre farm as the place was familiarly called though the true
name was watermelon hill to find myself stopped which way soever i
directed my steps by the possessions of mr aikin jones my old friend
and overseer whom i often saw roll by in his carriage while i was
trudging along through the mud

at the same time that i met with this heavy misfortune i had to endure
others that were vexatious enough my brother-in-law and sister had
their suspicions of mr jones and often cautioned me against him
though in vain not that i had any very superstitious reliance on the
gentleman's integrity but because i could not endure the trouble of
examining into his proceedings and accounts and chose therefore to
believe him honest this and my general indolence and indifference to
my affairs incensed them both to that degree that my sister did not
scruple to tell me to my face that i had lost all the little sense i
ever possessed while my brother-in-law took the freedom of saying of
me in public that i was wrong in the upper story in other words
that i was mad and he had the insolence to hint that it ran in my
blood that i had inherited it from my mother she as i mentioned
before having lost her mind before her decease i was so much
irritated by these insults on their part that i quarrelled with them
both though by no means of a testy or choleric disposition and it was
many years before we were reconciled having therefore neither friends
nor family i was left to bear my misfortunes alone which was a great
aggravation of them all




chapter v


the author finds himself in trouble some account of his servant
honest james jumble


i have always described myself as of an easy contented disposition
and such i was born but misfortune produces sad changes in our
tempers as it was soon my lot to experience before however i
describe the change that took place in mine it is fit i should let the
reader understand to what condition i was reduced by the perfidy of
jones or as i should rather say by my own culpable neglect of my
affairs

my whole landed possessions consisted of a farm of forty acres which
i had after the fashion of some of my richer neighbours in other
states suffered to fall into the most wretched condition imaginable
my meadow-lands being broken in upon by the river and neglected
were converted into quagmires reed-brakes and cat-tail patches the
only use of which was to shelter wild-fowl and mire cattle however
my live-stock was scanty enough and the only sufferers were my
neighbours whose cows easily made their way through my fences and
stuck fast in the mud at their pleasure my fields were overgrown
here with mullein and st john's-wort and there with sand-burs and
poke-berries my orchards were in an equally miserable condition the
trees being old rotten or worm-eaten half of them torn down by
the winds and the remainder fit for nothing but fire-wood my barn
was almost roofless and as for a stable i had so little occasion
for one that my old negro-man jim of whom i shall have more to say
hereafter or his wife dinah or both together thinking they could
do nothing better with it helped the winds to tear it to pieces
especially in the winter when it formed a very convenient wood-pile
my dwelling-house was also suffering from decay it was originally a
small frame building but my father had added to it one portion after
another until it became spacious and the large porches in front and
on the rear gave it quite a genteel janty air but this it could not
long keep the sun and rain gradually drove the white paint from the
exterior and the damps getting inside the fine paper-hangings pied
and spotted peeled from the walls the window-frames rotted and the
glasses left them one after another and one day in a storm one half
the front porch tumbled down and the remainder which i propped up as
well as i could had a mighty mean and poverty-stricken appearance
the same high wind carried away one of my chimneys which falling on
a corner of the roof crushed that into the garret and left one whole
gable-end in ruins

it must not be supposed that my property presented altogether this
wretched appearance at the moment of my losses it was in truth bad
enough then but i am now describing it as it appeared some few years
after when my miseries were accumulated in the greatest number and i
was just as poor as i could be

in all this period of trouble and vexation i had but one friend if i
dare call him such though i should have been glad half the time to be
rid of him this was my negro-man jim or jim jumble as he was called
of whom i spoke before an old fellow that had been a slave of my
father and was left to me in his will he was a crabbed self-willed
old fellow whom i could never manage but who would have all things
his own way in spite of me as i had some scruples of conscience about
holding a slave and thought him of no value whatever but on the
contrary a great trouble i resolved to set him free and accordingly
mentioned my design to him when to my surprise he burst into a
passion swore he would not be free and told me flatly i was his
master and i should take care of him and the absurd old fool ended by
declaring if i made him a free man he would have the law of me he
would by ge-hosh

i never could well understand the cause of his extreme aversion to
being made free but i suppose having got the upper hand of me and
being wise enough to perceive the difference between living on the one
hand a lazy life without any care whatever as my slave and on the
other labouring hard to obtain a precarious subsistence as a free man
he was determined to stick by me to the last whether i would or not
some little affection for me as i had grown up from a boy as it were
under his own eye was perhaps at the bottom of his resolution but if
there were it was of a strange quality as he did nothing but scold
and grumble at me all day long i remember in particular that when
the match i spoke of before was broken off and he had heard of it he
came to me in a great passion and insolently asked what i meant by
courting a wife who would be a good mistress to him and not marrying
her and on my condescending to explain the reasons of my change of
mind he told me plumply i had no more sense than a nigger for women
was women and children children and he was tired living so long in a
house with none but me and massa jones for company

i suppose it was old jim's despair of my ever marrying that put him
upon taking a wife himself for one day not long after i was reduced
to the forty-acre farm he brought home a great ugly free negro-woman
named dinah whom he installed into the kitchen without the least
ceremony and without so much as even informing me of his intention
having observed her two or three times and seeing her at last come
bouncing into the dinner-room to wait on me i asked her who she was
and what she wanted to which she answered she was jim's wife and
jim had sent her in to take care of me

it was in this way the old rascal used me it was in vain to complain
he gave me to understand in his own language he knew what was what
and there was no possuming an old nigger like him and if i had made
him overseer instead of massa jones it would have been all the
better for me

and in truth i believe it would for jim would never have cheated
me except on a small scale and if he had done no work himself it is
very certain he would have made everybody else work for he was a hard
master when he had anybody under him

i may here observe and i will do the old fellow the justice
to confess that i found him exceedingly useful during all my
difficulties what labour was bestowed upon the farm was bestowed
almost altogether by him and his wife dinah it is true he did just
what he liked and without consulting me planting and harvesting and
even selling what he raised as if he were the master and owner of all
things and laying out what money he obtained by the sales just as his
own wisdom prompted and finding i could do nothing better i even let
him have his own way and it was perhaps to my advantage that i did

but i grew poorer and poorer notwithstanding and at that period
which i shall ever be inclined to consider as the true beginning of my
eventful life i was reduced almost to the point of despair for my
necessities had compelled me to mortgage the few miserable acres i had
left and i saw nothing but utter ruin staring me in the face




chapter vi


sheppard lee experiences his share of the respect that is accorded to
honest poverty his ingenious and highly original devices to amend
his fortune


it may be asked why i made no efforts to retrieve my fortunes i
answer to that that i made many but was so infatuated that i never
once thought of resorting to the most obvious rational and only
means that is to say of cultivating with industry my forty acres as
my father had done before me this idea so sluggish was my mind or so
confused by its distresses never once occurred to me or if it did
it presented so many dreary images and so long a prospect of dull and
disagreeable labour that i had not the spirit to pursue it the little
toil i was forced to endure for my necessities now compelled me at
times to work with my own hands appeared to me intolerably irksome
and i was glad to attempt any thing else that seemed to promise me good
luck and did not require positive labour

the first plan of bettering my fortune that i conceived was to buy
some chances in a lottery which i thought an easy way of making money
as indeed it is when a man can make any i had my trouble for my
pains with just as many blanks as i had bought tickets upon which i
began to see clearly that adventuring in a lottery was nothing short of
gambling as it really is and so i quitted it

i then resolved to imitate the example of a neighbour who had made
a great sum of money by buying and selling to advantage stock in a
southern gold-mining company and being very sanguine of success i
devoted all the money i could scrape together to the purpose and that
so wisely that a second instalment being suddenly demanded i had
nothing left to discharge it with and no means of raising any the
consequence of which was that i was forced to sell at the worst time
in the world and retired from the concern with just one fifth the sum
i had invested in it i saw then that i had no talent for speculating
and i began to have my doubts whether stock-jobbing was not just as
clear gambling as horse-racing and lottery speculation

i tried some ten or a dozen other projects with a view to better my
condition but as i came off with the same luck from all i do not
think it necessary to mention them i will however state as a proof
how much my difficulties had changed my mind on that subject that
one of them was of a matrimonial character my horror of squabbling
children and scolding wives melted away before the prospect of sheriffs
and executions and there being a rich widow in the neighbourhood
i bought me a new coat and made her a declaration but it was too
late in the day for me as i soon discovered for besides giving me
a flat refusal she made a point of revealing the matter to all her
acquaintance who did nothing but hold me up to ridicule

i found that my affairs were falling into a desperate condition and
not knowing what else to do i resolved to turn politician with the
hope of getting some office or other that might afford me a comfortable
subsistence

this was the maddest project that ever possessed my brain but it was
some time before i came to that conclusion but in truth from having
been the easiest and calmest tempered man in the world i was now
become the most restless and discontented and incapable of judging
what was wise and what foolish i reflected one day that of my old
school and college mates who were still alive there was not one who
had not made some advance in the world while i had done nothing but
slip backwards it was the same thing with dozens of people whom i
remembered as poor farmers boys with none of the advantages i had
possessed but who had outstripped me in the road to fortune some
being now rich cultivators some wealthy manufacturers and merchants
while two or three had got into the legislature and were made much
of in the newspapers one of my old companions had emigrated to the
mississippi where he was now a cotton-planter with a yearly revenue
of twenty or thirty thousand dollars another had become a great
lawyer in an adjacent state and a third whom i always thought a
very shallow ignorant fellow and who was as poor as a rat to boot
had turned doctor settled down in the village and besides getting
a great practice had married the richest and finest girl in all the
county there was no end to the number of my old acquaintances who had
grown wealthy and distinguished and the more i thought of them the
more discontented i became

my dissatisfaction was increased by discovering with what little
respect i was held among these happy people the doctor used to treat
me with a jocular sort of familiarity which i felt to be insulting
the lawyer who had eaten many a dinner at my table when i was able to
invite him began to make me low bows instead of shaking hands with
me and the cotton-planter who had been my intimate friend at college
coming to the village on a visit to his relations stared me fiercely
in the face when i approached him and with a lordly hum ha asked me
who the devil i might be as for the others they treated me with as
little consideration and i began to perceive very plainly that i had
got into the criminal stage of poverty for all men were resolved to
punish me it is no wonder that poverty is the father of crime since
the poor man sees himself treated on all hands as a culprit

i had never before envied a man for enjoying more consideration in
the world than myself but the discovery that i was looked upon with
contempt filled me with a new subject for discontent i envied my
richer neighbours not only for being rich but for being what they
considered themselves my superiors in standing i may truly say i
scarce ever saw in those days a man with a good coat on his back
without having a great desire to beat him but as i was a peaceable
man my anger never betrayed me into violence




chapter vii


the author becomes a politician and seeks for an office the result
of that project


my essay in politics was soon made i spent a whole week in finding
out who were the principal office-holders candidates and busybodies
both in the state and the general governments and which were the
principal parties there being so many that an honest man might easily
make a mistake among them being satisfied on these points i chose
the strongest party on the principle that the majority must always be
right and attended the first public meeting that was held where i
clapped my hands and applauded the speeches with so much spirit that
i was taken notice of and highly commended by several of the principal
leaders in truth i pleased them so well that they visited me at my
house and encouraged me to take a more prominent part in the business
of politics and this i did for at the next meeting i got up and
made a speech but what it was about i know no more than the man in
the moon otherwise i would inform the reader my only recollection of
it is that there was great slashing at the banks and aristocrats that
ground the faces of the poor for i was on what our opponents called
the hurrah side and these were the things we talked about i received
uncommon applause and in fact there was such a shouting and clapping
of hands that i was obliged to put an end to my discourse sooner than
i intended

but i found myself in great favour with the party and being advised
by the leaders who considered i had a talent that way to set about
converting all i knew in the county who were not of our party and they
hinting that i should certainly in case the county was gained for our
county happened to be a little doubtful at that time be appointed
to the postoffice in the village i mounted my old horse julius
cesar and set out with greater zeal than i had ever shown in my life
before i visited everybody that i knew and a great many that i did
not know and wherever i went i held arguments and made speeches
with a degree of industry that surprised myself for certainly i was
never industrious before it is certain also that there was never a
labourer in the field of politics that better deserved his reward 
never a soldier of the party ranks that had won a better right to a
share in the spoils of victory i do not pretend to say indeed that
i converted anybody to our belief for all seemed to have made up
their minds beforehand and i never yet knew or heard of a man that
could be argued out of his politics who had once made up his mind on
the subject i laboured however and that with astonishing zeal and
as i paid my own expenses and treated all thirsty souls that seemed
approachable in that way to good liquor i paid a good round sum
that i could ill spare for the privilege of electioneering and was
therefore satisfied that my claim to office would hold good

and so it did as was universally allowed by all the party but the
conviction of its justice was all i ever gained in reward of my
exertions the battle was fought and won the party was triumphant
and i was just rejoicing in the successful termination of my hopes
when they were blasted by the sudden appointment of another to the very
office which i considered my own that other was one of the aforesaid
leaders who had been foremost in commending my zeal and talents and
in assuring me that the office should be mine

i was confounded petrified enraged the duplicity and perfidy of my
new friends filled me with indignation it was evident they must all
have joined in recommending my rival to the office for he was a man
of bad character who must without such recommendations have missed
his aim all therefore had recommended him and all had promised their
suffrages to me the scoundrels said i to myself i perceived that
i had fallen among thieves it was clear that no party could be in the
right which was led by such unprincipled men there was corruption at
the heart of the whole body the party consisted of rogues who were
gaping after the loaves and fishes their honesty was a song their
patriotism a farce in a word i found i had joined the wrong party
and i resolved to go over to the other sincerely repenting the
delusion that had made me so long the advocate of wrong and deception

but fortune willed otherwise i had arrived at the crisis of my fate
and before i could put my purpose into execution i was suddenly
involved in that tissue of adventure which i have no doubt will be
considered the most remarkable that ever befell a human being



chapter viii


a description of the owl-roost with mr jumble's ideas in relation to
captain kid's money


for five mortal days i remained at home chewing the bone of
reflection and a hard bone it was on the sixth there came a villanous
constable with a the reader may suppose what i struck a bargain with
him and he took his leave and julius cesar also saddle bridle and
all whereby i escaped an introduction to the nearest justice of the
peace the next visit i had good reason to apprehend would be from
the sheriff for having failed to pay up the interest on the mortgage
the mortgagee had discoursed and that in no very mysterious strain
on the virtues of a writ of venditioni exponas or some other absurd
and scoundrelly invention of the lawyers i was at my wits end and
i wished that i was a dog in which case i should have gone mad and
bitten the new post-master and all his friends

very well said i to myself the forty-acre is no longer mine i
clapped on my hat and walked into the open air resolved to take a
look at it before the sheriff came to convince me it belonged to some
other person as i passed from the door i looked up to the broken
porch may it fall on the head of my successor i said

it was a summer eve a day in july but a raw wind blew from the
northeast and the air was as chill as in november i buttoned my coat
and as i did so took a peep at my elbows i required no second look to
convince me that i was a poor man

the ruined meadows of which i have spoken lie on a little creek that
makes in from the delaware their shape is the worst in the world
being that of a triangle the longest leg of which lies on the water
hence the expense of embanking them is formidable a circumstance for
which the muskrats have no consideration the apex of the angle is a
bog lying betwixt two low hillocks or swells of ground between which
crawls a brook scarce deep enough to swim a tadpole though an ox may
hide in the mud at the bottom it oozes from a turfy ledge or bar a
few feet higher than the general level of the hollow which terminates
above it in a circular basin of two acres in area this circular
basin is verdant enough to the eye the whole surface being covered
by a thick growth of alders arrow-wood water-laurels and other
shrubs that flourish in a swamp as well as a bountiful sprinkling of
cat-tails on the edges the soil is a vegetable jelly and how any
plant of a pound in weight could ever sustain itself on it i never was
able to comprehend it is thought to be the nearest road to the heart
of the chinese empire to find which all that is necessary to do is
to take a plunge into it head foremost and keep on until you arrive at
daylight among the antipodes

the whole place has a solitary and mournful appearance which is to
many made still more dreary and even sepulchral by the appearance of
a little old church built by the swedes many a year ago but now in
ruins and the graveyard around it these being but a short distance
off and on the east side of the hollow the spot is remote from my
dwelling and apparently from all others nevertheless there is a small
farmhouse it was once mine on a by-road not many rods from the old
church a path not often trodden leads from my house to the by-road
and crosses the hollow by the grassy ledge spoken of before it is the
shortest path to the village and i sometimes pursued it when walking
thither

this lonesome spot had a very bad name in our neighbourhood and was
considered to be haunted its common name was the owl-roost given
it in consequence of the vast numbers of these birds that perched
and i believe nested in the centre of the swamp where was a place
comparatively dry or supposed to be so for i believe no one ever
visited it and a clump of trees larger than those in other places
some called the place captain kid's hole after that famous pirate who
was supposed to have buried his money there as he is supposed to have
buried it in a hundred thousand other dismal spots along the different
rivers of america old jim jumble was a devout believer in the story
and often tried his luck in digging for the money but without success
which he attributed to the circumstance of his digging in the daytime
whereas midnight was in his opinion the only true time to delve for
charmed treasure but midnight was the period when the ghosts came down
from the old graveyard to squeak about the swamp and i never heard of
jim being found in that neighbourhood after nightfall the truth is
the owls never hear any one go by after dark without saluting him with
a horrible chorus of hooting and screeching that will make a man's
hair rise on his head and i have been sometimes daunted by them myself

to this place i directed my steps and being very melancholy i sat
down at the foot of a beech-tree that grew near the path i thought
of the owls and the ghosts and of captain kid into the bargain and
i marvelled to myself whether there could be any foundation for the
belief that converted such nooks into hiding-places for his ill-gotten
gold while i thought over the matter i began to wish the thing could
be true and that some good spirit might direct me to the spot where
the money lay hid for sure enough no one in the world had greater
necessity for it than i i conned over the many stories that old jim
had told me about the matter as well as all the nonsensical ceremonies
that were to be performed and the divers ridiculous dangers to be
encountered by those who sought the treasure all which were mere
notions that had entered his absurd head but which he had pondered
over so often and long that he believed they had been told him by
others

the great difficulty according to his belief and a necessary
preliminary to all successful operations was first to discover exactly
the spot where the treasure lay buried and indeed this seemed to
be a very needful preliminary the discovery was to be made only by
dreaming of the spot three nights in succession as to dreaming twice
that was nothing jim had twenty times dreamed two nights together that
he had fallen upon the spot but upon digging it discovered nothing
having been so lucky as to dream of a place three successive nights
then the proper way to secure the treasure as he told me would be
to select a night when the moon was at the full and begin digging
precisely at twelve o'clock saying the lord's prayer backwards all
the time till the money was found and here lay the danger a single
blunder in the prayer and wo betide the devotee for the devil who
would be standing by all the time would that moment pounce upon his
soul and carry it away in a flame of brimstone




chapter ix


sheppard lee stumbles upon a happy man and quarrels with him


while i sat pondering over these matters and wondering whether i
could say the prayer backwards and doubting for to my shame be
it spoken i had not often of late years said it forward i
heard a gun go off in the meadow and rising and walking that way
i discovered a sportsman who had just shot a woodcock which his dog
carried to him in his mouth i knew the gunner at first sight to be a
gentleman of philadelphia by the name of higginson a brewer who was
reputed to be very wealthy and who had several times before visited
our neighbourhood for the purpose of shooting i knew little of him
except his name having never spoken to him the neighbours usually
addressed him as squire though i knew not for what reason he was a
man of forty or forty-five years old somewhat fat and portly but with
a rosy hearty complexion looking the very personification of health
and content and indeed as i gazed at him strolling up and down with
his dog and gun i thought i had never before seen such a picture of
happiness

but the sight only filled me with gloom and anger here said i to
myself is a man rich and prosperous who passes his whole life in an
amusement that delights him goes whither he likes does what he will
eats drinks and is merry and the people call him squire wherever
he goes i wish i were he for surely he is the happiest man in the
world

while i pondered thus regarding him with admiration and hatred
together a bird rose at his feet and he shot it and the next moment
another which he served in the same way

i noted the exultation expressed in his countenance and i was filled
with a sudden fury i strode up to him while he was recharging his
piece and as i approached him he looked up and gave me a nod of so
much complacency and condescension together that it rendered me ten
times madder than ever

sir said i looking him full in the face before you shoot
any more birds here answer me a question who do you go for the
administration or the opposition

this was a very absurd way of beginning a conversation with a stranger
but i was in such a fury i scarce knew what i said he gave me a stare
and then a smile and nodding his head good-humouredly replied

oh for the administration to be sure

you do sir i rejoined shaking my fist at him then sir let me
tell you sir you belong to a scoundrelly party and are a scoundrel
yourself sir and so sir walk off my place or i'll prosecute you
for a trespass

you insolent ragamuffin said he

ragamuffin was i sunk so low that a man trespassing on my own
property could call me ragamuffin

you poor miserable shote 

so degraded that i could be called a pig

you half-starved old sand-field jersey kill-deer 

a jersey kill-deer

you vagabond you beggar you dicky dout 

i was struck dumb by the multitude and intensity of his epithets and
before i could recover speech he shouldered his gun snapped his
fingers in my face and whistling to his dog walked off the ground
before he had gone six steps however he turned round gave me a hard
look and bursting into a laugh exclaimed tapping his forehead as he
spoke 

poor fellow you're wrong in your upper story

with that he resumed the path and crossed over to the old church
where i lost sight of him

wrong in my upper story it was the very phrase which tom alderwood
my brother-in-law had applied to me and which had given me such
mortal offence that i had never forgiven him and had refused to be
reconciled even when as my difficulties began to thicken about me
he came to offer me his assistance wrong in my upper story i was
so much confounded by the man's insolence that i remained rooted to
the spot until he had got out of sight and then not knowing what else
to do i returned home when i had a visit from old jim who entered
the apartment and not knowing i had sold my horse cried out massa
sheppard want money to shoe julius cesar morrow morning blacksmith
swear no trust no more

go to the devil you old rascal said i in a rage

guess i will said jim shaking his head follow hard after massa

that insinuation which struck me as being highly appropriate was
all i got for supper for it was jim's way when i offended him of an
afternoon to sneak off taking dinah with him and thus leave me to
shift for myself during the whole night as i could there was never a
more tyrannical old rascal than jim jumble




chapter x


sheppard lee has an extraordinary dream which promises to be more
advantageous than any of his previous ones


i went therefore supperless to bed but i dreamed of captain kid's
money and the character of my dream was quite surprising i thought
that my house had fallen down in a high wind as indeed it was like
enough to do and that i was sitting on a broken chair before the
ruins when squire higginson made his appearance looking however
like a dead man for his face was pale and he was swathed about with
a winding-sheet instead of a gun he carried a spade in his hand and
a great black pig followed at his heels in place of his dog he came
directly towards me and looking me full in the face said sheppard
lee what are you doing here but i was struck with fear and could
make no reply with that he spoke again saying the sheriff is
coming to levy on your property get up therefore and follow me
so saying he began to walk away whistling to the pig which ran at
his heels like a dog and i found myself impelled to follow him he
took the path to the owl-roost and arriving there came to a pause
saying sheppard lee you are a poor man and eaten up with discontent
but i am your friend and you shall have all your wishes he then
turned to the pig which was rooting under a gum-tree and blowing his
whistle said black pig show me some game or i'll trounce you
and immediately the pig began to run about snuffing and snorting and
coursing like a dog so that it was wonderful to behold him at last
the squire growing impatient and finding fault with the animal's ill
success for he discovered nothing took a whip from under his shroud
and fell to beating him after which the pig hunted more to his liking
and having coursed about us for a while ran up to the beech-tree
under which i had sat the day before and began with snout and hoof to
tear up the earth at its roots oho said squire higginson i never
knew black pig to deceive me we shall have fine sport now then
putting the spade into my hands he bade me dig exhorting me to be of
good heart for i was now to live a new life altogether but before i
struck the spade into the earth he drew a mark on the ground to guide
me and the figure was precisely that of a human grave not daunted
by this circumstance for in my dream it appeared natural enough i
began to dig and after throwing out the earth to a depth just equal
to the length of the spade i discovered an iron coffin the lid of
which was in three pieces and not being fastened in any way was
therefore easily removed judge of my transports when having lifted
up the piece in the middle i found the whole coffin full of gold and
silver some in the form of ancient coins but the most of it in bars
and ingots i would have lifted up the whole coffin and carried it
away at once but that was impossible i therefore began to fill my
pockets my hat my handkerchief and even my bosom until the squire
bade me cease telling me i should visit the treasure at the same hour
on the following night i then replaced the iron cover and threw the
earth again into the grave as the squire commanded and then leaving
him and running home as hard as i could in fear lest some one should
see me i fell into a miry place where i was weighed down by the mass
of gold i had about me and smothered in the midst of my dying agonies
i awoke and found that all was a dream

ah how much torment a poor man has dreaming of riches the dream made
me very melancholy and i went moping about all that day wishing
myself anybody or any thing but that i was and hiding in the woods at
the sight of any one who chanced to pass by for i thought everybody
was the sheriff i went to bed the following night in great disorder of
spirit and had no sooner closed my eyes than i dreamed the same dream
over again the squire made his appearance as before led me to the
owl-roost and set the black pig hunting until the grave was found in
a word the dream did not vary in a single particular from that i had
had the night before and when i woke up the next day the surprise
of such an occurrence filled me with new and superstitious ideas and
i awaited the next night with anxious expectations resolved if the
dream should be repeated again to go dig at the place and see what
should come of it

remembering what old jim had said in regard to the full of the moon
i went to a neighbour's to look at his almanack for i had none of my
own and discovered to my unspeakable surprise and agitation though
i had half known it before that the moon we then had would be at her
full between ten and eleven o'clock on the following morning

such a coincidence betwixt the time of my dreams and the proper period
for hunting the treasure since at the full moon was the proper time
was enough of itself to excite my expectations and the identity
between the two visions was so extraordinary that i began to believe
that the treasure did really exist in the owl-roost which being very
solitary and yet conveniently accessible from the river through the
medium of the creek was one of the best hiding-places in the world
and that i was the happy man destined to obtain it

i went to bed accordingly the third night with a strong persuasion that
the vision would be repeated i was not disappointed i found myself
again digging at the beech-roots and scraping up great wedges of gold
and silver from the iron coffin what was remarkable in this dream
however was that when i had picked up as much as i could carry the
squire nodded to me and said now sheppard lee you know the way to
captain kid's treasure and you can come to-morrow night by yourself
and what was further observable i did not dream of falling into a
miry place on this occasion but arrived safely home and beheld with
surprise and delight that my house which i had left in ruins was
standing up more beautiful than ever it had been newly painted from
top to bottom and the pillars of the porch were gilded over and
shining like gold

while enjoying this agreeable prospect i awoke and such was the
influence of the vision on my mind and the certain belief i now
cherished that the vast treasure was mine a whole coffinful of gold
and silver that i fell to shouting and dancing so that old jim
jumble who ran up into my chamber to see what was the matter was
persuaded i had gone mad and began to blubber and scold and take on
in the most diverting way in the world

i pacified him as well as i could but resolved to keep my secret until
i could surprise him with the sight of my treasure all collected
together in the house and i proceeded without delay to make such
preparations as were proper for the coming occasion i took a spade and
mattock and carried them to the hollow where i hid them among the
bushes but this i found difficult to do as secretly as i wished for
old jim either from suspecting what i was after or believing i had
lost my mind kept dogging me about so that it was near midday before
i succeeded in giving him the slip and carrying my tools to the hollow




chapter xi


in which the reader is introduced to a personage who may claim his
acquaintance hereafter


in this place to my dismay i stumbled upon a man who from the
character he had in the neighbourhood i was afraid was hunting the
treasure as well as myself he was an old german doctor called
feuerteufel which extraordinary name as i had been told signified
in german fire-devil he had come to our village about two weeks
before and nobody knew for what reason all day long he wandered about
among the woods swamps and marshes collecting plants and weeds
stones animals and snakes which he seemed to value very highly
some thought he was a counterfeiter in disguise and others called
him a conjurer many were of opinion he was hunting for gold-mines
or precious stones while others had their thoughts and said he was
the devil his appearance being somewhat grim and forbidding as for
myself having lighted upon him once or twice in the woods i did not
know what to think of him but i did not like his looks he was very
tall and rawboned with long arms and immense big hands his skin was
extremely dark and pock-marked and he had a mouth that ran from ear to
ear and long bushy black hair his eyes were like saucers and deep
sunk in their sockets with tremendous big black eyebrows ever frowning
above them and what made him look remarkable was that although he was
ever frowning with his eyes his mouth was as continually grinning in
a sort of laugh such as you see in a man struck with a palsy in the
head he was the terror of all the children and it was said the dogs
never barked at him

i found him in the hollow hard by the beech-tree and had scarce
time to fling my implements among the bushes before he saw me he was
standing looking over towards the old church where there was a funeral
procession for that morning the neighbours were burying a young man
that had taken laudanum for love two days before but had only expired
the previous evening

as soon as the german beheld me he started like a guilty man
and made as if he would have run away but suddenly changing his
mind he stepped towards me and just as we met he stooped down and
pulled a flower that struck his eye then rising up he grinned at
me and nodding said gooten morrow mine prudder it ish gooten
dag though what he meant by gooten dag i know no more than the
man in the moon having never studied german i did not at all like his
appearance in this spot at such a time but i reflected at last that he
was only culling simples and had paused near the beech-tree to look
at the funeral as would have been extremely natural in any man but
i liked the appearance of the funeral still less at such a particular
time and i thought there was something ominous in it

but my mind was fixed upon the treasure i was soon to enjoy too firmly
to be long drawn off by any such doleful spectacle and accordingly
having waited impatiently until the attendants on the funeral had
all stalked away as well as the german doctor i stole towards the
beech-tree and surveyed the ground at its roots there were some
stones lying among them which i removed as well as the long grass
that waved over their tops and looking closely i thought i could
see among some of the smaller roots of the tree that were pleached
together on the surface of the earth a sort of arrangement very much
in shape of a grave this was a new proof to me that the treasure lay
below and i considered that my good angel had platted these roots
together in order to direct me in what spot to dig

i could scarce avoid beginning on the instant but i remembered that
was not the hour i therefore concealed my spade and mattock and went
home when the first thing i did was to hunt me up a book that had the
lord's prayer in it for i feared to trust to my memory alone and
write this out backwards with the greatest care and i then spent the
remainder of the day in committing the words to memory in that order
but i found it a difficult task

as the evening drew nigh i found myself growing into such a pitch of
excitement that fearing i should betray the secret to jim jumble who
was constantly prying in upon me i resolved to walk to the village
and there remain until the hour for seeking the treasure should draw
nigh i had another reason for this step for my watch having gone
some month or two before julius cesar to satisfy a hungry fellow to
whom i owed money i knew not how to be certain of the hour unless
by learning it of some one in the village and to the village i
accordingly went soon after sunset




chapter xii


sheppard lee visits the village makes a patriotic speech and leaves
the fence


having arrived at the village i proceeded to a tavern which was the
chief place of resort especially after nightfall for all the idlers
and topers of the town of whom there were great numbers the village
at that time being a place of but little business

i found some ten or a dozen already assembled in the bar-room
drinking brandy smoking chewing talking politics and swearing i
had no sooner entered than some of them who were discoursing loudly
concerning the purity and economy of the government and the honesty of
those who supported it appealed to me my electioneering pilgrimage
through the country having caused me to be looked upon as quite a
knowing politician to assist them in the argument they were holding

remembering the scurvy way in which i had been treated by the party i
felt strongly tempted to give them a piece of my mind on the other side
of the question but i thought of my buried treasure and conceiving
it unwise to begin the quarrel at that time i made them no answer
but sat down in a corner where i hoped to escape observation here i
employed myself conning over the prayer backwards until i was assured
i was perfect in the exercise

i then still keeping aloof from the company gave my mind up to a
consideration of what i should do when i had transferred captain kid's
hoards of gold from the coffin to my house

the first thing i resolved to do was to pay my debts which how
greatly soever they oppressed me were not actually very fearful in
amount after which i was determined to rebuild my house restore my
fields to their original condition and go to law with mr aikin jones
who i had no doubt had cheated me out of my property it did not occur
to me that by such a step i should get rid of my second fortune
as expeditiously as i had the first all that i thought on was the
satisfaction of having my revenge on the villain whom i should have
punished in perhaps a more summary way had it not been for my respect
for the laws and my being naturally a peaceable man but i did not
think long of mr jones the idea of the great wealth i was soon to
possess filled my mind and i gave myself up to the most transporting
reveries

from these i was roused by hearing some one near me pronounce the words
captain kid's money the idea that was uppermost in my own mind
and looking round in a kind of perturbation i saw a knot of people
surrounding feuerteufel the german doctor one of whom was discoursing
on the subject of the treasure in the owl-roost and avowing his
belief that he that is the german doctor was conjuring after it
an imputation that gained great credit with the company there being
no other way to account for his visit to our village and his constant
perambulations through the woods and marshes in the neighbourhood of
the owl-roost

the german doctor to my great relief replied to this charge by
expanding his jaws as if he would have swallowed the speaker though he
was guilty of nothing beyond a laugh which was in depth and quality
of tone as if an empty hogshead had indulged in the same diversion
his voice was indeed prodigiously deep and hollow and even his laugh
had something in it solemn and lugubrious mine friends said he in
very bad english i fos can do men creat t'ings put i can no find no
captain kitt's money not at all i toes neffer looks for coldt except
in places fare gott puts it t'at iss in t'a coldt-mines with that
he laughed again and looking upon the people about him with great
contempt he walked up stairs to his chamber for he lodged in the inn

soon after this occurrence and just when i had sunk again into a
revery a man stepped up to me and saluted me in a way well suited to
startle me

sir said he friend kill-deer before you scratch your head
any more on this bench answer me a question what do you go
for brandy-toddy or gin-sling

it was squire higginson and he looked very good-humoured and waggish
but as i had dreamed of him so often and always as being in his
grave-clothes i was rather petrified at his appearance as if it were
that of a spectre rather than a mortal man as for our quarrel in the
meadow it had slipped my mind altogether until having recovered
my composure a little it was recalled to my recollection by the
associations arising out of his words

but i remembered the circumstance at last and being moreover offended
by his present freedom which was nothing less than sheer impertinence
i told him i desired to have nothing to say to him on which he fell
into a passion and told me i might go to the devil for a ragamuffin
and a turncoat politician but mad as he was he ended his speech by
bursting into a laugh and then tapping his forehead as before and
nodding his head and winking he left the bar-room to seek his chamber
 for he put up at the tavern as well as the german doctor

these insults threw me into some ferment and being irritated still
farther by the remarks of the company especially when some one asked
what the squire meant by calling me a turncoat politician i allowed
myself to be thrown into a passion in the course of which i gave such
of my old friends as were present to know that i had forsworn their
party and considered it to be composed of a pack of the corruptest
scoundrels in the country

this unexpected denunciation produced a great explosion my old friends
fell upon me tooth and nail as the saying is reviling me as a
traitor and apostate but on the other hand those of the opposition
who happened to be present ranged themselves on my side applauding
my honesty judgment and spirit to such a degree that i was more
than ever convinced i had been on the wrong side i met reproaches
with contempt and threats with defiance opposed words to words
and assertions to assertions for in politics we do not make use
of arguments and finding myself triumphantly victorious i mounted
into a chair and made a speech that was received by my new friends
with roars of applause intoxicated with these marks of approbation
i launched at once into a sea of declamation in which i might have
tossed about during the whole night had i not by chance while balking
for a word rolled my eyes upon the clock that stood opposite to me
in the bar and perceived that it wanted just a quarter of an hour
to twelve o'clock in a moment i forgot every thing but the treasure
that awaited me in the owl-roost i stopped short in the middle of a
sentence took one more look at the clock and then leaping down from
the chair rushed from the tavern without saying a word and to the
amazement of friend and foe ran at full speed out of the village and
this gait i continued until i had reached the old swedes church for i
had taken the footpath that led in that direction




chapter xiii


what befell the author on his way to the owl-roost


as it was now the full of the moon there was of course light enough
for my purpose but the sky was dappled with clouds very dense and
heavy some of which crossing the moon every minute or two there
was a constant alternation of light and darkness so that the trees
and all other objects were constantly changing their appearance now
starting up in bold relief white and silvery from the darkness and
now vanishing again into gloom

a cloud passed over the moon just as i reached the old church and the
wall of the burial-ground having fallen down at a certain place where
the rubbish obstructed the path it was my ill luck to break my shin
against a fragment the pain of which caused me to utter a loud groan
to my amazement and horror this interjection of suffering was echoed
from the grave-yard hard by a voice screaming out in awful tones
o lord o lord and casting my eyes round i beheld as i thought
three or four shapes that i deemed nothing less than devils incarnate
dancing about among the tomb-stones

i was seized with such terror at this sight that forgetting my hurt
and the treasure together i took to my heels and did not cease
running until i had left the church some quarter of a mile behind me
and i am not certain i should have come to a halt then had it not
been my fate to tumble over a cow that lay ruminating on the path
whereby besides half breaking my neck and cruelly scratching my nose
i stunned myself to that degree that it was some two or three minutes
before i was able to rise

i had thus time to recollect myself and reflect that i was running
away from captain kid's money the idea of losing which was not to be
tolerated a moment

but how to get to the owl-roost without falling into the hands of
the devils or spectres at the old church was what gave me infinite
concern the midnight hour the only one for attempting the treasure
with success was now close at hand so that there was no time left
me to reach the place by a roundabout course through the woods to the
right or over the meadows to the left i must pass the old church or
i must perhaps give up the treasure

there was no time to deliberate the figures i had seen and the cries
i had heard might have been coinages of my own brain nay the latter
were perhaps after all only the echoes of my own voice distorted
into something terrible by my fears i was not naturally superstitious
and had never before believed in ghosts but i cannot recollect what
precise arguments occurred to me at that moment to cause me to banish
my fears the hope of making my fortune was doubtless the strongest of
all and the moon suddenly shining out with the effulgence almost of
day i became greatly imboldened and in a word set forward again
resolved if met by a second apparition and driven to flight to
fly not backwards but forwards that is in the direction of the
owl-roost

on this occasion it was my fortune to be saluted by an owl that sat
on the old wall among some bushes and hooted at me as i went by and
notwithstanding that the sound was extremely familiar to my ears i was
thrown into a panic and took to my heels as before though as i had
resolved i ran onward pursuing the path to the swamp it is quite
possible there may have been a crew of imps and disimbodied spirits
jumping among the graves as before but as i had the good fortune to
be frightened before i caught sight of them i did not stop to look for
them and for the same reason i heard no more awful voices shrieking
in my ears i reached the owl-roost and the memorable beech-tree
where the necessity of acting with all speed helped me to get rid of
my terror i knew that i had not a moment to spare and running to the
bushes where i had hidden my mattock and spade i fetched them to the
tree and instantly began to dig not forgetting to pray backwards all
the while as hard as i could






chapter xiv


sheppard lee digs for the buried treasure but makes a blow with the
mattock in the wrong place


i was but an ill hand at labour and of the use of the spade and
mattock i knew nothing the nature of the ground in which i was digging
made the task especially difficult and disagreeable there were
many big stones scattered about in the earth which jarred my arms
horribly whenever i stuck them so that all my efforts to the contrary
notwithstanding i was every minute or two interrupting my prayer
with expressions which were neither wise nor religious but highly
expressive of my torture of body and mind and then i was digging among
the toughest and vilest roots in the world some of which i thought i
should never get through for i had not remembered to provide myself
with an axe and i was afraid to go home for one lest some evil
accident or discovery might rob me of the expected treasure

accordingly i had to do with a tougher piece of labour than i had ever
undertaken before in my whole life and i reckon i worked a full hour
and a half before i had got the hole i was excavating as deep as i
supposed would be necessary i succeeded at last however in throwing
out so much earth that when i measured the depth of the pit with my
spade i found the handle just on a level with the surface of the
ground

but i was not so near the treasure as i supposed i struck my mattock
into the clay scarce doubting that i should hear the ring of the iron
coffin instead of reaching that however i struck a great stone and
with a force that made the mattock-helve fly out of my hands to my
chin which it saluted with a vigour that set all my teeth to rattling
knocking me down into the bargain

having recovered from the effects of this blow i fell to work again
thumping and delving until i had excavated to the depth of at least
five feet my heart began to fail me as well as my strength as i got
so deep into the earth without finding the gold for i began to fear
lest my dreams had after all deceived me in my agitation of mind i
handled my tools so blindly that i succeeded in lodging my mattock
which was aimed furiously at a root among the toes of my right foot
and the pain was so horribly acute that i leaped howling out of the
pit and sinking down upon the grass fell straightway into a trance





chapter xv


in which sheppard lee finds himself in a quandary which the reader will
allow to be the most wonderful and lamentable ever known to a human
being


when i awoke from this trance it was almost daybreak

i recovered in some confusion of mind and did not for a moment notice
that i was moving away from the place of my disaster but i perceived
there was something strange in my feelings and sensations i felt
exceedingly light and buoyant as if a load had been taken not merely
from my mind but from my body it seemed to me as if i had the power
of moving whither i would without exertion and i fancied that i swept
along without putting my feet to the ground nay i had a notion that
i was passing among shrubs and bushes without experiencing from them
any hinderance to my progress whatever i felt no pain in my foot
which i had hit such a violent blow and none in my hands that had
been wofully blistered by my work nor had i the slightest feeling of
weariness or fatigue on the whole my sensations were highly novel and
agreeable but before i had time to analyze them or to wonder at the
change i remembered that i was wandering away from the buried treasure

i returned to the spot but only to be riveted to the earth in
astonishment i saw stretched on the grass just on the verge of the
pit the dead body of a man but what was my horror when perusing the
ashy features in the light of the moon i perceived my own countenance
it was no illusion it was my face my figure and dressed in my
clothes and the whole presented the appearance of perfect death

the sight was as bewildering as it was shocking and the whole state
of things was not more terrifying than inexplicable there i lay on
the ground stiff and lifeless and here i stood on my feet alive
and surveying my own corpse stretched before me but i forgot my
extraordinary duality in my concern for myself that is to say for
that part of me that eidolon or representative or duplicate of me
that was stretched on the grass i stooped down to raise the figure
from the earth in an instinctive desire to give myself aid but in
vain i could not lift the body it did not seem to me that i could
even touch it my fingers strive as i might i could not bring into
contact with it

my condition or conditions for i was no longer of the singular
number at this time can be understood only by comparing my confusion
of senses and sensations to that which occurs in a dream when one
beholds himself dead surveys his body and philosophizes or laments
and is all the time to all intents and purposes without being
surprised at it two persons one of which lives and observes while
the other is wholly defunct thus i was or appeared to be without
bestowing any reflection upon such an extraordinary circumstance or
being even conscious of it two persons in one of which i lived but
forgot my existence while trembling at the death that had overcome
me in the other my true situation i did not yet comprehend nor
even dream of though it soon turned out to be natural enough and i
understood it

i was entirely overcome with horror at my unfortunate condition and
seeing that i was myself unable to render myself any assistance i ran
upon an impulse of instinct to the nearest quarter where it was to be
obtained this was at the cottage or little farmhouse which i spoke
of before as standing on the by-road a little beyond the old church
it was occupied by a man named turnbuckle whom i knew very well and
who was a very industrious honest man although a tenant of mr aikin
jones

i arrived at his house in an amazingly short space of time rather
flying as it seemed to me through the air than running over the
marsh and up the rugged hill it was the gray of the morning when i
reached his house and the family was just stirring within as i ran
towards the door his dogs of which he had a goodly number as is
common with poor men set up a dismal howling clapped their tails
between their legs and sneaked off among the bushes a thing that
surprised me much for they were usually very savage of temper i
called to turnbuckle by name and that in a voice so piteous that in
half a minute he and his eldest son came tumbling out of the house
in the greatest haste and wonder no sooner however had they cast
eyes on me than they uttered fearful cries the old man fell flat on
his face as if in a fit and the son ran back into the house as if
frightened out of his senses

help me thomas turnbuckle said i i am lying dead under the
beech-tree in the hollow come along and give me help

but the old man only answered by groaning and crying and at that
moment the door opened and his eldest son appeared with a gun which
he fired at me to my inexpressible terror

but if i was frightened at this how much more was i horrified when the
old man leaping up at the discharge roared out o lord a ghost a
ghost and ran into the house

i perceived it all in a moment the howling of the dogs which they
still kept up from among the bushes the fear of turnbuckle and
his family all of whom old and young male and female were now
squeaking in the house as if old nick had got among them my being
in two places together and a thousand other circumstances that now
occurred to me apprized me of the dreadful fact which i had not
before suspected i was a dead man my body lay in the marsh under the
beech-tree and it was my spirit that was wandering about in search of
assistance

as this terrible idea flashed across my mind and i saw that i was a
ghost i was as much frightened as the turnbuckles had been and i took
to my heels to fly from myself until i recollected myself a little
and thought of the absurdity of such a proceeding but even this fatal
conception did not remove my anxiety in relation to my poor body or
myself as i could not help regarding my body and i ran back to the
beech-tree in a kind of distraction hoping i might have been revived
and resuscitated in my absence

i reached the pit and stared wildly about me my body was
gone vanished i looked into the hole i had excavated there was
nothing in it but the spade and mattock and my hat which had fallen
from my head when i leaped out of it after hurting my foot i stared
round me again the print of my body in the grass where it had lain
was quite perceptible for it was now almost broad day but there was
no body there and no other vestige excepting one of my shoes which
was torn and bloody being the identical one i had worn on the foot
hurt by the mattock




chapter xvi


sheppard lee finds comfort when he least expects it the extraordinary
close of the catastrophe


what had become of me that is what had become of my body its
disappearance threw me into a phrensy and i was about to run home
and summon old jim jumble to help me look for it when i heard a dog
yelping and whining in a peculiarly doleful manner at some little
distance down in the meadow and i instantly ran in that direction
thinking that perhaps the bloodthirsty beast might be at that very
moment dragging it away to devour it or hoping at the least to
light upon some one who could give me an account of it

i ran to a place in the edge of the marsh where were some willow-trees
and an old worm fence the latter overgrown with briers and
elder-bushes and there to my exceeding surprise i discovered the
body of squire higginson for he was stone dead lying against the
fence which was broken his head down and his heels resting against
the rails and looking as if while climbing it he had fallen down and
broken his neck his gun was lying at his side undischarged and his
dog whose yelping had brought me to the spot was standing by but i
must add that as soon as i approached him the animal betrayed as
much terror as turnbuckle's dogs had done and ran howling away in the
same manner

greatly incensed as i had been with squire higginson i felt some
concern to see him lying in this lamentable condition his face
blackened with blood as if he had perished from suffocation and
stooping down i endeavoured to take off his neckcloth and raise his
head in the hope that he might yet recover but i reckoned without my
host i had forgotten that i was a mere phantom or spirit possessing
no muscular power whatever because no muscles for even in walking
and running as i was now aware i was impelled by some unknown power
within me and not at all carried by my legs i could not bring my hand
into contact either with his cravat or head and for a good reason
seeing there was no substance in me whatever but all spirit

i therefore ceased my endeavours and began to moralize in a mournful
mood upon his condition and mine he was dead and so was i but there
seemed to be this difference between us namely that i had lost my
body and he his soul for after looking hard about me i could see
nothing of it his body as it lay there in the bushes was perfectly
useless to him and to all the world beside and my spirit as was
clear enough was in a similar predicament why might i not that is
to say my spirit deprived by an unhappy accident of its natural
dwelling take possession of a tenement which there remained no spirit
to claim and thus uniting interests together as two feeble factions
unite together in the political world become a body possessing life
strength and usefulness

as soon as this idea entered my mind or me for i was all mind i
was seized with the envy that possessed me when i first met the squire
shooting over my marshes how much better it would be i thought to
inhabit his body than my own in my own fleshly casing i should revive
only to poverty and trouble i had forgot all about captain kid's
money whereas if once in the body of squire higginson i should step
out into the world to possess riches respect content and all that
man covets oh that i might be squire higginson i cried

the words were scarce out of my mouth before i felt myself vanishing
as it were into the dead man's nostrils into which i that is to say
my spirit rushed like a breeze of air and the very next moment i
found myself kicking the fence to pieces in a lusty effort to rise to
my feet and feeling as if i had just tumbled over it

the devil take the fence and that jersey kill-deer that keeps it
in such bad order i cried as i rose up snatching at my gun and
whistling for my dog ponto my dog ponto it was even the truth
i was no more sheppard lee the poor and discontented no longer a
disimbodied spirit wandering about only to frighten dogs out of their
senses but john hazlewood higginson esq solid and substantial in
purse and flesh with a rosy face and a heart as cheerful as the
morning which was now reddening over the whole east if i had wanted
any proof of the transformation beyond that furnished by my own senses
and sensations it would have been provided by my dog ponto who now
came running up leaping on and about me with the most extravagant joy

god be thanked i cried dancing about as joyously as the dog i am
now a respectable man with my pockets full of money farewell then
you poor miserable sheppard lee you ragamuffin you poor wretched
shote you half-starved old sand-field jersey kill-deer you vagabond
you beggar you dicky dout with the wrong place in your upper story
you are now a gentleman and a man of substance and a happy dog into
the bargain ha ha ha and here i fell a laughing out of pure joy
and giving my dog ponto a buss as if that were the most natural act
in the world and a customary way of showing my satisfaction i began
to stalk towards my old ruined house without exactly knowing for what
purpose but having some vague idea about me that i would set old jim
jumble and his wife dinah to shouting and dancing an amusement i would
willingly have seen the whole world engaged in at that moment




chapter xvii


a natural mistake which although it procures the author a rough
reception at his own house has yet the good effect to teach him the
propriety of adapting his manners to his condition


i had not walked twenty yards before a woodcock that was feeding on
the edge of the marsh started up from under my nose when clapping my
gun to my shoulder i let fly at him and down he came

aha ponto said i when did i ever fail to bring down a woodcock
bring it along ponto you rascal rum-te ti ti rum-te ti ti
and i went on my way singing for pure joy without pausing to recharge
or to bag my game i reached my old house and began to roar out
without reflecting that i was now something more than sheppard lee
hillo jim jumble you old rascal get up and let me in

what you want hah said old jim poking his head from the
garret-window of the kitchen and looking as sour as a persimmon before
frost guess massa squire higginson drunk hah what you want s'pose
i'm gwyin to git up afo sunrise for not'in and for anybody but my
massa sheppard

why you old dog said i in a passion i am your master sheppard
that is your master john hazlewood higginson esquire for as for
sheppard lee the jersey kill-deer i've finished him you rascal
you'll never see him more so get down and let me into the house or
i'll 

you will hah said jim you will what

i'll shoot you you insolent scoundrel i exclaimed in a rage as
if it were the most natural thing in the world for me to be in one and
as i spoke i raised my piece when bow wow wough went my old dog
bull who had not bitten a man for two years but who now rushed from
his kennel under the porch and seized me by the leg

get out bull you rascal said i but he only bit the harder which
threw me into such a fury that i clapped the muzzle of my gun to his
side and having one charge remaining blew him to pieces

golla-matty said old jim from the window whence he had surveyed
the combat golla-matty shoot old bull

and with that the black villain snatched up the half of a brick which
i suppose he kept to daunt unwelcome visiters and taking aim at me
he cast it so well as to bring it right against my left ear and so
tumbled me to the ground i would have blown the rascal's brains out
in requital of this assault had there been a charge left in my piece
or had he given me time to reload but as soon as he had cast the
brick he ran from the window and then reappeared holding out an old
musket that i remembered he kept to shoot wild ducks and muskrats in
the neighbouring marsh with seeing this formidable weapon and not
knowing but that the desperado would fire upon me i was forced to beat
a retreat which i did in double quick time being soon joined by my
dog ponto who had fled like a coward at the first bow-wough of the
bulldog and saluted in my flight by the amiable tones of dinah who
now thrust her head from the window beside jim's and abused me as
long as i could hear




book ii


containing sundry illustrations of the advantages of good living with
a few chapters on domestic felicity


chapter i


some passages in the life of john h higginson esq the happy
sportsman with a surprising affliction that befell the author


i went off in a towering rage to think of the reception i had met and
that too after an absence of a whole night i had been bitten by my own
dog and driven from my own doors by my own servants but there was
something in these circumstances to admonish me of the change that had
come over me they reminded me of a fact that was not always present to
my thoughts to wit that i was no longer sheppard lee but mr john
hazlewood higginson a very different sort of personage altogether

to account for my forgetfulness of this important transformation i
must relate that although i had acquired along with his body all
the peculiarities of feeling propensity conversation and conduct
of squire higginson i had not entirely lost those that belonged
to sheppard lee in fact i may be said to have possessed at that
time two different characters one of which now governed me and now
the other though the squire's it must be confessed was greatly
predominant thus the moment after the transformation i found
myself endowed with a passion for shooting as if i had had it all my
life long a buoyant tone of mind and in addition as i by-and-by
discovered with somewhat a hot temper none of which had ever been
known to me before the difficulty was that i could not immediately
shake off my old sheppard lee habits and the influence of these
perhaps if one must scrutinize into the matter more than the
absolute retention of any other native peculiarities drove me into the
inconsistencies of which i was for a short time guilty but i will not
trouble the reader with philosophizing

i perceived from the repulse i had received from jim jumble that it
now became me to sink his old master altogether which i was very well
content to do and resolved accordingly although i could not help
thinking as i strode over the forty-acre farm how much satisfaction i
should have now that i was a rich man in putting it into fine order
but these thoughts were soon driven from my mind by ponto making a set
at some game and in a moment i was banging away right and left and
slaughtering the birds in the finest style imaginable

oh the delights of shooting woodcock it is rather hot work though
of a midsummer day and notwithstanding the prodigious satisfaction i
had in pursuing the sport i felt that my satisfaction would have been
still greater had i been a few stone lighter i began to think squire
higginson's fat rather inconvenient and i had the same opinion of a
touch of asthma or something of that nature which i found in his
lungs and besides there was a sort of whizzing and humming and
spinning in my head where they had been all the morning which were not
altogether agreeable

in consequence of these infirmities of my new body i began after a
while to weary of the sport and was just on the point of setting
off to the village to get my dinner when a crowd of men made their
appearance in the marsh and setting up a great shout at sight of
me began to run towards me i could not conceive the cause of such
a concourse nor could i imagine for what reason they directed their
steps towards me but hearing them utter the most furious cries and
perceiving that a multitude of dogs they had with them were rushing
against me as if to devour me i was seized with alarm and began to
retreat towards a wood that was not far off

this evidence of terror on my part only caused the people to utter
louder and more savage cries besides setting the dogs to running
faster and these ferocious animals gaining upon me and being on the
point of tearing me to pieces i was obliged to let fly my piece among
them whereby i shot one dead and disabled two or three others i then
defended myself with the breech of my gun until the men came up one
of whom tripped up my heels while the others seized and disarmed me
crying out that i was a murderer that i was found out and should be
hanged if there was any law in the county

i was confounded at this charge but how much greater was my amazement
when i understood as they haled me along towards the village which
they did very roughly that i was accused of having murdered sheppard
lee that is my own identical self

this accusation appeared to me so preposterous that in spite of my
indignation for my fears had now subsided i burst into a laugh
which only made them rail at me more furiously than i can express
hear him said they he laughs he thinks because he is a rich man
he can shoot any poor man he pleases and buy himself off but we will
show him there's law in jersey for aristocrats as well as poor men and
that we can hang a purse-proud man as soon as a beggar

and so they went on reviling me as if i had been the greatest criminal
in the land and dragging me as they said to a squire who would soon
show me what law was

i tried to reason with them but it was all in vain i then fell into
a passion and cursed and swore at them in a way which i am certain i
never did before at any human being having always had while sheppard
lee a great horror of profanity but this was just as fruitless
an expedient as the other they dragged me on until we reached the
village where we found all in a hubbub men women and children
running about as if mad and exclaiming that squire higginson had
murdered sheppard lee and hid the body in the owl-roost swamp as
soon as they saw me they set up a shout and some low fellows among
them raged in such a degree that i thought they would have massacred
me in the street they crowded round me hustled me seized me by the
collar shook their fists in my face and in general testified such a
vindictive concern for the murder of poor sheppard lee as they called
him that i might have supposed there was never a man more widely
beloved than myself had i not known otherwise or rather had i not
been too closely occupied to suppose any thing about it

in a word they carried me before squire andrew parkins who was a
fat man that i heartily despised and here they called upon him for
justice while i did the same thing swearing that i would prosecute
every rascal of them for assault and battery conspiracy defamation
and the lord knows what beside all of which it seems only inflamed
the mob against me the more they charged me with the murder and
the evidence they brought to support the charge appeared to justice
parkins sufficient to authorize his issuing a mittimus there were
twenty persons to swear i had two or three days before acknowledged
having had a quarrel with sheppard lee on his farm that is the
forty-acre and that he had ordered me off and there were twenty
more to swear i was a man of such a hot and furious temper that it
was a wonder i had not shot the poor man down on the spot then came
old turnbuckle and his son who swore that the ghost of sheppard lee
had come to them in the gray of the morning calling for help and
assuring them that he or his body lay murdered under the beech-tree
in the hollow that as soon as the phantom had vanished and they
recovered from their fears they roused the neighbours and sending
some to my house who learned i had not been at home all night the
others proceeded to the hollow where they found a freshly-dug grave
with spade and mattock in it and near it they lit upon my hat and one
of my shoes which latter was bloody as well as the grass on which
it lay that then looking round them they discovered me that is
john higginson sneaking away through the reeds on the marsh in a
suspicious way that at that moment old jim jumble was brought forward
who said i john hazlewood higginson had come to the house shot his
bulldog threatened to blow his brains out and bragged that i had
just finished or in other words murdered his master sheppard lee
and finally that this confirming the suspicions they all had against
me they pursued me i retreating and shooting their dogs like a
man conscious of guilt and anxious to escape and captured me not
without a furious resistance on my part

on the strength of this testimony i was committed to jail whither i
was conducted amid the shouts of the mob squire parkins doubtless to
beg off as well as he could afterward privately assured me that he
had committed me to prison not from any belief that i was guilty or
that the testimony really warranted such a step but because he was
afraid the people would otherwise murder me and considered that the
only way to protect me from their violence

meanwhile there was a great search made for my that is sheppard
lee's body the general belief being that i that is john h
higginson had cast it into the swamp after having been at the pains
to dig a grave wherein i at first designed to hide it and i do verily
believe that had my unfortunate old casing been found i should have
begun my new existence in the body of the man i had so much envied by
being hanged for the murder its sudden disappearance was therefore not
more extraordinary than it was really fortunate




chapter ii


the author being in prison makes a confidant of a deputy
attorney-general the inconvenience of telling a truth which happens
to be somewhat incredible


my wrath gave way when i found myself in prison and hearing from the
jailer that the grand jury was then in session and the prosecuting
attorney actually engaged in framing a bill of endictment against me
to send up to its members i began to think the matter rather serious
and resolved to end it before it proceeded further

i had already experienced the ill effects of attempting to sustain the
character of sheppard lee while in the body of another man and for
this reason was resolved to be more cautious for the future but i now
perceived i had no better way of relieving myself of my troubles than
by making the prosecutor who had been an old friend of mine and had
always treated me with respect acquainted with my transformation
after which i had no doubt he would throw his bill of endictment into
the fire i sent for him accordingly but was obliged to repeat the
message before he thought fit to make his appearance

you have perhaps made a mistake mr higginson said he as he
entered you have occasion for counsel but none that i can imagine
for me for as to my giving you any advice in this unfortunate
affair 

the devil take the affair said i in no amiable voice it was to
get rid of it entirely that i sent for you for i must stop that cursed
endictment of yours i don't want it said of me hereafter that i was
once in my life endicted for a felony

oh sir said he with a smile we are in no hurry about these
things the bill will lie over till we can procure a little more
evidence and some of a better quality don't be in any alarm but
allow me to recommend you to employ counsel my friend sharphead i
think will be your best man

i don't want any counsel said i and sharphead may go to the devil
i want to confide to you the true secret of this extraordinary affair

faith sir said he looking at me in surprise if you can do that
the case is not so ridiculous as i thought really mr higginson i
was rather amused than otherwise at the charge brought against you
not supposing you knew any thing of or had any connexion whatever
with the disappearance of poor sheppard lee but since you talk of
secrets sir i must inform you i am not the person you should make
any confessions to i must again recommend you to employ counsel

and with that he was about leaving me but i arrested him stop
jack said i his name was john darling and he is very well known
in the state though he was turned out of office you and i are old
friends and we must have a talk together

at these words he gave me a hard stare looking more astonished than
ever

jack said i taking him by the hand i'll make you stare harder
than that sheppard lee is no more dead than i am though as for his
body i believe old nick has got it now my boy i take it you will
act as a friend in this matter and not blab my secret but the truth
is it is john h higginson who is dead and i who am living

the deuse it is said the lawyer whose amazement set me into a
capital humour and pray sir he added if john h higginson is
dead who are you

sheppard lee said i bursting into a laugh only that you see me
now in john h higginson's body

i then proceeded to inform him as i have informed the reader of my
digging for the treasure of my sudden death of the visit of my spirit
to old turnbuckle's of the disappearance of my body of my finding
and entering that of squire higginson in which he now saw me and in
fine of all the other circumstances connected with the transformation
all which he heard like a man whom the novelty of the relation
astounded into marble

upon my soul said he when i had done you have told me a most
surprising story and so you really think yourself sheppard lee that
is sheppard lee's spirit in squire higginson's body

think myself sir said i a little fiercely

do you presume to slight my veracity sir or to doubt my common
sense

by no means said he i have the utmost respect for both your story
has completely satisfied me of your innocence a most wonderful story
sir truly a most wonderful story and repeating these words over and
over again he fell to nodding his head and musing staring at me all
the time like one who is lost in wonder and then suddenly rousing up
he burst into a roar of laughter seeing that i was incensed at his
merriment he hastened to apologize declaring that he was not laughing
at my story but at the absurdity he had been so nigh committing in
endicting me for my own murder and he added that my relation was
altogether the most remarkable he had ever heard in his life

i then gave him to understand i expected for very good and obvious
reasons that he would keep the story to himself which he faithfully
promised he then fell to cross-questioning me in relation to different
points and he was particularly curious to know what i supposed had
become of my body when not being able to satisfy him on that point
he himself suggested that perhaps squire higginson's spirit had taken
possession of it as i had done with his and carried it off for some
purpose or other and that we should soon have news of him an idea
that was so agreeable to him that he fell to laughing as hard as ever
sir said he shaking me by the hand in excellent good-humour we
will soon have you out of this dog-hole and that without betraying
your secret heaven forbid i should spoil the good fortune of my old
friend sheppard lee no sir i am no tale-bearer or blabber of
secrets comfort yourself sir i never had the least idea of endicting
you on this absurd charge nobody believes sheppard lee has been
murdered by you nor indeed by any one else no poor devil the
general opinion now is that he has taken himself off to get clear of
duns and sheriffs and as for the bloody shoe and hat why that's a
common way of turning pursuers off the scent by throwing dust in their
eyes the charge will be abandoned sir you will be liberated and
may if you like such amusement prosecute your captors by the dozen
for assault and battery farewell mr higginson that is mr lee
fortune smiles upon you at last and you are a happy a wonderful man
sir farewell

the attorney then left me and so much diverted was he by my adventure
that i could hear him indulge peal after peal of mirth until he had
got out of the prison

now it may be supposed that my story from its reasonableness carried
conviction to the attorney's mind and so i was persuaded but i
reckoned without my host the hypocritical gentleman did not believe
a word of it however much he pretended to do so but in this he was
like the rest of the fraternity i never indeed knew a lawyer to
believe any thing unless he was paid for it and i forgot to present
my gentleman a fee my story therefore not being paid for or proved
according to law only convinced this skeptical person that i the
unfortunate higginson as he called me had suddenly lost my senses
and gone staring mad and in consequence disregarding all his promises
of secrecy he ran over the whole village diverting every one he could
lay hands on with an account of the poor squire's hallucination
as he termed it that is to say his conceit that his body was now
inhabited by the soul of sheppard lee

but to give a certain personage his due or one of that personage's
representatives i must confess that darling who was at bottom a
good-natured fellow recollected one part of his promise and took
measures to effect my discharge from prison which was no very
difficult matter people being now pretty well aware of the folly
of the charge they had brought against me and the absurdity of the
evidence designed to support it the opinion was already entertained
that poor sheppard lee instead of being murdered had taken himself
out of the neighbourhood to avoid his creditors having left his hat
and shoe in the swamp only as blinds to those who might be most anxious
to secure his person and pursuers had already left the village to
discover his place of concealment




chapter iii


sheppard lee is visited by new friends released from prison and
carried to his new place of abode


another service that the attorney did me according to the jailer
through whom i discovered all these things was to despatch a messenger
to my friends in philadelphia with the news of my insanity and
imprisonment and a request that they should send proper persons to
take charge of me after being liberated and i was roused the following
morning by the appearance of some half a dozen kinsmen who had come to
the village for that purpose fully persuaded that they should find me
a raging lunatic

but the jailer's information had set me to reflecting upon my
difficulties all of which as i clearly perceived were owing to my
indiscretion in attempting to keep up the character of sheppard lee
while in another man's body i saw the necessity i was now placed under
to be mr john h higginson and nobody else for the future and so
i resolved to be for i did not like the idea of being clapped into a
mad-house by my new friends

yet they took me so much by surprise that i was guilty of some few
inconsistencies for it was not immediately that i felt myself at case
in my new character

the truth is my situation was peculiar and embarrassing with the body
of mr higginson i had acquired all his distinctive peculiarities
as i mentioned before but many of these were in a manner stupified
within me and required to be renewed or resuscitated by processes
of association i was like a man who has been roused from a lethargy
which had destroyed or obscured his memory though not his instincts
and who betrays complete ignorance of past events and forgetfulness
of old friends until some accidental circumstance a casual reference
to some past event the tone of a voice or other such cause recalls
him it may be to sudden and complete though usually imperfect
consciousness

thus when i was roused up in the morning and beheld a good-looking
personage of about my own years shaking me by the shoulder i regarded
him only as some impertinent stranger intruding upon my privacy
saluted him with divers epithets expressive of rage and indignation
and concluded by asking him who the devil he was

what i said he with the most doleful visage in the world why
timothy that is tim doolittle your brother-in-law don't you know
me

and don't you know me and me and me your cousin tom this
and your old friend dick that cried they all with horrible long
faces the oddity of which after a while set me a laughing especially
when i came to recollect them all as i did by-and-by when they had
pronounced their names for at each name it seemed to me as if a film
fell from my eyes and some spirit within awakened me to a vague
recollection of the person to whom it belonged in a word i became
aware that i was surrounded by a knot of my oldest and best friends
all of them excellent jolly dogs and good fellows who were come to
escort me home and assured me that i was no longer a prisoner

i shook them all by the hand and contrasting for a moment in my mind
the melancholy condition in which i had lived as sheppard lee with
my present glorious state surrounded by friends and conscious of
possessing lands houses stocks schuylkill coal-mines and the lord
knows what other goods beside i fell into a rapture danced about my
cell and hugged every person present as well as the jailer and my
old friend darling the attorney who happened at that moment to enter

bravo said tim doolittle now you're the true jack higginson again
and i don't believe you are mad a bit

mad said i thinking it needful to explain away that imputation
no and i never was i tumbled over an old rotten fence and hurt my
head which was in consequence in a whiz all day yesterday but now
it is clear enough i think i said some silly things about one thing
and another but that's neither here nor there

ah said tim doolittle touching his forehead and looking as grave as
a bullfrog it's well it's no worse for i always thought you had a
turn for apoplexy but i'm glad you are so well it will be good news
for poor margaret

margaret who the deuse is she said i feeling quite strange at the
name

why my poor sister your wife to be sure said he

my wife i recollected that i had a wife but the recollection
made me feel i knew not exactly why as if i had been suddenly soused
into cold water it was a highly uncomfortable idea and accordingly i
hastened to get rid of it

let us leave this confounded place i said and we left the prison

the prospect of a fine sunshiny day infused animation into my mind
which was vastly increased when i stepped into a splendid new barouche
with a pair of bay horses worth a thousand dollars for so much tim
gave me to understand i that is to say my prototype had given for
them scarce a month before the whole establishment being therefore my
own what a happy man am i ah poor miserable sheppard lee farewell
now to poverty farewell to discontent

such were my secret ejaculations as we set out in my splendid barouche
followed by a train of gigs and carriages that contained my friends i
esteemed myself the happiest man in the world and i gave my last sigh
to the memory of sheppard lee

what a glorious time we had of it on our way to philadelphia i found
myself the richest man in the company my pocketbook was full of
bank-notes and i resolved to give my friends a blow-out we stopped at
a certain village and at a certain hotel therein the master of which
prepares the best dinners and has the best butt of genuine madeira in
all new-jersey let us rest and rejoice i said and we will drive
into town after nightfall

my friends agreed we ate drank and were merry and it was not until
after sunrise the next morning that we found ourselves in philadelphia
and in my yes excellent reader in my house in chestnut-street
south side two doors from the corner of but it is needless to be
particular the house is yet standing in a highly aristocratic
neighbourhood and is not yet converted into a dry-goods shop

i reached my house i but before i relate what befell me in that
splendid pile of red bricks which like its neighbours seems to be
blushing all the year round at its naked simplicity i must say a few
words more of sheppard lee




chapter iv


containing illustrations of the advantages of dying an unusual death
in times of high political excitement


i never felt the slightest inclination to revisit the scenes of my late
trouble and discontent but the newspapers which are the lights of the
age though occasionally somewhat smoky acquainted me with the events
that followed after my marvellous disappearance what has become of
sheppard lee was the cry after his creditors had sought for him
in vain during a space of two weeks and more no vestige of him was
discovered not the slightest clew to indicate his fate beyond those
already brought to light in the owl-roost it was impossible he could
have fled without leaving some traces and none were found and why
should he fly men at last began to ask he was in debt it was true
but what could he gain by absconding since his little property was
necessarily left behind him

in a word the improbabilities of his having voluntarily fled were so
great that men began to recur to their original idea of his having
been murdered but why was he murdered and by whom some few began
to revive the charges against me that is to say against john h
higginson but brighter ideas were struck out and john h higginson
was forgotten an old friend of mine who never cared a fig for me
but who was ambitious to create a tumult and become the leader of a
party got up in a public place and recounted the history of william
morgan and his mysterious abduction and murder by the masons of the
empire state a terrible agitation at once seized his listeners poor
dear unfortunate sheppard lee they cried the masons have morganized
him for apostatizing from his oaths and revealing the secrets of the
society yes he has been morganized and giving way to their rage
they were on the point of tarring and feathering all the free-masons
they could lay their hands on when presto as the conjurers say
they suddenly made discovery that the masons could not have murdered
me for divulging secrets inasmuch as i had never known them nor for
apostatizing as i had never been a mason in my life

but the tumult was not allowed to subside my old friends of the
administration finding that their strength was dwindling away in
the country and dreading the event of the coming election unless a
reaction could be got up in their favour suddenly burst into a fury
swore that i had been made away with by the opposition on account
of my remarkable zeal energy and success as an electioneerer and
political missionary and taking my old hat and shoe and carrying
them round the village in solemn procession they stopped in the
market-place where one of their chief orators my faithful friend
the new postmaster delivered a sort of funeral address in which
he compared the opponents of the administration to cut-throats and
cannibals pronounced them the enemies of liberty swore that no honest
patriot was safe among them and declared his declaration being
illustrated by shouts and groans and grim faces that i had perished
the victim of a murderous opposition

but as if that was not immortality enough for one of my humble
pretensions the opposition instantly turned the tables upon their
accusers witnesses stepped forward to prove that on the night when
i was seen for the last time i had in the bar-room of the first
hotel in the village publicly denounced the hurrah party as being
based upon deception and fraud and avowed my determination not only
instantly to leave it but to go my death thenceforth in opposition
see the bloody vindictiveness and malice of the hurrah party
they cried before the sun rose upon this unfortunate and honest
man honest because he deserted his party the moment his eyes were
opened to its corruption he was a living man no longer the bravoes
of this horrible gang of mid-night murderers who have trampled on our
rights and liberties and now trample on our lives met the unlucky
patriot as he returned to his lowly cot and just heavens where was
he now save in his bloody and untimely grave he the humble the
unoffending the honest the universally-esteemed the widely-beloved
the patriotic sheppard lee waylaid and ambushed killed slain
murdered massacred the victim of a despotic and vindictive
cabal the martyr of liberty the  in short the noblest honestest
dearest best and most ill-used creature that ever dabbled in the
puddle of politics one might suppose that this outcry of the antis
backed as it was by the full proof of my change of politics would have
stopped the mouths of the hurrah-boys but it did no such thing they
only raved the louder as for the proof of my backsliding they treated
that with contempt proofs being as little regarded in politics as
arguments they accused the antis more zealously than before and the
antis recriminated with equal enthusiasm

there were some men in the village who strove to appease the ferment
by directing suspicion upon the german doctor and divers other
personages just as the humour of suspicion seized them furiously
accusing these suspected individuals of having had some hand in the
catastrophe but the german doctor and the other persons accused
had nothing to do with politics and were therefore suffered to go
their ways it is a great protection to one's reputation to keep
clear of politics the guilt of my murder was left to be borne by the
hurrah-boys and the antis one party or the other but as the evidence
was equally strong against either party and just as strong against
any one individual of either party as another it resulted that i was
murdered not only by both parties but by every man of both parties a
peculiarity in my history that proved me to have possessed though i
never dreamed it before a vaster number both of energetic friends and
bloodthirsty enemies each man being both friend and enemy than any
other man in the whole world

how the antis and the hurrah-boys settled the affair among them i did
not care to inquire i was engrossed by the novelties and charms of a
new being and willing to forget that such a poor devil as sheppard lee
had ever existed




chapter v


the true meaning of the word podagra


let the reader judge of my transport when my elegant new barouche
and splendid pair of horses that cost me a thousand dollars drew up
before my house in chestnut-street i stood upon the kerb-stone and
surveyed it from top to bottom the marble of the steps basement and
window-sills was white as snow and the bricks were redder than roses
the windows were of plate glass and within them were curtains of
crimson damask fronted with hangings of white lace as fine and lovely
as a bride's veil of true paris blonde and a great bouquet of dahlias
wreathed around a blooming rose glittered in each it was evidently
the house of a man of wealth and figure

the neighbourhood it was equally manifest was of the highest vogue
and distinction on one side was the dwelling of a fashionable
tailor who built a house out of every ten coats that he cut on the
other side was the residence of a retired tavern-keeper and right
opposite on the other side of the street was the mansion of one of
the first aristocrats in the town who had had neither a tailor nor
a tavern-keeper in the family for a space of three full generations
there was no end to the genteel people in my neighbourhood here was
the house of a firstrate lawyer there of a shop-keeper who had not
sold any thing by retail for ten years here a croesus of a carpenter
who turned up his nose at the aristocrat and there a plutus of a
note-shaver who looked with contempt on the gentleman of chips in
short my house was in a highly fashionable neighbourhood and i felt
as i mounted my marble steps that jack higginson the brewer as my
brother tim always called me was as genteel a fellow among them as
you would find of a summer's day

i entered the house as proud as lucifer telling my friends that they
should crack a bottle or two of my best port for tim had given me a
hint that my cellar contained some of the best in the world and
said tim giving me a wink we may take our fun now as sister
margaret  at that name i felt a cold creeping in my bones as
sister margaret is still in the country the ague left me i did not
think it he continued worth while to alarm her

the lord be thanked said i though why i said it i knew no more
than the man in the moon

we sat down we drank and we made merry that is to say they made
merry as for myself a circumstance occurred which nipped my pleasure
in the bud and began to make me doubt whether in exchanging the
condition of sheppard lee for that of john h higginson i had not made
somewhat of a bad bargain

i had managed somehow or other in the course of the night to stump
my toe or wrench my foot and though the accident caused me but
little inconvenience at the time the member had begun gradually to
feel uneasy and now as i sat at my table it grew so painful that
i was forced to draw off my boot but this giving me little relief
and finding that my foot was swollen out of all shape and beauty my
brother tim pronounced it a severe strain and recommended that i
should call in my family physician dr boneset a very illustrious
man and fine fellow who at that moment chanced to drive by in his
coal-black gig which looked as physicians gigs usually look as if
in mourning for a thousand departed patients

what's the matter said the doctor

why doctor said i i have given my foot a confounded wrench i
scarce know how but it is as big and as hot as a plum-pudding

hum ay very unlucky said the doctor off with your stocking and
let me look at your tongue pulse quite feverish fine port he said
drinking off a glass that tim had poured him and cocking his eye like
one who means to be witty fine port sir but one can't float in it
for ever without paying port-charges a very gentlemanly disease at
all events it lies between port and porter

port and porter disease said i slipping off my stocking as he
directed without well knowing what he meant my foot was as red as
a salamander swelled beyond all expression and while i drew the
stocking it hurt me most horribly

zounds doctor said i can that be a wrench

no said the doctor it's the wrencher genuine podagra pon
honour

podagra said i podagra said tim and podagra said the others
what's that

gout said the doctor

gout cried my friends gout roared my brother tim and gout
yelled i starting from the doctor as if from an imp of darkness who
had just come to make claim to me it was the unluckiest leap in the
world i kicked over a chair as i started and the touch was as if i
had clapped my foot into the jaws of a roaring lion crunch went every
bone crack went every sinew and such a yell as i set up was never
before heard in chestnut-street

you see gentlemen i'll take another glass of that port mr
doolittle you see what we must all come to this is one of the
small penalties one must pay for being a gentleman when one dances
one must pay the piper now would my friend higginson there give a
whole year of his best brewing that all the pale ale and purple port
that have passed his lips had been nothing better than elder-wine
and bonny-clabber but never mind my dear sir said the son of
æsculapius with a coolness that shocked me as long as it's only in
your foot it's a small matter

a small matter i grinned at him but the unfeeling wretch only
repeated his words a small matter

i had never been sick before in my life as john h higginson my
worst complaints had been only an occasional surfeit or a moderate
attack of booziness and as sheppard lee i had never known any disease
except laziness which being chronic i had grown so accustomed to
that it never troubled me but now ah now my first step into the
world of enjoyment was to be made on red-hot ploughshares and pokers
my first hour of a life of content was to be passed in grinning and
groaning and but it is hardly worth while to say it the gout should
be confined to religious people for men of the world will swear and
that roundly

for six days  six mortal days  did i lay upon my back enduring
such horrible twitches and twinges in my foot that i was more than
once on the point of ordering the doctor to cut it off and i do not
know how far that conceit might have gone had not the heartless
fellow who i believe was all the while making game of my torments
assured me that the only effect of the dismemberment would be to drive
the enemy into the other foot where it would play the same tricks over
again the gout said he has as great an affection for the human
body as a cat has for a house in which she has been well treated when
it once effects a lodgment and feels itself comfortable 

comfortable said i with a groan

in good easy quarters 

don't talk to me of easy quarters said i for if i were hacked
into quarters and that by the clumsiest butcher in the town i could
not be more uneasy in every quarter

i am talking said dr boneset not of you but of the disease and
what i meant to say was that when it once finds itself at home in a
good wholesome corporation of a man there you may expect to find it a
tenant for life

for life said i i am the most wretched man in existence oh
sheppard lee sheppard lee what a fool were you to think yourself
miserable doctor i shall go mad

not while you have the gout said he tis a sovereign protection
against all that but let us look at your foot and the awkward or
malicious creature managed to drop a tortoise and gold snuff-box of
about a pound and a half weight which he was always sporting right
upon the point of my great toe while he was looking at it had it been
a ton and a half instead of a pound and a half in weight it could not
have thrown me into greater torture and the the man he thought he
had settled the matter by making me a handsome apology he left me to
endure my pangs and to curse squire higginson's father grandfather
great-grandfather and in general all his forefathers who had
entailed such susceptible great toes upon the family in a word i was
in such a horrible quandary that i wished the devil would fly off with
my new body as he had done before with the old




chapter vi


sheppard lee's introduction to his wife and his suspicion that all is
not gold that glistens


but there is as philosophers say an unguent for every wound a solace
for every care and it was my fate to experience the consolation that
one provides beforehand against the gout as well as all other ills man
may anticipate in the person of a faithful spouse on the fourth day
of my malady and just at a moment when i was fairly yelling with pain
a lady neither young nor beautiful but dressed like a princess save
that her shoes were down at heel and her bonnet somewhat awry stepped
up to my bedside seized me by the hand and crying out oh my poor
dear husband burst into tears

her appearance acted like a charm even my foot that seemed to be
roasting over one of nott's patent anthracite blazers grew cool
and comfortable in the chill that was diffused over my whole body
complaint was silent at the sight of her pain vanished at her touch i
forgot that i had the gout and remembered only that i had a wife

i was struck dumb and presume i should not have groaned again for
twenty-four hours had not my consort in the exuberance of her
affection and grief thrown her arms around my neck and thereby
brought the whole weight of her body upon my foot which after
having tried all parts of the bed i had at last lodged upon the
very extremity of the feathers by which act of endearment my poor
unfortunate limb was crushed against the horrible log of mahogany that
made one side of the bed-stead and ground to pieces had my wife been
my wife twenty times over i must have uttered just as loud a cry as i
did and repeated it just as often

she started up and regarded me with severity

is that the way you use me said she i believe i had rather pushed
her away but how could i help it is that the way you welcome me
home whither i have come leaving kinsfolk and friends to nurse
you barbarous man you hate me yes and besides having no longer any
love for me you have not even the slightest regard for my feelings
but don't think mr higginson that i will be treated so any longer
you may break my heart your poor margaret's heart if you will
but but  and here the affectionate creature was so overcome that
she could not utter another word but sat down wringing her hands and
weeping as if i had broken her heart and she had not crushed my foot
but as far as my experience enables me to form any opinion on such a
subject i must say that wives have an extraordinary knack at turning
the tables on their husbands

for heaven's sake madam said i don't set me distracted the
pain and her absurd reproaches together made me both frantic and
ferocious don't make me believe that adam's wife was made out of the
bone of a gouty leg instead of a good sound rib

what do you mean by that sir said mrs higginson

only said i gritting my teeth that i have some thoughts she must
have been a piece of the sorest bone in his body

my wife marched up to the bed and looked me in the face my wrath
went out like a gas-light before a black frost my agonies again
disappeared there was no standing that look unless one could stand
the look of a jersey black-snake famous beyond all other snakes for
its powers of fascination and talking of snakes i must add that
while my wife gave me that look i felt as if one just turned out of
winter-quarters horribly cold and creepy were slipping down my back
she looked at me with mingled anger and disdain

how often have i told you mr higginson she said never to attempt
to be witty since you only expose your folly i won't use any harder
word and whatever you do sir she added beginning to cry again
don't make a jest of your wife sir you're always doing it sir
you're always making me appear ridiculous to your friends and to
myself you treat me as if i were a fool you 

madam said i endeavouring to appease her a little for i was quite
overcome by her violence remember that i have the gout and am
suffering the 

yes she cried and you are determined that everybody else shall
suffer as well as yourself and me in particular oh mr higginson
how can you use me so i'll never speak to you another word

and down she sat again weeping and wringing her hands harder than
ever and moping and whining the lord knows how long

sheppard lee sheppard lee i muttered but i took good care not to
mutter aloud you were not the most miserable dog in the world by a
great deal a gouty constitution and a perverse wife are oh pangs and
purgatory

i hoped my consort being so greatly incensed would take herself out
of the room when i determined though it should cost me a howl for
every step to get up and lock the door on her come of it what might
but she was not of that mind she maintained her seat sobbing and
sighing and by taking off her hat and flinging it pettishly into
a corner made it manifest that she had determined to nurse me in
earnest though in a way entirely of her own happily the paroxysm of
suffering which was at its height when she entered soon subsided
and being left greatly exhausted and her sobs having somewhat of a
soporific quality i managed notwithstanding my mental disquiet to
fall fast asleep whereby i got rid for a time of an evil in many
respects equal to the gout itself

two days after i was able to leave my bed though not to walk had i
been i am strongly of opinion i should have walked out of my house 
out of the city of philadelphia and perhaps out of the united states
of america nay and upon a pinch out of the world itself to get rid
of my beloved wife who would have believed in our village that john
h higginson who seemed to have nothing in the world to do but to
slaughter woodcocks beat his dog ponto and ride about in a fine new
barouche with a pair of horses that cost a thousand dollars who had a
dwelling-house in chestnut-street a brewery in the northern liberties
with an ale-butt as big as the basin of the mediterranean a goodly
store of real estate in town and country bank-stock and coal-mines
and a thousand other of the good things of the world who i say
would have believed that this same john h higginson was decidedly the
most miserable dog in the whole universe it was truth every word of
it and before i was six days old in my new body i wished no not
that the devil had me but i was more than willing he should have the
better half of me i had the gout my wife was a shrew and i was a
henpecked husband

yes the reader may stare and bless his stars the manly john h
higginson who seemed to have no earthly care or trouble and who was
so little deficient in spirit that he could quarrel with a jersey
farmer while trespassing on his grounds shoot his bull-dog and take
aim at his negro had long since succumbed to the superior spirit and
acknowledged the irresponsible supremacy of his wife in the field
and at a distance from his house he was a man of spirit and figure
but at home the most submissive of the henpecked resistance against a
petticoat government is as all know the most hopeless of resistance
a single man has often subverted a monarchy and overturned a republic
but history has not yet recorded an instance of successful rebellion on
the part of a married man against the tyranny of a wife the tongue of
woman is the only true sceptre for unlike other emblems of authority
it is both the instrument of power and the axe of execution john h
higginson attempted no resistance against the rule of his wife the
few explosions of impatience of which he was now and then guilty were
punished with a rigour that awed him into discretion on this subject i
feel myself eloquent and i could expatiate on it by the hour but i am
writing not so much the history of my reflections as of my adventures
and i must hasten on with my story




chapter vii


a comparison between dunning and scolding with some thoughts on
suicide


no one but a henpecked husband who may happen to be shut up in prison
with his wife can appreciate the horror of the situation in which
i now found myself placed the gout prevented my escaping even for
a moment from the sway of my spouse she truly had me tied to her
apron-string and as i may say by a cord that went round my sore
foot i was a martyr to two of the greatest ills that ever afflicted
a son of adam and the two together were not to be borne either if
alone i might perhaps have tolerated in consideration of the many
good things that marked my lot i might have endured the gout if i
had had a wife who instead of scolding at me would have suffered me
as a good wife should to do all the scolding myself or i might even
have submitted to the tyranny of my margaret had i been able to beat a
retreat when i grew tired of it but my wife and the gout together were
not to be borne by any human being they set me after a while quite
distracted

what pleasure had i in being the rich john h higginson it was in vain
that my brother-in-law tim who it appears was the junior partner
and factotum in the brewery as well as manager-general of my affairs
bragged to me of the astonishing rise in my property and declared
i was already worth a hundred thousand dollars in the midst of my
exultation i heard my wife's voice on the stairs and my joy oozed out
of the hair of my head i could only look at tim and groan and tim did
the same for poor fellow though only her brother he was as much
henpecked as myself never mind said tim consolatorily your foot
will be well by-and-by and then we shall have a jolly time together
but my comforter took great care on such occasions to sneak out of the
house in good time and so leave me to bear the evil by myself

in the course of two weeks or thereabouts my foot had so far
recovered that i was able to put it on the ground and hobble about a
little with a crutch but i had lost all hope of ever being able to
resume my exercises in the field i was therefore reduced to despair
and my wife becoming more intolerable every day i began to be so weary
of existence that i was once or twice on the point of making away with
myself

she was in truth the nonpareil of women and of scolders i have
called her a shrew but it must not be supposed she was of that species
to which men give the name of tartar she was none of your fierce
pepper-tempered creatures who wrangle in a loud voice over the whole
house and sometimes take broomsticks to the servants such viragoes
are in a measure sufferable for they are sometimes in a good-humour
my margaret was of the family of croakers as they are called that
is of a lugubrious grumbling complexion always sad and whining full
of suspicions and reproaches now in tears now in hysterics always
in an ill-humour and so keeping every one about her in a state of
misery i never knew a servant male or female old or young black
or white to remain in the house two weeks at a time except a poor
little negress that had been bound to me that is my prototype under
indentures and she after running away a dozen times began to mope
and pine and look so sorrowful that out of pity i sent her home
to her mother as for myself being incapable of flying and exposed
all day long to her lectures and reproaches i became melancholy and
desperate wished myself sheppard lee again with the constable and
sheriff both after me and twice or thrice as i have hinted before
resolved to put an end to my life

one day while i was reading the papers i fell upon the account of
a man who had hanged himself he was in good circumstances said
the journal and had a wife and three children no reason has been
assigned or suspected for his rash act

no doubt his wife was a shrew said i to myself and there was no
way of getting rid of her and so it was the wisest thing the poor man
could do

i thought over this occurrence so long that it produced a great
effect upon my mind and my wife leaving me one day more incensed and
desperate than ever i snatched up a bit of cord that lay in my way
and resolved to strangle myself forthwith i should have hanged myself
over the chamber door but was in dread i might slip down to the floor
and hurt my foot and thinking it more genteel to die in my bed i made
the cord into a noose or ring through which having placed it about
my neck i clapped a silver candlestick by means of which i thought i
might twist the cord tight enough to strangle me and so i might had i
possessed the nerve but in truth i no sooner found my breath a little
obstructed than i became alarmed with the idea of apoplexy which was
always frightful to me and so gave over my purpose

on another occasion i sent to an apothecary whom i knew for a vial
of prussic acid which takes life so expeditiously that as i
supposed one could have no time to be in pain but that i might know
in what manner it operated i gave a quantity to a neighbour's cat
which had found her way into my chamber and made friends with me
during my confinement and the creature was thrown into such horrible
convulsions and set up such a diabolical yell that although she was
stone-dead in less than half a minute i was convinced this was the
most uncomfortable way of dying that could be hit on

i had then some thoughts of drowning myself and only hesitated whether
i should try the experiment in the bath-tub or wait until i could bear
a ride over the paving-stones to the river as to cutting my throat or
blowing my brains out i had never the slightest idea of trying either
for in respect to the former besides that it makes such a horrible
puddle of blood about one's body it causes one to look as vulgar and
low-lived as a slaughtered bullock and as for the latter i was so
familiar with fire-arms that i knew them to be weapons one cannot
trifle with

but fortune that had served me such a scurvy trick in saddling me with
gout and a scolding wife along with the wealth of john h higginson
willed that i should employ none of these deadly expedients against my
life but get rid of my distresses in a manner much more remarkable and
novel




chapter viii


sheppard lee forms sundry acquaintances some of which are genteel


it was three full weeks before i left my chamber and during the last
days of that confinement the only amusement i had consisted in looking
from the window after properly poising my leg on a soft cushion upon
what passed in the streets and this as the reader may suppose i only
enjoyed when my wife left off tormenting me for a moment to go down
stairs and torment the servants

this was poor pastime for one of my habits and turn of mind but my
wife had made me contemplative and had it not been for the perpetual
dread of her return that i was under i think i might have extracted
some diversion from what i saw in the streets but being in constant
fear and vexation i looked on with a spirit too morose and cynical for
my own enjoyment

day after day between the hours of five and six in the afternoon
i observed mr cutclose the tailor descend from his marble steps
and climb upon the back of a horse to take the evening air he
rode like one who had taken his chief lessons on the shop-board
and i often wondered he did not draw up his legs and sit on the
saddle hunker-fashion at once but what particularly struck me
was the compliment he paid himself of wearing his own coats cut
american-fashion about the arm-holes and so keeping himself in
purgatory all day long he used to give parties every fortnight and
invite all the dandies whom he had down in his tick-book by which
means his entertainments were rendered highly genteel and fashionable

next door to mr cutclose lived the great lawyer of our square the
celebrated coke butterside esq i could see him sally out every
morning with his green bag which he carried in his own hands either
because he intended to be a candidate at the next congressional
election and would seem democratic or because he was afraid if
he intrusted it to another the devil might snap it up as his own
property he had a lordly self-satisfied air about him as if he felt
the full merit of his vocation and prided himself upon having more men
by the ears than any other in the whole city his bow was exceedingly
condescending and his look protecting

nearer at hand was the dwelling of the old note-shaver old goldfist
as they called him though his true name was skinner he was horribly
rich and such a miserly insatiable old hunks that although he had
ostensibly retired from business he was originally a pawn-broker
for some six or seven years he still kept up his trade in a certain
way that was not so reputable as gainful and of which i shall have
occasion to say something by-and-by he was said to be a good friend of
such desperate young gentlemen as moved in high life and had passable
expectations from rich uncles and parents but he was said to hold his
friendship at very extortionate prices how such a skinflint as he
ever came to live in a good house and in a fashionable quarter was a
question not easy to solve but according to tim my brother-in-law's
story he came for economy having got the house of a demolished
aristocrat who had fallen into his clutches and found it in so
dilapidated a condition that he chose to live in it himself rather than
submit to the expense of preparing it for a tenant it brought him
moreover nearer to his customers and perhaps the old curmudgeon who
had a daughter and a brace of hopeful sons had a hope of thus getting
them into society

but one who lives at heaven's gate does not live in heaven as the
saying is old goldfist kept neither horses nor carriages nor did he
give parties i doubt whether he ever asked anybody to dine with him
in his life and as for his boys and his girl all of whom were grown
up he kept them in such a mean condition that they were not company
for genteel people everybody despised them especially cutclose the
tailor who turned up his nose at them and called them rooterers
which i am told for i never troubled myself to study the modern
languages there being so many of them is a french word signifying
low people

 perhaps roturiers rooterers is however good america french
 printer's devil

this old money-maker who had a stoop in the shoulders used to
parade the street up and down before his own door every sunshiny
day in a thread-bare brown coat to which he sometimes added a blue
spencer roundabout a silver-headed stick in one hand and a yellow
handkerchief in the other the latter he was wont every two or three
minutes to clap to his nose producing thereby an explosion which
notwithstanding the muffler over his nostrils was prodigiously strong
and sonorous and once to my knowledge it frightened a young lady
into the gutter

i could say a great deal more of this old gentle man whom everybody
despised but whom every man took off his hat to on account of his
wealth but i shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter

as for the rest of my neighbours i do not think them worthy of notice
i might indeed except mr periwinkle smith my opposite neighbour
spoken of before whom i knew to belong to that order of aristocracy
which is emphatically termed chip-chop and who was of such pure blood
that it had known no mechanical taint for three different generations
the nearest approach to such disgrace being found in a family of
ragamuffins who claimed to be mr smith's relations merely because
they were descended from his grandfather but who were very properly
discountenanced by him

this old gentleman had a daughter who seemed to be universally admired
judging from the numbers of visiters of both sexes who besieged her
father's door every morning to do her justice i must say she was very
handsome but she had the additional merit of being an only child and
therefore an heiress as was supposed i thought so myself until tim
who knew something of everybody's affairs assured me that her father's
estate was eaten up by mortgages that he was poor as a rat and would
die insolvent

among the many young gentlemen who paid court to the fair miss smith
i noticed one who besides being more assiduous in his attentions
seemed also to enjoy a greater share of her regard than others he was
a young fellow of uncommonly genteel figure that is he was long and
lank somewhat narrow in the shoulders but clean-limbed and straight
as an arrow he had a long face and hollow cheeks but what his jaws
lacked in flesh was made up to them in beard his whiskers which
were coal-black being as exuberant as if made by a brush-maker and
stretching from his temples to the point of his chin and so enveloping
his whole face he had besides a pair of peaked mustaches that would
have done honour to the grand seignior and with a turban and caftan
on he might have paid his respects to the alumni of any college in the
land without even the necessity of speaking bad latin he dressed
well walked with a step as easy and majestical as a stork or an
ostrich and was evidently a favourite with the ladies

 here sheppard lee seems to have had in his eye a very ingenious
loafer of pearl slip or thereabouts who some years since was seized
with the whim of travelling and bamboozling the politic especially
the learned part thereof by the aid of little dog-latin horribly
anglicized in idiom and pronunciation a stock of gothamic impudence
and features truly yankee and vernacular he convinced the cognoscenti
of one or more learned institutions that he was a highly unlucky son
of a turk born all the way off at damascus

his name tim told me was i d that is to say isaac
dulmer dawkins though in consideration of the rusticalness of the
first member of the triad and from regard to his feelings which
were outraged by its pronunciation his friends had universally
agreed to suppress it and in consequence he was called i dulmer
dawkins esquire that title being added because it is the only one
an american gentleman not in office or the militia can claim he
was as timothy assured me a dandy of the true style being a born
scion of the chip-chop order and as such admitted to all its honours
and immunities though without the support of any living relations
in society or as his ill luck would have it of connexions either
he was said to possess some little property in town and what was
still better to be the heir of a rich uncle without children whom he
expected to die within a reasonable period as for his town property
my brother tim doubted its existence altogether and would perhaps
have been as skeptical in regard to the uncle had he not known that
an uncle did really exist and a rich one too for he was largely
concerned in the distilling and lumbering business on the susquehanna

i am particular in making the reader acquainted with mr i dulmer
dawkins inasmuch as it was my fortune after a time to fall into a
connexion with him myself as intimate as it was unexpected

when i first saw him i accounted him an ugly and uncouth personage
and i regarded him with contempt and dislike i had acquired along
with other peculiarities of john h higginson a hearty hatred for all
people who considered themselves better than myself for rich and
respectable as i was i soon perceived that i was considered a very
low vulgar personage by the true chip-chop aristocracy and i longed
greatly at times as i looked out of the window upon them to take some
of them by the ears and settle the matter of superiority between us in
that way

but as for mr dulmer dawkins i soon began to experience an interest
in him which was indeed of a somewhat envious complexion i frequently
saw him dancing along at the side of the fair miss smith and he
seemed so exceedingly happy and content and she cast upon him so many
approving glances that i could not help contrasting his condition with
mine there he strutted in the open street young active and hale
as ignorant of disease as of care and here sat i in a sick chamber
imprisoned with the gout there he moved at the side of a young and
elegant woman who eyed him with admiration doubtless also with
regard and who had such native amiableness and cheerfulness imprinted
together on her countenance that it was plain she must prove a
blessing rather than a curse to him who should be so happy as to wed
her while i miserable i was tied to such a wife as i could scarce
have the cruelty to wish bestowed upon my worst enemy contracted to an
ague married as i may say to a toothache i should have been glad to
exchange conditions with mr dulmer dawkins ay by my honour if there
was ever honour in man or with anybody else

from tim's account it seemed that my young gentleman had a longer face
than head in other words that nature had endowed him more bountifully
with beard than brains and in truth i judged by the way he showed
his teeth and rolled his eyes at the fair miss smith and a thousand
other little grimaces and affectations i was witness to that he
was neither more wise nor brilliant than the others of his tribe
but what of that wisdom and care go hand in hand and wit makes us
uncomfortable fools are the only happy people so i used to think
while i looked on mr i d dawkins and the fair miss smith

but it is an ill way to pass time peeping into millstones or reading
men's history out of their faces dulmer dawkins had his cares as well
as another i suddenly missed him from the street the fair miss smith
made her promenades attended by other admirers and for three whole
days mr dawkins was invisible on the fourth he reappeared i saw him
as he came up the street escorting another belle entirely unknown to
me but of a dashing appearance as he passed mr periwinkle smith's
house the fair miss smith issued from the door mr dawkins made her a
low and most elegant bow his companion waved her fan and they passed
on looking unutterable things at one another the fair miss smith
seemed confounded a flush appeared on her face and then vanished
she looked after her admirer and then with her attendants two young
coxcombs who were with her descended the steps and walked down the
street i saw her once turn her head half round as if to look again
after dulmer but her curiosity anger sorrow or whatever feeling it
was prompted the movement was restrained and she strode off at an
unusually rapid and unfashionable gait so so my turtles have been
quarrelling i said to myself and the fair miss smith is just a
jezebel like the rest of her confounded sex it never occurred to me
to think a quarrel arising between two persons of different sexes could
be caused by any thing but the unreasonable behaviour of the lady

it was two weeks before i saw dulmer dawkins again and then i beheld
him under a new aspect




chapter ix


the author grows weary of his wife and mistakes the schuylkill for the
river lethe the tragical adventure that befell a young gentleman in
that romantic tide with its effects upon the destinies of sheppard lee


it may be supposed since i was able to amuse my mind with such
observations that they detracted from the miseries of my condition
or at least assuaged in some measure my pangs but as well might one
believe that the condemned malefactor who looks out from his cart
on the volunteer companies escorting him to the gallows and admires
the splendid incoherence of their trappings their infantry coats and
horsemen's hats their republican faces and imperial colours feels
thereby less dissatisfaction with his shroud and coffin and the rope
coiled so inelegantly round his neck my observations were made only at
intervals that were both brief and rare my wife was the most attentive
creature that ever set a husband distracted and under the plea of
nursing me gave me so much of her company that i was gradually driven
to desperation in course of time i was happily able to get into my
barouche and thus for a short hour or two escape my tormentor had
that period been deferred a week later i should certainly have taken
an ounce of arsenic that i found lying in a closet though i knew it
was awful bad stuff to swallow

as soon as i found myself once more at liberty i began to con over
a project i had formed of deserting my dear margaret altogether and
this i resolved to put into execution the moment my foot should be well
enough for travelling but oh horror just as the doctor pronounced me
cured i was seized with a second paroxysm and beheld nothing before
me but eternal captivity and unmitigated wife

this attack was brought on by the mere triumph of restoration the
afternoon before i drove out upon the schuylkill with tim and another
friend and several other jolly dogs meeting us we stopped together
at a well-known house of entertainment on the banks of that river and
resolved to enjoy ourselves i declare in all sincerity that i was
very moderate both in eating and drinking but having sat at the table
until after nightfall and being well content to tarry longer i made
a sudden and rash resolution not to return that night at all nor upon
the following day either if i could avoid it but as it was necessary
to account for my absence to my wife i instructed tim to tell her i
had contracted a sudden fit of podagra which made it proper i should
not expose myself to the night-air with this fib in his mouth tim
who considered the whole thing a capital joke as indeed he did every
other of my devising returned to the city whither he was followed by
the others before midnight

now whether it was that the immoderate satisfaction i indulged in at
enjoying even a few hours of quiet was an excess capable of bringing
on a paroxysm of gout whether it was the unwholesome night-air of
the schuylkill so famous for its agues and bilious fevers or whether
indeed it was not the lie i had invented which was punished upon me in
the reality of the affliction i had assumed it is certain that i woke
up the next morning in quite a feverish condition and with all the
symptoms of returning podagra though i did not immediately suspect it
it was not until towards nightfall that i understood my situation

in the meanwhile tim had returned and again driven back to town
without me to assure my affectionate spouse that being entirely
recovered i thought it best to defer my return until the evening at
which time i proposed to be sick again so as to excuse my remaining
from home a second night in this way i designed to put off my return
from night till morning and from morning till night as long as i
could

feeling a little better about dinner-time i indulged in a hearty meal
and then lay down but i had not slept many hours before i dreamed the
devil was tugging at my foot with a pair of red-hot tongs and starting
up in anguish i perceived clearly enough that my malady had returned

miserable wretch that i am i cried why was i not content to
be sheppard lee was poverty worse than the gout was debt equal
in torment to a scolding wife what a fool i was to change my
condition would that i was now a dog

i hobbled down to the porch of the inn not without pain for my foot
was awfully tender and began to picture to myself the misery that was
inevitably prepared for me the thought of living a month longer in the
same house with my wife entirely at her mercy drove me to despair in
the midst of which being roused by the sound of approaching wheels
i looked up and beheld my wife herself advancing as fast as my
elegant bays could bear her to pay me a visit i knew her by her white
feathers and my brother tim was sitting at her side

at this sight my philosophy forsook me altogether i fell into a
phrensy and disregarding the condition of my foot or rather sharpened
and confirmed in my purpose by the pangs it gave me i rushed down
to the river-side towards a spot where i knew there was deep water
resolved to throw myself in without a moment's delay and this without
considering that as it was hot weather i should spoil the water drunk
by my fellow-citizens this was an objection that partly occurred to
me before when debating the subject of drowning and i think it so
serious a one that i would recommend to the councils of philadelphia
to appoint a bailiff whose express duty should be to prevent people
drowning themselves in the basin and the same person might have an eye
to the drowned cats dogs pigs calves dead fish and swimming boys
that somewhat detract from the agreeableness of the water

i reached the place just as the barouche drew up at the door and
hopping forward i began to slip off my coat and waistcoat and draw
out my watch and pocketbook though for what purpose i am sure i
cannot say but what was my surprise to perceive myself forestalled
in my intentions by another person who stood upon the very rock from
which i designed to throw myself and was evidently preparing to
exercise justice upon himself in the same summary way he was a tall
lank personage of highly genteel figure and habit but his back being
towards me i could not see his face

i had scarce laid eyes upon him before with a very violent motion of
his arm he cast his hat into the stream and immediately afterward
his neck-cloth then slapping his hands together like one who is
about rushing into a fight and rushing into it with resolution he
exclaimed the devil take all women and tailors and leaped into the
river which instantly closed over his head

i was so petrified at his rashness that i forgot my own and stood
staring on the water as it came rushing in agitated ripples to the
shore lost in such confusion and horror that for a space of a minute
or more i neither moved hand nor foot the water which previous to
the plunge had been as smooth as a mirror was fast regaining its
tranquillity when on a sudden a great bubbling began to appear a few
yards below the rock and i saw the top of a man's head come to the
surface and immediately after sink again

at that sight my presence of mind was restored and being much
concerned that a young fellow as he appeared to be should perish so
miserably i rushed into the river and being a good diver had but
little trouble to fish him up and drag him to the shore but i pulled
him out a moment too late he was as dead as a herring or appeared to
be for his countenance was distorted and blue as an in digo-bag and
his mouth full of foam a circumstance which i regretted the more as i
no sooner looked him in the face than i recognised the features of my
friend if i may so call him mr i dulmer dawkins

as i was dragging the body to the shore a carriage came rattling along
the road which is there so near to the river that those who were in
it could easily perceive the act in which i was engaged and they
stopped it to give me assistance it was at that very moment that i
discovered who it was i was carrying and i was so much surprised at
the discovery that i cried out in a loud voice i d dawkins by the
lord

there was immediately a great screaming in the carriage and out
rushed my aristocratical neighbour mr periwinkle smith with two
young ladies one of whom was his daughter and such an uproar and
lamentation as they made about me were perhaps never before made by so
small a number of genteel people on any occasion i was particularly
affected by the expressions of the fair miss smith who seemed overcome
by grief and as i did not doubt she had an affection for the young
fellow i wondered what folly could have driven him into this act of
suicide

but my wonder was not very long-lived the cries of the two ladies had
reached the inn and drawn every soul therein to the scene of disaster
they came running towards us and i saw that my wife was among them

i could maintain my equanimity no longer in the bitterness of my heart
i muttered almost aloud and as sincerely as i ever muttered any thing
in my life i would i were this addle-pate dawkins were it only to be
lying as much like a drowned rat as he

i had not well grumbled the last word before a sudden fire flashed
before my eyes a loud noise like the roar of falling water passed
through my head and i lost all sensation and consciousness




book iii


containing much that will be interesting to young gentlemen in debt
and to fathers of families who desire to have their children rise in
society




chapter i

the inconveniences of being drowned the first chapter of the history
of i d dawkins esq


when i recovered my wits i thought i had got into the place which is
never mentioned among polite people except at church i perceived a
horrible smell of gin whiskey hartshorn tobacco-smoke and spirits
of firstrate camphire as if these made up the constituents of the
atmosphere of darkness and i saw though very obscurely for the light
was dim and there seemed to be films over my eyes a number of figures
that moved to and fro uttering discordant noises one of them it
seems and i took it for granted he was the chief devil stood by me
pressing my ribs with a fist that felt marvellously heavy while with
the other he maintained a grasp upon my nose to which ever and anon he
gave a considerable tweak while another little less dreadful stood
at his side armed with some singular weapon shaped much like a common
fire-bellows the nozle of which he held at but a little distance from
my own there were four others of them each of whom had me by a leg or
arm pulling and slapping with much zeal and as i supposed preparing
me for a gridiron while divers others flitted about as i mentioned
before talking with voices that appeared to me louder than thunder

such were the observations which i made vaguely and confusedly for
there was a great stupor over most of my senses and which led me
to suspect i was in the place of torment in which suspicion i was
confirmed by a thousand pangs i felt all over my body so strange
racking and horrible that unless one were to have the toothache
gout earache gravel rheumatism headache a stumped toe and locked
jaw all together it would be impossible to form any just conception of
the nature and variety of my torments i had i verily believed the
paddle-wheel of a steamboat in my head which was revolving full thirty
times a minute with a hideous crashing and clamour and churning
my brains to atoms and by the same rule i conceived there was an
iron-foundry in my lungs and heart every cell and cavity of which was
full of hot castings

but it would require a greater space than the subject is worthy of to
describe the agonies i endured in those moments of torture and they
were perhaps the more poignant since i could neither move a muscle
nor vent my distresses in a single cry which i was the more inclined
to do from conceiving myself in the kingdom of darkness

when i opened my eyes i heard him who had me by the nose yell out
something to the others upon which there was a great stir and outcry
among them and i distinctly heard one say after a great oath we'll
do well enough without a doctor

what said i to myself have they doctors here too do they follow
their patients

but continued the same voice we'll never finish the job till we
roll him over a barrel he'll never show game till the water's out of
him

these words it may be supposed were sufficient to give my mind the
right cue and relieve me of all apprehensions in relation to death
and condemnation on the contrary they confirmed me the more strongly
in my conceit how there should be water in me i knew not but my idea
was the inhuman imps wished to roll it out of me only to make me burn
the better fortunately for me another voice made answer and opposed
the atrocious proposal

no rolling on barrels it said nor hanging up by the
heels hanging up by the heels thought i it is against the rules
of the humane society and here they are

the humane society thought i is there a humane society among the
devils

the rule is the second voice went on as soon as the body shows
signs of life snaps its eyes and breathes to pour a little brandy
and water down

brandy and water said the first voice evidently in a passion and
i wonder if that a'n't against the rules of the temperance society
better give the man so much burning brimstone

the temperance society thought i i might have brought myself to
believe they had a temperance society as well as a humane one in
the lower regions had it not been for the violent ardour of him who
pronounced its name i knew by his rage and fury he could belong to
no temperance society but in the united states of america and the
inference was therefore plain that instead of being in the other
world i was in the united states of america myself

but before i could infer myself into this happy belief i was confused
by a hot argument that grew up between the advocates of the two
societies who waxed quarrelsome until there was a sudden cry the
doctor has come which pacified them in a moment and satisfied me i
was neither dead nor buried

the doctor stalked up to me i thought i knew his features and voice
but my sight and hearing were still confused i have no doubt he
treated me secundum artem but in about five minutes i was as dead as
ever




chapter ii


a conversation betwixt the author and his bosom friend john tickle
esq


however it was not my fate to die in good earnest by-and-by i opened
my eyes feeling in very passable health though somewhat weak and
dejected

the devils or my late attendants whoever they were had all vanished
and with them noise darkness and the various ill odours that had
afflicted my nostrils i was lying in a very good bed and chamber with
curtained windows the curtains being closed to keep out the sunshine
that was playing on them and at my side there sat in an arm-chair a
young gentleman of a buckish appearance sound asleep the creaking
of the bed as i rose on my elbow roused him he started rubbed his
eyes and looking me in the face burst into a hearty laugh

bravo he cried i told old boneset so i could watch as comfortably
as ever a child's nurse of messina i thought i should have the child
wake me with crying i vow to gad i've been snoozing all night and so
you've opened your peepers like an honest man at last dawky pray
what the devil made you drown yourself

and here the young gentleman seizing me by the hand fell a laughing
again and that with more zest than before

sah said i looking at him with both surprise and confusion for
though his voice and face seemed familiar to me i could not for the
life of me say who he was sa ah really i ah  and here i stopped
for first i knew not what to say and secondly my bewildered looks
set him into such a roar of merriment that there was no saying a word
to him

come you dog said he with a grin here and a roar there don't be
comical just after coming out of the grave a man just fished out of a
river and rescued from death after a hard fight between the doctor and
the devil should be serious and ecclesiastical solemn of visage and
sanctified of conversation no joking you dog but get up absalomize
and talk no joking i say no joking with jack tickle

as he spoke he seized me by the shoulder and dragged me half out of
bed

ged and demmee said i remember my foot for my toe catching in
the bed-cord i suddenly recollected the gouty member

i will said he with another roar for the lord knows tis the
best part of you spoil dawky's foot and ruin him with women and
shoe-makers for ever the one ceases to adore and the other trusts no
longer

but i mean the gout said i

the fiddlestick and fiddle said he whoever heard of a poor dandy
living on tick having the gout up dawky my dog and tell me what
set you to drowning if twas about betty small twas a small matter
what drown for being jilted if twas about the tailor's bill twas
still more ridiculous i say dawky my fellow what made you drown
yourself

drown myself said i but i said it with a stare the odd behaviour
and expressions of the young gentleman who called himself jack tickle
a name that i never remembered to have heard before in my life
although his countenance was certainly highly familiar and certain
queer associations his appearance gave birth to the singularity of
my feelings and more than all the appearance of my foot and leg
the former of which instead of being tumid and red with gout was
white and of elegant shape while the latter which but the day before
had a calf to compare with any old quaker's in arch-street was now
as lank as a sword-blade i say these circumstances had the effect
to increase my confusion to that degree that i felt like one who is
asleep and knows it provided one ever did or can feel so

in the midst of all i suddenly cast my eyes upon a goodly large
looking-glass that hung against the wall and saw my reflection
therein it was the image of mr i dulmer dawkins his exact
representation perfect in beard and visage save that the former was
in great disorder and the latter somewhat white and equally perfect
in figure as far as i could compare a man in buff and linen to one in
the full panoply of the tailor

my ged said i i am transformed again

and with that i made a hop up to the glass to look at myself closer
there was no mistaking the matter even if the looking-glass had i
looked at my legs and i gave a tweak at my mustaches my shoulders
were elegantly narrow and my foot as sound as a savage's i jumped up
cut a pigeon-wing and then descending attempted a ballet-dancer's
pirouette after which i looked again into the glass i was a young man
of twenty-five and the most elegant fellow i ever laid eyes on

i ran to jack and hugged him round the neck crying lard jack you
rogue i'm the most comical creature that ever lived

ay said he smothering with laughter and my embraces together but
what made you drown yourself

i recollected all about it and suddenly felt astonished i remembered
how i had jumped into the water and how i had fished myself out as
dead as a poker that is how mr higginson had fished me or rather
how i had fished mr dawkins i remembered how i john hazlewood
higginson had wished to be mr i dulmer dawkins and now i was mr i
dulmer dawkins himself and nobody but he i sat down on the bedside
marvelling how such a thing could be and the wonder of it was indeed
amazing that my spirit should creep into a man's body though strange
enough was not so prodigiously surprising but that my spirit and
body together for i did not know it had been otherwise disposed of
especially so corpulent a one as john h higginson's should get into
one that was truly marvellous

but my study was brought to an end by tickle suddenly exclaiming with
a voice of concern curse him gad poor fellow i believe he has
washed his wits out he has gone mad

no more than you have said i shaking him by the hand but you must
allow it is a most extraordinary affair

pon honour yes said he laughing as hard as ever but what made
you throw yourself into the river

why said i in a hurry to save dawkins

to save dawkins said he looking at me as one would look at a
shoemaker who brings a pair of shoes home the day he has promised them

that is said i to save higginson

to save higginson he cried with such a roar of laughter as made
my teeth rattle why there were twenty people saw higginson drag you
out i say dawky no lillibullering what did you jump into the river
for

i jumped said i quite in a quandary after my hat

at this answer my friend jack tickle threw himself upon the bed where
he rolled over and over until his coat was covered with down and
feathers which cooled his transports a little

i see said he i see it was the last of the family for hatters
tick was exhausted right dawky in such straits of credit i think i
should have jumped after mine who would not fight roast or drown
for his hat when it was the last decent one he ever expected to
have on his head i am glad this was the cause it makes me think
better of you i thought like the rest it was on account of your
disappointment from the adorable betty 

the devil take betty said i but without well knowing why

he has cried jack uproariously at least a poor devil has
she has thrown away her seventy thousand upon a fellow no more to be
compared with you than a tame goose with a wild one and instead of
spending it like a man the rascal will buy stocks and save it i
say dawky you must have been surprised at her conduct as we all
were really we thought you had her and there was no one more
certain than the fair miss smith

the devil take the fair miss smith said i

he will said tickle shaking his head and laughing or if he
don't i don't know who will for it is a clear matter dad's done up
entirely and they say the sheriff is already making an inventory of
his chattels a great pity dawky for if she had but money miss
smith would be certainly an angel incarnate a nymph a houri the
finest woman in town i say dawky i think she almost had you




chapter iii


in which sheppard lee is prepared for the brilliant destiny that awaits
him


there were many things in the conversation of my friend tickle which i
did not exactly comprehend though i had a vague confused appreciation
of all and afterward understood him well enough the fact is i was
in the same difficulty which had beset me when scarce warm in the body
of mr higginson that is a confusion of characters propensities
and associations only that the last were imperfect as if my memory
had suddenly given way and besides the difficulty was in both cases
increased by the feeling of amazement with which for several hours
when properly conscious of it i pondered over the marvel of my
transformation how such a thing could happen or had happened i knew
no more than the man in the moon it was a new thing in the history of
man and there was nothing in philosophy at least such philosophy as
i had at that time to explain it i had certainly done nothing on my
part in either case to effect a change save merely wishing it and
it seemed to me that i possessed a power never before known to a human
being of transferring my spirit from body to body whenever i willed
at least under certain circumstances but on this subject i will have
more to say hereafter

happen how and by what means it might it was certain a transfer had
taken place and that i was no longer the poor miserable john h
higginson with the gout and a scolding wife the conception and full
consciousness of which were so rapturous that i suddenly bounded on
my feet and danced about like a madman now running to the glass to
admire my youthful and elegant appearance and now flinging my arms
round the neck of my friend and hugging him twenty times over

the conversation that passed between us was exceedingly joyous and
varied though as i said before i had but an imperfect understanding
of many things tickle said for which reason i will record no more of
his expressions lest they should confuse the reader's mind as they
did mine some things however i gathered from him in relation to my
catastrophe and resuscitation which are proper to be told

it seems that when i that is john h higginson wished i were or
might be the defunct dulmer dawkins i fell down under a sudden
stroke of apoplexy which was supposed to be caused by my exertions
to rescue the unfortunate beau and indeed i saw in the first
newspaper i looked into upon getting to philadelphia afterward a
long account of my demise with a highly eulogistic and affecting
account of my heroism in sacrificing my life for another's for as
the paragraph stated i was of a full and plethoric habit strongly
inclined to apoplexy of which i was aware myself as well as of the
danger of over exertion and therefore my act was the more truly
heroic the paper was of a highly democratic character and the notice
was closed by a ferocious warning to the young bug of aristocracy
meaning the elegant and fashionable i dulmer dawkins to remember
when wasting his trivial existence in that heartless society whose
pleasures were obtained at the expense of their worthier though poorer
fellow-creatures that the preservation of it had cost the nation one
of its most excellent citizens and the world a virtuous man and pure
patriot by which i understood that john h higginson was of the
democratic party although that was a circumstance of which the gout
and my wife had kept me ignorant as long as i lived in his body

as for me that is i d dawkins being lugged into the tavern along
with my late tenement the body of john h higginson i was fallen
foul of by all hands and what with tweaking my nose beating my arms
scorching my legs with hot bricks flaying me with salt whiskey
spirits and such things and filling my lungs with dust and ashes
from an old fire-bellows i was brought to life again greatly to
the triumph of my tormentors before the appearance of a physician
who however subsequently assured me they had revived me with such
effect as to give him double trouble to keep me in the land of the
living afterward for it seems after being more dead than alive all
that night i had remained in a kind of stupor all the following day
from which i awoke on the second morning well enough as the doctor
prognosticated i would be but only after i had remained more than
thirty-six hours in a state of insensibility

as for my body that is higginson's it had the honour after being
cogitated over by the coroner of riding home in my splendid barouche
with the thousand-dollar hourses but whether my wife went with it or
not i never cared to inquire it was enough she was gone and oh
rapture of raptures gone for ever

my friend tickle illuminated me as to other matters especially in
relation to the fair miss smith with whom it seems and i recollected
all about it when he had set my new associations properly to work i
had been quite particular until he himself discovered the insolvency
of her father's estate when and this i began to recollect in the same
manner i instantly turned my attentions upon another the fair miss
small who jilted me these things i say i soon began to recall to
mind as well as many other incidents in the past life of i dulmer
dawkins and indeed in the course of a few days i was as much at
home in his body and among his affairs as he had ever been himself
but of this anon i learned that mr periwinkle smith after seeing
me lodged in the tavern had driven off to town to engage medical
assistance and this he did so effectually that i had no less than
seven doctors at one time to send me their bills which was a very
foolish thing of them

of these things i say i discoursed with my friend jack tickle
whose conversation together with the happy consciousness i had of my
transformation infused inexpressible vivacity into my spirits i was
marvellously pleased at the idea of being a fine young fellow with the
freedom of chip-chop society and i was impatient to return to the city
to enjoy my happiness

bravo said jack we'll walk in together but do you know dawky he
went on nodding and winking that this is a cursed no-credit place
and that the man below betrayed a certain vulgar anxiety about scot and
lot and the extra expenses you had put him to what do you say about
paying

really said i clapping my hands into my pockets i have forgotten
my pocketbook

to be sure you have said tickle laughing but why need you tell me
so i am no shop-keeper

i mean said i in alarm demmee that i have lost it and with that
hundred-dollar bill my brother tim 

your brother tim said tickle who's he

i was struck all aback i remembered that i was i d dawkins

tickle perceived my confusion and enjoyed it attributing it to
another cause

right said he grinning with delight but don't make any pretence
with me i didn't expect you to have any money and the lord be
thanked i have i'll square your account my dear fellow and help you
to a pigeon besides

with these words and many others not needful to be mentioned he
led the way down stairs where he became astonishingly grave and
dignified a peculiarity i found myself falling into slapped his ratan
against his legs called for his friend dawkins's bill and paid
it that is i suppose he did for i stalked out upon the porch as if
i considered such vulgar matters beneath my notice

here being soon joined by tickle and the day proving uncommonly fine
we set out on foot towards the city and i was conducted by my friend
to the door of my own lodgings




chapter iv


in which sheppard lee has an interview with a lady who tells him a
secret


in and mount said tickle i see jem puddle in the street yonder
and i have an idea i can borrow fifty dollars of him i will drop round
on you by-and-by

so saying tickle started off and left me at the door of my lodgings
i had a sort of confused recollection of the place though i had never
seen it before in my life the dingy bricks and weather-stained
marble the rickety old iron railing on the steps and the ugly
worn-out brass plate with the j sniggles engraved thereon rose on
my memory like old acquaintances who had grown out of it the house
might have been a fashionable one in its day nay for the matter of
that it was not so humble in appearance but that a gentleman might
have lived in it if too poor to inhabit a better and though out of
the world being in a street called eighth it was within hail of
chestnut nevertheless it was but a poor place compared with my late
dwelling my house in chestnut the recollection of which together
with the reflection that i entered this only as a lodger somewhat
abated the transport of my joy ah thought i what a pity in giving
up john h higginson's gout and wife i had also to give up his house
and money but the recollection of the two first-named possessions was
fresh upon me and i ceased to murmur

i ascended the steps and rang the bell somewhat faintly i must
acknowledge for though i had my friend tickle's assurance and a
confused consciousness of my own that i was at the right place there
was a certain strangeness in it naturally arising from my situation
that made me hesitate the door however opened and the reception
that followed convinced me i was not intruding where i was not known

the door was opened by a bouncing irish wench of some twenty-five
years or thereabouts with hair as yellow as a broom-whisk and
shoulders twice as broad as my own besides which she was not
handsome she had staring gray eyes brick-coloured cheeks a nose that
looked up at her forehead and a mouth not so ugly as spacious

i was about to pass by this fair apparition with no further notice than
a nod which i made somewhat instinctively but i was not fated to get
off so easily no sooner did she lay eyes upon me than she set up a
squeak oh hubbuboo and is it you misther dawkins dear and
threw her great beef-steak arms round my neck

an embrace from a creature of her attractions i could have easily
dispensed with yet i might have been affected by her joy at seeing
me return alive from the bottom of the river it was so truly natural
and exuberant had she not been in a great hurry to qualify it oh
murder dear she cried and i'm glad for they said bad luck
till'em the vagabones you was drownded dear and was after chating
me out iv my money for the washin and mindin

the washing and mending thought i do i patronise such a tasty body
as this and do i owe her money

but while i muttered thus within the girl giving me another hug that
i thought would have made my shoulders change place with one another
roared out in continuation 

och throth but the man must drown dape that chates nora magee of her
own musha hinny darlint jist pit yer finger into yer pocket and pull
me out the tin dollars and seventy cents that you owe me

certainly nora said i and succuba let me go but ged now nora
i cried for well i knew my pockets were as empty as the promises i
intended to make her and i was driven by a sort of instinct upon the
proper course for pacifying the harpy a course i suppose that
i that is my prototype the true dawkins had often practised
before i say nora don't talk of dollars and cents for i intend to
pay you in eagles and half-eagles some of these days when my uncle
comes and besides nora you jade you i intend to give you a buss
into the bargain as ged i believe i will now

and with that i returned the compliment she had paid me took the great
creature by the neck and yea faith and i presume i should have done
the same thing with my tailor if he could have been managed the same
way absolutely kissed her

och blessings on yer pritty face said she looking pleased and
disappointed together but wiping her mouth as if to prepare for a
second salute and that's the way you bamboozles me wid your uncles
and your thricks upon a poor cratur's modesty but oh misther
dawkins dear ye'r lookin sick and pokey and so i'll not be after
throubling you and i hopes your uncle will be soon in phillydelphy
for there's our ould sniggles the hungry ould nagur that i should be
saying so of the master o the house that gives me a dollar a week
and a new bonnet at christmas he's been rampin and roarin and
swearin like a turk my heavy hathred on him he'll be havin you up
before the constables and squires for the dirty rint-money the ould
divil that you owe him

the rent-money thought i and i began to have a sort of feeling
about me i do not know what but it was not agreeable i clapped my
hand into my pocket there was a pocketbook there but i had examined
it before and there was nothing in it my mind began to misgive me a
little it was apparent the worthy i d dawkins had not yielded me his
body without leaving me some of his debts to pay and as to what means
of discharging them he might have bequeathed i was yet in the dark

i ascended to my rooms of which i discovered i had a brace but i was
in some dudgeon to find them in the third story very odd said i to
myself that i should be a fashionable man and a dandy and live in a
third story my instincts had gone nigh as i climbed the stairs to
carry me into a chamber on the first floor but arrah now hinny
said nora you'd be after forgetting you agreed to give up the best
chambers till yer uncle comes to town bad luck to him for keeping me
so long out iv my tin dollars

this uncle of mine thought i will settle all pothers but who he
was or what sort of claim i had upon him i knew no more than the man
in the moon my associations acted but slowly and imperfectly and when
i strove to look back upon the past history of my new body i felt
like a man who has clapped upon his nose his grandmother's spectacles
through which he can behold objects indeed but all so confused
distorted and mystified that they serve only to bewilder his vision
thus i beheld when i made the effort a jumble of events and persons
crowded together on my memory but without being able to seize upon any
one and examine it to my satisfaction i had an uncle it seemed but i
could not recall any thing like a recollection of having ever seen him
but time thought i will set these things right




chapter v


an inventory of a young gentleman's effects with some account of mr
sniggles his landlord


my chambers were but meanly furnished and this but it needs not i
should acquaint the reader with the divers proofs that rose every
moment to convince me mr i d dawkins though a dandy was not a rich
one before i had rummaged an hour among his chattels i discovered
enough to set me into a cold shiver and almost make me repent having
taken possession of his body i found lying upon his table no less
than thirty-seven folded papers the tribute doubtless of the two days
of his absence of which eight were either billetsdoux or mere cards
of invitation to ladies parties and twenty-nine were letters from
tailors shoemakers c all of them requesting payment of money owed
and most of them as ferocious in spirit as they were original in style
and grammar in an old trunk which i ransacked as well as every chest
of drawers and closet in the rooms the keys were ready at hand in my
pocket i discovered a bushel or two of bills i suppose there may
have been a thousand of them for they were of all dates not one of
which had a receipt to it

but to make amends for this evil i found mr i d dawkins's wardrobe
in pretty good condition except in the article of shirts of which i
discovered but six and those none of the best however there were
three dozen good dickeys and a great abundance of loose collars
and wristbands with which i perceived i might do without shirts
altogether

but what gave me most pleasure and indeed quite consoled me under the
feelings of disappointment and doubt that had begun to rise was a
marvellous great quantity of love-letters locks of hair finger-rings
odd gloves c that i found scattered about each as was apparent
the tribute or spoil of some admiring fair aha said i i am a
devil of a fellow among the girls who can resist me the idea of
being a favourite among the women and the prospect i had of shooting
conquests among them right and left were infinitely agreeable ged
and demmee said i i will look about me now and fix for life i will
pick out the finest creature i can find who has a fortune and marry
her and then i say demm all tailors and other people i will marry a
wife eged

it was doubly remarkable i should make such a resolution having had
but lately such a lesson of the joys of matrimony but i found myself
fast growing another man i still retained a lively recollection of
mrs higginson but fancy pictured an angel in the anticipated mrs
dawkins dim visions which seemed to be made up as much of crude
recollections as of half-formed anticipations dim visions of lovely
eyes and noses floated over my brain i sank into a soft elysium-like
revery when i suddenly heard a voice somewhat tremulous and feeble
but rude as the screech of a strawberry-woman in spring saying

sir i say sir mr dawkins i shall trouble you i say for the
amount of that ere small account

the accents were more horrible to my soul than the grating of a
dentist's file upon the tenderest of grinders i looked up from my
feet which i had been admiring and beheld a visage somewhat iracund
and savage but so vulgar and plebeian in all its lineaments that my
fear was changed into contempt

and i say sare whoever you ah said i looking the fellow to the
soul what do you want he-ah who ah you

at these questions the man looked petrified he opened his mouth till
i thought his under jaw would drop off and stared at me in dumb
amazement i had some hopes he was about to fall down in a fit i am
not naturally of a bloodthirsty turn but i knew he was a dun and such
persons one always wishes the devil would snatch up but he recovered
his tongue and to do him justice i must confess he used it with a
spirit i did not look for in such a mean shrivelled-up body as he had

don't go for to insult me said the goth gritting his teeth and
spluttering his words through them as through a watering-pot i'll let
you know who i am i'll have my money or i'll have the worth on it out
on you for i won't be cheated no more for nothing and as for what i'm
doing here i'll let you know as how i'm master in my own house and
as mrs sniggles says 

sniggles said i recollecting that the rascal was my landlord and
creditor i started up and seizing the enraged little man by the hand
i begged his pardon

really my dear soul said i i was in a brown study and i didn't
know you pray how d'ye do how is mrs sniggles you must know i have
hardly yet got over my unfortunate fall into the water really sah i
was almost drowned and i had the misfortune to lose my pocketbook

none on your gammon on me said mr sniggles looking as intrepid as
ever for i don't believe none on it and i don't believe you're no
gentleman neither or you wouldn't keep me out of my money you see
mr dawkins do you see you've had my rooms five months and i ha'n't
seen the colour on your money over once it's all promise and no pay
and so as i was saying i won't be diddled no longer or i'll see the
end of it for as mrs sniggles says we can't afford to be diddled
for nothing

come sniggles said i don't be in a passion i'll pay you what's
the amount

seventeen weeks on the second story seven dollars a week monstrous
cheap at that considerin there's breakfast in one hundred and
nineteen dollars and taking off the ten dollars you paid me as per
account one hundred and nine dollars four weeks on the third story
at five dollars and a half and good rooms too twenty-two dollars
and adding the ten dollars i paid the shoe-maker and the five dollars
sixty cents i loaned you to pay the fine at the mayor's office for
smashing the lamp makes jest a hundred and forty-one dollars sixty
cents no halves nor quarters precise and the sooner you shows me the
money the better

a confounded long bill that sniggles said i but i don't dispute
it and the moment my uncle comes to town 

the mean avaricious fellow had begun to look happy as he conned over
the hateful particulars of his account which he held in his hand but
no sooner had the words my uncle left my lips than he began to jump
up and down pulling his hair gritting his teeth and shaking his
fists like a mad-man and to my astonishment the contemptible fellow
waxed profane and actually cursed me and my uncle too his oaths
as may be supposed only made him appear more low-lived and vulgar
than before for cursing and swearing are the hardest things to do
genteelly that i know there are but few persons in the world who
can produce an oath with any thing like elegance it is the truest
criterion of gentility and in consequence i would recommend no person
to attempt one who is not confident of his high breeding

my landlord mr sniggles fell to cursing and swearing and insulted
me very grossly first by affecting to believe that no such person
as my uncle existed secondly by threatening to turn me out of his
house and thirdly by assuring me he would have his account in an
attorney's hands before i was an hour older it was in vain i exhorted
him to moderate his passion and strove to wheedle him into a better
humour i had forgotten or rather i did not yet know the true secret
of his character which was cowardice by addressing my arguments to
which i might have readily brought him to reason but in truth i was
frightened myself how i was to pay a bill of a hundred and forty-one
dollars sixty cents was a thing only to be guessed at and the prospect
of taking up my lodgings in the debtors apartments up arch-street was
as vinegar and wormwood to my imagination

the more i strove to sooth the wrath of mr sniggles the more
ferocious he became until at last he did nothing but dance round and
round me like a little dog barking at a big one that is tied to a
post crying out all the time frantic with despair and fury pay me
what you owe me pay this here bill here pay me my money or i'll have
you in jail with other expressions equally foolish and insulting




chapter vi


sheppard lee hears news of his uncle and mr sniggles is brought to
his senses


in the midst of my troubles up comes my friend tickle and pops into
the room he gave a stare at sniggles and next a grin and then just
as i was looking to be laughed at he made a spring and caught me round
the neck crying with uncommon exultation and eagerness 

i congratulate you dawkins you dog and mind you must lend me five
hundred dollars tomorrow

before i could answer a word to this surprising address he turned upon
sniggles and looking black as a thunder-cloud cried 

hah sniggles what is the fellow doing here dunning you for his
money the scoundrel hah what

i thought he would have kicked the poor man out of the room and so
thought sniggles also for though he exclaimed touch me if you dare
he ran to the door where he looked vastly alarmed and was able to
muster only a single expression of resolution i asks my money said
he and dang me but i'll have it for as mrs sniggles says i'll not
be diddled for nothing

pay the rascal his dirty money and then be done with him leave his
house and patronise him no more said jack then turning to me he
made three skips into the air clapped his hands and running up to me
and giving me a second embrace cried 

angels horses and women hug me kiss me and lend me that five
hundred dollars your uncle has arrived

uncle what uncle said i

why your uncle wiggins your rich old uncle your dad of an
uncle your bank and banker your but i say dawky you'll lend
me that five hundred won't you saw him at the hotel just
arrived asked anxiously for his nephew dawkins bad look about the
eyes will die in a month and then then my fellow fourteen
thousand a year if it's fourteen hundred

fourteen thousand a year echoed i the words were also muttered over
by sniggles i caught the fellow's eye he looked confounded and uneasy

if that's so said he then i hope mr dawkins will pay me my money
and not take no offence for none wasn't intended

pay you your money said jack tickle stepping up to him in a rage
no you rapacious dun he sha'n't pay you a cent you shall sue him
and get judgment and wait six months for your money

no you rascallion said i i won't take that revenge of such a low
fellow i'll pay you your money and be done with you but jack i
say demmee let's be off let's run down to my uncle wiggins

wiggins said my landlord why you always said his name was
wilkins

and so it is said tickle wiggins p wilkins the rich and
well-known wiggins p wilkins but what do you want here have you had
your answer what do you mean by intruding here you'll get your money
and so if you please do mr dawkins and me the favour to walk down
stairs or 

well said my amiable creditor whose fury was quite overcome by
tickle's violence and his report of my uncle's arrival i always
said mr dawkins was a gentleman and would pay me one day or another
and one day's just as good as another and so i hopes he'll take no
offence but as for you and the likes of you mr tickle said the
little man endeavouring to assume courage i don't like to be abused
in my own house but howsomever as you're mr dawkins's friend i'll
say no more about it

and with that my gentleman walked down stairs

let us go said i let us run let us fly

where said tickle

why to my uncle where is he

where cried tickle bursting into a roar of laughter are you as
big a fool as sniggles you didn't believe me ah lud is there nobody
witty but myself

and my uncle a'n't come then said i what made you say so

to rid you of a dun my fellow said jack i saw the rascal had
worked himself into a phrensy and that you were at your wit's end
i had pity on your distresses and so ran in with a huge lie as
irresistible as a broadsword to the rescue victory and jo pæan i
have routed the enemy and you are no longer in fear keep up the fire
and you are easy for a week

but my uncle really intends to leave me that fourteen thousand a
year said i

has he got it said jack giving me a comical stare

jack said i after pausing a little i want to ask you a favour

have but twenty-five in the world said tickle pulling out his
pocketbook but you shall have ten

it isn't that said i i want you to tell me my history

your history said tickle staring at me in surprise




chapter vii


in which sheppard lee is told his history


an idea had suddenly seized me and i must say that up to this time
it was the most brilliant one that ever entered my mind my ignorance
of mr i d dawkins's affairs was still highly inconvenient and
oppressive and i was determined with my friend's assistance to
remove it

tickle said i i really believe the doctor has only half
resuscitated me my body is pretty well but my mind is only so-so
would you believe it my memory is quite gone

as to your debts certainly said jack so is mine

ged said i tis gone altogether really it seems to me as if i
had only begun existence this morning my recollection of all events
and even persons known anterior to my sop in the river is so
imperfect you can't conceive would you believe it i really didn't
know that rogue sniggles and had to ask him his name the ladies
too jack miss smith miss small and the rest that you were talking
about who the deuse are they i have heard much talk of my uncle too
have i an uncle and if so who and what is he for i swear pon
honour jack i know no more than the man in the moon in a word jack
demmee i am in my second childhood and you must help me out of it
give me therefore my history my whole history and tell me all about
me for may i be dunned to death if i rightly know who i am

you don't said jack well that's funny but i have heard of such
things before is a dip in cold water then so hard on the memory
i say dawky my fellow couldn't we contrive some way to dip our
creditors but eged now dawky you a'n't serious

i am said i and i beg you'll give me an idea who i am and all
other things appertaining

oh said tickle who seemed vastly diverted by my embarrassment
that is soon done you are a dandy of pure blood and poor as a church
mouse but not yet out of favour your father who was a dandy before
you and in prime esteem having bought his way into notice with two or
three cargoes of indigo and young hyson for he was an india merchant
properly laid out in elegant entertainments gave up trade to live a
gentleman and died one leaving you an elegant fellow and ignoramus
as a gentleman's son should be to spend his leavings this you have
done dawky and most gloriously for five years none of us the sons
of nabobocracy could compare with you in dash flash and splash but
even phaeton fell horses galloped away buggies and curricles rolled
into the gutter and tailors looked alarmed stocks flew out at the
window bricks and mortar took to themselves wings and your stockings
began to want darning then said dawkins i will marry a wife and
he looked loving at periwinkle's fair daughter and periwinkle's fair
daughter looked loving at dawkins and dawkins calling counsel of his
friend john tickle of ticklesbury manor beheld and lo periwinkle's
fair daughter's father's fine estate was fenced round with rows
of mortgages as thick and thorny as prickly-pears whereupon the
inconstant swain forgetting his vows ran to the elegant miss small
who smiled on him and married another and the loss of this adorable
fair fortune and all together with an uncommon fit of dunning
so affected my friend's spirits that he threw himself into the
schuylkill whence he was fished by a fellow called what-d-ye-call-it
a brewer

well said i but do you mean to say i have squandered all my
property

every sous said my friend it is just six weeks since you spent the
last dollar of the last term of your annuity

what annuity said i

why the five years annuity you bought of old goldfist is it
possible you don't recollect him don't you remember the row of
negro-houses you owned down in southwark

i don't said i

a piece of arrant cheating sheer swindling said tickle but
when did old skinner ever make an honest bargain the houses and
lot of ground worth two thousand as they stood but title good and
indefeisible and capable of being made worth twenty thousand i
remember you offered em to old goldfist for seven what said the old
hunks give me immediate possession and thereupon you shall have a
bonus of a thousand on the nail together with the same sum yearly
for five years provided you live so long if not then as long as
you live snapped like a gudgeon and was bit and on the fifth
year beginning of august last had the last integer of payment with
comfort of seeing a property you had sold for six thousand yielding
its possessor just that much a year

the geds said i has old goldfist six thousand a year

say sixty replied jack

tickle said i the old curmudgeon has a daughter i'll marry her

no you won't said my friend shaking his head mournfully old
goldfist is too well acquainted with your affairs and unless you have
his consent what will you get by her

tickle said i i must marry somebody or be ruined but stay
there's my uncle now my dear fellow who is he

faith said tickle i don't know always supposed he belonged to the
apocrypha and was used to argue duns into good manners nobody sues
a young fellow that has good expectations from a rich uncle but now
i think of it i believe you did once tell me you had an uncle some
vagabond trading fellow or other in the west but i never heard you
say you expected any thing of him i thought you called him wiggins
but sniggles says wilkins all's one however for i remember you said
he had brats of his own

i began to feel uncomfortable and upon questioning my friend further
i discovered that my situation was far from being agreeable i had a
horrible quantity of debts on my shoulders and no fund to discharge
them and what was worse i found that my means of subsistence were
not only precarious but i had good reason to fear they were any
thing but reputable my dear friend john tickle though a gentleman
and dandy it was plain was a personage who lived by his wits and
i began to see that mr i d dawkins was another from tickle's
expressions i perceived that our chief dependance lay in the noble
trade of pigeon-hunting as this is a word some of my readers may be
too unsophisticated to understand i will explain it and in very few
words as there are in the world young fellows of plebeian origin
but full pockets who are ambitious to figure in elegant society so
there are also in elegant society sundry youths of better fame than
fortune who are willing to patronise them provided any thing can
be made by their condescension in which case the happy phaeton is
taught to spend his money in ways most advantageous to his patrons
though by no means to his own profit such a young gentleman is then
called a pigeon and is allowed to flutter in the sunbeams while his
eagle-clawed friends are helping themselves to his feathers the last
of which being abstracted he is commonly called a fine fellow and
kicked out of their company i cannot pretend to say what degree of
relish my prototype the true i d dawkins may have had for such
a mode of existence but i must aver in my own defence that i had
throughout the whole adventure while in his body so much of sheppard
lee's original sense of honour and honesty hanging about me that i was
more than once shocked at the meanness and depravity of such a course
of life and when i first understood the thing from tickle i was so
ashamed of myself that had i lighted upon the body of any decent man
at the moment i do verily believe i should have done my best to get
into it and so put an end to mr i d dawkins altogether but men's
bodies are not like the dry-goods dealers boxes in market-street to
be stumbled into at any moment

it was some comfort to me to find that our practice in this particular
was so little known that both tickle and myself but myself more
especially were considered in the main very excellent exemplary
young men as far as dandies could be and were still allowed to mingle
in elegant society

as for tickle indeed i soon discovered he was in but doubtful odour
with the ladies at least with their mammas for he had been for
some years living on his wits but i on the contrary being pretty
universally regarded as the heir-expectant of a rich uncle and being
besides a prettier fellow was received with general favour and
approbation

having obtained from tickle as much of my or mr i d dawkins's
history as was necessary i gave my worthy friend to understand i
should need his advice and assistance in returning into society for
said i and very truly too i really sha'n't know anybody and shall
feel very awkward here i added are two invitations for this very
evening one from mrs pickup and the other from the misses oldstyle
now who is mrs pickup and who are the oldstyles and where the
mischief do they live

it is very odd you should forget so much said tickle and then
proceeded to give me the information i wanted promising also to go
with me to both places himself and prompt me through all difficulties




chapter viii


a conversation with a tailor sheppard lee finds himself in a situation
truly appalling


having thus got upon the subject of the ladies we that is tickle
and myself fell into a highly agreeable conversation in the course
of which i lost sight of all my fears and anxieties until they were
suddenly recalled by the entrance and a very unceremonious one it
was of a tall fellow with hinge knees and crow-bar elbows fashionably
dressed but whom there was no mistaking for aught but a vulgarian i
knew his errand before he spoke and so did tickle who instantly cried
out

snip the tailor eged and another paroxysm of dunning

servant mr dawkins servant mr tickle said the gentleman
giving each of us a scrape hope no intrusion and no offence wouldn't
go to controvert gentlemen on no account but talking of accounts mr
dawkins hope you'll excuse me wouldn't dun a gentleman for the world
but have a cussed note in bank for cloth and must make up the sum by
to-morrow and so if it's convenient mr dawkins shall be obliged
for the amount of bill

my uncle said i 

can't go that no more said the tailor can't go that no more
begging pardon bill outstanding nineteen months and over wouldn't
mind letting it run the year out but for the cussed pressure on the
money-market no money to be had nowhere

right said jack and what makes you suppose you will get it here
now snip my dear fellow make yourself short tis not convenient
just now for my friend dawkins to pay you

must take up that note said mr snip can't think of waiting no
longer

the rascal spoke resolutely though more cowardly-looking than
sniggles but who could withstand the rage and indignation of my friend
tickle

away you ungrateful loon said he is that the way you serve the
man that made you who would have employed you you botch if dawkins
had not taken you up and made you fashionable

ay demmee snip said i taking my cue from tickle i say wasn't i
the making of you and do you come dunning me didn't i recommend you
into notice and business didn't i send my friends to you

can't deny said the tailor won't controvert but must say can't
always get my money of mr dawkins's friends but don't mean no
offence wouldn't think of pressing mr dawkins always said he was my
friend wouldn't mind holding back if mr dawkins would send me good
pay-customers

well said i thinking the man was modest in his desires i will
you shall have three johnny raws before the week is out and you may
charge them double

very much obliged and won't controvert said mr snip humbly but
can't take no more promises

and you really insist upon having your money said tickle

ay said i re-echoing his indignation and putting on a dignity
that even awed myself you are determined to have your money and to
lose your business tickle hand me back that five hundred i lent you
or enough of it to pay the rascallion shall have it again as soon as
i can run down and see my uncle wilkins i say tickle hand me the
money and let me pay the ungrateful rascal off

if i do said jack demmee encourage dunning never

he shall have his money said i here you snip you man you have
broken your own neck come back here to-morrow at half past twelve
with a receipt in full take your money and never look to make a
gentleman's coat again come tickle it is time i was with my uncle
you shall go along and dine with him a fine old cock i assure you

i surveyed the tailor my dignity and the sound of my uncle's name
had subdued him he slipped his bill into his pocket and looked
penitent

won't controvert a gentleman on no occasion he said always said
mr dawkins was my friend and as for mr dawkins's uncle 

yes said jack yes you said you did not believe in any such person
did not believe there was such a person

can't controvert no gentleman said the tailor looking as if he had
been rubbed down with his own goose but never said no such thing
mr tickle always believed in mr dawkins's uncle but only thought
perhaps he wouldn't pay that is wasn't certain and didn't mean no
offence and so if mr dawkins will say a word for me now and then to
gentlemen that wants coats i'll leave it to his convenience hoping
he will excuse my coming up stairs without asking not having found no
servant and not supposing he would take no offence and 

and so the rascallion was going on heaping apology on apology and
about to depart in contrition for his offence when as my evil genius
would have it in popped mr sniggles foaming with wrath and looking
daggers and conflagration

trouble you for the amount of that ere small account said the
fellow don't believe in no more uncles won't be diddled no longer
for nothing all diddle about uncle just as mrs sniggles says no
more uncle than she has

what do you mean said jack tickle but his indignation no longer
daunted the dun who cried out with uncommon emphasis and effect 

had my doubts about the matter and told mrs sniggles said i mr
dawkins's uncle has come says mrs sniggles run down to the tavern
and see for no sitch thing a'n't certain till we knows it and so i
runs down to the mansion house and mr wilkins wasn't there and then
i runs to the united states hoping it was a mistake and mr wilkins
wasn't there and then i runs to this place and that place and mr
wilkins wasn't there and as mrs sniggles said mr wilkins wasn't
nowhere but twas all diddle and throwing dust in my eyes and so as
for this here account one hundred and forty-one dollars sixty 

don't controvert no one said mr snip who had listened all agape to
the outpourings of the other and now turned his battery upon me again
but can't think of keeping the account open no longer don't want to
be hard upon any gentleman but must have my money

one hundred and forty-one dollars sixty cents said sniggles

two hundred and thirty-seven said snip

but why should i detail the particulars of that eventful hour even
tickle's courage sank before the fire of the enraged assailants and
as for mine had it been fortified by a heart of steel and ribs of
brass it must have yielded to the horrors that followed duns follow
the same laws as flies and carrion-crows no sooner does one swoop at a
victim than down drop a thousand others to share the feast scarce had
my landlord and the tailor begun the assault when there sneaked into
the room a consumptive-looking fellow smelling strongly of leather and
rosin who displayed a greasy scrap of paper and added his pipe to the
others then came another with inky hands a black spot on his nose
and a new hat under his arm then another and another and another
until i believe there were fourteen different souls in the room or
rather bodies for i don't think they had one soul among them all
of them armed with long bills all clamorous for their money and all
each being encouraged by the example of the others as noisy mad and
ferocious as any mob of free and independent republicans i ever laid
eyes on such a siege of dunning was perhaps never endured except by
a poor dandy they dunned and they dinned they poked out their ugly
bills and they gave loose to their inhuman tongues in a word they
conducted in such a manner that i was more than once inclined to jump
out the window being driven to complete desperation

in the midst of all and when i saw no escape whatever from my
persecutions they were brought to a close by a most unexpected
incident the door flew open and in rushed not a fifteenth tormentor
as i expected but an angel of light in the person of nora magee who
screamed out at the top of her voice 

och hinny darlint your uncle misther wiggins has come and in a
beautiful carriage and he looks as if he could pay your ditts twice
over sure now and ye'll ax him for my tin dollars




chapter ix


the author receives a visit from his uncle samuel wilkins esq and
is relieved from his tormentors


let the reader judge of the effect of such an announcement upon my
tormentors and myself i had an uncle then and he had arrived nay
he had paid me a visit and was in the house i could hear him
stumping up the stairs my debtors were struck dumb and so was i
and at that moment of confusion he stepped into the room i looked at
the gentleman and upon my soul i was somewhat disappointed his
appearance was scarce genteel enough for my uncle he looked like
a country squire of low degree who might pass for a man of quality
better in an unsophisticated village of the backwoods than anywhere
else and he had an atrocious white fur hat with a big brim all
puckered and twisted like the outer casing of a cabbage there was a
vulgar vivacity and good-nature about his visage an air of presumption
and familiarity in his motions and his nose turned up on the whole
i did not like his appearance and my first impulse was to give him a
look of contempt but i recollected he was my uncle and had come in a
carriage and seeing him stand staring about in great astonishment as
not knowing what to make of such a rout of ragamuffins as i had about
me nor how to distinguish his nephew among them i stepped up to him
and taking him by the hand said 

my dear saw ah looking for me what my uncle wiggins

wiggins said he ods bobs don't you know the name of your own
uncle wilkins

wiggins said i ged twas a mere slip of the tongue

ods bobs said he and is this you ikey my boy the very picture
of your aunt poor mrs wilkins but ods bless her she's dead ha'n't
seen you since you was a baby do declare you're as big as sammy
come to live in your town ikey my dear tired of living among the
clodhoppers have plenty of money and mean to be a gentleman now glad
to see you ikey but i say ikey who is all these here people always
heard you was a great gentleman but don't much like your acquaintance
ikey

this was pronounced in an under voice much to my satisfaction for
the liberty the old gentleman took with my name was not grateful to my
feelings ikey indeed none but a vulgarian would have made so free
with me

but he was my uncle he said he was rich and i perceived he might be
made serviceable

i shook him by the hand a dozen times over swore i was so glad to see
him he could not conceive assured him in his ear the fellows he saw
were ambitious cobblers and stitchers who had come to beg my favour
and recommendation to the fashionable circles for my countenance was
a fortune and the rascals would persecute me declared my friend
tickle who stood enjoying the scene from a corner was a young blood
and intimate who had just lent me a thousand dollars to pay a poor
fellow who was in distress and concluded by assuring him that as i
did not like being obliged to a man not a near kinsman i would hand
the sum back again and borrow it of him if he had brought so much to
town with him

the warm welcome with which i began my speech greatly delighted my
uncle's heart as i saw my apology for the appearance of the duns
it was evident caused him to look upon me as a young fellow of great
importance and distinction the reference to the young blood who had
just lent me a thousand dollars confirmed his opinion of my lofty
stand among the rich and fashionable and to all these members of
my discourse he hearkened with respect and satisfaction but when i
arrived at my climax and professed a readiness to borrow that sum of
himself i thought his eyes would drop out of his head they stared out
so far in a word i perceived that let him be as rich as he might
he was not the man to lend me money for which reason i despised the
relationship more than ever and resolved to disown it as soon as my
convenience would permit but it was proper to make it useful at the
present moment

i turned round upon my duns who were yet in confusion gentlemen
said i giving them a bow of dismission i will remember your claims
you may depend upon me but at present as you see i must attend to
those of my excellent uncle you understand me ehem

ehem said they all and i thought they would have all turned
somersets so profound were their congees as one by one they sneaked
out of the room the only ones who hesitated were my landlord nora
magee and snip the tailor the first was probably overcome by a sense
of having dunned me too hard and despair of forgiveness on which
supposition i gave him a frown and waved my hand and he retired as
for nora she perhaps loitered to feast her eyes with the spectacle
of the rich man from whose pockets were to be drawn her ten dollars
but i gave her a wink a very vulgar way of conveying a hint i
confess but one can't be genteel with one's creditors and she rolled
smiling away what kept the tailor i could not say till having given
him divers significant looks and gestures he began to drawl out can't
controvert no gentleman but  when i stepped up to him took him by
the arm and led him from the apartment

what you dog said i in a familiar affectionate sort of way as
soon as i had him out of my uncle's hearing do you want to raise a
hubbub and put the old fellow in a passion come you rogue your
fortune's made seven grown sons seven broadcloth suits a year
extravagant dogs they shall have them all you shall upon my
honour can twist the young apes round my finger and you shall
have'em seven times seven is forty-nine seven fifties is three
thousand and odd ged and demmee you'll make a fortune out of them

with that i pushed the giggling cormorant down stairs and ran back to
my uncle




chapter x


some account of sheppard lee's country kinsmen


adieu said tickle giving me a nod as much as to say make the
most of the old gentleman he then imitated the duns and left me a
circumstance for which i was not sorry for i was somewhat ashamed of
my uncle

fine-looking young fellow that said mr wilkins must be a rich dog
to lend you a thousand dollars but i say ikey 

uncle wiggins that is wilkins said i i beg you won't call me by
any such vulgar nickname as ikey i can't abide nicknames they are
horrid plebeian

ods bobs said my uncle i call my son sammy sammy and sam too 

what said i have you a son

ods bobs said he why didn't you know i say nevvy your dad
and me was never good friends proud as a turkey-cock thought me a
democrat and no great shakes but i snapped up his sister though and
so there was never no love lost between us never knew much about one
another especially him but i say nevvy ods bobs don't be a fool
and despise like your dad could buy him six times over if he was
alive and don't suppose you're much richer and don't value you a new
pin don't pretend you didn't know i had a son might as well say you
didn't know i had a daughter

the old gentleman looked somewhat incensed i hastened to pacify him
by assuring him i had had a violent fit of sickness and lost my memory
i then drew from him without difficulty as much of his history and
affairs as i cared to know

although of a vulgar stock his face had somehow or other captivated
the fancy of my father's sister who very ungenteelly ran off with
him and accompanied him to some interior village of the state where
the happy swain sold tapes and sugar that being his profession
here although discountenanced and despised by his wife's family he
gradually amassed wealth and in course of time mightily increased it
by laying his hands on those four great staples of the susquehanna
iron lumber coal and whiskey in fine having scraped together
enough for his purpose he yielded to a design which his wife had first
put into his plebeian head and which his children as they grew up
took care to stimulate into action this was to exchange his village
for the metropolis his musty warehouses for elegant saloons and live
during the remainder of his life a nabob and gentleman and in this
design as i discovered he expected to derive no little aid from my
humble self who being as he said a gentleman cut and dried and
knowing to all such matters could give him a hint or two about high
life and help his children the hopeful sammy and the interesting
pattie for such were their horrid names into good society the first
step of his design he had already taken having wound up his business
and got him to philadelphia with his brats both of whom were now
safely lodged in a hotel burning to make the acquaintance of their
fashionable cousin my distinguished self and to these worthy kinsfolk
he proposed to carry me forthwith

i debated the matter in my mind should i acknowledge the claims of a
brace of rustics with two such names sammy wilkins pattie wilkins
i felt that an old coat or a patched shoe could not more endanger my
reputation than two cousins named sammy and pattie but the old man
was rich and some good might arise from my condescension i agreed to
go with him and asked him at what hotel he had put up

oh said he at a mighty fine place the what-d-ye-call-it in
market-street

in market-street said i and i thought his nose looked more
democratic than ever horrible vulgar beyond expression how came you
to stop in such a low place can't expect any decent man to go nigh
you must carry you to head's without a moment's delay or you'll be
ruined for ever

ods bobs said my uncle it's a very good tavern with eating
and drinking for a king but if it's not fashionable sha'n't stay
there no longer shall go with us nevvy and show us the way to
what-d-ye-call-it's the hack will just hold four

i go to a tavern in market-street the idea was offensive and ride
thither and afterward my three country kinsfolk with me to head's
in a hackney-coach the market-street tavern and the hackney-coach
finished my uncle wilkins i suddenly recollected a highly important
engagement which would deprive me of the pleasure of going round with
my excellent uncle that moment to make the acquaintance of my worthy
cousins nay i feared it would occupy me all that evening being an
engagement of a very peculiar nature i would see them the next day
when they were safely lodged at head's whither i recommended mr
wilkins to proceed bag and baggage instanter my uncle accepted my
excuses and agreed to follow my advice with a ready docility that
might have pleased me seeing that it showed the respect in which he
held me but i perceived in it nothing more than a willingness to be
put into leading-strings arising from his consciousness of inferiority

i got rid of him and resolved i would consider the pros and cons
before compromising my reputation by any public acknowledgment of
relationship

then being vastly tired by the varied business of the day i threw
myself on my bed where i slept during the remainder of the day very
soundly and agreeably




chapter xi


containing a morsel of metaphysics with a short account of the
author's experience in good society


i was roused about nine o'clock in the evening by tickle who came
according to promise to squire me to mrs pickup's and the misses
oldstyle's and dressing myself in mr dawkin's best i accompanied him
forthwith to the mansion of the former

it was yet summer and the season of gayety was therefore afar off all
genteel people were or were supposed to be out of town according to
the rule which at this season drives the gentry of london to their
country-seats the few of philadelphia who could imitate the lords and
ladies in this particular were now catching agues on the schuylkill
while the mass consisting of those whose revenues did not allow
any rustication on their own lands were killing sand-flies on the
seashore or gnawing tough beef and grumbling over bad butter at some
fashionable watering-place in the interior there were some however
as there always are who considered themselves genteel and who stayed
at home either because they were tired of agues sand-flies tough
beef and bad butter as they freely professed because they really
believed they were better off at home or because they were like
me and my friend tickle not rich enough to squander their money on
vanities and so stayed at home from necessity

of such persons one can always even in summer-time assemble enough to
make a party of some kind or other where the contented guests can be
uncommonly sociable eat ices and pity their friends who may be at
the moment roasting in a ball-room at saratoga

it was undoubtedly a great misfortune that i should make my first
introduction to good society at a time when it was to be seen only
in its minimum of splendour whereby i lost the opportunity of being
dazzled to the same degree in which i found myself capable of dazzling
others nevertheless i was vastly captivated by what i saw and
for the few brief weeks that my destiny permitted me to live among
the refined and exclusive i considered myself an uncommonly happy
individual

the reception i met at mrs pickup's convinced me that in entering
mr dawkins's body i had done the wisest thing in the world for
however much it endangered me with the tailors it proved the best
recommendation to the ladies i found myself ushered into a suite of
apartments magnificently furnished and lighted and not so over crowded
for the season was taken into consideration but that the moschetoes
had room to exercise their talents i thought i should be devoured by
mrs pickup she was so amazingly glad to see me but i perceived
by a sort of instinct i had acquired along with dawkins's body that
there was something plebeian about her although a very fine woman as
far as appearances went and indeed tickle assured me she was a mere
parvenue or upstart whom everybody despised and whom no one would
come nigh were it not for her wealth and the resolution she avowed to
give six different balls of the most splendid character in the course
of the season she had a daughter who was very handsome and a decided
speculation but i did not think much of her especially as i found she
was already engaged to be married

i found here that i knew everybody or what was the same thing that
everybody knew me and with tickle's help i soon found myself as
much at home with mr i d dawkins's fair acquaintances as if i had
known them all my life it was still as it had been before a virtue
and peculiarity of my recollections that they were always roused by
a few words of conversation with any one known to my prototype from
which i infer that the associations of the mind as well as many of
its other qualities are more dependant upon causes in the body than
metaphysicians are disposed to allow

this dependance it has been my fate to know and feel more extensively
perhaps than any other man that ever lived the spirit of sheppard lee
was widely different from those of john h higginson and i d dawkins
as i think the reader must have already seen and yet no sooner had
it entered the bodies of these two individuals than the distinction
was almost altogether lost certain it is that in stepping into each
i found myself invested with new feelings passions and propensities 
as it were with a new mind and retaining so little of my original
character that i was perhaps only a little better able to judge and
reason on the actions performed in my new body without being able to
avoid them even when sensible of their absurdity

i do verily believe that much of the evil and good of man's nature
arises from causes and influences purely physical that valour and
ambition are as often caused by a bad stomach as ill-humour by bad
teeth that socrates in bonaparte's body could scarce have been
socrates although the combination might have produced a timoleon or
washington and finally that those sages who labour to improve the
moral nature of their species will effect their purpose only when they
have physically improved the stock strong minds may be indeed operated
upon without regard to bodily bias and rendered independent of it but
ordinary spirits lie in their bodies like water in sponges diffused
through every part affected by the part's affections changed with its
changes and so intimately united with the fleshly matrix that the
mere cutting off of a leg as i believe will in some cases leave the
spirit limping for life

but as i said before i am not writing a dissertation on metaphysics
nor on morals either and as my adventures will suggest such
reflections to all who care to indulge them i will omit them for the
present and hasten on with my story

and here the reader may expect of me a description of those scenes and
persons in fashionable life to which and whom i was now introduced
and if i valued the reader's approbation at a higher price than my own
conscience and reputation i should undoubtedly gratify him by putting
my imagination in requisition and painting at once some dozen or two
of such fanciful pictures as are found in novels of fashionable life
though never i opine in fashionable life itself in such i should
have occasion to represent gentlemen more elegant and witty and ladies
more charming and ethereal than are to be found in any of the ordinary
circles of society but as i am writing truth and not fiction and
represent things as i found not as i imagined them i declare that
the ladies and gentlemen of the exclusive circles to which i was
admitted were very much like the ladies and gentlemen of other circles
 that is as elegant and witty as they could be and as charming and
celestial as it pleased heaven and that after due exercise of
judgment and memory i cannot in the adventures of three whole weeks
in such society remember a single person or thing worth describing
for which reason i will pass on to more important matters




chapter xii


sheppard lee makes the acquaintance of his cousin miss pattie wilkins


although i now look upon those three weeks of my life as three weeks of
existence out of which i cheated myself i was nevertheless so greatly
delighted at first by the way in which i spent them that i had almost
forgotten my uncle wilkins and when i did think of him it was only
with renewed contempt and indifference finding however that the old
fellow had called upon me three or four times during my absence from
my lodgings on as many different days and remembering what he had
said of his riches it occurred to me that i might as well pay him a
visit were it only to satisfy mr sniggles and nora magee both of
whom manifested great uneasiness at my undutiful conduct it occurred
to me moreover that although my uncle wilkins was not a lending man
my cousin sammy might be and as i had now existed four different
days without a single sixpence in my pocket and began to be heartily
ashamed of such a state of things i thought it would be as well to pay
the rustics a visit and putting on a new coat which snip had just sent
me to seal our reconciliation and secure my seven extravagant cousins
i started off forthwith

as my evil luck would have it i found the old gentleman on the point
of setting out to pay me a fifth visit and i had the satisfaction
just as i placed my foot on the porch of the hotel in full view of
some half a dozen respectable-looking people who were congregated
there to receive an embrace from mr samuel wilkins with the old
white fur hat accompanied by a vocal salutation of oho ikey my
boy and so you have come have you ods bobs but i began to think
you was ashamed of your relations

not i said i i am never ashamed of my relations and i looked
around me with dignity so that all present might perceive i was
condescending i supposed i should find some of the spectators
giggling but was agreeably surprised when i beheld among them nothing
but grave looks of respect indeed two or three old gentlemen that
i knew by sight and who were what you call stanch citizens that
is rich old fellows not very genteel but highly respected made me
low bows and i heard one of them as i passed with my uncle into the
hotel whisper to another it is the rich old rascal's nephew quite a
promising young man

i began to feel a greater esteem for my uncle for i saw that others
respected him everybody seemed to know him and make way for him
seeing which i grew more condescending than ever and instantly began
to apologize for my seeming neglect by pleading that i had been
engaged night and day in preparing the way for the admission of him and
my cousins sammy and pattie into good society

you want a house in a fashionable quarter said i 

ods bobs said he yes and i've been looking all over town from
the glass-works down to the navy-yard and seen a power of them

i flatter myself i can suit you said i and better than you can
yourself besides said i i have been looking for carriages and
horses

why said my uncle it's expensive keeping horses in a city and i
was against it but there's pattie says we can't do without em

exactly so said i you must live like a gentleman or there's no
getting or keeping in society and besides i have been stirring up
the beaux and belles to come and see my cousin the fair i say uncle
eged has she no other name than pattie

yes said my uncle wilkins there's abby that's abigail martha
abigail wilkins called her after her grandmother and aunt and hoped
aunt abby would leave her something but she didn't

martha abigail wilkins worse and worse i despaired of doing any
thing if i even wished it for a creature with such a name

but what i had done that is what i said i had done for i had done
nothing had produced a great effect on my uncle and put him into
such a good-humour with me that he seized me by the hand swore i
was the right sort of a dog after all and reaching the door of his
private parlour where the fair martha abigail was sitting he kicked
it open crying aloud

here pattie you puss here's your cousin ikey the dandy as fine a
whole-hog fellow as ever you saw ods bobs give m a buss

i looked upon the unsophisticated rustic who was called upon to
manifest her breeding in such an agricultural style and upon my soul
i was quite surprised to find in her the aforesaid pattie abigail
one of the nicest little creatures i had ever laid eyes on of a most
genteel figure tolerably well dressed considering she had been
brought up in the country and with a sweet prudish face that was
quite agreeable to look on

she smiled and she blushed then laughed and blushed again but
without waiting to be bidden a second time tripped up to me gave me
both her hands and saying cousin ikey how do you do with a voice
that was charming in every word save one the infernal ikey she very
innocently turned her cheek up to be saluted

i felt myself called upon to give her a lesson in politeness and
therefore put my lips to her hand saying cousin p p pattie ehem
the girls will all call her petty-patty petty-patty wilkins i beg
your pardon but it is quite ungenteel and vulgar to kiss a lady that
is to say in common cases but as i spoke i admired her beauty the
more and began to think the etiquette in such cases was absurd but
as we are cousins i think that alters the case entirely

and with that i paid my respects to her cheek and upon my soul was
rather gratified than otherwise nay and upon an instinct which i know
not whether i owed to my soul or body i made an offer to repeat the
ceremony that i might be as condescending as possible when the little
minx to my surprise and indignation lifted up one of the hands i had
dropped and absolutely boxed me on the ear starting away at the same
time and saying with a most mischievous look of retaliation

i reckon i know manners as well as anybody

ged and upon my soul said i and marched up to the glass to restore
my left whisker to its beauty for she had knocked it out of its
equilibrium while my uncle wilkins fell foul of her and scolded her
roundly for her bad behaviour

it don't signify pa said the amiable pattie bursting into tears
i served cousin ikey no worse than cousin ikey served me for when
i wanted him to kiss me he wouldn't and if he had boxed my ear it
wouldn't have been half so bad for it was very rude of him not to kiss
me and say it was vulgar and he can't deny it

i have mentioned before i think the surprising facility women seem to
have of turning the tables upon a man in any contest that may happen
between the sexes for let a man be never so much in the right my
head for it the woman will soon prove him to be in the wrong

i found the truth of the maxim on the present occasion for there was
the pretty pattie who had just shocked my sensibilities wounded my
self-love violated my dignity and disordered my whisker by a buffet
on the cheek extremely well laid on considering the youth and sex
of the bestower now weeping and bewailing the injury i had done her
in moralizing over a kiss before taking it it occurred to me she was
an uncommon goose but she looked so wonderfully handsome pouting
her lips with such a beautiful pettishness that i was convinced i
had treated her very badly for which reason i stepped up to her and
begged her pardon so penitently that she relented and forgave me and
we were soon in a good-humour with one another

she seemed to me to be an odd creature disposed to be whimsical and
funny and i rather feared she was at bottom witty i say i feared
she was witty and lest the reader should draw wrong inferences from
the expression i think it right to inform him that while recording
my adventures in the body of mr i d dawkins i feel my old dawkins
habits revived so strongly in my feelings that i cannot avoid giving
some of the colouring of his character to the history of his body i do
not presume to say what women should be or what they should not in
confessing a fear that my cousin pattie was witty i only record the
horror with which i while a dandy in common with all others of the
class regarded any of the sex who were smarter or more sensible than
myself

my cousin pattie was then odd whimsical and i feared witty but
that remained to be proved she certainly acted in a manner highly
unsophisticated which arose from her youth for my uncle told me
she was not yet eighteen and her country breeding she had divers
rusticities of speech and a frankness of spirit that would at any
moment burst out in weeping and wailing or a fit of romping all which
was horridly ungenteel and a great objection to genteel people taking
notice of her

but on the other hand she was a positive beauty and although she
slouched about sometimes when forgetful her movements were commonly
graceful and lady-like

my judgment was therefore favourable beauty grace good clothes
and a grammatical way of speaking were as far as i knew the only
requisites for a fine woman and i thought it was possible to make her
one the two first requisites she already possessed good clothes were
to be had of a good milliner and as for her conversation i flattered
myself i could in a few lessons teach her to subdue all redundances
for in that particular she wanted nothing but pruning




chapter xiii


a further account of miss pattie wilkins


having made these observations in the course of a ten minutes
conversation i perceived i had no longer any reason to be ashamed of
her but on the contrary to congratulate myself on the relationship
then permitting myself to be affectionate and frank as a near kinsman
should i gave her freely to understand that with a little advice
and training which i would undertake to give her in a few lessons
she would be fit to shine in the very best society an admission that
set my uncle into an ecstasy of delight and triumph while it somewhat
discomposed the fair pattie she gave me a hearty stare a thing i was
glad to see for it looked lady-like then coloured a circumstance
i did not approve so much since blushing is girlish and ungenteel
and then burst out a laughing and concluded by seizing upon my hand
giving it a yeomanly shake and saying

very well cousin ikey you shall be my schoolmaster and teach me
all you know and as you say i think you can teach me in a very few
lessons

and here she looked as meek and quiet and almost as sanctimonious as
any saint i ever saw of a sunday

very good said i and the first lesson i will give you is never to
call me ikey again for that's vulgar but always mr dawkins or
just plain cousin or as we are so nearly related why i don't care
if you call me by my middle name dulmer

wouldn't dully be better said she as sweetly as could be it's
more affectionate and cousins ought to be affectionate

that's very true said i and upon my soul i thought her mouth was
the handsomest i had ever seen it is very true but it don't do to
be too familiar and besides dully don't sound a whit better than
pattie i wish to ged you had a better name than that and yet it
is the best of them all for martha is kitchen-like and abigail
wash-womanly 

and pat said my cousin 

pat said i struck with horror 

yes pat said she looking as if she would cry again it is the
most odious of nicknames and there's my brother sam who calls me
so all day long and there's pa who is not much better but i say
cousin i hope you'll take them to schooling too i won't say any
thing about pa but i reckon there's none of us will be the worse for a
little rubbing up

don't say reckon said i nor sam neither ged you have horrid
names among you but we'll do the best we can pattie miss pattie
wilkins well the name is not so very bad as for your brother you
must always call him brother occasionally you may say wilkins and
it will sound aristocratic as being a family name but i say uncle
we can't do any thing till we have you in your own house and if you
mean to pass for a man of quality it must be a grand one that is as
grand as can be had without building i say uncle if you please what
do you hold yourself worth

ods bobs said my uncle bristling up what's that any man's
business never blab a man's capital for 

oh said pattie pa's always thinking about trade and shop-keeping
but i'll tell you for i know all about it for he told me six months
ago and i know he's worth two  and here the little beauty looked
as if she designed to make me her confidant at once and swell my very
soul with the greatness of her revealment he's worth two hundred and
ninety thousand dollars and when he dies he is to leave me half a'n't
it grand

to leave you half one hundred and forty-five thousand dollars
said i so confounded by a sudden idea that entered my mind that i
could not even conceal it hang it if that's the case but i shall
certainly marry you and snap up that hundred and forty-five myself

would you said the imp looking so lovely and innocent and
willing that i positively threw my arms around her neck as if the
matter were already settled

ods bobs said my uncle none of your jokes here nevvy

as for pattie she jumped out of my arms though apparently more
pleased with the rudeness than with my former want of enthusiasm and
ran laughing to a chair

none of your jokes here nevvy i say cried mr wilkins and don't
talk to pattie about marrying for she has had enough of that already

i ha'n't pa said the daughter beginning to cry again you're
always twitting me with danny but i'm sure if you're willing i'd as
lief marry my cousin ikey that is cousin dulmer as anybody

who's danny said i

my uncle looked black but pattie answered boldly

why my sweetheart to be sure danny baker one of the truest
sweethearts you ever saw and oh so handsome but he was nothing but
one of pa's clerks and so we turned him off between us and because
i took his part and said it was no great harm in him to like me pa
is always twitting me about him and i can't abide it if i am to be
twitted about everybody that likes me i should like to know where will
be the end of it

i perceived that my little cousin had a good opinion of herself which
was proper enough but i reprobated the good-will she extended to her
admirer telling her that all clodhoppers were to be despised and
that she must now think of being liked by none but fine gentlemen my
counsel as i discovered afterward was peculiarly acceptable to my
uncle and greatly increased his respect for me and as for pattie she
dried her eyes and said she had as much spirit as anybody but danny
baker was no fool for all we might say of him

in short the interview was much more satisfactory than i had dared
to anticipate and finding my uncle and cousin were eager to have my
instructions and assistance so as to begin the world as soon and with
as much eclat as possible i summoned my wisdom and laid down the law
to them forthwith a house was to be immediately had and recollecting
the state of mr periwinkle smith's affairs i recommended that my
uncle should make proposals for his dwelling which was just the house
required and which i supposed mr smith or the sheriff for him would
soon bring to the hammer nay in the exuberance of my affection i
offered to begin the negotiation myself and visit mr periwinkle smith
that day whereby i might have an opportunity to return my thanks for
his friendly assistance at the schuylkill without exciting any false
hopes in the bosom of his daughter which i feared might be the result
if i went without an object

i then discoursed on the subject of carriages and horses furniture
tailors and mantuamakers and with such effect that i perceived
i should have the control of all my uncle's affairs directing his
expenses and making all his purchases which i saw would be highly
advantageous in reinstating my credit even if it led to no better
profit




chapter xiv


a short chapter containing an account of the author's cousin samuel
wilkins jr


having debated these matters to my satisfaction and theirs i was
about taking my leave when my cousin sammy unexpectedly entered the
apartment

his appearance struck me dumb and filled me with mingled terror and
despair what could i do with such a scarecrow his appearance was
death to my hopes of making the family fashionable he was a raw youth
of twenty or twenty-one but six feet high long-legged lantern-jawed
and round-shouldered he wore a white hat like his father but stuck
upon his head with a happy contempt of order and symmetry and his
coat hung down in a straight line from his shoulders as if cut to fit
the wall of a house he walked with a lazy grave swagger indicative
of vast serenity of mind and self-regard and until i cured him of
the habit with both hands in his pockets there was not an ounce of
brain in his whole head big as it was though from the gravity with
which he stared and whistled one in the face for staring and whistling
were two of his greatest characteristics it might have been supposed
otherwise i will not say the clown was ugly in visage or deformed in
person but he was a slouch from head to foot one could see at a look
that he considered himself a gentleman that he lived in the country
and that the highest exercise of his gentility had been to stalk about
from one mud-hole to another with his hands in his pockets

he did not seem at all daunted by my appearance but having surveyed
me with his great staring eyes he dragged one of his fists out of his
pocket and gave me a friendly grasp very much like the pinch of a
bear glad to see you hope you're well he said and said no more
but remained observing me with extreme gravity during the remainder of
the conference when i got up to depart he rose also and though i
could have well dispensed with such an escort attended me to the door
he uttered not a word until we came within view of the bar when the
great oaf opened his lips and said with an extremely knowing look i
say ikey my boy suppose we take a smaller

a smaller said i indignantly gentlemen in a city never drink
smallers

well then said the goose i don't care if we go the whole gill

come said i commiserating his ignorance you must never more talk
of such things none but vulgarians drink strong liquors slings
cocktails and even julaps are fit only for bullies gentlemen never
drink any thing but wine

wine's small stuff said my kinsman with great equanimity but i'm
for any thing that's genteel and dad says you're the boy for showing
us but od rabbit it it's a hard thing to play the gentleman in a
place where you a'n't up to it but i say now how do you think we'll
do me and pat

i could scarce avoid laughing in the booby's face he asked his
question with such simplicity and complacency i perceived that
notwithstanding his lazy serenity and stolid gravity he was as anxious
to be made genteel as either of the others and quite as ready to
submit to my guidance i told him i had no doubt he would do very well
when i had polished him a little which i would soon do and i resolved
to begin the task without delay i carried him to a private apartment
ordered a carriage and a bottle of chateau-margaux to amuse us while
it was getting ready and gave him to understand i would immediately
take him to a tailor's and this i did in a very short time to the
infinite delight of my friend snip whom i ordered to make three or
four different suits for him without troubling myself to ask his
opinion about either i then carried him in the same way to a hatter
shoemaker and man-milliner leaving the jeweller watchmaker and so
on for a future occasion

these important matters being accomplished greatly to my own
advantage for i took care to speak of my uncle wilkins in a way to
produce the strongest effect i ordered the coachman to drive up to mr
periwinkle smith's whither i thought i might as well proceed while
i had a coach to carry me i gave my gawky cousin to understand my
business was to buy the house for his father at which he expressed
much satisfaction for everybody in philadelphia knows the house is a
very fine one and a desire to help me examine it but telling him
there were many fine ladies there who must not see him till he was
properly dressed i charged him to wait for me in the coach until i
returned




chapter xv


in which sheppard lee visits mr periwinkle smith and his fair
daughter and is intrusted with a secret which both astonishes and
afflicts him


i pulled the bell with a most dignified jerk and asked for mr
smith but the servant who grinned with approbation as at an old
acquaintance and doubtless considered that he knew more about the
matter than myself as philadelphia servants usually do ushered me
into the presence of mr smith's fair daughter

ah said i to myself as i cast my eye around the apartment and saw
that her levee consisted of but a single beau a stranger whom i did
not know but who i learned afterward was a young millionaire from
boston the world begins to suspect the mortgages and friends are
falling away poor dear miss smith and i felt great compassion for
her

she seemed somewhat surprised at my appearance and i thought she
looked confused she was a marvellous fine creature and i was quite
sorry she was not rich

i saw she had a sneaking kindness for me yet but it was not right to
encourage her i hastened therefore to express my thanks for the
sympathy which i had been informed she had bestowed on me on the
memorable occasion of my dip in the schuylkill and regretted that the
indisposition consequent upon that disaster had prevented my calling
earlier i had not met the fair lady at mrs pickup's or the misses
oldstyle's or at the other two place where i had figured during the
last four evenings and although it was highly probable she knew my
indisposition had not prevented my going to these places yet my not
seeing her made the excuse perfectly genteel and fair yet she looked
at me intently i thought sadly and reproachfully for a moment and
then recovering herself expressed her pleasure to see me so well
restored and ended with great self-possession by presenting me to
her new admirer after this her manner was cooler and i thought her
pique rendered her a little neglectful it was certain she wished
me to observe that she had a high opinion of the new philander a
circumstance to which i was not so indifferent as i ought to have
been but in truth she was an elegant soul and the more i looked at
her the more i regretted she was not a fortune i felt myself growing
sentimental and to check the feeling i resolved to proceed to
business

i had no sooner asked after the old gentleman and expressed a desire
to see him than she gave me a look that bewildered me it expressed
surprise and inquiry mingled with what i should have fancied contempt
could i have believed anybody could entertain such a feeling for me
she rang the bell ordered my desire to be conveyed to her father and
in a few moments i was requested to walk up stairs to his study where
i found him in company with a gentleman of the law and a broker whose
face i knew and surrounded with papers

ah said i to myself things are now coming to a crisis he is
making an assignment

the gentleman of the law and the broker took their departure and mr
periwinkle smith gave me a hard look i began to suspect what he was
thinking of he was perhaps looking for me to make a declaration in
relation to his fair daughter

that he might not be troubled with such expectation long i instantly
opened my business and gave him to understand i came to make proposals
he opened his eyes and grinned for his house he looked astounded
which i had heard he was about to dispose of

indeed said he and then fell to musing a while pray mr dawkins
said he who sent you upon this wise errand

i did not like his tone but i answered i came on the part of my uncle
samuel wilkins of wilkinsbury hall for i thought it as well to make
my kinsman's name sound lordly

very good said he but what made you suppose i intended to sell my
property

i liked this question still less than the other and mumbled
out something about common report and the general talk of my
acquaintance

ah said he now i understand giving me a grin which i did not
let us be frank with one another there was something said about
mortgages was there not a heavy weight on my poor estate

thinking it was useless to mince the matter i acknowledged that such
was the report

and it is from the influence of that report i am to understand some
of the peculiarities of your that is to say it is to that i am to
attribute your present application really mr dawkins i am afraid i
can't oblige you my house i like very well and but i'll admit you
to a little secret and smiling with great suavity he laid his hand
on a pile of papers here said he are mortgages and other bonds
to the amount of some seventy thousand dollars they are my property
and not mortgages on my property the truth is and as you are an old
friend i don't scruple to tell you that having a little loose cash
which i did not know what to do with i took the advice of a friend
and invested it in the form in which you now see it and i believe it
is very safe the story of the mortgages was quite true only it was
told the wrong way

i was petrified and stood staring on the old gentleman with awe and
amazement

some people said he very good-naturedly might doubt the
propriety and even the honourableness of a private gentleman
investing money in this way but stocks are at a high premium and many
unsafe and money can't lie idle i hope you are satisfied i am quite
sorry i can't oblige your uncle my house as i said i like extremely
well and i have besides promised it as a wedding-present to my
daughter

oh ye gods of greece and rome a wedding-present to his daughter i
resolved to make her a proposal without delay and i thought i might as
well break matters to the old gentleman

your daughter said i your beloved and excellent daughter 

will doubtless always be happy to welcome her old friend and admirer
mr dawkins said he and i thought he looked beautiful though
i never thought so before he could not have spoken more plainly
i thought if he had said marry her at once i took my leave
intending to make love to her on the spot

i will have the pleasure to see you to the door said the old
gentleman and to the door he did see me i do not well know how it
happened but instead of entering the parlour again i found myself led
to the front door by the courteous mr smith and bowed handsomely out
to the great satisfaction of my cousin sammy who regarded proceedings
from the carriage window

good morning said mr periwinkle smith i can't sell my daughter's
house but i should be glad to have you for a neighbour and now i
recollect it there's higginson the brewer's house over the way there
advertised for sale and i am told it is very well finished

so am i said i to myself as the door closed on my face finished
unutterably it occurred to me i was turned out of the house and
the suspicion was soon very perfectly confirmed i called on the fair
miss smith the next day and though i saw her by accident through the
window i was met by the cursed fib not at home the same thing
was told me seven days in succession and on the eighth i saw to my
eternal wo and despair her marriage with my boston rival announced in
the papers he lives in philadelphia and can confirm my story but
this is anticipating my narrative

i say dawkins cried my cousin sammy i had cured him of the vulgar
ikey what does the old codger say

these words bawled by the rustic from the carriage window woke me
from a trance into which i had fallen the moment mr periwinkle smith
shut the door in my face

didn't he say there was a house over the way

i remembered the words my own house for sale i knew it well it
was just the thing wanted an elegant house provided genteel people
were in it i was on the point of running over and securing it when i
remembered mrs higginson a cold sweat bedewed my limbs no said i
i will go to tim doolittle i can face him

to make matters short for i have a long story to tell i drove up to
higginson's brewery it is now doolittle and snagg's or was when
i heard last of it saw my late brother-in-law whom i thought a
very plebeian body and made such progress with him that in three
days time for my margaret had gone to mourn in the country the
house changed owners and my uncle wilkins marched into it as master
followed by sammy and pattie




chapter xvi


containing much instructive matter in relation to good society whereby
the ambitious reader can determine what are his prospects of entering
it


three days after i had established my uncle in his new house the fair
miss smith was married

it was a great blow to me and i mused with melancholy on the
fickleness of the sex wondering what it was in woman's nature that
enabled her so easily to change from one love to another i considered
myself very badly used and the more i thought of the wedding-present
and the seventy thousand dollars in bonds and mortgages the more
deeply did i feel my loss i read the announcement of her marriage in
the newspaper cursed her inconstancy and hard-heartedness and gave
myself up to grief the whole morning she had certainly used me ill
but by dinner-time i remembered i had served her pretty much in the
same way

besides my cousin pattie i always dined with my uncle wilkins
of course and intended soon to live with him altogether looked
uncommonly handsome and who knows said i to myself whether she
won't have more than miss smith after all in addition to this
great consolation i had another in a few days and the two together
quite comforted me for the loss of periwinkle's daughter but of this
in its place

in three days time as i have mentioned i had my uncle wilkins in his
new house and was busy polishing the family but the task was harder
than i supposed the rusticities of my uncle were inveterate and as
for sammy the only change i could effect in him was such as the tailor
effected for me i found him a clown and a clown i left him i should
have given him up after the first day had it not been that his father
kept him pretty well supplied with pocket-money which was an advantage
to me for i never could borrow any thing of my uncle i therefore
treated him civilly and carried him about to divers places taking
good care however that he should not fall into the hands of my friend
tickle or any other poor dandy

my cousin pattie was more docile and i perceived that as soon as i
should cure her of a mischievous habit she had of playing tricks upon
everybody in the house and myself too upon occasions she would be
fit for any society

as soon as my uncle had procured a carriage and i took care it should
be a good one i made an effort to buy my fine old thousand-dollar
bays but mr doolittle would not part with them i took her out
airing and shopping to teach her how to behave in public and i
contracted with mrs pickup who lived close by and who it was
supposed on account of her six balls would make a favourable
sensation to chaperon her for the season i took care to bestow her
patronage among the aunts and sisters of my tradespeople in such a way
as to advance my own credit and thinking it would be to my advantage
to have such a friend near her i recommended nora magee to her for a
maid although nora was not quite so genteel as i should have wished

in short i did every thing that was proper to prepare her way for
the approaching season and as soon as i thought her fit to receive
company went round among all the leading fashionables and requested
them to visit her

it was here that the invaluable nature of my services on behalf of my
country kinsfolk was shown as i took care to make them understand for
without me to help them or some other equally genteel person my uncle
and cousins might as well have tried to get into congress as into good
society my request was not granted until i had answered ten thousand
different questions and removed as many scruples on the part of the
monarchs of the mode there were a thousand reasons why my uncle's
family should be denied admission into that elegant society they were
so ambitious to enter and nothing but the force of my recommendations
ensured them success

my labours on this occasion made me familiar with the principles
upon which republican aristocratic society is founded and as these
principles are not universally understood even in america i think
i can do nothing better than explain them for the benefit of all my
young and aspiring readers

the pretensions of any individual to enter the best society of the
republic depend upon his respectability and the measure of this is
determined by the character of his profession if he have one if
not by that of his father i never knew even the most exclusive
and fastidious of examiners to carry his scrutiny so far back as a
grandfather for indeed all our grandfathers in america were pretty
much alike and the sooner we forget them the better

the first profession in point of dignity is that of a gentleman who
has nothing to do but to spend his revenue if he has one there are
some gentlemen well received in good society who live upon their wits
but they are born in it poor gentlemen not already in society had
better not try to get into it for rich men who have romantic daughters
are afraid of them a gentleman then always stands a fair chance of
being admitted and if his father was of a respectable profession
he is received with open arms the preference accorded to this class
is just since founded upon nature all occupations are more or less
disgraceful a strong proof of which is found in the fact that all
primitive nations such as the hottentots and north american indians
look upon them with contempt considering idleness and war as the only
business for gentlemen providence indeed ordained that men should
live by the sweat of their brows but it is horrid ungenteel to do so

the next profession in point of dignity is law and lawyers as i may
say form the true effective nobility of america for though the mere
gentlemen deem themselves higher and purer they are pretty generally
considered by others as only the lady-dowagers of society but the
lady-dowagers sometimes consider the gentility of lawyers doubtful

the third profession is that of arms which owes its consideration
mainly to the women who although the ministers of love and mercy to
man are wondrous fond of those who deal in blood and gunpowder these
are the only respectable professions in america

divinity physic merchandise agriculture and politics are the only
others from which a man is occasionally allowed to enter good society
but they are considered low and it is only peculiar circumstances
which can give any of their followers a claim to rise

i have said that the claim of the gentlemen to consider themselves the
highest class is founded in nature they form the nucleus of society
and around them as they are admitted the members of the other
professions establish the grand order of fashion according to their
creed law is a respectable profession because it keeps down the mob
or people by keeping them constantly by the ears and because it makes
money and arms they hold to be reputable because it does the same
thing and paves the way to the presidency divinity and physic they
consider to be naturally low occupations since their provinces are
only to take care of dirty souls and bodies merchandise is denounced
since it consists of both buying and selling whereas buying is the
only part of traffic that is fit for a gentleman agriculture is
contemned because there are so many clodhoppers engaged in it and
politics because it demands consociation with the mob

in these five professions however certain fortunate circumstances may
give a claim to notice parsons who are often doctors of divinity and
always reverends and physicians are titled gentry and this counts in
their favour and the same thing may be said of politicians when they
rise to be secretaries of departments or foreign ministers or become
renowned as orators great distinction will secure them favour for
they are then people that people look at merchants are allowed to be
respectable as soon as they are worth a million provided they have two
or three daughters and no sons and are willing to be splendid in their
entertainments an agriculturist of our own latitudes can never expect
to be made respectable but a planter of cotton or tobacco who owns a
hundred negroes and puts the name of his farm or the county he lives
in after his own has as good a chance as any

all other classes are vulgar and mechanical and therefore ineligible
men of science and genius are excluded on account of their manners
which are outlandish and their arrogant display of superiority which
is disagreeable and as for the actors dancers and singers that
are sometimes met with the two first are admitted because they are
foreign and famous and the last because they bring good music for
nothing

from this exposition of the code of society it will be seen that my
uncle wilkins could boast but slender claims to an introduction his
occupation had been vulgar and he had not made money enough to ennoble
him i trebled his two hundred and ninety thousand as is usual but i
could not deny that his son was named sammy and his daughter pattie

but what spoke highly in his favour was that whatever had been his
profession he had now abandoned it with the praiseworthy intention of
living a gentleman during the remainder of his life and what was also
advantageous he had pursued it at such a distance from the haunts of
fashion that his new friends might with the greatest propriety affect
an entire ignorance of it

his having a daughter too and but one son to divide with her his
eight hundred and seventy thousand that is to say his two hundred and
ninety was also a strong recommendation to those mammas who had sons
to provide for and his determination to indulge the fair pattie in
as many balls and parties as she desired was another circumstance to
propitiate favour

but to crown all i countenanced him and that settled the matter
in a few days time there was such a rattle and trampling at the
brewer's door as had never been known before the whole square was in
commotion being choked up with carriages and such was the throng of
genteel people rushing into the house that an unsophisticated dealer
in second-hand furniture supposing there was an auction to be held
stalked into the parlour and electrified everybody by wondering in
the way of a question not addressed to any particular person when the
sale was to begin

in short the thing was settled my uncle was dubbed a gentleman and
every occurrence went to show that in the approaching season his rank
would be confirmed and his daughter recognised as a belle by everybody
in town

but before that time a change came o'er the spirit of my fate and but
i shall confess the whole affair to the reader




chapter xvii


in which sheppard lee relates the passion he conceived for his fair
cousin and his engagement to elope with her


my uncle wilkins it seems was not merely ambitious to get into good
society he was ambitious to have his daughter married and as he
said into the best family in the land an object not very difficult
to compass considering the fortune he intended to leave her but my
uncle was resolved her husband should be rich as well as distinguished
and i discovered the old curmudgeon had an extreme horror of poverty
perhaps one of the strongest reasons for his leaving the country was
a fear he had lest his adorable daughter should be snapped up by that
aforesaid danny baker whom my cousin had pronounced one of the truest
and handsomest sweethearts i ever saw although i never saw him at
all nor indeed any other extremely true and handsome sweetheart of
the male gender in all my life for those that are true are ugly and
those that are handsome are as uncertain as politics i say this was my
uncle's fear and indeed he confessed to me his belief that pattie
had really a sneaking kindness for the young rustic for which reason
he was anxious to have her married as soon as possible

i may here observe that if a bachelor is to judge of the excellence of
love by the character of its vocabulary he will discover no stirring
reason to lament his insensibility all the expressions on the subject
go to show that there is something mean and contemptible in the tender
passion which men otherwise profess to be the most heavenly of the
passions as if indeed heaven had any thing to do with any of them
the moment a man begins to think a woman uncommonly charming he is
said to cast a sheep's eye on her when he feels a friendship for
her it becomes a sneaking kindness and the moment his heart is in
a hubbub he is deep in the mire from these terms and others that
might be mentioned it results as i have said namely that men and
women who have experienced the tender passion are notwithstanding
their pretences to the contrary really ashamed of it that a lover is
a sheep and a sneaking fellow ordained to grovel in the mud at the
feet of his mistress and finally that a bachelor has no good reason
to execrate his stars for keeping him single

but i had other notions when i was in mr i d dawkins's body

i was entirely of my uncle's way of thinking and proposed to take her
myself to which my uncle replied in some perturbation none of your
jokes there ikey my boy and gave me plainly to understand that was
a thing he would never think of nay the proposition seemed to him so
unpalatable that i was compelled to pretend i had made it entirely in
jest though i demanded supposing i had been serious what objection
he could have to me oh none in the world said he except your
being so near of blood for a cousin-german is almost the same as a
brother

i understood the old hunks better than he thought he had somehow
or other found out that i had spent my fortune and was therefore
in that particular no better off than mr danny baker i saw too
clearly enough that he only valued me as a sort of stepping-stone into
society and that having once had all the advantage of me he could he
would be ready to forget all my benefits the curmudgeon he had found
out i had been borrowing money of his son sammy and he was already
longing for the time to come when he might safely discard me

i resolved to marry pattie in spite of him and began to cast about for
some device by which to secure her share of his two hundred and ninety
thousand which it was more than probable he would withhold in the
event of her marrying against his will this device i soon hit upon

i told him there was among all my acquaintance not above one man whom
i could recommend as a husband for pattie for though there were dozens
of genteel young fellows fortunes were by no means so plentiful my
friend tickle i assured him was just the man a little gay to
be sure indeed quite dissipated and what was worse an enemy to
matrimony which was the more extraordinary as by marrying he might
come at once into possession of a splendid fortune and thereupon i
told him that jack's father who was a saint in his way and a bigot
to reclaim him had by will for i assured him the poor man was dead
bequeathed his superb estate to him only upon condition that he married
before the expiration of five years failing in which the whole
property now in the hands of trustees would revert to other persons
with the exception of a shabby annuity of a thousand a year the five
years i told my uncle wilkins were now nearly expired and jack
being in some alarm was already expressing an inclination to seek a
spouse but she must be a rich one otherwise he would never think of
her

this story which i fabricated for the purpose produced a strong
effect upon my uncle wilkins and i concluded it by recommending he
should without delay settle half his fortune upon pattie by legal
grant of dedi et concessi as the lawyers call it and register the
same in which event i would do all i could to bring the marriage
about not doubting that we should succeed since pattie was as i
averred just the sort of girl that tickle liked

my uncle was rather dumbfounded at the last proposal and swore he
would do no such thing he was not going he said to bribe anybody
to take his girl off his hands not he she should have her share when
he was dead and if she married to his liking why she should have
something before i might bring my friend tickle to see her if i would
and he would see what he thought of him

my uncle put a bold face upon the matter but i perceived he was eager
to make the acquaintance of my friend tickle and would be soon brought
to reason and indeed after having seen the intended son-in-law
and listened some half a dozen times over to my arguments he opened
his heart so far as to settle the sum of forty thousand dollars upon
pattie which or rather the yearly interest of that sum for the
crafty old sly-boots took care to constitute himself trustee for the
girl and retain the principal in his own hands he conditioned to pay
her after her marriage

i was provoked at his stinginess but as no better terms could be had
i thought i might as well bring the matter to a conclusion trusting
that something better would turn up after my marriage

i say my marriage for i had no thoughts of bestowing forty thousand
dollars or the interest thereof upon my friend tickle i made him my
confidant in the matter and easily prevailed upon him to assist me in
deceiving my uncle wilkins by appearing to pattie in the light of a
wooer as for pattie herself who i was persuaded had fallen in love
with me at first sight i made her a declaration which diverted and
delighted her beyond expression and revealing to her also my project
to secure her an independence she agreed to do her part in the play
pretend a great fancy for mr tickle and run away with me the moment
her father should make her the grant in question

the grant was made as i mentioned before but by that time i was in
a dilemma having made an engagement to elope with another lady who
was in some respects highly attractive and had fallen devouringly in
love with me indeed i may say she made me the first offer though it
was not leap-year but her situation excused her especially as it was
i she made love to she was the reader will be surprised to learn the
daughter of old skinner or goldfist the usurer and she was rather
handsome than otherwise the engagement was brought about as will be
shown in the next chapter




chapter xviii


in which sheppard lee recounts an engagement of a similar nature which
he formed with the fair alicia


my creditors looking with great certainty for their money now that
my long-talked-of uncle had got to town having waited a couple of
weeks for payment in vain began to besiege me in a highly importunate
way and as no assistance was to be had of my uncle and sammy's purse
was not so well filled as i could have wished i was reduced to great
straits

conversing on this subject with my friend tickle he advised me to
visit old goldfist as i that is my prototype the true dawkins had
often done before and see what could be had out of him on the strength
of my projected nuptials

the advice being as good as could be had for tickle's pockets were
as empty as my own i proceeded to the old fellow's house after
nightfall for i did not care to be observed

having knocked at the door it was opened by no less a person than
skinner's fair daughter herself as i soon discovered and in fact i
had some faint recollection of having seen her before there was a lamp
on the pavement before the door by which i could see her very plainly
she blushed and smiled and looked confused and when i asked for her
father made me some answer which i did not understand but as she
invited me to enter i followed her into the house expecting to be led
to the money-lender she conducted me however to a parlour not over
and above well furnished for skinner was a notorious skinflint when
having vouchsafed to converse with her a while i again asked after her
father

she told me he was not at home but seeing me rise to depart she
stammered out an assurance that he would soon return which caused me
to resume my seat evidently to her great pleasure

seeing this i condescended to make myself agreeable and with such
effect that the simple-hearted foolish creature began to tell me how
often she had seen me at her father's house a year or two before when
she was a little school-girl as she said and how glad she was to
see me back again as if a year or two before we had been intimate
acquaintances when on the contrary as my associations assured me i
or my original had never taken the slightest notice of her as in
truth why should i her father being so much beneath me

i believe i rather gave her a stare but she looked so admiringly at
me i could do no less than continue to be agreeable and to tell the
truth i was afterward amazed at my condescension

by-and-by there dropped in one of her brothers a very fine looking
young man for one of his rank in life but of a dissipated
under-the-table look and i thought somewhat julapized which is
a word that among certain classes signifies that one is not sober
however he behaved with great decorum and instead of taking a
seat as i expected to make my acquaintance he gave me a nod and a
laugh as much as to say i know what you're after my boy and went
stumbling into the back part of the house

in a few moments after there came another equally good looking but not
so obliging for he helped himself to a seat without any ceremony and
with just as little proceeded to inform me he supposed i was after
dad but dad was fast on an arbitration and would not be home for at
least three hours

poor alicia for that was her name and in this particular she was
better provided than my cousin pattie gave her brother an angry look
for at this announcement i got up and took my leave she followed
me however to the door and told me if i would come at about eight
o'clock on the following evening i would find her papa at home and
she added softly that she would be glad to see me she glad to see
me poor soul

i went though according to appointment and poor soul she was
glad to see me as was plain enough but sorry that papa had not yet
got through with that arbitration and so i could not see him unless
i would be so good as to wait until he came home and if i would it
would be charity for there was nobody in the house with her except old
barbara the housekeeper who was but poor company and indeed she
had but poor company always living a very lonesome life of it c
c and she concluded by promising if i would sit down to play me a
tune upon the piano

she played me a tune accordingly and horrid work she made of it but
as she did her best i praised her and that pleased her she then
to show me that she was accomplished introduced me to divers bits of
paper with colours on them which she told me were drawings and as i
knew but little of such things i took her word for it after which she
exhibited some two or three dozen handsome-looking volumes in french
and italian of which languages i knew no more than dandies in general
and for that reason i told her such things were now considered bores
and left to children and schoolmasters

i perceived we were to have a tête-à-tête of it and i began to suspect
the lassie knew so when she invited me when this idea entered my
mind i felt a little indignant yet it was diverting to think of her
simplicity i thought i would amuse myself with her a little while and
unbend from the austerity of dignity which seemed to gratify her most

in this humour i permitted myself to be merry and easy and having
romped with her one way and another much to her delight i at last
seized upon her and gave her a buss whereupon she acted pretty much
as my cousin pattie had done before her that is she laughed and
blushed and cried oh la but looking all the time any thing but
incensed

in short my condescension affected her to that degree that she
began to treat me as her most undoubted friend and in the height
of her confidence informed me that she was just eighteen years old
minus two months the very age of my cousin pattie that she was
her father's favourite as far as any one could be the favourite of
such a curmudgeon and that besides her fine expectations from him
she enjoyed in her own right a fortune of twenty thousand dollars a
bequest from some old aunt or other which she would come into
possession of as soon as the aforesaid two months and a few odd days
had expired

this was news that affected me very strongly and had her father been
a gentleman all things considered i believe i should have made her a
declaration on the spot

as it was i felt my soul growing tender towards her for though twenty
thousand dollars was but a small sum it was if i could take her word
for it certain which was not yet the case with any of my cousin
pattie's expectations however before i could digest the information
we were surprised by the turning of a dead-latch key in the front
door and alicia cried with a tone of disappointment oh la it is
papa and so it was

the old gentleman looked upon the open piano and the books and
drawings upon the table with surprise and then upon me with
uneasiness

mr dawkins has been waiting papa said alicia

humph said old goldfist and pointed her to the door she stole me a
look and as she passed out raised her hand archly to her lips she
was rather free i confess but she had lived a secluded life and knew
no better

the old fellow gave me a sharp look coughed phthisically twice or
thrice and then with but little superfluous ceremony asked me what i
wanted

money said i

oh ay always money who is to pay it what's your security

my uncle wilkins said i

very good name don't doubt growled the bear the banks will take
it don't do any business of that sort

ged faith no said i i don't come for money at six per cent
but on the old terms of usury you know my uncle wilkins eh only two
children a fortune of eight hundred and seventy thousand dollars

bah said the bull that will do for the girls and boys know all
about him one hundred and twenty and half of it in railroads good
for nothing

two hundred and ninety bona fide said i and half of it in
bank-stock

know all about it said mr skinner but what's that to you has a
son of his own

and a daughter said i giving him a nod which brought a christian
look into his face and doubtless a christian feeling into his
hearts i took advantage of it to inform him that she and i were about
to elope and wanted a thousand dollars to bear our expenses assuring
him also that her father was on the eve of making her a grant of fifty
thousand dollars as soon as which was done we should be off at a
moment's warning to be brief i told the old fellow all that was
necessary for my purpose and made so good a story of it that i have
no doubt i should have got something out of him had not my evil genius
suddenly prompted me to refer to his own daughter alicia and ask him
what he intended to give her over and above her own twenty thousand

he looked as black as midnight and asked who told me she had such a
sum

i saw i had alarmed him and said i had it of a friend of mine a very
fine fellow who thought of taking her off his hands provided he would
add twenty more to it

want no fine fellows and no friends of yours said he gruffly
won't give her a cent and has nothing of her own all a fool's
story told you so herself a jade's trick never told a truth in her
life

the old miser's soul was up in arms the prospect of being called upon
in two months space to render up the girl's portion to a son-in-law
was so much scotch snuff thrown into his eyes if it did not blind
it at least distracted him and the reward i had for conjuring up the
vision was my own dismissal notwithstanding all my arguments to the
contrary with my pockets as empty as when i entered a rude assurance
that he had closed accounts with me and a highly impertinent request
that i would avoid troubling him for the future

so i got no money of him but his daughter fell in love with me
and the next day she sent me by the post a very tender and romantic
billetdoux in which she lamented her father's harshness and barbarity
hoped i would not think ill of her for venturing upon an apology and
concluded by informing me with agreeable simplicity that her father
was never at home between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when
the weather was clear from all which i understood that she was as
ready to run away with me as my cousin pattie

having pondered over the matter for a while it appeared to me proper
to encourage her enthusiasm so that in the event of my uncle wilkins
refusing to make pattie independent i might be certain of a wife
who could bring me something i had many objections indeed to the
lady's family and relations but the latter i could easily cut in case
of necessity and the other i considered scarce worth thinking of
her twenty thousand dollars was a strong recommendation and there
was no telling what her father might leave her if reconciled after
her marriage i liked my cousin pattie best but upon the whole i
considered it advisable to have a second string to my bow

with this impression on my mind i took occasion to drop in upon her
the first clear evening repeating the visit now and then as suited my
convenience and promised to run away with her upon the first fitting
occasion and this promise i resolved to keep provided my affairs with
my cousin pattie should render it advisable




chapter xix


the ingenious devices with which sheppard lee prepared the way for the
elopement


i had scarce brought my friend tickle upon the stage and introduced
him into my uncle's family before my mind began to misgive me i
suspected that instead of being content to play the stalking-horse for
my sole advantage he would take the opportunity to advance his own
interest and gain if he could my cousin pattie for himself

to remove all temptation and bind him more closely to be faithful i
told him of my adventure with alicia taking care however to conceal
her name for i did not wish to forego my advantages in that quarter
until convinced i could do so without loss described her claim to the
sixty thousand dollars for of course i trebled her inheritance and
concluded by engaging to make her over to him the moment i was myself
secure of pattie which would be the moment pattie was secure of an
independence

upon this promise tickle made me a thousand protestations of friendship
and disinterestedness and i felt my mind more easy

he acted his part assisted by pattie who at my suggestion feigned
suddenly to be violently in love with him and besieged her father
to the same end as myself the old gentleman at last com plied and
actually executed the deed of gift which i mentioned before by which
he secured to her the revenue accruing upon a sum of forty thousand
dollars the principal which he retained in his own hands in trust
to revert to her at his death and to this deed i was myself made a
witness

with these terms as it seemed there were no better to be had i
allowed myself to be satisfied and trusting to a final reconciliation
with my uncle wilkins to augment the dowry i ran to my cousin pattie
and informed her of her good fortune

she was filled with repture and began fairly to dance with joy she
told me i was the best and sweetest of cousins and vowed she would
love me to her dying day her joyous spirits fired my own and i
answered in terms equally ecstatic in short we agreed to elope that
very night and arranged our plan accordingly it was agreed i should
have a carriage in waiting at the corner of the street during the
evening and that pattie who was to feign herself unwell as an excuse
for not going to mrs pickup's first ball which was to take place
that evening should find some means to get her father out of the way
immediately after which i having disposed of the redoubtable sammy by
depositing him in the aforesaid mrs pickup's drawing-room was to make
my appearance and bear her in triumph to a reverend divine previously
secured for the ceremony

having settled all these things and sealed our engagement with a kiss
my adorable cousin admitted me to a secret which nearly froze my blood
with horror

she informed me that my friend tickle disregarding all his vows
of fidelity had been busy ever since i brought him into the house
besieging her on his own account that he had taken every occasion to
undermine me in her affections by disparaging my good qualities both
of soul and mind and especially by assuring her i was a great ass
and fortune-hunter those were his very words and finally that he
had so used the power his knowledge of our secret had given him by
occasional threats of betraying it to her father that she had been
compelled to accept his addresses and make him the same promise she
had just made me that is to elope with him the perfidious fellow had
by some means got wind of the deed of gift and while i was engaged
in signing it he had paid my cousin a visit with the same object as
myself and she had promised to decamp with him nay at this moment
the villain was engaged in securing his carriage and his parson with
the prospect of chousing me out of my wife and fortune

my horror was however soon dissipated my cousin pattie had made the
engagement only in self-defence and she looked upon the whole affair
as the best joke in the world how we will cheat him said she the
base fellow and she danced about smiling and laughing and crying
together so that it was a delight to see her yes said she with
uncommon vivacity we will cheat him for i'm sure he deserves no
better for i'm sure he's just as much of a goose and fortune-hunter as
he said you were and i'm sure i despise a goose and fortune-hunter
above all things and i'm sure i know how to treat a goose and
fortune-hunter as well as anybody how we'll laugh at him to-morrow
how he'll stare when he finds i'm gone how papa will stare too how
sammy will stare and how he'll whistle oh dear i do love to cheat
people of all things i do cousin ikey and ods fishes i'm almost
half minded to cheat you too

and with that she flung her arms round my neck gave me a kiss and ran
laughing away to prepare for the hour of elopement

there was an extraordinary coincidence between the situation of my
cousin pattie and myself she had agreed to run away with two different
people at the same moment and so had i the day before my uncle proved
unusually crusty and self-willed and i began to think i should never
effect my point with him and what was equally dispiriting i fell
among duns who persecuted me with astonishing rancour my uncle's
appearance as it seemed serving rather to sharpen than to allay their
appetites for payment being thus goaded on by doubt and dunning i
resolved to make sure of goldfist's daughter which i did by visiting
her as soon as night came and proposing an elopement on the following
evening and this it was the more easy to put into execution since her
father as she told me was fast in bed with a sciatica or some such
vulgar disorder

no one could be more willing and delighted than the fair alicia and it
appeared that in anticipation of the happy event she had already made
all her preparations having as she assured me arranged with a friend
of hers at whose house she designed the ceremony to be performed
ordered secretly a whole trunk full of bride's clothes and notified an
old schoolmate whom she had engaged to wait upon her

i thought upon my soul she was taking matters pretty easily and
acting somewhat independently but she was ignorant of the world as i
said before and knew no better i was still more disgusted with the
thought of being shown off among her friends and told her a bridemaid
was wholly superfluous but she had made her mind up as to what was
right on such an occasion and i judged it proper to submit it was
agreed i should meet her at her friend's house at nine o'clock in the
evening and she hoped very modestly i thought that i would bring
some nice pretty fellow to wait on me that would make a good match
with her dear julia who was the nicest dear soul in the world

this nice dear soul as i afterward discovered and as i think proper
to inform the reader now that he may understand into what a slough of
democracy i was rushing was no less a personage than a cousin-german
of mr snip my tailor and her appointment to the honour of waiting
upon the bride of the distinguished i d dawkins was productive of a
casualty expected neither by herself nor by my adored alicia

i laughed in my sleeve at that hint of my alicia and yet i did after
all provide myself with an attendant and one who was perhaps better
suited than any other person i could have lighted on as an offset
and pendent to the fair julia this was my cousin sammy wilkins
and the reason of my appointing him was this he was although the
stupidest creature on earth of a meddling and prying nature and
had an extraordinary fancy to go sneaking after me whithersoever i
went from admiration and affection perhaps but of that i was not
certain and at all events he was a great burden to me he discovered
my repeated visits to skinner's house and was seized with a stupid
curiosity to know the reason and what was still worse he made so
many observations on my attentions to and secret conferences with
his sister pattie that it was clear he suspected there was something
in the wind there too being kept in eternal torment lest he should
discover more than i liked or by his indiscreet tattling awake the
suspicions of others i saw no better means of averting the mischief
and turning his eyes from his sister than by taking him aside and
telling him with many injunctions to secrecy that i was courting old
skinner's rich daughter and wished to have him wait upon me at the
wedding

such confidence coupled with the intention to do him so much honour
entirely overcame his rustic imaginations he swore he approved of
marrying rich wives and was looking out for one himself and hoped i
would put him on the track of one which i promised and the clownish
juvenile was content he looked forward to the great event with a
measure of glee i had never seen him roused to before and he ordered a
new coat of snip that he might do honour to his service

it is quite true i never really intended he should trouble himself in
the matter but when the fated evening came when the loving alicia
arrayed in satin and white roses was awaiting her lover who was
preparing to run away with her rival i thought it better to despatch
him to my charmer than to leave him at mrs pickup's whence he might
stray at a moment's warning and indeed with no warning at all it
was quite necessary to have him out of the way for which reason i sent
him to the house where alicia was in waiting with a special message
to the lady to make his introduction the more easy and a thousand
instructions in relation to nothing

it was fortunate that my cousin sammy though as great a rustic as
ever lived was as little troubled with bashfulness as wisdom hence
i found no difficulty in despatching him to my inamorata whom he had
never laid eyes on and to her friends with regard to whom i was in
the same predicament i promised to follow him in a short time and
thus to my great joy succeeded in getting him out of the way




chapter xx


the guests that sheppard lee invited to his wedding


the appointed hour drew nigh and all things had gone on swimmingly
with one single exception the persecution i had endured from messrs
sniggles snip co the day before i was fated once more to endure
for going home to my lodgings about dusk to put on my best shirt
i found my chief creditors assembled in solemn divan or rather in
warlike ambush and such a troop of bears and wolves as they were was
perhaps never seen by an unfortunate gentleman before what had brought
them together especially at such an unlucky moment it was impossible
to divine but it seems they had had in consideration the state of
my affairs and prospects and had just come to the conclusion as i
entered that they were none the better off for the coming of my uncle
wilkins who for it appeared the villain sniggles had been sounding
him on the subject had disavowed all responsibility for my debts and
all disposition to discharge them in terms not to be mistaken it had
just been resolved nem con as the saying is that i had cheated
them that i was cheating them and that i would cheat them as long as
i could and that terms therefore should be kept with me no longer

to this moment my flesh creeps when i think of the yell the villains
set up when i stumbled among them and the audacity with which they
heaped on my devoted head their upbraidings menaces and maledictions
they used highly uncivil language and some laid their defiling fingers
upon my collar while all as with one voice cried out to carry me
before an alderman and make a public spectacle of me at once

i say my flesh yet creeps while i think of their ferocious conduct
and i shall remember it to my death-bed for of all the various
woes and grievances to which flesh is heir and which i have had
uncommon opportunities to test there are none more truly awful in my
recollections than a high case of dunning

it was several moments before i could utter a word in defence and when
i did having nothing better to say i assured the rascals i was just
on the eve of running away with my uncle's daughter and of course
would be soon able to answer all their scurvy demands i told them the
time was fixed the carriage and parson prepared and my fair pattie
in waiting but as i had told them many thousand things before which
were not always exactly true i found my present assurances received
with so little credit that i was obliged to give them ocular proof of
my honesty and fair-dealing i invited them to follow me to my uncle's
door and there station themselves until they beheld me come forth
conducting my bride to the carriage after which they might if they
would follow me in like manner to the parson and i engaged in the
confidence of my heart if i failed to bring out a wife according to
promise to follow them without any further demur to the alderman or
to old nick himself which was pretty much the same thing

this proposal being highly reasonable was accepted and i had the
honour of such an escort to my uncle's doors as was never before
enjoyed by a bridegroom the only one who did not accompany me to my
uncle's door was mr snip the tailor who passing a house where lived
as he said a young lady of his acquaintance stepped in to show one
of his customer's new coats that he had on promising to follow after
us in a moment as my stars or the father of sin would have it this
young lady was that identical dear julia his cousin-german of whom
i spoke before and whom he found rustling in satin just prepared
as she informed him to join her dear alicia skinner who was to be
married to the handsome mr dawkins at the house of their friend mrs
some-one-or-other

the tailor was thunderstruck as tailors doubtless often are assured
the dear julia she was mistaken and acquainted her with the true state
of the case the result of which was as may be understood when she
had carried her news to the expectant alicia a certain scene of a
highly interesting nature as for mr snip himself he rushed out of
the house to bring me to an explanation but when he reached the party
i had already taken refuge in my uncle's house




chapter xxi


containing a scialogue or curious conversation with nothing with a
discovery extremely astonishing to several persons


i found my cousin pattie also in her satins and nora magee whom she
had resolved to take with her decked out with extraordinary splendour
and what i thought was diverting enough the creature had a long
bridal veil like her mistress and as huge a cloak to conceal her
person from observation they were prepared to start with each her
bundle at hand and they hailed my appearance with delight

but there was a difficulty before us my uncle wilkins was yet in the
house and so was sammy as for the latter i soon got rid of him by
sending him to alicia as i mentioned before but my uncle we could
not remove my cousin's affectation of sickness to confirm which and
conceal her nuptial preparations she kept aloof in her chamber or
pretended to do so concerned him and he refused to leave the house
but being left to himself we knew he would soon drop asleep that
being one of his rustical propensities

by-and-by while we were discoursing upon our difficulties we heard a
carriage drive by and just as it passed the door the coachman gave
three loud cracks with his whip it was a sign i had agreed upon with
the fellow and i knew all was now in readiness i proposed that we
should instantly steal down stairs and 

at that moment i heard the front door softly open and shut

who's that said i

ah i'm sure i don't know said my cousin pattie turning so pale
i thought she was going to fall down in a faint perhaps it is mr
tickle yes she cried recovering her spirits and almost jumping for
joy now we'll sort him i'll show him how i serve fortune-hunters
i reckon i'll lock him up in a closet i will and there he shall
kick his heels till morning and i don't care if the rats eat him i
don't oh goody gracious he's coming up stairs she cried was
there ever anybody so impudent but i'll fix him here cousin ikey do
you run in here pointing to her chamber and don't let him see you

no said i thinking it proper to appear courageous i will face
the faithless rascal and punish his impertinence on the spot i
had no idea of doing any such thing which of course must have
alarmed my uncle and i intended to yield to pattie's fears and
importunity swallow my wrath for the present and conceal myself as
she recommended but my display of resistance awoke the indignation of
nora magee who cried och the divil take him thin does he mane to
rob us of our husbands and seizing me by the shoulders she thrust me
towards the chamber

run in cousin ikey said my cousin driving the irish barbarian
away but seizing me herself and urging me into the chamber while
she seemed dying with suppressed mirth you'll see how nora will sort
him you'll hear it you mustn't speak a word and ods fishes you
must remember to behave yourself here she seemed more diverted than
ever ods fishes you must behave yourself in a lady's chamber

at that moment nora blew out the light so that we were left in
darkness and my cousin locked the door thus as i supposed dividing
us from the enemy i say pattie my soul said i whispering in her
ear what is nora going to do with him but she answered me not a
word and i took that as a hint to hold my own peace the next instant
i heard a rustling in the next room and the voice of jack tickle
saying softly and almost in my own words

i say pattie my soul what did you blow out the light for where are
you oh you divine creature and i heard the smack of a kiss that
quite astonished me

pattie said i what the deuse is the meaning of that

but pattie was as dumb as before the rustling was transferred from the
antechamber i had taught my cousin to call it her boudoir into the
passage and i could tell by the creaking of a step that my friend
tickle was going down stairs

pattie said i what's in the wind now

but still pattie refused to answer me

while i was wondering at her silence now that there was no fear of
being overheard i again distinguished the sound of the house door
softly opened and shut

i say pattie said i what the devil is all that and pray why
don't you speak

it occurred to me that her silence was all owing to a fit of
bashfulness caused by her having me locked up in the chamber with her

pattie said i reaching out my hands but without being able to
reach her you shouldn't be bashful nor nothing considering we're to
be married in less than half an hour i say pattie what are we to do
now where are you

while i spoke i heard a carriage again rattle by the door and to my
astonishment the coachman saluted the house with three such cracks of
his whip as my own had given a few minutes before

pattie said i while a cold sweat broke over my limbs where are
you and why don't you speak

i felt about the door for her but felt in vain i listened for the
sound of her breath hoping she might have hidden herself out of sheer
mischief but not a breath was to be heard i went feeling about the
chamber and with as little effect

a horrible suspicion seized upon my fancy there were two doors to the
apartment one opening upon the passage the other into the boudoir
and both were locked as fast as doors could be where was the key my
cousin pattie turned when we entered the chamber together it was gone
i discovered its absence and looked round the chamber in astonishment
and dismay

at that moment some person in mr periwinkle smith's house which
was right opposite entered a front chamber therein with a light
which streamed into the windows of pattie's apartment with a lustre
sufficient to make every object visible my cousin pattie was not to be
seen i looked under the bed and into the bed examined the presses
and peeped behind the chairs but no cousin pattie was to be found she
had locked me in the chamber but not herself horror of horrors she
had played a trick upon me she had jilted me and ay there was no
doubting it a moment longer she had run off with my friend tickle
i'll show you how i serve fortune-hunters said she lock him up in
a closet kick his heels till morning eaten up by rats shall hear
yourself how i'll serve your rival tickle death and destruction and
after all she has run away with him eloped in the very carriage i
provided married by the parson i engaged decamped with the forty
thousand i secured and i i the unfortunate jilted cozened
i was the person left kicking my heels in a closet

the idea filled me with phrensy and the light from mr periwinkle
smith's house being removed at the moment i tumbled over a chair that
lay in my way and besides breaking my head and shin woke up such a
din in the house that the very servants in the kitchen bounced up in
alarm and screamed out for assistance

what's the matter pattie said my uncle wilkins turning the key
which the faithless creature had left sticking in the outside of the
door and entering i say pattie ods bobs what's the lord bless
us cousin ikey is that you what's the matter what are you doing in
pattie's chamber

i answered my uncle wilkins only by opening my mouth as wide as i
could and staring at him in anguish horror and despair

where's pattie said he in alarm

the question restored me to my faculties

eloped said i cheated me beyond all expression and run off with
my rival jack tickle

what a fool said my uncle recovering his composure i'm sure i
never opposed her

so much for not giving her to me said i

to you said my uncle

uncle wilkins said i from this moment i shall cut your
acquaintance pattie has jilted me so horribly you can't conceive and
has married jack tickle

well said my uncle where's the harm to be sure and a'n't he as
good now as worth ten thousand a year

not worth a cent said i shaking my fists at the old gentleman and
then drumming on my own breast not worth a cent and down in every
tailor's books in town except snip's who wouldn't trust him

oh you villain said my uncle wilkins how you've cheated me

he ran down stairs and i after him he was bent upon pursuing his
daughter and so was i



chapter xxii


in which sheppard lee finds that he has made the fortune of his
friends without having greatly advantaged his own


as we reached the foot of the staircase the house door opened and in
came my friend tickle dragged along not by our dear and faithless
pattie as we fondly supposed but by the raging nora magee

help murder help cried my friend tickle

och murder and twenty murders more upon ye ye chatin crathur and
won't ye marry me cried nora magee

my uncle wilkins and myself rushed forward lost in amazement and
separated the fury from her prey what is the matter cried both and
where is pattie

the devil is the matter cried jack panting and blowing and where
pattie is i know no more than you i thought i was running away with
her until i reached the squire's and then i found i had this wild
indian under her cloak who insisted i should marry her or else 

ay ye murderin faithless villain said nora magee i'll marry ye
or i'll have the breaches of promise and the damages out of ye och
but i have the law of ye for didn't my missus pattie promise ye should
marry me i say ye ugly-faced hin-souled tickle that they call ye i
have the law of ye and i'll be married before the squire or i'll have
the breaches out of ye

my breeches said jack you may have and my coat and waistcoat too
for may i be hanged and quartered if i am not cheated out of my very
skin

where's my daughter pattie said my uncle wilkins he looked at me
and i looked at him it was plain my cousin pattie had not run away
with my friend tickle

where could she be i began to recover my spirits when they were
suddenly put to flight by a knock at the door which being opened a
letter was thrown in the messenger instantly taking to his heels so
that no one beheld him it was a letter to my uncle wilkins he opened
it and read the following words 

dear papa and honoured father

this is to inform you that i don't like mr tickle and so can't
marry him and hope you will excuse me for following my own fancies
being now independent as you have made me for which i will remain
your dutiful loving daughter for life give my love to cousin dully
and tell him i consider him my best friend next to my dear papa and
my dear husband for oh papa i'm really married and going off
travelling to-morrow

hope you'll forgive us papa and shall ever love and pray for you and
rest your loving dutiful children

 pattie and danny baker

danny baker roared my uncle danny baker groaned i the clodhopper
had got her and i had been only toiling in his service

oh you villain said my uncle wilkins this is all your doings

sir said i no hard words

you're a villain said my uncle you wanted to steal her yourself
and i a'n't sorry danny baker has choused you out of her and for that
reason i don't care if i forgive him yes sir i'll forgive danny
baker but for you sir i owe you a debt 

if you do said tickle pay him but we took no notice of him my
uncle because he was enraged and i because i was devoured by the
greatness of my misfortune in truth the loss of my cousin pattie was
so unexpected that it had astounded me out of my faculties i was
reduced to a mere automaton conscious indeed of being in a horrible
quandary but incapable of seeing my way out of it when i suddenly
heard the voice as i thought or some one very like it of my cousin
sammy at the door

this roused me at once i remembered that at this moment my alicia was
waiting for me and i fell into a rapture

uncle wilkins said i you may say what you please jack tickle you
are a rascal nora magee you are a jade but it is all one to i d
dawkins i will marry my miss skinner

as i spoke i looked upon the door which opening disclosed a sight
that petrified me body and soul together it was the apparition of
my alicia in bridal array leaning upon the arm of my cousin sammy
and followed by a brace of youthful damsels decked in white flowers
all of whom stalked into the door with the solid step of flesh and
blood and advanced towards my uncle my alicia looking as silly and
shame-faced as could be while sammy on the contrary held up his head
and strutted like a turbaned turk in the midst of his harem

what the deuse is all this said jack tickle as for me i could not
speak a word being a hundred fold more amazed than before i looked at
my alicia who seeing me began to blush and bridle and simper and
hold fast to sammy's arm as for sammy he looked not a whit the less
turkish but marched up to his father as if charging him at the head of
a regiment

the old gentleman was as much astonished as myself and at last cried
out

ods bobs what's the matter sam have you been running away too

no said my cousin sammy i reckon i'm not gone yet but i've come
to get ready and first dad as in duty bound let's have a bit of
your blessing if you've no objection on me and my wife

your wife said i and said no more

well said my cousin sammy i reckon i may say so for you see
dawkins my boy when i saw lishy here i liked her and when july
here came and told us as how you had run off with sister pat wilkins
why then said i i may as well speak up for myself and so as the
parson was ready and lishy dressed up to be married already we made
but short work of the courtship and now as the saying is one and one
is one this here is my wife for better and for worse and i hope
neither you nor father has any objection




chapter xxiii


a crisis sheppard lee is reduced to great extremities and takes
refuge in the house of mourning


i never knew what my uncle wilkins replied to the aforesaid speech
the longest i ever heard my cousin sammy utter nor do i know what
reception he gave to the bride i made but one jump to the front
door where my horror was consummated my departure was greeted by an
uproarious cry but it proceeded from the street not the house i
found myself among the philistines whom an hour before i had myself
placed there in wait i had forgotten the barbarians which was natural
enough as they were my creditors but they had not forgotten me they
hailed my appearance on the steps with some such yell of wrath and
hunger as that with which the beasts of a menagerie express their joy
at the appearance of their daily meal

that cry was the finisher i leaped from the steps and took to my
heels not however without leaving in the hands of my tailor one tail
of the last coat he had made me which was i believe the only payment
i ever made him my hat flew into the gutter and that was perhaps
recovered by its maker in which case it was doubtless brushed up
and sold over again as a new one i fled like the wind my creditors
followed me the clatter of our footsteps and the uproar of their
interjections threw the street into a tumult some persons yelled
murder and others cried stop thief while the little boys catching
up the cry from a distance screamed out fire and ran to the nearest
engine-house to enjoy their evening amusement

how long i ran and whither it is quite impossible for me to say i
recollect doubling two or three times and diving into alleys to throw
my pursuers off the track my efforts were however in vain i found
myself lodged at last in a vile alley and hemmed in both on the front
and rear i made a leap at a garden gate which i cleared then running
forward and perceiving a back door in a house standing open i rushed
in scarce knowing what i did

i immediately discovered that i was in a sort of servants hall
or anteroom to the kitchen in which an old woman sat sleeping in
an arm-chair she was disturbed by the noise of my entrance and i
dreaded every moment to see her open her eyes and by her shrieks draw
my pursuers after me i was afraid however to retreat for in the
confusion of my mind i thought i heard my tormentors rushing to and
fro in the garden

in this uncertainty seeing a flight of stairs in one corner of the
room i darted up them without reflecting a moment upon what might be
the consequences but what evil could happen to me more horrid than
that i was fleeing i might stumble into a lady's chamber and throw her
into hysterics or i might find myself at the bedside of some valiant
personage sleeping with a brace of pistols under his pillow the
contents of which he might transfer to my body but such catastrophes
had now lost their terrors it was all one to i d dawkins as i had
said to my uncle wilkins i could receive no addition to my woes go
whither and do whatsoever i might

i rushed up the stairs therefore and entered a chamber where a
tallow candle burning all on one side stood flaring on a little
table among vials gallipots and other furniture of a sick chamber
throwing a dim and spectral light on a bed near to which it stood i
cast my eyes upon the bed and perceived i had nothing to fear either
from timorous ladies or nervous gentlemen




chapter xxiv


what happened in the dead-chamber the dirge of a wealthy parent


upon that couch lay the ghastly spectacle of a human corse stiff and
cold it was that of an old man and i thought at first that he slept
but upon looking closer i perceived that he had been dead for at
least an hour and it appeared as if he had died untended by friend or
servant for the bedclothes had been nearly tossed from the bed in his
last convulsion and now lay tumbled about his limbs and the floor
just as they had fallen his features were greatly distorted having an
expression of rage upon them that was highly disagreeable to look on
yet i had a vague feeling that i had seen him before

while i was wondering who he could be i perceived a paper clutched in
his right hand and taking it to the light the secret was at once
revealed

it was a letter from my adorable alicia to her father dated that very
evening in which she gave him to understand in the most romantic
language in the world that his opposition to her wishes in relation to
her beloved dawkins had broken her heart that she could never think
of marrying any one else as if indeed the old gentleman ever wished
her that she could not live without her dawkins and accordingly
had made up her mind to fly with him afar from parental severity
and concluded by assuring him that when he read those lines penned
by a grieved and determined but still dutifully loving heart she
said nothing of her fingers she would be in the arms of a lawful
husband there was appended a postscript in which she expressed much
contrition hoped he would forgive her and hinted that she would be of
age in two months

i looked at the old man again and wondered i had not known him before
it was old skinner sure enough and the secret of his death was
readily explained he had been sick before and this elegant epistle
had finished him or rather the necessity so romantically hinted at
in the conclusion of settling two months thereafter his guardian's
account with her husband had done his business i did not suppose the
wound in his parental feelings had done him much hurt but there was
more perhaps in that than any one would have thought that knew the
old miser

and there he lay then the owner of thousands and hundreds of
thousands with none to mourn him nay with not even a hand to smooth
the bed-robe over his neglected body he had squandered health
happiness good name and perhaps self-approbation the true riches of
man in the pursuit of the lucre which cannot purchase back again one
of these treasures and notwithstanding which lucre he was now and
indeed had been at his death-hour no better off than the beggar in his
coffin of deal he had heaped up gold for his children that they might
begrudge him the breath drawn in pain and infirmity and rejoice in the
moment of his death he had but why should i moralize over a subject
worn just as threadbare as any other the old fellow was a miser and
met the miser's fate nobody accused even his children of loving him
and while i stood by his side i had a stronger proof of their regard
than spoke in the neglected appearance of his deathbed i had scarce
entered the room before i heard from some of the apartments below the
sounds of mirth and festivity

they were not to be mistaken it was plain that some persons were
feasting and making merry in one of the old fellow's parlours and i
doubted not they were his two sons ralph and abbot both of whom had
very bad characters the latter in particular who was a notorious
profligate they were young men of promise i had heard but the
avarice of the parent had ruined them their education neglected from
indifference or a miserable spirit of parsimony their minds and
morals uncultivated the consciousness of their father's wealth and
their own golden prospects at his decease stimulated them to excesses
which were perhaps rendered still more agreeable to their imaginations
and certainly more destructive to their weal by the difficulty of
indulging in them resulting from the niggardliness of their father

but the reign of denial was now over the rattle and crash of glasses
and vessels in the room below the tumbling down of chairs and tables
with the sounds of singing shouting and laughter proclaimed with
what a lusty lyke-wake the abandoned sons were honouring the memory of
their father with what orgies of bacchus they were celebrating their
own deliverance from restraint suddenly the sound of the singing grew
louder as if some door between the revellers and the dead had been
opened and a moment after i perceived from the increase and direction
of the uproar that the sots were ascending the stairs and perhaps
approaching the chamber of death

an idea seized upon my mind i was heartily sick of mr i d dawkins's
body being ready at that moment to exchange it for a dog's and i was
incensed at the heartless and brutal rejoicings of the young skinners
it occurred to me if i could get my spirit into old goldfist's body i
should avoid all dunning for the future and give these two reprobate
sons of his such a lesson as would last them to their dying day

the idea came to me like a blaze of sunshine i remembered in a moment
the vast wealth of the deceased and i pictured to my imagination the
glorious use i should make of it i had always hated and despised the
old villain but a sudden affection for him now seized upon my soul i
had a strong persuasion in me resulting from my two former adventures
that i possessed the power of entering any human body which i found to
my liking and i resolved to exercise it or at the worst to make
proof of its existence for a third time of the manner of exercising
the power i knew but little i remembered however that on the former
occasions i had merely uttered a wish and the transformation was
instantly completed i stepped up to the body and chuckling with the
idea of chousing the unnatural sons out of their expected inheritance
i said old goldfist if you please i wish to be in your body

in less than a second of time i found myself starting up from the bed
as if i had just been roused from sleep by the noise of some falling
body and exclaiming what's that


i looked over the side of the bed and saw the body of i d dawkins
lying on the floor on its face the transformation was complete and
had been so instantaneous that my spirit heard through the organs of
its new tenement the downfall of its old i felt a little bewildered
indeed posed and remained upon my elbow staring about the room and i
may add that i was more disconcerted by the bacchanalian voices now at
the chamber door than by any thing else

the door opened and the young skinners entered i shall remember them
to my dying day they were both royally drunk and each armed with
a candle with which scattering the tallow over the floor as they
advanced they came staggering and hiccoughing into the chamber

i say bravo dad and no offence said the foremost but don't feel
so sorry as i ought and here's ralph a'n't sorry neither

led us a devilish hard life of it grumbled the other but shall
have something done for his soul by the catholics i say abby shall
buy that black horse and the buggie

and a tombstone for dad said the worthy abbot laying his candle
upon the table and striking an attitude like a dancing-master which
however he could not keep i say ralph he went on it isn't right
to say so but don't you feel good three hundred thousand apiece
dammee i say ralph let us dance

and the villains took hands and attempted a pas de deux as the
theatre people have it while the old woman who had been sleeping
below and was roused by the fall of my late body came running into
the room to see what was the matter by this time the dogs had
chasséd up so nigh to the bed that for the first time they laid
their eyes upon the reanimated countenance of their father

the effect was prodigious the moment before their faces were all
drunkenness and triumph now they were all drunkenness and horror the
light of the candle held by ralph flashed over my visage but abbot was
the first to observe me resting on my elbow and staring at him with
looks of wrath and indignation

lord love us ralph said he dad's coming to

yes you villains said i i am coming to you unnatural undutiful
rascals i have come to

they looked upon me and upon one another unutterably confounded
and i wondered myself that i did not laugh at them their confusion
however only filled me with rage and i railed at them with as much
emphasis and sincerity as if i had been their father in earnest

they dropped on their knees but their rueful appearance only added to
my fury i stormed and i scolded until being quite exhausted with the
effort a film came over my eyes and i fell back in a swoon

chapter i


the private history of abram skinner the shaver


my swoon was i believe of no great duration and i awoke from it a
new man as well as an old one

yes i was changed and with a vengeance and into such a miserable
creature that had i justly conceived what i was to become in entering
old goldfist's body i doubt whether even the extremity in which i was
placed would have forced me upon the transformation i forgot that
the title to skinner's wealth was saddled with the conditions of age
infirmity and a thousand others equally disagreeable but i soon made
the discovery though it was some time before i discovered all

the first inconvenience of the transformation which i felt was a
thousand aches in my bones a great disturbance in my inner man and
a general sense of feebleness and impotency highly vexatious and
tormenting my eyesight was bad my hearing indistinct and indeed
all my senses were more or less confused my hand trembled when i
lifted it to my face my voice quavered while i spoke and every effort
to breath seemed to fill my lungs with coal-gas and ashes in a word i
was a man of sixty years or more with a constitution just breaking up
if not already broken

my resuscitation produced a hubbub of no ordinary character my
sons for wonderful to be said i had sons and i soon felt as if
they were in reality mine were confounded and so doubtless was
barbara the housekeeper to the latter of whom it was perhaps owing
that i ever recovered from my swoon for my two boys overcome with
horror and despair rushed out of the house and it was a week before i
saw their faces again

what added to the confusion was the discovery of my late body lying
on the floor no one being at all able to account for its appearance
to this day indeed the thing remains a mystery among tailors and
shop-keepers it was pretty generally considered that the unfortunate
i d dawkins met his death by dunning and i believe the coroner's
jury returned a verdict accordingly but how he made his way into the
chamber of the usurer to give up the ghost just at the moment the
other was resuming it was never known some supposed he had visited
the old gentleman to borrow money and had knocked his head against the
bedpost in despair upon finding the lender past lending speculation
was alive upon the subject for two full days and was then buried in
the young gentleman's grave along with his body and his memory for
the memory of a dandy passeth away unless recorded on the books of his
tailor

i was confined to my bed a week suffering with a complication of
disorders for though i possessed the power to reanimate a corpse i
had none to conjure away its diseases in this period i had leisure to
exchange all previous characteristics that might have clung to me for
those that more properly belonged to my new casing and when i rose
from my bed the transformation was in every particular complete my
soul had lost its identity it had taken its shape from the mould it
occupied it was the counterpart of the soul of abram skinner

my last act as i d dawkins was to chuckle over the prospect of
spending abram skinner's money my first as abram skinner was to take
care it should be spent neither by myself nor by any one else the
desire to enjoy myself had vanished the thoughts of fine clothes
horses and carriages and so on entered my mind no more the only idea
that possessed me was what am i worth how much more can i make myself
worth and the first thing i did when i could sit in a chair was to
ransack a certain iron chest that stood under my bed containing my
prototype's books of accounts over which i gloated with the mingled
anxiety and delight that had doubtless distinguished the studies of the
true goldfist

i found myself rich beyond all my previously-formed expectations
and glum and rigid as were now all my feelings i think i should
have danced around my chamber for joy had not the first flourish
of a leg introduced me to the pangs of rheumatism i indulged my
rapture therefore in a soberer way and while awaiting the period of
emancipation from my chamber arranged a thousand plans for increasing
my wealth

my sons had deserted me but i was not left entirely to solitude
i received divers visits from old fellows like myself who after
growling out a variety of wonder and congratulation at my return to
life proceeded to counsel with me on subjects the discussion of which
speedily brought me to the knowledge of my new condition where it had
not been supplied by the iron chest and my instincts

these persons formed a confraternity of which it seems i or rather
my prototype abram skinner was a prominent member and the objects
of the association were to secure to each member the fruits of his
ambition with as little danger and trouble as possible we were a
knot of what the censorious call stock-gamblers and by working in
common and playing into each other's hands without taking pains to
acknowledge any connexion we were pretty sure of our game

it is astonishing how soon i entered into the spirit of my new
character on previous occasions the adaption of soul to body was a
work of time but here it seemed the work of but a few hours the cause
was however simple abram skinner was possessed of but one or at
most two characteristics and with these i easily became familiar the
love of money was the ruling passion and this i honestly confess
came to me so naturally that i was not conscious while giving up my
whole soul to it of any change of character whatever before i left
the house i was as busy shaving notes receiving bonds mortgages and
pledges for abram skinner was a gambler of all work and devising
schemes for cornering and blowing high and low in the stock-market
as if i had been born to the business

i found on my books the records of all imaginable operations from the
mem of a thousand shares of the moonlight manufacturing company
bought of a b on time to the entry of mrs c ds silver spoons and
pitcher purchased abram skinner scorned all dealing on pawns
that being illegal to the unlicensed at such a sum but redeemable at
such another sum which was generally at fifty per cent advance on a
certain day or forfeit here was a memorandum of a note bought at
half its value there of a mortgage taken in form of a purchase and in
other places a thousand other forfeitures such as marked the extent
and universality of business the skill the forethought and the
success of abram skinner the shaver

i have my compunctions when i think of the life i led that winter for
so long did i continue the life of a money-maker but i entreat the
reader to remember that i had got into abram skinner's body and that
the burden of my acts should be therefore laid upon his shoulders a
swearing gentleman once borrowed a quaker's great-coat with a promise
not to dishonour it by any profanity while it was on his back upon
returning it to his friend he was demanded if he had kept his promise
yes said the man of interjections with one of the most emphatic
but it has kept me lying all the time i never heard anybody doubt
that the lying was the fault of the coat and in like manner i hope
that the reader will not hesitate to attribute all my actions while in
abram skinner's body to abram skinner's body itself

besides my friends of the honest fraternity i had other visiters
before my infirmities permitted me to leave the house and the dealings
i had with them besides enabling me to get my hand in as the saying
is would afford the reader if described some insight into the
excellences of my new character

but i cannot pause over such pictures in detail the rulers then over
us to please the poor had got up a pressure in the money-market
whereby the poor were as is usual in such cases put under
contribution by the rich such a pressure however may be said to
please everybody though it puts everybody in a passion to the
rich who have money to lend it is as great a season of jubilee
as a rain-storm to ducks or a high wind to the bristly herd in an
apple-orchard and they are in a passion because they fear it will
be soon over to the poor who borrow their money at a higher rate
than usual it affords an opportunity to rail at the aristocracy and
the grinders of the poor which is a pleasing recreation after a bad
dinner at such times abram skinner was a happy man for he made money
without the trouble of stirring from his house every knock at the door
was the signal of a god-send every jerk at the bell was as the jingle
of coming dollars and cents




chapter ii


sheppard lee's first hit at money-making


it was at such a season that i entered the shaver's body the knocks
at my door were frequent and the demands of my visiters to be
brought into presence irresistible what cared they for my pains and
sickness they wanted money what cared i for my pains and sickness
 i was anxious to make it i ordered my house-keeper barbara for
it seems i was such a niggard i had no other servant to admit all
well-dressed applicants for i scorned to deal with any other

the first person admitted was a woman very good looking but advanced
in years she kept a boarding-house but as barbara informed me
had seen better days having been the wife of a rich merchant who
failed was absurd enough to keep his books so straight as to allow no
opportunity for defrauding his creditors surrendered up every cent
of his property and died a beggar leaving a widow and six orphan
daughters to lament his honesty

she was in some little flurry and perturbation of spirits but i spoke
with a blandness that astonished myself until i found that this was
always my practice with a customer whom i was not tired of this
restored her to confidence and garrulity

her tale was soon told her boarders were all very fine gentlemen
and ladies and good pay but the times were so hard they were just
at this moment compelled to pay with promises with which coin her
landlord was not so easily satisfied she would not distress poor mr
g who owed her a hundred and fifty dollars nor mr h nor mrs i
who were all in a peck of trouble just then but were well enough to do
in the world no not she she had heard i was so good as often to lend
to people who wanted money for a few days even when the banks would
not provided they were good and safe and who was better and safer
than she with all her troubles and the lord he knew they were many
and enough she had always paid her debts and she defied anybody to
say the contrary and so she hoped i would be so good as to oblige her
with the small sum of two hundred-dollars which upon her honest word
she would pay as soon as she had the money

to this eloquent suggestion i answered and i doubt if the true abram
skinner could have answered better by lamenting her difficulties and
assuring her i was in as great trouble as herself not having a cent at
command that i could call my own the iron chest told another story
and there were divers handsome hundreds placed to my credit in three
or four different banks nevertheless i had a little money belonging
to a friend which i thought i might make so free as to lend to one of
her excellent character and standing but that would be taking a great
responsibility on my shoulders c c in terms which the reader can
easily imagine and i concluded by hinting that if she had any plate
or other valuables to deposite as a security it would save her the
trouble of giving her note and the inconvenience such an instrument
might prove to her if my friend's necessities should compel him to
throw it into the market

the widow delighted with my frankness and penetrated by my
friendliness ran home and returned with a basket of chattels to the
value of perhaps three hundred and fifty dollars

very good said i you shall have the money though i should have to
pay for it myself

sure said she but you are a good obliging man and i shall be much
beholden and sure but i thought all pawnbrokers had golden balls at
their doors

madam said i thank your good fortune that i am not a pawnbroker
had you gone to such a person you would have paid dear for your money
and perhaps lost your silver into the bargain now supposing this
silver to be worth three hundred dollars 

three hundred lack-a-daisies said the old lady why it cost more
than four hundred dollars for i remember the coffee-pot 

yes ma'am said i that was the cost of making i reckon the silver
at about three hundred dollars though that is a large allowance now
had you taken this to a pawnbroker what do you think he would have
loaned you on it

to be sure and i suppose but i can't say

one hundred dollars perhaps if a moderate fellow said i but i
am another sort of man i scorn to take any advantage of any one yes
said i feeling warm and virtuous i scorn them there fellows that
take advantage and grind down the poor to the last mite i mrs 
hum ha mrs 

mrs smith said the old lady eying me with admiration

i mrs smith will treat you in another way i will let you have
what you want the full two hundred dollars for the space of thirty
days and charge you but twenty-five dollars for the favour

sure said mrs smith and that's dear

on the contrary madam said i it is but twelve and a half per
cent a month whereas money will often fetch fifteen

will it indeed said the foolish widow and sure but you must
know better than myself well then mr skinner let me have the two
hundred dollars and you shall have the plate in pawn

no ma'am said i none but a pawnbroker can do that a gentleman
like myself does this sort of thing in another manner for were i to
receive this silver as a pawn you might prosecute me for it in court
and make me pay a fine the way we do is this i buy the plate of
you for two hundred dollars taking a receipt from you for that
amount and granting you on my part a written permission to purchase
the same back again this day month for the sum of two hundred and
twenty-five dollars

la said the old lady is that the way but what if i should not get
the money in a month

why then said i with a look of benevolence why then i think i
must give you a month longer

sure and you are the best man in the world said mrs smith and you
think my silver won't be in no danger and you'll lock it up in some
big iron chest for thieves are quite thick already and your paper to
buy again will be just as good as a pawnbroker's certificate

i hastened to satisfy the old lady's mind on this and all other
subjects i then wrote out a receipt which i caused her to subscribe
being a due acknowledgment on her part of having sold me certain
specified articles of plate after which i delivered her a paper
in which without troubling myself to make any reference to the
conveyance i covenanted to sell her the same articles at the price
mentioned before at the expiration of thirty days

with this and the two hundred dollars which i now gave her the foolish
woman departed very well satisfied and as for me i actually rubbed my
hands together with the delight of having made such a good bargain i
say again old skinner himself could not have managed the affair with
greater address than myself and young as i was in his body i felt as
much satisfaction at having overreached a silly old woman as ever a
less avaricious man felt at deluding a young one this was small game
to be sure for a man who dabbled in stocks and counted profits not
by dollars but by hundreds and thousands but as i said before abram
skinner was a man of all work who thought no gain small enough to be
despised and who cheated a single tatterdemalion with as much zeal as
he would fleece a community

the end of the bargain was this in a month's time mrs smith called
on me again but without money whereupon i spoke to her with greater
benevolence than before assured her she need not be distressed
and renewed the engagement between us by adding twenty-five dollars
the interest upon the money advanced to the sums specified in
the conveyance and covenant and the same amount i added at the
expiration of the second month and this course i intended to pursue
for two months more until the amount of interest should swell the
purchase-money to three hundred dollars after which i designed to
close the bargain and consider the silver fairly purchased

if anybody supposes i treated the old woman ill that i acted
dishonestly and even illegally in the matter all i have to say is
that i only did what abram skinner the shaver had done a thousand times
before me and what i have no doubt other worthy gentlemen of his
tribe have done after me he who rides with the devil must put up with
his driving and he who deals with his nephews must look for something
warmer than burnt fingers

the transaction with mrs smith was a sample of divers others begun
and conducted on the same principles though involving more momentous
profits the system of forfeitures as practised by a skilful hand
is applicable to all species of property and i practised it with
great effect in the case of houses and lands and the lord knows what
besides the pressure continued long and i think i should have made
a handsome fortune in the course of the winter out of this single
branch of my business alone had not destiny arrested me in the midst
of a prosperous career and left the business to be settled by my
administrators




chapter iii


reflections on stock-jobbing and other matters


but this was but a branch and a small one of my profession my
noblest blows were struck at the community at large and struck
in that most magnificent of gambling-fields the stock-market my
skill here for i inherited all the sagacity and daring that had
distinguished the original owner of my body was such as to keep me at
the head of that confraternity of which i have spoken before i was the
very devil among the fancy stocks and had the good luck to originate
and conduct a stroke of cornering by which no less than twenty young
shop-keepers who were ambitious to be seen on change and in brokers
offices and to dare that achievement of audacity selling on time
were smashed like coal-candlesticks and half as many wiser and richer
desperadoes were driven to the verge of ruin

my chief strength indeed was shown in the management of small stocks
and especially those that were good for nothing and more especially
still in southern mining-companies it was here that we of the clipping
club as the members of the fraternity delighted to call themselves
found our fairest opportunity to prey upon those passions of cupidity
and terror which lay the ignorant at the mercy of the knowing no one
knew better than myself how to get up or depress such a stock i knew
how many ignorant widows poor parsons infirm artisans and other
needy persons were to be cajoled by the prospect of handsome and
increasing dividends to invest their petty savings when it could be
done at small premiums and i knew how easily the terror of loss could
drive them out of their investments to say the truth the principal
business of myself and my brother clippers was to bob for such minnows
and it is incredible how they bite though it is only to be bitten a
few words scattered at random and still fewer uttered in confidence
were enough to send shoals of these unlucky creatures to swallow what
we thought proper to sell and a few doubts and long faces added to
the throwing away at low prices of a few dozen shares sufficed to
convert the trembling holders into sellers whenever we deemed it
advisable to buy in this way i have known a pet stock to be tossed
up and down like a ball while every ascent and downfall served the
purpose of filling the pockets of the fraternity and emptying those of
the victims

in such occupations as these passed three months of my existence
and sinner that i am i thought that they passed very honestly the
spirit of abram skinner had left such a taint of rascality in his
body that my own was thoroughly imbued with it from which i infer
that a man's body is like a barrel which if you salt fish in it
once will make fish of every thing you put into it afterward a grain
of lying or thieving or any such spicy propensity infused into the
youthful breast by a tender parent will give a scent to the spirit
for life and as this is a fact i recommend parents to take no notice
of it not supposing parents will take advice except by contraries
the passion of abram skinner destroyed every trait that had belonged
to sheppard lee and as for those i had taken from john h higginson
and i d dawkins they were lost in like manner i was abram skinner
and nothing but abram skinner i scarce remembered that i had ever been
any thing else i am free now to confess what i was not so certain of
then though i had my doubts on the matter at times namely that in
labouring so hard after lucre i was only striving to sell my soul to
the greatest advantage

idleness is said to be the root of all evil the root of much evil i
never doubted it was but my experience in the body of abram skinner
has convinced me that the industry to which a man is goaded by the
love of money is the root of much greater evil of a bigger upas
indeed than ever sprung from the bed of the sluggard the idler may
betake him to the bottle as the idler usually does and then lapse
into a reprobate which is a common consequence but at the worst his
crimes are committed at the expense of individuals the man of avarice
drinks out of his purse which intoxicates quite as deeply as the
bowl makes war upon communities preys legally upon his neighbour's
pocket and just as legally consigns his neighbour's children to want
and beggary from which it appears that he is a drunkard thief and
murderer just as naturally as the idler the latter by indulging his
propensity loses his character the former by indulging his loses
all those generous sentiments and feelings the sense of honour and
instinct of integrity upon which character should be founded the man
who enriches himself by extracting wealth from the soil and the bowels
of the earth or by the practice of any art or business which supplies
the necessaries of life or ministers to the convenience of society
makes his money virtuously and deserves to enjoy it in honour but he
who gains a fortune by the mere gambling legerdemain of speculation
by turning his neighbour's pockets wrong side out is not so much
of a christian as he supposes my honest opinion formed after much
reflection and experience is that bulls and bears are as little
likely to go to heaven as any other animals

in regard to myself i am as free to confess that my course of life
while in abram skinner's body was deserving of all reprobation i hope
that the acts i then committed may be laid to old skinner's door but
for fear of a mistake i have endeavoured to repent them as being sins
of my own committing and this course i recommend to all those good
folks who are persuaded their peccadilloes are the fault of others and
for the same reason namely lest they should be mistaken i confess
also that i had my doubts even at the time of committing them of the
righteousness of my acts and that i sometimes had bad dreams but the
fury of avarice stilled the pangs of conscience as the fury of wrath
and battle stills those of the wounded soldier having made these
admissions i will now betake me to my story

 chapter iv

the miser's children


it will scarcely be supposed that with the passion of covetousness
gnawing at my heart i had space or convenience for any other feeling
but abram skinner had loved his children and to this passion i was
introduced as well as to the other at first i was surprised that i
should bestow the least regard upon them seeing that they were no
children of mine i endeavoured to shake off the feeling of attachment
as an absurdity but could not in spite of myself i found my spirit
yearning towards them and by-and-by having lost my identity entirely
i could scarcely even when i made the effort recall the consciousness
that i was not their parent in reality

indeed the transformation that had now occurred to my spirit was more
thorough than it had been in either previous instance i could scarce
convince myself i had not been born the being i represented my past
existence began to appear to my reflections only as some idle dream
that the fever of sickness had brought upon my mind and i forgot that
i was or had been sheppard lee

yes reader i was now abram skinner in all respects and i loved his
children as he had done before me in entering his body i became as
i have mentioned repeatedly before the subject of every peculiarity of
being that marked the original possessor without which indeed the
great experiment my destiny permitted me to make of the comparative
good and evil of different spheres of existence must have been made
in vain what my prototype hated i was enforced to hate what he loved
i found myself compelled in like manner to love while moving in the
bodies of john h higginson and i d dawkins i do not remember that
i experienced any affection for anybody which happened doubtless
because these individuals confined their affections to their own
persons abram skinner on the contrary loved his children which i
suppose was owing to their being the worst children that ever tormented
a parent he loved them and so did i he pondered with bitterness over
the ingratitude of their tempers and the profligacy of their lives
and i despite all my attempts to the contrary did the same i forgot
at last that i was not their parent and my feelings showed me that i
was and i found in the anguish that attacked my spirit when i thought
of them one of the modes in which heaven visits with retribution the
worshipper of the false god of the country when the votary of mammon
has propitiated his deity let him count the children he has sacrificed
upon his altar avarice as well as wrath sows the storm only to reap
the whirlwind

i am growing serious upon this subject but i cannot help it this
portion of my history dwells on my remembrance with gloom it keeps me
moralizing over the career of my neighbours when i see or hear of a
man who is bending all his energies to the acquisition of a fortune
and is already the master of his thousands i ask what has become of
his sons or what will become of them

with the affection for the children of abram skinner that took
possession of my mind came also a persuasion exceedingly painful
that they were a triad of graceless ungrateful reprobates and what
was worse there was something whispered within me that much if not
all the evil of their lives and natures was owing to the neglect in
which their parent while engrossed with the high thought of heaping up
money had allowed them to grow up the consequences of this neglect i
felt as if it had been my own act

the first pang was inflicted by the girl alicia and i felt it
keenly not indeed that i had any particular parental affection
for her as doubtless i should have had had she not run away so
opportunely on the contrary a vague recollection of my amour and
the inconstancy of her temper caused my feelings in relation to her
to assume a very peculiar hue so that i regarded her with sentiments
due as much to the jilted lover as the injured father but what
chiefly afflicted me was the hint she had given in the postscript of
her letter warning me of the fatal call to be made upon me within
two months space to render up an account of my guardianship and
surrender into the hands of that detestable sammy wilkins my late
cousin the rich legacy of her aunt sally which being chiefly in real
estate i or rather my prototype before me had without anticipating
such a catastrophe managed so prudently that it was now worth more
than double its original value the thought filled me with such rage
and phrensy that had she been twice my daughter i should have
rewarded her with execrations

my quondam uncle mr samuel wilkins of wilkinsbury hall who it
seems received the girl as well as he afterward did his daughter's
husband thought fit to pay me a visit a week after my transformation
to confer with me on the subject and receiving no satisfaction for i
was in a rage and refused to see him sent me divers notes proposing a
reconciliation betwixt myself and his daughter-in-law and these being
cast into the fire i received in course of time a letter from his
lawyer or his son sammy's in which i was politely asked what were my
intentions in relation to settlement and so forth and so forth

i received letters from the damsel also but they went into the fire
like the others and my rage waxing higher and higher as the time of
settlement drew nigh i set myself to work to frame such a guardian's
account as would materially lessen the amount of my losses

but all was in vain the married alicia was at last of age and all i
could do was to fling the matter into the lawyers hands so as to keep
the money the dear money in my own as long as possible

my reader may think this was not a very handsome or reputable way of
treating a daughter but he must recollect i was in abram skinner's
body the matter was still in suit when i departed from my borrowed
flesh but i have no doubt the execrable samuel wilkins jr got
possession of the legacy as well as ten times as much to the back of
it

but this great as was the anguish the evil inflicted was nothing
to the pangs i suffered on account of the two boys ralph and abbot
on these i showered not openly indeed for i was crabbed enough of
temper but in my secret heart all the affection such a parent could
feel but i showered it in vain the seeds of evil example and neglect
had taken root the prospect of wealth had long since turned brains
untempered by education and moral culture and the parsimony of their
parent only drove them into profligacy of a more demoralizing species
they were ruined in morals in prospects and in reputation and while
yet upon the threshold of manhood they presented upon their brows the
stamp of degradation and the warrant of untimely graves

the younger abbot had evidently been a favourite from his childhood
up his temper being fierce and imperious yet with an occasional dash
of amiableness that showed what his disposition might have been if
regulated by a careful and conscientious parent he possessed a fine
figure of which he was vain and being of a gay and convivial turn
there was the stronger propensity to dissipation and greater fear of
the consequences these were now lamentable enough he was already
beyond redemption a sot and almost a madman

the elder brother was a young man to all appearance of a saturnine
mood and staid habits but this was in appearance only he was the
associate of the junior in all his scenes of frolic and an actor in
others of which perhaps abbot never dreamed a strong head and a
spirit of craft enabled him to conceal the effect of excesses which
sent his brother home reeling and raging with drunkenness i knew his
habits well and i knew that besides being in a fairer way to the
grave if not to the gallows he was a hypocrite of the worst order
his gravity being put on to cover a temper both fiery and malicious
and his apparent correctness of habits being the mere cover to the most
scandalous irregularities he was a creature all of duplicity and wo
to the father who made him such

the scene in the dying chamber of their father they never forgot
though perhaps i might have done so it drove the younger from all
attempts at pretended regard or concealment of his profligacy and
was i believe the cause of his final ruin he absconded out of mere
shame for a week and then returned to put a bold or indifferent
face upon the matter and to show himself as regardless of respect as
restraint

the other after concealing himself in like manner for a few days came
to me apparently in great contrition of spirit and almost persuaded
me that his brutal conduct on that eventful evening arose rather from
grief than joy he had been so much affected by my death he assured
me as scarce to know what he did when swallowing a glass of brandy
his brother gave him that he declared with half a dozen tears had
set him crazy and he knew not what he had done only he recollected
something about going to the chamber where he believed he had
behaved very badly for which he begged my forgiveness and hoped i
would not think his conduct was owing to any want of affection

i had proof enough that the villain was telling me falsehoods and i
knew that if either should in a moment of soberness and compunction
breathe a single sigh over my death-bed he was not the one in
truth they were both bad both perhaps irreclaimable but while
the conduct of abbot gave me most pain that of ralph filled me with
constant terror nothing but the daily excitement of speculation and
gain could have made tolerable an existence cursed by incessant griefs
and forebodings it may be supposed that i frequently took the young
men to task for their excesses i might as well have scolded the winds
for blowing or the waters for running it is true that ralph heard me
commonly with great patience and sometimes with apparent contrition
but at times a scowl came over his dark features that frightened me
into silence and once giving way to his fierce temper he told me
that if there was any thing amiss or disreputable in his conduct it
was the consequence of mine that i instead of granting him the means
for reasonable indulgence and elevating him to the station among
honourable and worthy men to which my wealth gave him a claim and
which he had a right to expect of me had kept him in a state of need
and vassalage intolerable to any one of his age and spirit

as for abbot this kind of recrimination was a daily thing with him
i scarce ever saw him except when inflamed with drink and on such
occasions he was wont to demand money which being denied he would
give way to passion and load me with reproaches still more bitter of
spirit and violent of expression than those uttered by ralph nay upon
my charging him with being an abandoned profligate and ruined man he
admitted the fact and swore that i was the author of his destruction
that my niggardliness had deprived him of the opportunities that gave
other young men professions and independence that i had brought him up
in idleness and ignorance and by still refusing him his rights was
consigning him to infamy and an early grave

such controversies between us were common and perhaps expedited the
fate that was in store for him as well as his brother i thought in my
folly to punish and at the same time check his excesses by denying
him all supplies of money and by refusing to pay a single debt he
contracted a deep gloom suddenly invested him he ceased to return
home intoxicated but stalked into and out of the house like a spectre
without bestowing any notice upon me the change frighted me and in
alarm lest the difficulties under which he might be placed were driving
him to desperation i followed him to his chamber with almost the
resolution to relieve his wants let them be what they might

the absence of intoxication for several days in succession had induced
me to hope he had broken through the accursed bondage of drink were it
only from rage and shame but i was fatally mistaken as i entered the
apartment i saw him place upon the table a large case-bottle of brandy
which he had just taken from a buffet he looked over his shoulder as
i stepped in and without regarding me proceeded to pour a large
draught into a tumbler his hand was tremulous and indeed shook so
much that the liquor was spilt in the operation

i was shocked at the sight and struck dumb seeing which he laughed
with what seemed to me as much triumph as derision and said you see
this is the way we go it your health father come help yourself
don't stand on ceremony

i abbot said i as he swallowed the vile potion have you
neither respect nor shame i never drank such poison in my life

the more is the pity muttered the young man but rather as if
speaking to himself than me i should have had the sooner and freer
swing of it

you mean if it had killed me as it is killing you said i pierced
by the heartlessness of his expression oh abbot a judgment will
come upon you yet

he stared me in the face but without making a reply then pushing a
chair towards me he sat down himself and deliberately filled his
glass a second time

abbot for heaven's sake said i wringing my very hands in despair
what will tempt you to quit this horrid practice

nothing said he you have asked the question a month too late
look he continued pointing my attention again to his hand shaking
as it held the bottle as if under the palsy of age do you know what
that means

what does it mean said i so confounded by the sight and his stolid
merriment for he laughed again while exposing the fruit of his
degrading habit that i scarce knew what i said

it means said he that death is coming to make equitable division
betwixt ralph and alicia unless the devil after all should carry
them off before me in which case you can build an hospital with your
money

he swallowed the draught and then leaning on the table buried his
face between his hands

the sarcasm was not lost upon me and the idea that he was about to
become the victim of a passion from which he might be wrested by a
sacrifice on my part greatly excited my feelings

i will do any thing said i what shall i do to save you oh
abbot can you not refrain from this dreadful indulgence what shall i
do

he leaped upon his feet and eyed me with a look full of wildness

pay my debts he cried pay my debts and make me independent and
i i'll try

and what said i trembling with fear what sum will pay your debts

twenty thousand perhaps said he

twenty thousand what twenty thousand dollars cried i lost in
confusion

you won't then said the reprobate

not a cent cried i in a fury how came you to owe such a sum do
you think i will believe you how could you incur such a debt what
have you been doing

gambling drinking and so forth and so forth twenty times over

he snatched up the bottle and locking it in the buffet deposited the
key in his pocket then seizing upon his hat and stepping to where i
stood transfixed with grief and indignation he said you won't
take the bargain then

not a dollar not a dime not a cent said i

not even to save my life father

not a dollar not a dime not a cent i reiterated incapable of
saying another word

farewell then said he and good luck to you it is a declaration of
war and now i'll keep no terms with you

then giving me a look that froze my blood it was so furiously hostile
and vindictive he struck his hands together rushed from the house
and i saw him no more for nearly a fortnight i saw him no more as i
said but coming home the following evening from the club i found my
strong-box broken open and rifled of the money that i left in it

the sum was indeed but small but the robbery had been perpetrated by
my own son and the reader if he be a father will judge what effect
this discovery produced upon my mind in good truth i felt now that
i was the most wretched of human beings and was reduced nearly to
distraction

but this blow was but a buffet with the hand compared with the
thunder-bolt that fate was preparing to launch against my bosom i
cursed my miserable lot yet it wanted one more stroke of misfortune to
sever the chain with which avarice still bound me to my condition




 chapter v


the fate of the firstborn


on the eleventh day after the flight of abbot whom all my inquiries
failed to discover as i was walking towards the exchange torn by
my domestic woes and by a threatened convulsion in stocks which
concerned me very nearly i met one of my companions of the club who
noting my disturbed countenance drew me aside and told me he was
sorry i had got my foot into the fire but the club had last night
taken the matter into consideration and agreed to stand by me if it
were possible

all this was heathen greek to me and i told my friend i was in no
trouble i knew of and wanted no countenance from anybody

i am very glad to hear it said he but what are you doing with so
much paper in the market that's no good sign you'll allow

i started aghast and he proceeded to inform me that he had himself
seen two of my notes for considerable amounts and had heard of others
and finally that he had just parted with the president an intimate
friend of his of a bank not a furlong off who had asked divers
questions as to the state of my affairs and admitted there was paper
of mine at that moment in the bank

i was seized with consternation assured him all such notes must be
forgeries and running with him to the bank demanded to see any paper
they had with my name to it they produced two different notes for
large amounts which i instantly declared to be counterfeit and then
ran in search of others

the hubbub created by this declaration was great but the tumult in my
mind was greater a horrid suspicion as to the author of the forgeries
entered my soul and i became so deadly sick as to be unable to
prosecute the inquisition further my friend deposited me in a coach
and i was carried to my home but in a condition more dead than alive
my suspicions were in a few hours dreadfully confirmed by my friend
who returned with the intelligence which he had acquired the forger
was discovered and arrested it was the elder brother ralph skinner

words cannot paint the agony with which i flew to the magistrate's
office and beheld the unfortunate youth in the hands of justice
but what was my horror to discover the extent and multiplicity of
his frauds the number of forgeries he had committed in his parent's
name was indeed enormous and it seems he had committed them with the
intention of flying for many of his guilty gains were found secreted
on his person but even after so much had been recovered the residue
to be refunded was appalling the thought of making restitution drove
me almost to a phrensy while the idea of seeing him carried to jail
to meet the doom of a felon was equally distracting my misery was
read on my face and some one present perhaps with a motive of
humanity cried out

why persecute the young man here is his father who acknowledges the
notes to be genuine

ah said the magistrate does he so why then we have had much
foolish trouble for nothing

i looked at the amount of the forgeries a list of which some one put
into my hands

it is false i cried i will not pay a cent

i cast my eyes upon ralph he reached over a table behind which he
stood and waved his hand to and fro as if had he been nigh enough
he would have buffeted me on the face his look was that of a demon
and he spat the foam from his lips as if to testify the extremity of
hatred

let him go i cried i will pay it all

you can undoubtedly do so if you will said the magistrate who had
marked the malice that beamed from the visage of the young man but do
not dream that that will discharge the prisoner from arrest or from
the necessity of answering the felony of which he now stands accused
before a court and jury the extent of the forgeries and the temper
displayed by the accused are such that he must and shall abide the
fruits of his delinquency he stands committed officer remove him

i heard no more my brain spun round and round and i was again carried
insensible to my miserable dwelling




 chapter vi


the catastrophe of a tragedy often performed on the great stage of life


it may be supposed that the misery now weighing me to the earth was
as much as could be imposed upon me but i was destined to find and
that before the night was over that misery is only comparative and
that there is no affliction so positively great that greater may not
be experienced in the dead of the night when my woes had at last
been drowned in slumber i was roused by feeling a hand pressing upon
my bosom and starting up i saw for there was a taper burning on a
table hard by a man standing over me holding a pillow in his hand
which the moment i caught sight of him he thrust into my face and
there endeavoured to hold it as if to suffocate me

the horror of death endowed me with a strength not my own and the
ruffian held the pillow with a feeble and trembling arm i dashed it
aside leaped up in the bed and beheld in the countenance of the
murderer the features of the long missing and abandoned son abbot
skinner

his face was white and chalky with livid stains around the eyes and
mouth the former of which were staring out of their orbits in a manner
ghastly to behold while his lips were drawn asunder and away from his
teeth as in the face of a mummy he looked as if horror-struck at
the act he was attempting and yet there was something devilish and
determined in his air that increased my terror to ecstasy i sprang
from the bed threw myself on the floor and grasping his knees
besought him to spare my life there seemed indeed occasion for all my
supplications his bloated and altered visage the neglected appearance
of his garments and person and a thousand other signs showed that the
whole period of his absence had been passed in excessive toping and
the murderous and unnatural act which he meditated manifested to what a
pitch of phrensy he had brought himself by the indulgence as i grasped
his knees he put his hand into his bosom and drew out a poniard a
weapon i had never before known him to carry at the sight of which i
considered myself a dead man but the love of life still prevailing i
leaped up and ran to a corner of the room where i mingled adjurations
and entreaties with loud screams for assistance he stood as if rooted
to the spot for a moment then dropping his horrid weapon he advanced
a few paces clasped his hands together fell upon his knees and burst
into tears and all the while without having uttered a single word but
now my cries still continuing he exclaimed but with a most wild and
disturbed look father i won't hurt you and pray don't hurt me

by this time the housekeeper barbara having been alarmed by my
outcries came into the chamber and her presence relieving me of the
immediate fear of death i gave vent to the horror that his unnatural
attempt on my life justly excited and thus made the woman acquainted
with his baseness

the poor old creature who had always loved him was greatly affected
especially when in reply to my reproaches he began to talk
incoherently admitting the fact one instant attempting to justify
it by preferring some strange and incoherent complaint and the next
assuring me in the most piteous manner that he would do me no harm
to barbara's upbraidings he replied with a like inconsistency and when
she reproached him for meditating violence at such a moment while i
was mourning the baseness of his brother he paid little attention to
what she said seeming not only ignorant of ralph's delinquency but
apparently indifferent to it

for this reason i began to fear his brain was touched of which
indeed i had soon the most fatal proof for barbara having led him
to his chamber came back assuring me that he was going mad that
his mind was already in a ferment and in a word that that horrible
distraction which sooner or later overtakes the confirmed drinker
was lighting the torch in his brain that could only go out with life
itself a physician was sent for our fears were but too just and
before dawn the miserable youth was raving distracted

the day that followed was one of distraction not only to the wretched
abbot but to myself and i remember it as a confused dream the
only thing that dwells on my recollection apart from the outcries
in abbot's chamber and the tumult in my own heart is that some one
who owed me a sum of money due that day came and paid it into my
hands with great punctiliousness and that i received and wrote the
acquittance for it with as much accuracy as if nothing were the matter
though my thoughts were far from the subject before me

at eleven o'clock at night a messenger came to me from the prison
and his news was indeed frightful the wretched ralph had just been
discovered with his throat cut from ear to ear having made way with
himself in despair

a few moments after i was summoned to the death-bed of his brother

i shall never forget the horror of that young man's dissolution he
lay at times the picture of terror gazing upon the walls along
which in his imagination crept myriads of loathsome reptiles with
now some frightful monster and now a fire-lipped demon stealing out
of the shadows and preparing to dart upon him as their prey now he
would whine and weep as if asking forgiveness for some act of wrong
done to the being man is most constant to wrong the loving the
feeble the confiding and anon seized by a tempest of passion the
cause of which could only be imagined he would start up fight foam
at the mouth and fall back in convulsions once he sat up in bed and
looking like a corpse began to sing a bacchanalian song on another
occasion after lying for many minutes in apparent stupefaction he
leaped out of bed before he could be prevented and uttering a yell
that was heard in the street endeavoured to throw himself from the
window

but the last raving act of all was the most horrid he rose upon his
knees with a strength that could not be resisted caught up his pillow
thrust it down upon the bed with both hands and there held it with
a grim countenance and a chuckling laugh none understood the act but
myself no other could read the devilish thoughts then at work in his
bosom it was the scene enacted in the chamber of his parent he was
repeating the deed of murder he was exulting in imagination over a
successful parricide

in this thought he expired for while still pressing upon the pillow
with a giant's strength he suddenly fell on his face and when turned
over was a corpse he gave but a single gasp and was no more

the horror of the spectacle drove me from the chamber and i ran to
my own to fall down and die when the blessed thought entered my
mind that the wo on my spirit the anguish the distraction were
but a dream that my very existence as the miser and broken-hearted
father was a phantasm rather than a reality since it was a borrowed
existence and that it was in my power to exchange it as i had done
other modes of being for a better i was sheppard lee not abram
skinner and this was but a voluntary episode in my existence which i
was at liberty to terminate

the thought was rapture i resolved to sally out and fasten upon the
first body i could find being certain i could be in none so miserable
as i had been in that i now inhabited nay the idea was so agreeable
the execution of it seemed to promise such certain release from a load
of wretchedness that i resolved to attempt it without even waiting for
morning

i seized upon my hat and cloak and for fear i might stumble into some
poor man's body as i had done in the case of dawkins's i opened my
strong-box and clapped into my pockets all the money it contained
designing to take precautionary measures to transfer it along with my
spirit to the new tenement i seized upon the loaned money that had
been repaid that day together with a small sum that had been in the
box before and had there been a million in the coffer i should have
nabbed it all without much question of the right i actually possessed
in it the whole sum was small not exceeding four hundred dollars all
being in bank-bills i should have been glad of more but was too eager
to exchange my vile casing with its miseries for a better to think
of waiting till bank-hours next day

taking possession therefore of this sum and a dozen silver spoons
that had been left in pledge a few days before i hastened to put my
plan into execution i slipped down stairs let myself out of the door
as softly as if i had been an intruder and set out in a night of
february to search for a new body




 chapter vii


in which it is shown that a man may be more useful after death than
while living



the reflection that i possessed the power already thrice successfully
exercised to transfer my spirit whenever i willed it from one
man's body to another and so get rid of any afflictions that might
beset me was highly agreeable and under the present circumstances
consolatory but there was one drawback to my satisfaction and that
was a discovery which i now made that men's bodies were not to be
had every day at a moment's warning this was the more provoking
as i knew there was no lack of them in the world between eighty and
ninety thousand men women and children having given up the ghost in
the natural way that very day whose corses would be on the morrow
consigned to miserable holes in the earth where they could and would
be of no service to any person or persons whatever the young doctors
only excepted

and here i cannot help observing that it is an extremely absurd
practice thus to dispose of to squander and throw away as i may call
it the hosts of human bodies that are annually falling dead upon our
hands whereas with the least management in the world they might be
converted into objects of great usefulness and value

according to the computation of philosophers the population of the
world may be reckoned in round numbers at just one thousand millions
of which number the annual mortality at the low rate of three in
a hundred is thirty millions and that without counting the extra
million or two knocked on the head in the wars let us see what benefit
might be derived from a judicious disposition of this mountain of
mortality i say mountain for it is plain such a number of bodies
heaped together would make a chimborazo the great mass of mankind
might be made to subserve the purpose for which nature designed them
namely to enrich the soil from which they draw their sustenance
according to the economical chinese method each of these bodies could
be converted into five tons of excellent manure and the whole number
would therefore produce just one hundred and fifty millions of tons
of which one hundred and fifty thousand being their due proportion
would fall to the share of the united states of america enabling
our farmers in the course of ten or twelve years to double the
value of their lands this therefore would be a highly profitable
way of disposing of the mass of mankind such a disposition of their
bodies would prove especially advantageous among american cultivators
in divers districts as a remedy against bad agriculture and as
the only means of handing down their fields in good order to their
descendants such a disposition of bodies should be made upon every
field of victory so that dead heroes might be made to repair some
of the mischiefs inflicted by live ones the english farmers it is
well known made good use of the bones left on the field of waterloo
and though they would have done much better had they carried off the
flesh with them they did enough to show that war may be reckoned a
good as well as an evil and a great battle looked upon as a public
blessing a similar disposition to continue the subject of their
mortal flesh might be with great propriety required in this land
of all politicians and office-holders from the vice-president down to
the county collector who being all patriots would doubtless consent
to a measure that would make them of some use to their country as for
the president we would have him reserved for a nobler purpose we
would have him boiled down to soap according to the plan recommended
by the french chymists to be used by his successor in scouring the
constitution and the minds of the people

in this manner i repeat the great bulk of human bodies could be
profitably appropriated but other methods should be taken with
particular classes of men who might claim a more distinguished and
canonical disposition of their bodies the rich and tender would esteem
it a cruelty to be disposed of in the same way with the multitude i
would advise therefore that their bodies should be converted into
adipocire or spermaceti to be made into candles to be burnt at the
tops of the lamp-posts whereby those who never shone in life might
scintillate as the lights of the public for a week or two after their
bones might be made into rings and whistles for infant democrats to
cut their teeth on

the french and italian philosophers as i have learned from the
newspapers have made sundry strange and as i think useful
discoveries in relation to the practicability of converting the human
body into different mineral substances one man changes his neighbour's
bones into fine glass a second turns the blood into iron while a
third more successful still transforms the whole body into stone if
these things be true and i have no reason to doubt them seeing that
i found them as i said before in the newspapers they offer us new
modes of appropriation applicable to the bodies of other interesting
classes lovers might thus be converted into jewels which although
false could be worn with less fear of losing them than happens with
living inamoratos or in case of extreme grief on the part of the
survivers into looking-glasses where the mourners would find a solace
in the contemplation of their own features the second process namely
the conversion of blood into iron would be peculiarly applicable in
the case of soldiers too distinguished to be cast into corn-fields
and indeed nothing could be more natural than that those whose blood
we buy with gold should pay us back our change in iron the last
discovery could be turned to equal profit and would do away with the
necessity of employing statuaries in all cases where their services are
now required but i would confine the process of petrifaction to those
in whom nature had indicated its propriety by beginning the process
herself none could with greater justice claim to have their bodies
turned into stone than those whose hearts were of the same material
and i should propose accordingly that such a transformation of bodies
should be made only in the case of tyrants heroes duns and critics

but this subject though often reflected on i have had no leisure to
digest properly for which reason begging the reader's pardon for the
digression i shall now leave it and resume my story




 chapter viii


sheppard lee's search for a body an uncommon incident


i was provoked i say to think there were so many millions of dead
bodies thrown away every year for which i in the greatest of my
difficulties should be none the better such was the extremity
to which i was reduced that i should have been content to change
conditions with a beggar

it was a night in february the day had been uncommonly fine with a
soft southern air puffing through the streets the frost was oozing
from the pavement and the flags i beg their pardon the bricks were
floating in the yellow mud so that one walked as if upon a foundation
of puddings such had been the state of things in the day such also as
late as at nine o'clock p m

but it was now eleven the wind had chopped round to the northwest and
northeast and perhaps some half a dozen other points beside for it
seemed to blow in all directions and the thermometer was galloping
downward towards zero a savage snow-storm had just set in and with
such sharp and piercing gusts of wind and such fierce rattling of
hail that had not my mind been in a ferment i should have hesitated
to expose myself to its fury but i reflected that i was flying from wo
and terror and the hope of diving into some body that might introduce
me to a life of sunshine rendered me insensible to the rigours of the
tempest

having stumbled about in the snow for a while i began to inquire of
myself whither i was going and the answer or rather the want of an
answer somewhat confounded me where was i to look for a dead body
at such a time of night it occurred to me i had better refer to a
newspaper and see what persons had lately died in town and were yet
unburied i stepped accordingly into a barber's shop that happened
to be open and snatched up an evening paper the first paragraph i
laid my eyes on contained an account of the forgeries of my son ralph
skinner it was headed unheard-of depravity and it blazoned in
italics and capitals the crime the unnatural crime of committing
frauds in the name of a father

the shock with which i beheld the fatal publication renewed my horror
and sharpened my desire to end it i threw down the paper without
consulting the column of obituaries and ran towards the hospital
where it appeared to me i should certainly find one or more bodies
which the doctors had no longer occasion for but my visit was at
a highly unseasonable hour and the porter being knocked out of a
comfortable nap got up in an ill humour whose cow's dead now i
heard him grumble from his lodge i wonder people can't break their
necks by daylight

but my neck was not broken and he listened to my eager
inquiry whether there were no dead bodies in the house with rage
and indignation

i tell you what mister said he we takes no mad people in here
except they comes the regular way

and with that he shut the door in my face leaving me to wonder at his
want of civility

but the air was growing more frigid every moment and the hour was
waxing later and later i ran to the alms-house not doubting as that
was a more democratic establishment that i should be there received
with greater respect but good-breeding is not a whit more native to a
leather shirt than to a silk stocking my cerberus here was cut from
the same flint as the other his civility had been learned in the same
school and his english studied from the same grammar

i tell you what uncle barebones said he without waiting to be
questioned we takes no paupers here except they comes with an order

and so saying he slapped to the door with an energy that dislodged
from the roof of his den a full hundred weight or more of snow which
fell in my face and had wellnigh smothered me

the case began to look desperate but the difficulty of finding what i
wanted only rendered my wits more active i resolved to run to one of
the medical schools make my way into its anatomical repositories and
help myself to the best body i could find for indeed i was in such a
rage of desire to be released from my present tenement that i did not
design to stand upon trifles

i set out accordingly with this object in view but fate willed i
should seek my fortune in another quarter

the storm had by this time begun to rage with uncommon violence
the winds were blowing like so many buglers and trumpeters on a
militia-day and the snow that had already fallen was whisked up
every moment from the ground and driven back again into the air to
mingle in contention with that which was falling the atmosphere was
thickened or rather wholly displaced by the whirling particles so
that in a short time the wayfarer could neither see nor breathe in
the white chaos around him it was in truth a savage inclement
night the watchman betook him to his box to snooze away the hours in
comfort the lamps went out being of a spirit still more economical
than their founders and thinking with great justice that the streets
which could do with them could do equally well without them the dogs
were no longer heard yelping at the corners and the pigs the only
spectres of philadelphia that run squeaking and gibbering up and down
the streets in the night to vanish at early cock-crowing provided the
hog-catchers are in commission were one by one retreating to their
secret strongholds leaving the street to solitude the snow-storm and
me

i plodded on as well as i could and with such effect that after a
quarter hour's trudging i knew not well whither i stopped at last
i knew as little where instead of being in the heart of the city as
i supposed i found myself somewhere in the suburbs wedged fast in a
snow-drift one single lamp and one single wick of that single lamp
had escaped the puffs of the tempest it shone from aloft through the
rack of snow like a fire-fly in a fog dividing its faint beam betwixt
my frozen visage and a low open shed hard by the only objects beside
itself that were visible

i perceived that i was lost and being more than half dead with cold i
dragged myself into the shed to shelter me from the fury of the storm
and lament the ill fate that attended my efforts

as i stepped into the wretched hole i stumbled over a man lying coiled
up on the ground and so exposed to the air that his legs were already
heaped over with snow there was just light enough to discern a black
jug lying broken at his side from which arose the odour of corn-juice
but by no means of the true monongahela savour

i was struck by the fellow's appearance he had evidently been lying
there all the evening the stumble i had made over him did not disturb
him in the least and my hand chancing to touch his face i found it
could as marble i perceived he was dead a discovery that filled me
with uncommon joy for my eagerness to change my condition was such
that i only saw in him a body to be taken possession of without
reading in the broken jug and the miserable corner in which its victim
had breathed his last the newer wretchedness and degradation upon
which i was rushing such is the short-sightedness of discontent such
the folly of the man who deems himself the unluckiest of his species

with a trembling hand i thrust into the pockets of the corse the money
and the silver spoons i had brought with me being so far prudent that
i was resolved not to trust the transfer of such valuables to my new
body to accident this being accomplished i uttered the wish that had
thrice served my turn before

i wished however in vain i muttered the charm a dozen times over
but with no more effect than if i had pronounced it to the lamp-post
the body lay unmoved and i remained unchanged

i became horribly disconcerted a fear seized me that my good angel if
i had ever had one had deserted me or that the devil if it was from
him i derived my power of passing from body to body had suddenly left
me in the lurch in a word that i had consumed all my privileges of
transformation and was chained to the body of abram skinner for life

i beat my breast in despair and then changing from that to wrath i
began to belabour the ribs of the dead man with all the strength of my
foot as if he were answerable for my disappointment perhaps indeed
the reader will think that he was for at the third kick the corpse
became animated and to my astonishment rose upon its feet saying in
accents tolerably articulate though somewhat thick and tumultuous
i say charlie odd rabbit it none on your jokes now and none on
your takin of folks up cause how folks is not half so drunk as you
suppose and so good night and let's have no more words about it and
i'll consider you werry much of a gentleman

with these words the corpse picked up that fragment of the jug that had
the handle to it leaving the others as well as his hat behind him
and staggering out of the shed he began to walk away i was petrified
he was stalking off with my money and a dozen of mrs smith's silver
spoons

you villain said i running after him give me back my property

i'm a free man said the sot i'm no man's property and so
charlie don't go for to disturb me for i knows my way home as well as
anybody

but the four hundred dollars and the silver spoons said i seizing
him by the shoulders and endeavouring to empty the pockets i had but a
moment before filled if you resist you rogue i'll put you in jail

i won't go to jail for no charlie in the liberty said the man of
the jug who to the last moment seemed to have no other idea than
that he had fallen into the hands of a guardian of the night and was
in danger of being introduced to warmer quarters than those he was
leaving he spoke with the indignation of a freeborn republican who
felt his rights invaded and was resolute to defend them and lifting
up the fragment of his jug he suddenly bestowed it upon my head with
such good-will that i was felled to the earth he took advantage of my
downfall to decamp carrying with him the treasure with which i had so
bountifully freighted him i pursued him as well as i could calling
upon the watch for assistance and shouting murder and robbery at the
top of my voice but all was in vain the watch were asleep or i had
wandered beyond their jurisdiction and after a ten minutes chase i
found myself more bewildered than before and the robber vanished with
his plunder




 chapter ix


in which the author makes the acquaintance of a philanthropist


i should have cursed my simplicity in mistaking a drunkard for a dead
man but i had other evils to distress me besides chagrin i was lost
in a snow-storm fainting with fatigue shivering with cold and afar
from assistance there not being a single house in sight it was in
vain that i sought to recover my way i plunged from one snow-bank into
another and i believe i should have actually perished had not succour
arrived at a moment when i had given over all hopes of receiving it

i had just sunk down into a huge drift on the roadside where i lay
groaning unable to extricate myself when a man driving by in a chair
hearing my lamentations drew up and demanded in a most benevolent
voice what was the matter

who art thou friend said he and what are thy distresses if thou
art in affliction peradventure there is one nigh at hand who will
succour thee

i am said i the most miserable wretch on the earth

heaven be praised said the stranger with great devoutness of
accent for in that case i will give thee help and the night shall
not pass away in vain yea verily i will do my best to assist thee
for it is both good and pleasant a comeliness to the eye and a
refreshment to the spirit to do good deeds among those who are truly
wretched

and besides said i i am sticking fast in the snow and am
perishing with cold

be of good heart and hold still for a moment and i will come to thy
assistance

and with that honest broadbrim for such i knew by his speech he must
be descended from the chair and helped me out of the drift all which
he accomplished with zeal and alacrity showing not more humanity as
i thought than satisfaction at finding such a legitimate object for
its display he brushed the snow from my clothes and perceiving i was
shivering with cold for i had lost my cloak some minutes before he
transferred one of his own outer garments of which i believe he had
two or three to my shoulders plying me all the time with questions
as to how i came into such a difficulty and what other griefs i might
have to afflict me and assuring me i should have his assistance

hast thou no house to cover thy nakedness he cried verily i will
find thee a place wherein thou shalt shelter thyself from snow and
from cold art thou suffering from lack of food verily there is a
crust of bread and the leg of a chicken yet left in my basket of cold
bits and thou shalt have them with something further hereafter hast
thou no family or friends verily there are many humane persons of my
acquaintance who will like myself consider themselves as thy brothers
and sisters art thou oppressed with years as well as poverty verily
then thou hast a stronger claim to pity and it shall be accorded thee

he heaped question upon question and assurance upon assurance with
such haste and fervour that it was some minutes before i could speak
i took advantage of his first pause to detail the latest and at that
moment the most oppressive of my griefs

i have been robbed i cried of four hundred dollars and a dozen
silver spoons by a rascal i found lying drunk under a shed but i'll
have the villain if it costs me the half of his plunder and 

be not awroth with the poor man said my deliverer it was a
wickedness in him to rob thee but thou shouldst reflect how wickedness
comes of misery and how misery of the inclemency of the season be
merciful to the wicked man as well as to the miserable for thereby
thou showest mercy to him who is doubly miserable but how didst thou
come by four hundred dollars and a dozen silver spoons thou canst not
be so poor as to prove an object of charity

no said i i am no beggar but i won't be robbed for nothing

verily i say unto thee again be not awroth with the poor man thou
shouldst reflect if thou wert robbed how far thou wast thyself the
cause of the evil for having four hundred dollars about thee thou
mightst have relieved the poor creature's wants in which case thou
wouldst have prevented both a loss and a crime the one on thy part
the other on his talk not therefore of persecuting the poor man
hunt him up if thou canst administer secretly to his wants and give
him virtuous counsel and then peradventure he will sin no more

i was struck by the tone and maxims of my deliverer they expressed an
ardour of benevolence an enthusiasm of philanthropy such as i had
never dreamed of before i could not see his face the night being
so thick and tempestuous but there was a complacency a bustling
self-satisfaction in his voice that convinced me he was not only a
good but a happy man i regarded him with as much envy as respect
and a comparison which i could not avoid mentally making betwixt his
condition and my own drew from me a loud groan

art thou hurt said the good samaritan i will help thee into my
wheeled convenience here and take thee to thy home

no said i i will never go near that wretched house again

what is it that makes it wretched said the quaker

you will know if you are of philadelphia i replied when i tell
you my name i am the miserable abram skinner

what abram skinner the money-lender said my friend with a severe
voice friend abram i have heard of thy domestic calamities and
verily i have heard of those of many others who laid them all at
thy doors as the author and cause thereof thou art indeed the most
wretched of men but if thou thinkest so thyself then is there a hope
thou mayst be yet restored to happiness thou hast made money but
what good hast thou done with it thou hast accumulated thy hundreds
and thy thousands and thy tens of thousands but how many of thy
fellow-creatures hast thou given cause to rejoice in thy prosperity
truly i have heard much said of thy wealth and thy avarice friend
abram but verily not a word of thy kind-heartedness and charity and
know that goodness and charity are the only securities against the
ills both sore and manifold that spring from groaning coffers i say
to thee friend abram hast thou ever given a dollar in alms to the
poor or acquitted a single penny of obligation to the hard-run of thy
customers

my conscience smote me not however that i felt any great remorse
for not having thrown away my money in the way the quaker meant but
his words brought a new idea into my mind it was misery on the one
hand and the hope of arriving at happiness on the other which had
spurred me from transformation to transformation each change had
however been productive of greater discontent than the other and the
woes with which i was oppressed in my three borrowed bodies had been
even greater than those that afflicted me in my own proper original
casing it was plain that i had not exercised a just discretion in the
selection of bodies since i had taken those of men whose modes of
existence did not dispose to happiness what mode of existence then was
most likely to secure the content i sought such i inferred from the
quaker's discourse as would call into operation the love of goodness
and of man such as would cause to be cultivated the kindly virtues
unknown to the selfish such as would lead to the practice of charity
and general philanthropy i was grieved therefore that i had entered
so many bodies for nothing my conscience accused me of a blunder and
i longed to enter upon an existence of virtue not that i had any great
regard for virtue itself but because i valued my own happiness had my
deliverer chanced to break his neck while discoursing to me i should
have reanimated his corse to try my hand at benevolence as for being
good and charitable in the body i then occupied i felt that it was
impossible the impulse pointed to another existence

the quaker's indignation soon abated he looked upon my silence as the
effect of remorse and the idea of converting me into an alms-giver and
a friend of the poor like himself took possession of his imagination
and warmed his spirit by such a conversion his philanthropic desires
would be doubly gratified it would make me happy and as i was
a rich man some hundreds of others also he helped me into the
chair and driving slowly towards the city attempted the good work
by describing the misery so prevalent in the suburbs and dilating
with uncommon enthusiasm upon the delight with which every act of
benevolence would be recorded in my own bosom

it seems that he was returning from a mission of charity in one of
the remotest districts where he had relieved the necessities of
divers unhappy wretches and he gave me to understand it was his
purpose to make one more charitable visitation before returning home
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the fury of the tempest
and this visit he felt the more urged to make since it would afford a
practical illustration of his remarks and show how doubly charity was
blessed both to the giver and receiver

thou shalt see said he even with thine own eyes what power he
that hath money hath over the afflictions of his race what power to
dry the tear of the mourning and to check the wicked deeds of the
vicious he that i will now relieve is what thou didst foolishly call
thyself to wit the most miserable of men for he is both a beggar and
a convicted felon having but a few days since been discharged from the
penitentiary where he had served out his three years for i believe
the third time in his life

surely said i he is then a reprobate entirely unworthy pity

on the contrary said the philanthropist he is for that reason the
more to be pitied since all regard him with distrust and abhorrence
and refuse him the relief without which he must again become a
criminal the very boys say to him get up thou old jail-bird and
men and women hoot at him in the streets poverty made him a criminal
and scorn has hardened his heart yet is he a man with a soul and
verily thou shalt see how that soul can be melted by the breath of
compassion in this little hovel we shall find him said the quaker
drawing up before a miserable frame building which was of a most
lonely aspect and in a terrible state of dilapidation the windows
being without shutters and glasses and even the door itself half torn
from its hinges

it is a little tenement that belongeth to me said my friend and
here i told him he might shelter him until i could come in person and
relieve him a negro-man whom i permitted to live here for a while
did very ungratefully that is to say very thoughtlessly destroy
the window-shutters and other loose work for fire-wood i having
forgotten to supply him with that needful article and he poor man
being too bashful to acquaint me with his wants verily i do design to
render it more comfortable but in these hard times one cannot find
more money than sufficeth to fill the mouths of the hungry descend
friend abram and let us enter i see the poor man hath a fire shining
through the door this will warm thy frozen limbs while the sound
of his grateful acknowledgments will do the same good office for thy
spirit




 chapter x


containing an affecting adventure with a victim of the law


my benevolent friend leaving his horse standing at the door led the
way into the hovel the interior of which was still more ruinous than
the outside it consisted of but a single room below with a garret
above a meager fire which furnished the only light was burning on
the hearth to supply which the planks had been torn from the floor
leaving the earth below almost bare there was not a single article
of furniture visible save an old deal table without leaves a broken
chair and a tattered scrap of carpet lying near the fire which seemed
to have served as both bed and blanket to the wretched tenant

how is this said the friend in surprise verily i did direct my
man abel to carry divers small comforts hither which have vanished as
well as the poor man john smith

john smith it seems was the name of the beneficiary and that
convinced me he was a rogue i ventured to hint to our common friend
that john smith having disposed of those small comforts he spoke of
to the best advantage was now engaged seeking others in some of our
neighbours houses and that the wisest thing we could do in such a
case would be to take our departure

verily said my deliverer with suavity it is not possible john can
do the wicked things thou thinkest of for first it is but three days
since he left the penitentiary and secondly i sent him by my helper
and friend abel snipe sufficient eatables to supply him a week so
that he could have no inducement to do a wicked thing still it doth
surprise me that he is absent nevertheless we will tarry a little
while lest peradventure he should return and be in trouble with none
to relieve him it wants yet ten minutes to midnight continued the
benevolent man drawing out a handsome gold watch and five of these
at least we can devote to the poor creature

i was about to remonstrate a second time when a step was heard
approaching at a distance in the street

peradventure it is john himself said my friend and peradventure it
will be better thou shouldst step aside into yonder dark corner for an
instant that thou mayst witness without restraining by thy presence
the feelings of virtue that remain in the spirit even when tainted and
hardened by depravity

i crept away as i was directed to a corner where i might easily
remain unobserved the room being illumined only by the fire and that
consisting of little besides embers and ashes from this place i saw
mr john smith as he entered which he declined doing until after he
had peeped suspiciously into the apartment and been summoned by the
voice of his benefactor

he was as ill-looking a dog as i had ever laid eyes on and his
appearance was in strange contrast with that of his benevolent patron
the latter was a tall and rawboned man of fifty with an uncommonly
prepossessing visage rather lantern-jawed perhaps but handsome and
good-natured the other was a slouch of a fellow short of stature
but full of fat and brawn with bow legs gibbon arms and a hang-dog
visage he sidled up to the fire hesitatingly and indeed with an air
of shame and humility while the philanthropist laying his watch upon
the table extended his hand towards him

be of good heart friend john he said i come not to reproach thee
for thy misdeeds but to counsel thee how thou shalt amend them and
restore thyself again to the society of the virtuous

es sir grumbled john smith dodging his head in humble
acknowledgment rubbing his hands for warmth over the fire and
casting a sidelong look at his benefactor werry good of you sir
shall ever be beholden werry hard times for one what's been in the
penitentiary takes away all one's repurtation and lord bless us
sir a man's but a ruined man when a man hasn't no repurtation

and with that worthy john drew his sleeve over his nose which
convinced me he was not so much of a rascal as i thought him

john thou hast been but as a sinner and a foolish man

es sir said john with another rub of his sleeve at his nose but
hard times makes hard work of a poor man always hoped to mend and be
wirtuous but lord bless us mr longstraw beg pardon can't think of
making so free to say friend to such a great gentleman one can't be
wirtuous with nothing to live on

verily thou speakest in a measure the truth said my friend
and i intend thou shalt now be put in some way of earning an honest
livelihood

es sir said john and sure i shall be werry much beholden

but it is not my intention to record the conversation of the worthy
pair i am writing a history of myself and not of other people and
i therefore think it proper to pursue no discourses in which i did
not myself bear a part it is sufficient to say that my deliverer
said a thousand excellent things in the way of counsel which the
other received very well and many indicative of a disposition to be
charitable which mr john smith received still better and in the end
to relieve the pressing wants of the sufferer which mr john smith
feelingly represented drew forth a pocketbook and took therefrom a
silver dollar at the sight of which i thought mr john smith looked
a little disappointed nay it struck me that the appearance of the
pocketbook ancient and ill-looking as it was had captivated his
imagination in a greater degree than the coin i had before observed
him steal several affectionate looks towards the gold watch lying on
the table which now however the sight of the well-thumbed wallet
seemed to have driven from his thoughts entirely nevertheless he
received the silver dollar with many thanks and with still more the
assurance that the philanthropist would procure him employment on the
morrow and mr longstraw's eyes as he turned to beckon me from the
corner began to twinkle with the delight of self-approbation

i was myself beginning to feel a sentiment of pleasure and to picture
to my mind the unfortunate felon converted by a few words of counsel
and still fewer dollars of charity into an honest and worthy member of
society when oh horror of horrors the repenting convict suddenly
snatched up a brand from the fire and discharged it with a violence
that would have felled an ox full upon the head of his patron

the sparks flew from the brand over the whole room and my friend
dropped upon the floor on his face followed by the striker who
seizing upon his cravat twisted it tightly round the unfortunate man's
throat thus completing by strangulation the murder more than half
accomplished by the below

the whole affair was the work of an instant and had i possessed
the will or courage to interfere i could not have done so in time
to arrest the mischief but in truth i had not the power to stir
horror and astonishment chained me to the corner where i stood as if
transformed to stone unable even to vent my feelings in a cry i was
seized with a terrible apprehension on my own account for i could
not doubt that the wretch who would thus murder a benefactor for a
few dollars would have as little hesitation to despatch me who had
witnessed the deed i feared every moment lest the villain should
direct his eye to the corner in which i stood separated from him only
a few yards but he was too busy with his horrid work to regard me
and terrified as i was i looked on in safety while my deliverer was
murdered before my eyes

how long mr john smith was at his dreadful work i cannot say but i
saw him after a while relax his grasp from his victim's throat and
fall to rummaging his pockets then leaping up he seized upon the
watch and clapped it into his bosom saying with a most devilish
chuckle and grin

damn them ere old fellers what gives a man a dollar and preaches
about wirtue i reckon old slabsides there's none on your people will
hang me for the smash much beholden to you for leaving the horse and
chair it makes all safer

with these words the wretch slipped out of the hovel and a moment
after i heard the smothered roll of the vehicle as it swept from the
door


 chapter xi


in which the plot thickens and the tragedy grows deeper


i supposed that mr john smith had taken himself away with as much
speed as was consistent with the strength of his horse and the safety
of his bones and i recovered from the fears i had entertained on my
own account i crept up to the philanthropist to give him assistance
if such could be now rendered but it was too late he was already
dead mr john smith had not taken his degrees without proper study
in his profession and i must say that his practice on the present
occasion did not go far to confirm me in the love of benevolence

nevertheless the appearance of the defunct threw my mind into a
ferment i had been hunting a body and now i had one before me i had
come to believe that if i wished for happiness i must get possession
of one whose occupant had previously been happy and i had seen enough
of the deceased to know that he had been an uncommonly comfortable and
contented personage

the end of all this was a resolution which i instantly made to
take advantage of the poor man's misfortune and convert his body
to my own purposes i had seen him for the first time that night i
did not remember ever to have heard his name mentioned before and i
consequently knew nothing of him beyond what i had just learned where
he lived who were his connexions what his property c c were
all questions to which i was to find answers thereafter it appeared
to me that a philanthropist of his spirit and age the latter of which
i judged to be about fifty could not but be very well known and that
all i should have to do after reanimating his body would be to seek
the assistance of the first person i should find and so be conducted
at once to the gentleman's house after which all would go well enough
but in truth i took but little time for reflection or perhaps i
should not have been in such a hurry to attempt a transformation a
little prudence might have led me to inquire into the consequences of
the change inferred from the condition of the body suppose his scull
should prove to be broken who was to stand the woes of trepanning i
do say it would have been wiser had i thought of that but unluckily
i did not i was in too great a hurry to think of any thing save the
transformation itself and the result was that i had a lesson on the
demerits of leaping before looking which i think will be of service to
me for the remainder of my life as it might be to the reader could
the reader be brought to believe that that experience is good for any
thing which costs nothing

my resolution was quickened by a step which i heard approaching along
the street it is a watchman thought i to myself i will jump into
the body and run out for assistance

i turned to the defunct

friend longstraw said i or whatever your name is if you are
really dead i wish to occupy your body

that moment i lost all consciousness the reader may infer the transfer
of spirit was accomplished

and so it was i came to my senses a few moments after just in time
to find myself tumbling into a hole in the earth beneath the floor of
the hovel with mr john smith hard by dragging to the same depository
the mortal frame i had just deserted i perceived at once the horrible
dilemma in which i was placed i was on the point of being buried and
what was worse of being buried alive

i conjure and beseech thee friend john smith i cried but cried no
more the villain had just reached the pit dragging the body of the
late abram skinner he was startled at my voice but it only quickened
him in his labours he snatched up the corse and cast it down upon me
as one would a millstone and the weight though that was not very
considerable and the shock together jarred the life more than half
out of me

what old slabsides said he ar'n't you past grumbling

with that the bloody-minded miscreant seized upon a fragment of plank
and began to belabour me with all his strength

i had entered the philanthropist's body only to be murdered i uttered
a direful scream but that was only a waste of the breath which mr
john smith was determined to waste for me he redoubled his blows with
a vigour that showed he was in earnest nor did he cease until his work
was completed in a word he murdered me and so effectually that it
is a wonder i am alive to tell it he assassinated me and even began
to bury me by tumbling earth down from the floor when as my good
fate would have it the scene was brought to a climax by the sudden
entrance of a watchman who running up to the villain served him the
same turn he had served me by laying a leaded mace over his head and
so knocking him out of his senses

it seems for i scorn to keep the reader in suspense by indulging in
mystery that this faithful fellow having made a shorter nap than
was warranted by the state of the night had taken a stroll into the
air to look about him that he had passed the hovel and seeing the
chair standing at the door had looked through a crack and perceived
mr longstraw with whose person and benevolent character he was
acquainted and myself that is my late self warming ourselves by the
convict's fire and that after pursuing his beat for a while he was
about to return by another way when to his surprise he lighted upon
the vehicle at more than a square's distance from the house and the
horse being tied to a post it was evident he had not strayed thither
this awaking a suspicion that all was not right he determined to pay
a second visit to the hovel and was on the way thither when i set up
the scream mentioned before then quickening his pace he arrived in
time to witness the awful spectacle of mr john smith thrusting the two
bodies into the pit which operation the courageous watchman brought to
a close by knocking the operator on the head as i have related

what had brought mr john smith back again and why he should have
troubled himself to conceal the victim of his murderous cupidity must
be conjectured as well as the amazement with which doubtless he
found he had two bodies to bury instead of one he perhaps reflected
that the visit of his patron was known to other persons who upon
finding his body would readily conjecture who was the murderer and
therefore judged it proper to conceal the evidence of assassination
and leave the fate of his benefactor in entire mystery

as it happened his return had wellnigh proved fatal to me and it
was any thing but happy for himself it caused him to take up his
lodgings for a fourth time in the penitentiary and there he is sawing
stone i believe to this day unless pardoned out by the governor of
pennsylvania according to the practice among governors in general
the visitation was however thus far advantageous to me that it
caused me to be conducted to the dwelling of mr longstraw with all
due expedition and care whereas had it not happened i might have
remained lying on the floor of my miserable tenement until frozen to
death for the night was uncommonly bitter

as for my late body it found its way to abram skinner's mansion
whence having been handsomely coffined it was carried to the grave
which but for me it would have filled three months before

 chapter i


the philanthropist's family


if my first introduction to the life of the philanthropic zachariah
longstraw for that was his name was attended with circumstances of
fear and danger i did not thereby escape those other evils which as
i hinted before might have been anticipated had i reflected a moment
on the situation of his body it was covered with bruises from head to
foot and there was scarce a sound bone left in it so that as i may
say i had in reanimating it only exchanged anguish of spirit for
anguish of body and which of these is the more intolerable i never
could satisfactorily determine philosophers indeed contend for the
superior poignancy of the former but i must confess a leaning to the
other side of the question what is the pain of a broken heart to that
of the toothache the poets speak of vipers in the bosom what are
they compared to a bug in the ear be this however as it may it is
certain i had a most dreadful time of it in mr longstraw's body and
it would have been much worse had not the blows i had received on the
head kept me for a long time in a delirium and therefore in a measure
unconscious of my sufferings the truth is the body which i so rashly
entered was in such a dilapidated condition so bruised and mangled
that it was next to an impossibility to restore its vital powers and
it was more than two weeks after lying all that time in a state of
insensibility more dead than alive before i came to my senses and
remembered what had befallen me and it was not until four more had
elapsed that i was finally able to leave my chamber and snuff the
early breezes of spring

as soon as i began to take notice of what was passing about me i
perceived that i lay in a good though plainly-furnished chamber and
that besides the physicians and other persons who occasionally bustled
around me there were two individuals so constantly in attendance
and so careful and affectionate in all their deportment that i did
not doubt they were members of my new family indeed i had no sooner
looked upon their faces and heard their voices than i felt a glow of
satisfaction within my spirit which convinced me they were my very
dear and faithful friends and that i loved them exceedingly

they were both young men the one perhaps of twenty-five the other
six or seven years older both were decked in quaker garments the
elder being uncommonly plain in his appearance wearing smallclothes
shoe-buckles and a hat with a brim full five inches wide which he
seldom laid aside these gave him a patriarchal appearance highly
striking in one of his youth which was much increased by an uncommon
air of gravity and benevolence beaming from his somewhat swarthy and
hollow visage

the younger had no such sanctimonious appearance there was a janty
look even in the cut of his straight coat he had a handsome face and
seemed conscious of it he swung about the room at times with a strut
that excited his own admiration and any three moments out of five he
might be seen before the looking-glass surveying his teeth inspecting
the sweep of his shoulders and brushing up his hair with his fingers
his plain coat was set at naught by a vest and trousers of the most
fashionable cut and pattern he had a gold guard-chain worn abroad
and his watch which in all likelihood was gold also was stuck in
his vest-pocket in the manner approved of by bucks and men of the
world instead of being deposited according to the system of the wise
in a fob over the epigastrium and to crown his list of vanities he
had in his shirt a breastpin which he took care to keep constantly
visible containing jewels of seven or eight different colours it
was manifest the young gentleman if a quaker as his coat showed him
to be was quite a free one and indeed the first words i heard him
utter which were also the first that i distinguished after rousing
from my long sleep of insensibility set the matter beyond question i
saw him peer into my face very curiously and directly heard him call
out to his companion i say snipe by jingo uncle zack's beginning
to look like a man in his senses

these words imparted a sensation of pleasure to my breast but i felt
impelled to censure the young man for the freedom of his expressions
my tongue however seemed to have lost its function and while i was
vainly attempting to articulate a reprimand the other rushed up and
giving me an earnest stare seized upon one of my hands which he fell
to mumbling and munching in a highly enthusiastic manner crying out
with inexpressible joy and fervour blessed be the day and does thee
open thee eyes again verily this shall be a day of rejoicing and
not to me only the loving abel snipe but to thousands does thee
feel better zachariah my friend and patron verily the poor man
that has mourned for thee shall be now as one that rejoices for thee
shall again speak to him the words of tenderness and open the hand of
alms-giving yea verily and the afflicted shall mourn no more

these words were even more agreeable than those uttered by the junior
and i experienced a feeling of displeasure when the latter suddenly
cut them short by exclaiming come snipe none of thee confounded
nonsense i reckon uncle zack has had enough philanthropy for the
season and don't thee go to humbug him into it any more thee has made
thee own fortune and should be content

verily friend jonathan said the fervent abel snipe addressing the
junior but still tugging at my hand thee does not seem to rejoice
at thee uncle's recovery as thee should but thee jokes and thee jests
sha'n't make my spirit rejoice the less

verily said jonathan so it seems but if thee tugs at uncle zack
in that way and talks so loud thee will do his business

verily said abel 

and verily said jonathan interrupting him thee will say it is
thee business to do his business which is very true but not in
the sense of murder so let us hold our tongues and do thou uncle
zachariah he added addressing me keep thyself quiet and take this
dose of physic

it was unspeakable how much my spirit was warmed within me by this
friendly contest between the two young men and by their looks of
affection i longed to embrace them both but had not the strength
and indeed it was three or four days more before i felt myself able
or was allowed by the physicians to indulge in conversation

at the expiration of that period i found myself growing stronger the
twenty thousand different pangs that had besieged my body from the
crown of my head to the sole of my foot whenever i attempted to move
were less racking and poignant and waking from a slumber that had
been more agreeable than usual and finding no one near me save the
ever faithful abel snipe i could no longer resist the impulse to speak
to him

abel snipe said i

blessed be thee kind voice that it speaks again said abel snipe
devouring my hand as before and blubbering as he devoured

thy name is abel snipe said i

verily and surely it is abel snipe and no other said he i hope
thee don't forget me

why really said i i can't exactly say friend abel seeing that
there has a confusion come over my brain but art thou certain i am no
longer abram skinner

at this question abel snipe's eyes jumped half out of his head and
they regarded me with wo and horror i saw he thought my wits were
unsettled and i hastened to remove the impression

don't be alarmed friend abel but of a verity i think i was killed
and buried

yea said abel yea verily the vile ungrateful malicious john
smith did smite thee over the head with a club so that the bone was
broken and thee was as one that was dead but oh the villain we have
him fast in jail and oh the unnatural rascal we'll hang him

verily said i feeling uncommon concern at the idea we will do no
such wicked deed but we will admonish the poor man of the wickedness
of his ways and relieving his wants discharge him from bondage

yea said abel snipe with an air of contrition so will we do as
becometh the merciful man and christian but verily the flesh did
quarrel with the spirit and the old adam cried out to me blood for
blood and the thing that is flesh said vengeance on the wicked man
that smote the friend of the afflicted but now thy goodness reproves
me and teaches me better things wherefore i say be not hard with the
miserable man for such is the wicked and such is john smith who is
now mourning over his foolish acts in the county prison yea verily
we will be exceeding lenient and so forth and so forth

i do not think it needful to repeat all the wise and humane things
said by abel snipe they convinced me he was the most benevolent of
beings and warmed a similar spirit that was now burning in my breast
and which burnt on until it became at last a general conflagration of
philanthropy yea the transformation was complete i found within
me on the sudden a raging desire to augment the happiness of my
fellow-creatures and wondered that i had ever experienced any other
passion the generous abel discoursed to me of the thousands i that
is my prototype the true zachariah had rescued from want and
affliction and of the thousands whom i was yet to relieve my brain
took fire at the thought and i exulted in a sense of my virtue i
perceived in imagination the tear of distress chased away by that
of gratitude i heard the sob of sorrow succeeded by the sigh of
happiness and the prayer of beseeching changed to the prayer of praise
and thanksgiving a gentle warmth flowed from my bosom through the
uttermost bounds of my frame and i felt that i was a happy man yea
reader yea and verily i was at last happy my only affliction was
that the battered condition of my body prevented my sallying out at
once and practising the noble art of charity the tears sprang into my
eyes when abel recounted the numbers of the miserable who had besieged
my doors during my two weeks of insensibility crying for assistance

why didst thou not relieve them abel snipe i exclaimed

verily said abel turning his eyes to heaven with a look of fervent
rapture i did relieve the sorrowing and destitute even to the
uttermost penny that was in my pocket blessed be the deed for i have
not now a cent that i can call my own as for thine zachariah it
became me not to dispense it without thy spoken authority the more
especially as thy nephew jonathan did hint and vehemently insist
that thou hadst bestowed too much already for thy good and his

these words filled me with concern and displeasure

surely said i the young man jonathan is not averse to deeds of
charity

verily said abel clasping his hands and looking as if he would
have wept the excellent and beloved youth doth value money more than
the good which money may produce and of that good he esteemeth chiefly
the portion that falleth to his own lot of a surety i do fear he hath
an eagerness and hankering a fleshly appetite and an exceeding strong
desire after the things of the world he delighteth in the vanity of
fine clothes and his discourse is of women and the charms thereof
he hath bought the picture of a french dancing-woman and hung it in
his chamber swearing for he hath a contempt for affirmation that
it is a good likeness of the maiden ellen wild and yesterday i did
perceive him squeaking at a heathenish wind-instrument called a flute
and thereupon he did avow an intention to try his hand at that more
paganish thing of strings called a fiddle and oh what grieved me
above all and caused the spirit within me to cry avaunt and get thee
away jonathan he did offer me a ticket of the cost of one dollar
to procure me admission into the place of sin and vanity called the
theatre swearing by jingo and by gemini there was great fun
there and offering to lend me a coat hat and trousers so that the
wicked should not know me yea verily the young man is as a young
lion that roameth up and down as a sheep that wandereth from the
pinfold into the forbidden meadows and as for charity peradventure
thee will not believe me but he averred the only charity he believed
in was that which began at home

these confessions of the faithful abel in relation to the young man
jonathan caused my spirit to wax sorrowful within me but it is
fitting before pursuing such conversations further that i should
inform the reader who the faithful abel and the young man jonathan
were

the latter as abel himself informed me was my or if the reader
will my prototype's nephew the only and now orphan son of a
sister who had married as the phrase is out of meeting and dying
destitute left her boy to the charge of the benevolent zachariah
who being himself childless adopted him as his son and heir and had
treated him as such from his childhood up the great wish of zachariah
was to make the adopted son a philanthropist like himself in which
however he was destined to disappointment for jonathan was of a wild
and worldly turn fond of frolic and amusement and extremely averse to
squander in works of charity the possessions he designed applying in
future years to his own benefit nevertheless he was greatly beloved
by his uncle and i who was imbued with that uncle's spirit and
destined to love and abhor what he had loved and abhorred whether i
would or not soon began to regard him as one of the two apples of my
eyes




 chapter ii


some account of the worthy abel snipe


the faithful abel snipe it seems his history was told me by
jonathan was a man whom zachariah some years before while playing
the howard in a neighbouring sovereignty had found plunged in deep
distress and making shoes in the penitentiary to this condition he
had been reduced by sheer goodness for being an amateur in that
virtuous art of which zachariah was a professor and having no means
of his own to relieve the woes of the wretched he had borrowed from
the hoards of his employers the president and directors of a certain
stock-company in whose office he had a petty appointment and thus
perforce made charitable an institution that was chartered to be
uncharitable he committed the fault however of borrowing without
the previous ceremony of asking either because he was of so innocent
a temper as to think such a proceeding unnecessary or because he knew
beforehand that the request would not be granted and the consequence
was that the president and directors as aforesaid did very
mercilessly hand him over to the prosecuting attorney the prosecuting
attorney to a grand jury the grand jury to a petit jury the petit
jury to a penitentiary and the penitentiary to the devil or such
at least would have been the ending of the unfortunate amateur had
not the philanthropist who always ordered his shoes for charity's
sake at the prison been struck with the uncommon excellence of a pair
constructed by abel's hands

he sought out the faithful maker for sure a man must be faithful to
make a good pair of shoes in a penitentiary was melted by his tale
of wo even as the wax through which abel was then drawing a bunch of
ends was melted by the breath thereof and shedding tears to find the
poor creature's virtue so shabbily rewarded ran to the prosecutors
with a petition which he induced them to sign transmitted it to the
governor with a most eloquent essay on the divine character of mercy
and in less than a week walked abel snipe out of prison a pardoned
man

the charity of the professor did not end with abel's liberation
enraptured with the fervour of his gratitude touched by the
artlessness of his character and moved by the destitution to which a
pardon in the winter-time exposed him he carried him to his own land
and house fed clothed and employed him upon a new pair of shoes
and discovering that he had talents for a nobler business advanced
him in time to the rank of accountant or secretary collector of
rents dispenser of secret charities and in general factotum and
fiduciary at large such a servant was needed by the humane zachariah
his philanthropy left him no time to attend to his own affairs and his
nephew jonathan had fallen in love and become incompetent to their
management

never was experiment more happy for subject and object abel snipe
was made an honest and useful man and zachariah longstraw obtained a
friend and servant without price the gratitude of abel was equal to
his ability humility fidelity and religion were the least of his
virtues he became a philanthropist like his master he managed his
affairs with such skill that zachariah had always pennies at hand
for the unfortunate which it seems had not always happened before
and what was equally charming the zealous abel dived into every
lane alley and gutter to discover new objects of charity for his
patron to crown all he felt moved in the spirit to profess the faith
so greatly adorned by his protector and after due preparation and
probation appeared in the garb of peace and humility and even went so
far as to hold forth once at meeting

in a word abel snipe was a jewel of the first water who supplied
the place of the idle jonathan in all matters of business and almost
in the affections of his kinsman if not equally beloved he was more
highly esteemed and his shining worth consoled the philanthropist for
many of the derelictions of his nephew he became the confidant the
coadjutor and the adviser of zachariah and zachariah never found
occasion to lament the be nevolence that had redounded so much to his
own advantage




 chapter iii


in which the young man jonathan argues several cases of conscience
which are recommended to be brought before yearly meeting



my nephew jonathan had no great love for poor abel and he did not tell
me his story without passing sundry sarcasms on him as well as myself
for bestowing so much confidence on the poor unfortunate man i rebuked
the youth for his freedom and uncharitableness and remembering what
abel had told me of his own idle and trifling course of life i felt
impelled by the new spirit of virtue that possessed me to take him
to task which i did in the following manner and it is wondrous how
completely and how soon for i was yet lying on my back groaning with
my unhealed wounds and bruises my spirit assumed and acted upon all
that was peculiar in the nature of zachariah longstraw

nevvy jonathan said i the uncharitableness of thy spirit afflicts
me trouble not thyself to censure the worthy abel snipe but think
how thou shalt amend thine own crying faults it has been said to me
jonathan my son and verily i fear it is true that thou squeakest
upon flutes and that thou makest profane noises with fiddles and
furthermore that thou runnest after and dost buy the vanity of
pictures and triest thy hand at painting the same

i do said jonathan and i find nothing against them in the
scripture

verily said i but dost thou find nothing against them in thine own
spirit

not a whit said jonathan my heart says love them and my head
approves the counsel where's the harm in these things i know thee
don't say they are in themselves sinful

verily no said i but they are indirectly so for being wholly
useless the time bestowed upon them is time lost and wasted and that
nevvy jonathan i think thee will allow to be sinful

not i said jonathan stoutly i don't believe the wasting of time
to be any such heinous matter as thee supposes had it been so man
would not have been made to waste a third of his existence in slumber
but granting this for the sake of argument i deny thy premises
uncle zachariah the time bestowed upon these things is not wasted
heaven has given to nine men out of ten a capacity to enjoy both music
and painting it has done more it has set an example of both before
our eyes and thus laid the foundation of the divine arts in nature
what is the world around us but a great concert-hall echoing with the
music of bird and beast of wind water and foliage what but a great
gallery of pictures painted by the hand of providence nature is a
painter nature is a musician and her sons can do nothing better
than follow her example but were nature neither it is not the less
evident that these arts are lawful and sinless they can be proved so
uncle zachariah upon thine own system of philanthropy for they add
to the happiness of our existence and they do so without corrupting
our morals or injuring our neighbours i say uncle quoth jonathan
who had pronounced this defence with much enthusiasm and now concluded
with a grin of triumph i have thee there dead as a herring

verily said i more pleased than offended at the young man's
ingenuity for my spirit yearned over him the more at every word thee
has a talent for argument which i would thee would cultivate for then
thee could get into the assembly and finally perhaps into congress
and do much good to thy fellow-men by reforming divers crying abuses

verily said he the first thing i should reform would be thy
philanthropy

don't be funny nevvy said i for i have not done with thee thee
was dancing last night in the house of the vain man ebenezer wild

i was said jonathan i was shaking my legs and i can't see the
harm of it for the flies do the same thing all day long

verily thee should remember that a reasonable being that hath a
brain should rather exercise that than his heels

i grant thee said jonathan but thee knows brains are not so
abundant as heels and thee should expect the mass of people to conduct
according to their endowments

jonathan said i if thee thinks to make me laugh thee is mistaken
of a verity i will not be rigid with thee but verily i must speak to
thee of what i hold thy faults thou hast a vain and eager hankering
after the society of giddy women

i have said jonathan with great fervour heaven made women to be
loved and i love them especially ellen wild

sure said i i have heard that name

sure said jonathan it would be odd if thee had not for thee knows
her well thine old friend ebenezer's daughter

a giddy girl jonathan i fear me a giddy girl

as giddy as the dev that is as giddy as a goose said jonathan

what said i thee meant something worse verily i have heard thee
uses bad language jonathan

by jingo said the youth indignantly there is no end to the
slanders people will say of one i use bad language by jingo

why thee is at it now said i let thy yea be yea and thy nay nay
for all beyond is profanity or folly but thee will allow jonathan
that when thee is among the people of the world thee uses the language
thereof forgetting the language of simplicity and sobriety which
would best become thy lips

ay there i plead guilty and with good reason too said jonathan
when i was a boy thee had thoughts of making me a merchant and thee
compelled me to study french and german now when i meet a frenchman
or a german unacquainted with the english tongue in what language does
thee suppose i address him

why french or german to be sure

verily i do said the youth and when i get among the people of the
world i speak to them in the language of the world for poor ignorant
creatures they don't understand quaker moreover uncle does thee
know ellen wild is of opinion we friends don't speak good grammar now
she and i spent a whole hour the other evening trying to parse thee
is thee does thee loves and so on and we could not work
them according to murray i say uncle does thee know of any command
in scripture to speak bad grammar

no said i but it is not forbidden and the phrases mentioned thou
knowest have crept into our speech as corruptions and are only used
for conversational purposes

truly said jonathan and the language of the world is used for
conversational purposes also i say uncle zachariah that now's a
clincher

i won't quarrel with thee on this account jonathan but how comes it
thou wert seen in that wicked place the theatre

by jingo said he snipe has been blabbing there too

what said i does thou strive to conceal it

yea said jonathan for when we do our good deeds we should do them
in secret uncle zachariah i went to the theatre in charity

thee did said i charmed more than i can express at the thought of
the young man's virtue

yes uncle said the youth and great need have the actors of
charity for a poorer set of fellows i think i never saw got together
and here the rogue fell a laughing in my face and so thee need not
distress thyself for i sha'n't go there again until they get a better
company but uncle zachariah thee has exhorted me enough for one
time and it is my turn now so do thou be conformable and answer my
questions for i can tell thee i have a fault to find with thee
according to thine own system of philanthropy it is thy duty to make
thy fellow-creatures happy now i ask thee whether thou dost not
think it thy duty to make me thy loving nephew happy as well as a
stranger

verily said i i do

why then said jonathan there is a short way of doing it uncle
zachariah i want to be married ellen and i have talked the matter
over and she says she'll have me now uncle thee did once talk of
giving me a counting-house and ten or twenty thousand dollars as the
case might be to begin a commission business and mr wild talked
of doing as much in the way of dowry to ellen and now i say uncle
zachariah as the shipwrecked sailor did when he prayed among the
breakers if thee means to help me now's the time

what said i have i so much property

thee is joking said the youth thee is a rich man and thee knows
thee can afford it but thee must do it soon or it may be too late
for i can tell thee folks begin to talk of thy philanthropy and say
thou art flinging away so much money that presently thou wilt have
nothing left to give me mr wild is of this mind and he has hinted
some things to me very plainly in a word uncle if thee does not
permit me to marry ellen soon he will break the match and so if thee
will make me a happy man 

i will said i with uncommon fervour thee shall marry the maiden
and i will straightway see what i can do for thee verily what is
wealth but the dross of the earth unless used to purchase happiness
for those that are worthy

at these words jonathan leaped for joy seized my hand and kissed it
vowed i was his dear old dad for all i was only his uncle and ran
from the room doubtless to impart the happy tidings to his mistress




 chapter iv


containing little or nothing save apostrophes exhortations and
quarrels



how happy was i to think i had conferred happiness upon another how
agreeable my sensations how delightful the approbation of my own
heart how much i rejoiced that my soul had at last found a habitation
equal to its wishes an abode of peace a dwelling of content if i am
zachariah longstraw said i to myself i will show myself worthy of
the name i will spend his money in the great cause of philanthropy i
will make the afflicted smile i will win the blessings of the poor
i will do more good than even zachariah longstraw himself yea of a
surety i will devote myself to a life of virtue

while i was making these virtuous resolutions the faithful abel snipe
came to my bedside and told me there were divers suffering creatures
widows with nine small children widowers with fourteen sick old
women and starving old men in great need of relief and so affecting
was the picture he drew of their griefs that the tears rolled from my
eyes and i bade him if there was any money he could honestly lay his
hands on carry comfort to them all

verily said he i have just collected the quarter's rent of the
house in market-street and it will be enough and more

relieve the poor afflicted creatures then and hark thee abel
snipe does thee consider me a rich man if so let me know where i
can find twenty thousand dollars to set up the young man jonathan in
business and marry him to the maiden ellen wild

alas said abel snipe of a verity the young man is in a hurry and
alas for of a verity if thee takes away at this time such a great
sum from thee possessions thee will cut off the right hand of thee
charity

and thereupon the benevolent creature after showing me which it was
easy to do that with the mere revenue of the sum demanded if kept
in our own hands we could carry smiles and rejoicing into at least a
hundred families every year exhorted me not to forget that i was the
friend of the afflicted nor to faint in the good work of philanthropy
jonathan was a very young man he said only twenty-five happy in
his youth happy in his affections happy in the certain prospect
he enjoyed of sooner or later arriving at the fullest felicity
why should he not then consent like us to forego for a while his
selfish desires contribute his portion to the wants of the poor
and by labouring a few years in their cause approve himself worthy
of fortune how much better that he should endure a fancied ill than
that a hundred afflicted families should be given up to actual want he
contended that the young man's request was untimely and selfish and
that i would only harden his heart while breaking a thousand others
if i granted it in short he said so many things and painted so many
affecting pictures of the miseries of my fellow-creatures and the
beauties of charity that my mind was quite changed on the subject and
i perceived it was my duty to resist the young man's wishes

this change on the morrow being the first day that i was able to sit
up i explained to jonathan exhorting him with a feeling enthusiasm
to tear all narrow selfish feelings from his heart and embark with
me like a virtuous youth in the great enterprise of philanthropy
he fell into a passion told me my philanthropy was a fudge and abel
snipe a rogue and hypocrite vowed i had a greater regard for knaves
and paupers than for my own flesh and blood and was flinging away my
money only to encourage vice and beggary it was in vain i sought to
pacify the indignant youth an evil spirit seized upon him he did
nothing for three days but scold reproach and complain he abused
the faithful abel to his face calling him a fox viper cormorant
harpy and i know not what beside all which abel endured with patience
and resignation for he was of a meek and humble spirit nay not
content with this he proceeded on the third day to greater lengths
and did very intemperately fall upon the said abel snipe tweaking
him by the nose and ears until the poor man yelled with pain and
even endeavoured to kick him out of the house after which being
censured for the same and i siding with abel as justice demanded in
the controversy his resentment grew to such a pitch that he left the
house declaring he would live with me no longer but leave me to ruin
myself at my leisure

this was an occurrence that caused me much pain for verily i had an
exceeding great love for the young man and i perceived that he was
treating me with ingratitude i was however greatly comforted by the
increased zeal and affection of the ever-faithful abel who coming to
me with tears in his eyes declared that he could not bear the thought
of being a cause of dissension between me and my nephew and therefore
besought me that i would discard him from my presence when i could
again live happily with my jonathan

i resisted while duly appreciating the good man's friendship and
fortunately there needed no such sacrifice on my part for on the
eleventh day jonathan returned of his own accord and confessing his
folly and entreating abel's forgiveness as well as mine was restored
again to favour his return itself was grateful to my feelings but
the reader may judge how great was my rapture when jonathan avowed
a change in his sentiments on the subject of philanthropy and
declared that the spirit at last moved him to think of his suffering
fellow-creatures he entreated to be conducted to the abodes of
affliction and there the conversion was completed he became a changed
man and in a few days was almost as zealous an alms-giver as myself i
took him to my arms and said 

now jonathan thee is a man in whom i no longer fear the seductions
of the flesh thee shall marry the maid ellen and be set up in
business

nay said jonathan not so i am yet but as a youth in years and
the time sufficeth for all things let not the whirl of business and
the joy of the honey-moon disturb the virtue that is yet young and
frail in my bosom of a verity ellen wild will wait till the fall and
if she don't and my heart should be broken verily i shall then be
better enabled to sympathize with the wretched

such was the lofty though new-born virtue of my jonathan

but of that as well as our works of benevolence i shall speak in the
following chapters




 chapter v


which is short and moral and can therefore be skipped


i have already said that the mere presence of the philanthropic
feeling now infused into my spirit filled me with happiness even
while i lay upon my back aching with wounds and bruises it may be
inferred therefore that my soul was ecstasy itself when restored at
last to health and strength i stalked into the air dispensing charity
with both hands

of a verity it was at least for a time and i will say that
during the first month of my new existence i experienced a thousand
agreeable sensations such as had never occurred to me in my whole life
before and here let me observe that if what i have to add shall
show that there are offsets of inconvenience and tribulation even
to the satisfaction of the benevolent i do not design to throw any
discredit on the virtue of benevolence itself which i truly regard
as one of the divinest of endowments angelic in its nature and
blessed in its effects when practised with discretion and amiable
if not lovely even in its folly i believe indeed that if heaven
looks with peculiar indulgence on the errors of any man it is in
the case of him who has the softest judgment for the errors and the
readiest reparation for the miseries of his fellows what i wish to
be understood is that man is an unthankful animal and of such rare
inconsistency of temper that he seldom foregoes an opportunity to
punish the virtue which he so loudly applauds

i was now a philanthropist and i will say which i think i may do
without shame the merit being less attributable to me than to that
worthy deceased personage whose body i inhabited that a truer
purer or more zealous one never walked the earth i should fill a
book as big as a family bible were i to record all the good things
i did or attempted while a tenant in zachariah longstraw's body
all my feelings and desires were swallowed up in one great passion
of philanthropy universal benevolence was the maxim i engraved upon
my heart i had no thought but to relieve the distresses meliorate
the condition and advance the happiness of my species my generosity
extended equally to individuals and communities i toiled alike in the
service of the beggar and the million putting bread into the mouth of
the one and infusing moral principles into the breasts of the others
in a word i was as i have called myself already a philanthropist
and if my virtue was somewhat excessive in degree it proceeded from
the sincerest promptings of spirit




 chapter vi


an inconvenience of being in another man's body when called upon to
give evidence as to one's own exit


it may be supposed that the treatment i for of a verity i myself
came in for some share of the hard usage that killed the true
zachariah had received from the base and brutal john smith must
have cooled my regard for him if it did not affect my feelings of
philanthropy in general i confess that i did regard that personage
with sentiments of disgust and indignation but nevertheless i was
very loath to appear against him when summoned as i was soon after
leaving my sick-bed to give evidence on the charges preferred against
him these were two in number and afforded matter for as many separate
endictments in the first and verily i was startled when i heard
it john smith was charged with the murder of abram skinner in the
second with an assault with intent to kill upon myself that is my
second self zachariah longstraw and also with robbery

now if the reader will reflect a moment upon the relation in which i
stood to these charges he will allow that the necessity of testifying
on them reduced me to a quandary in the first place i knew very well
that mr john smith rogue and assassin as he was had not killed
abram skinner but that i had finished that unhappy gentleman myself
and i knew also in the second that my admitting this fact would
without doing mr john smith any good produce a decided inconvenience
to myself not that there was any fear i should be arraigned for
murder but because nobody would believe me i remembered how my
telling the truth to my friend john darling the deputy attorney in
regard to my first transformation had caused him to believe me mad
and i foresaw that telling the truth on the present occasion would
reduce me to the same predicament and perhaps the friends mad-house
into the bargain

there was the same difficulty in relation to the second charge
accompanied by another still greater for whereas john smith was
there only accused of assault with intent to kill he had in reality
committed a murder which if i had affirmed as i must have done had i
affirmed any thing at all i should have been a living contradiction of
my own testimony and thus considered madder than ever

the truth is i was in a dilemma out of which the truth could not
extract me and the more i thought the matter over the greater was
my embarrassment a feeling of integrity within me for zachariah
longstraw was a man of conscience urged me to speak the truth while
common sense showed me how much worse than useless truth would be in
such an extraordinary conjuncture

i received a visit from the prosecuting attorney who very naturally
expected a clear and satisfactory account of mr john smith's doings on
the night of the murder and the difficulty i had with him that is
the attorney gave me a foretaste of what i was to expect when summoned
into the witness's box in court i remember that the gentleman after
plying me with many questions to which he got that sort of replies
invidiously termed quaker answers flew into a huff and threatened
me with what would be the consequence if i should prove backward in
court and sure enough his prediction was verified for not giving a
straight answer to any one question when the trial came on i received
divers reprimands from the court and was finally committed for a
contempt to prison where i lay two or three days until called into
court again to give evidence on the second endictment mr john smith
having been found not guilty on the first this was owing in part
i presume to the testimony of several surgeons who deposed that
there were no marks of violence upon abram skinner's body although
the evidence of the watchman who had seen him alive through the
window and afterward found john smith burying his dead body in the
same hole with myself went rather hard with him i say the acquittal
was perhaps owing in part to the testimony of the surgeons though
much of it might be attributed to the marvellous humanity that reigns
in the criminal courts of the city of brotherly love to the great
benefit and encouragement of that proscribed and injured class of men
namely murderers

i made little better work of the second attempt at witnessing but
as i have matters of much greater importance to demand my attention
and the reader can easily infer what i did and what i did not affirm
i must beg to despatch the second trial by relating that i was packed
off a second time to prison for contempt but that the evidence of the
watchman and my late wounds and bruises were esteemed sufficient
to secure the prisoner's conviction and accordingly john smith was
convicted and accommodated with lodgings in the penitentiary for the
fourth time

my own incarceration was of no long duration my contumacy as it
was called was considered extraordinary but it was generally
thought to be owing to a mistaken humanity and a perverted quixotic
conscientiousness such as are common enough among persons of the
persuasion i then belonged to this and perhaps the circumstance that
i was yet in feeble health for the trial as i said took place soon
after i left my bed caused me to be treated with lenity and in a few
days i was liberated

all this i beg the reader to understand happened before the
reconciliation with my nephew jonathan and of course before i had
well begun my career of philanthropy of that career of some of my
deeds of goodness and of the consequences they produced i shall now
speak




 chapter vii


the sorrows of a philanthropist


my benevolence was of a two-fold character being both theoretic and
practical in the latter sense is to be regarded the relief which i
granted with my own hands to such suffering persons as i could lay them
on and there was no way in which i did not personally relieve some one
wretch or other by the former i understand a thousand schemes which
i devised and framed to enlist the sympathies of communities and so
relieve the afflicted in a mass besides a thousand others which were
designed to bestow upon the poor and vicious that virtuous knowledge
and those virtuous principles which are better than alms of gold and
silver i instituted some half a dozen charitable societies to supply
fuel clothing food and employment to the suffering poor as well as
others to exhort them to economy industry prudence fortitude and
so forth i formed societies even among themselves classing divers
isolated creatures into bands who wrought in common and disposed of
their wares either in a shop kept for the purpose or at fairs i
established schools to keep the children of the poor out of mischief
and one in particular i supported solely from my own that is to say
zachariah longstraw's pocket

i bestowed much of my regards upon the poor wretches in prison doing
all that i was permitted to effect a reformation in their habits and
feelings and i took uncommon pains to scatter light and sentiments of
a civilized character among the worthy representatives of the green
island who make up so large a portion of our suffering population

and let it not be supposed that i neglected that other class of poor
creatures called negroes whom although allowed the name and most
of the privileges of freemen their white brethren refuse to take to
their bosoms merely because they have black faces woolly heads and
an ill savour of body for myself verily if they were not comely in
my sight nor agreeable to my nostrils i said heaven hath made them
so and although my nephew jonathan insisted that heaven had done the
same thing with other animals and that upon my principles men should
be as affectionate with pigs and badgers as they were with cats and
lap-dogs i perceived that they were my brethern and that it became me
to conquer the prejudices lying only in my eyes and nostrils i girded
my loins to the work and verily i prevailed over the weakness of the
old adam of a verity i was the african's friend

but oh the wickedness of the world and the ingratitude thereof the
heart of man is even as the soil of the earth which the more it is
stirred up by cultivation the more barren and worthless it becomes it
is as the fields of the ancient dominion where if a man soweth barley
and corn he shall reap a harvest of jamestown weed poke-berries and
scrub pines it is as the bulldog that one feedeth with beef and other
wholesome viands who the moment he has done his dinner snaps for
his dessert at the feeder's heel it is as the tender flowers which
in the winter-time a man taketh from the cold to warm by night
in his chamber and which smother him with foul air before morning
verily it was my lot to find even as my nephew jonathan had once
foolishly contended that even philanthropy is not secure from the
sting of unthankfulness that benevolence is in one sense the great
parent of ingratitude since it begets it for a period of full seven
months for so long did i remain in zachariah's body after recoving my
health i laboured to do good to my fellows and verily i laboured
with might and main yet had i toiled with the same energy to injure
and oppress i almost doubt whether i should have been rewarded with
more manifold outpourings of wrath and fury verily as i said before
the world is a wicked world and i begin to doubt whether man can make
it better

one of the first mishaps that befell me was of the following nature
stepping one morning into the mayor's office which was a favourite
haunt with me seeing that misery doth there greatly abound i fell
upon a man whom the magistrate was about to commit to jail for being
drunk and beating his wife and children he being unable to pay the
fine imposed upon him and to find surety for his future good behaviour

the spirit stirred within me as i beheld the contrite looks of the
culprit and i said to myself while he lies in jail his poor wife
and his infants may perish with hunger i paid the fine and though
the mayor did very broadly hint to me that a little punishment would do
the man good and his wife too seeing that he was a barbarous fellow
i offered myself for his security and thus sent him back to his
rejoicing family i said to myself this very night will i witness
the happiness i have created i went accordingly to the man's house
where i found the wicked fellow raving with drink and beating his
wife as before his children screaming with terror and the neighbours
crying out for a constable i did but say a word of reprehension to
him when the brutish ingrate leaving his rib fell foul of myself
mauling me cruelly and i believe he would have beaten me to death had
i not been rescued by the timely appearance of a constable thee sees
the end of thy humanity said the mayor when i entered his office
the next morning that my black eye and bruised visage might testify
against the ungrateful man thee will not object to my committing the
fellow now

nay said i it is drunkenness that has made the poor man mad
therefore lock him up in prison until his madness hath departed

i will said the mayor and thee will have the goodness to pay over
to the clerk the hundred dollars in which thee bound thyself that the
rascal should keep the peace

verily said i it is not just i should pay the money for the
beating was upon my own body

truly said the mayor and so it was and therefore it is the harder
that thee should have to pay it but pay it thee must the man having
broken the peace as much in beating thee as if it had been any other
citizen of the commonwealth

and so much satisfaction i had for befriending the sot the charity
which did more harm than good even to the man's poor family since it
exposed them a second time to his fury costing me without counting
the fine paid on the first day a sore beating and one hundred dollars

my next misadventure was the being cheated in a very aggravated way by
a poor man to whom i loaned money without exacting bond or voucher
the same being loaned to re-establish him in a gainful business which
had been interrupted by an unfortunate accident for having prospered
in his business and i requiring that he should now repay the money
that i might devote it to the service of others he very impudently
averred that he had never had any thing of me except advice and a good
word of recommendation here and there swore that he never paid away or
received a cent without giving or taking a receipt defied me to prove
my claim and concluded his baseness by threatening to kick me out of
his workshop

these instances of ingratitude were followed by others of a still
deeper die and so numerous that i can mention only a few of them

walking one day to that infant school which i had established to
keep children out of mischief while their hard-working parents were
at their daily labours i perceived the urchins standing at the door
pelting the passers-by with mud reproving them for this misconduct
the graceless vagabonds did speedily turn their battery upon myself
and not content to plaster and bespatter me with mud-balls from head
to foot they fell upon me and being very numerous did actually roll
me about in a gutter where was a deep slough so that i had nearly
perished with suffocation being sorely bruised into the bargain to
crown all having expelled from my school the ringleaders in this
marvellous outbreaking of precocious ingratitude i was visited by
their parents all of them abusing me for my tyrannical usage of their
children although of a truth the tyranny was all on the side of the
juveniles and impudently demanding that i should pay them for their
boys time at the rate of twenty-five cents a week each for as many
weeks as i had had them at school of a surety some people are very
unreasonable

it was also my misfortune to offend divers tailors and shopkeepers
by benevolently taking part in the efforts of their poor unfortunate
needle-women to obtain better wages and one day in the streets these
angry men did hustle me and tear a tail from my coat but i consoled
myself for this violence by thinking of the gratitude of the poor
creatures i was defending when making my way the following evening
to their place of assembly i was set upon by the whole crew for that
i did hint that as their difficulties did chiefly proceed from their
numbers there being more hands at the business of sewing than were
required they would greatly benefit themselves and the community
too by going two thirds of them at least into service there being
ever a great want of domestics in our respectable families i say i
did but hint this reasonable and undeniable truth together with a
friendly remark upon the exposed state of their morals when there
arose such a storm among them as was never perhaps witnessed by any
other human being hear the old hunks said one he wants to make
niggur servants of us us that is freeborn american girls yes
ladies said another and he is insinivating we are no better nor we
should be turn the old rip out said a third and turn him out
cried the other three hundred and fifty there present of a verity
they did assail me with both tongue and nail testifying such vigour of
spirit and strength of arm that were i a philanthropist now which
i fortunately am not and were i moved to consult their interests as
before i should endeavour to form them into a regiment of soldiers
not doubting that they would at any moment prevail over twice their
numbers of male fighting men of a verity i say they did violently
pull me about thrusting me at last from the apartment and their
ingratitude was a sore wound to my spirit




 chapter viii


the same subject continued


another evil that befell me about the same time was equally
afflicting a negro-man that had fled from bondage in a neighbouring
state being sharply hunted and about to be captured by the person
that called him his property i carried him to my house and there
concealed him for three days and mights until his master had departed
for said i of a surety slavery is a bitter pill and one that
cures neither the rheumatism nor the ague and therefore why should
my brother pompey be compelled to swallow it my brother pompey
having eaten drunk and slept at my expense for the three days
mentioned disappeared on the morning of the fourth before daylight
carrying with him twenty-seven pounds of silver in spoons teapots
and other vessels the three watches belonging to myself my nephew
and abel snipe as well as jonathan's best coat and trousers verily
i was confounded at the fellow's ingratitude and the loss of my
valuables all of which however though broken up it was my good
fortune to recover together with the three watches the thief himself
being taken was clapped into jail for a while and then surrendered
to his master and carried back to bondage and this stirring up the
choler of the free africans in town they did naught but cry out upon
me as the author of his misfortune surrounding my house with a mob
and proceeding to the length of even burning it down at least the
house taking fire and manifestly by the act of an incendiary it was
charged by my friends upon these raging foolish people though i was
never able to prove it upon any one in particular as my good fortune
would have it abel snipe had taken out a policy of ensurance so that
i recovered the money from the company but not without going to law
the company averring that my humanity rendered me careless

i caused another dwelling to be built and in building it received
another strong and inconvenient proof not merely of man's ingratitude
but of his natural hostility to the charity which benefits his
neighbours i bought my marble out of the prison in order to encourage
industry among the prisoners and thus lighten the load of taxation on
the community at large this being known the marble-cutters fell into
wrath denounced me as the friend of villany and the enemy of honest
industry and being joined by the shoemakers who had put me down in
their character-book as a patron to none but prison-workmen and by
divers other mechanics that had some grudge of the same kind they
seized upon me as i stood surveying my rising mansion and bedaubed
me from head to foot with thick whitewash painting in great black
letters on the broad of my back the following words namely the
rogue's friend which caused me after i had escaped from their hands
to be hooted at by boys and men along the street and to be bitten by a
great cur-dog that was amazed at my appearance

another misfortune still more distressing befell me one day as i
walked among the western suburbs seeking whom i might relieve i
espied a company of men surrounding a ring made with stakes and ropes
in which two wretched creatures were stripping off their garments with
the intention to do battle upon one another with their fists these
were gentlemen of the fancy as it is called though imagination can
paint nothing of a more grossly animal and brutish character afar
from all that is fanciful than that very class that calls itself of
the fancy i was shocked that the poor creatures should in their
ignorance agree to maul and beat one another for the amusement of
a mob and i was concerned that a mob containing so many rational
beings should be willing to harry on two such silly fellows to harm
each other for their pastime i stepped among them therefore and
addressed them exhorting them to peace and harmony and this producing
but little effect on them i upbraided them with breaking the laws
both human and divine and assured them i would go hunt up the police
to prevent the mischief they meditated alas how ungratefully they
used me there was a man at a distance who was heating a great pot of
tar to pay the bottom of a canal-boat and just a moment before a
carter had stopped to look on the affray leaving on the roadside his
cart on which among other articles of domestic furniture was an old
feather-bed lying on the top of all the devil had surely brought
these things upon the ground that his sinful children the gentlemen
of the fancy might be at no loss how to testify their hatred of
humanity the very combatants themselves were the first to seize me
and cry out tar and feather the old bother'em douse down the bed
and dab the pot off the fire and daub him well they cried all the
while that their wretched companions drowning the cries i made for
assistance with savage yells of rage and merriment covered me from
head to foot with the nasty pitch and then tearing the bed to pieces
emptied its contents over my reeking body then having feathered me
all over and so transformed me that i looked more like an ostrich than
a human being they tied me to a post where i was forced to remain
looking upon the fight that immediately ensued between the champions a
horrid sight it was but i was so devoured with shame and indignation
that i should have cared little had they dashed each other's brains
out so much i endured for exhorting men to live together in peace and
amity

the very beasts seemed to conspire to treat me with ingratitude
my first effort in their cause was an attempt i made one day on
the tow-path near the water-works to protect a poor broken-down
barge-horse which the driver was cruelly beating my interference
cost me a dip in the basin the man who was both savage and strong
pitching me in headlong and what i deemed still more provoking a
kick from the horse who let fly at me with his heels merely because
mine as they were tripped into the air came in contact with his
hind-quarters so that i was both lamed and half drowned for my charity

in the same way i was scratched half to death and much more savagely
than i had been before by the needle-women by a cat that i took out
of a dog's mouth without counting upon a nip that i had from the cur
also and to end this small catalogue of animal ingratitude i may
say that within a fortnight after i was served in the same way by a
rat that i strove to liberate from the fangs of my own gray tabby for
while tabby was clawing at my fingers the rat took me by the thumb
and between them i was near perishing with lockjaw the weather being
uncommonly hot and the time midsummer

there were a thousand other mischances of a like nature which befell
me but which i have not leisure to describe nor even to enumerate
some few of them however i think proper to record but to save
space i will clap them into a short list along with those already
mentioned where they may be examined at a glance and where in that
glance the reader may perceive what are sometimes the rewards of
philanthropy

 i beaten by a drunkard whom i had taken out of
 prison and bailed to keep the peace

 ii mulcted out of surety-money because
 my gentleman broke the peace by beating me

 iii driven and almost kicked out of a man's
 workshop because i asked payment of a loan
 made without bond or voucher

 iv my nose pulled by a merchant to whom i
 had out of charity to the latter who was
 unfortunate recommended a customer who
 swindled him

 v rolled in the mud by the boys of my own
 charity-school whom i had exhorted not to daub
 the passers-by

 vi abused by their parents for not paying them
 cents per week for the time i had the boys
 at school

 vii hustled by tailors slop-shopkeepers and
 others for taking part with the needle-women
 in a strike

 viii scolded scratched and tumbled down
 stairs by the needle-women for advising them
 to go into domestic service and take care of
 their morals

 ix robbed by a fugitive slave whom i had
 concealed three days and nights in my house
 from his master

 x house burnt down by the free blacks or so
 it was suspected for putting the thief as
 aforesaid into jail so that his master got him

 xi whitewashed and libelled on my own back by
 the stonecutters for buying wrought marble out
 of the prison

 xii tarred and feathered by a gang of the
 fancy whom i exhorted at the ring to peace and
 amity

 xiii scalded at my own house which i had
 converted at a season of suffering into a
 gratis soup-house and with my own soup by a
 beggar because there was too little meat and
 too much salt in it

 xiv soused in the canal by a boat-driver for
 rebuking his cruelty to an old barge-horse

such were some of the unhappy circumstances that rewarded a seven

more discouraging and afflicting




chapter ix


containing a difficulty


it is a common belief among those who are more religious than wise
that a man never catches a cold going to church of a wet sunday or
being baptized in midwinter i am myself of opinion the belief of
such good people to the contrary notwithstanding that many devout
persons by wading to church in the slush or washing out their sins
in snow-water have gone to heaven much sooner than they expected in
the same way and on the same principle of distrusting all miraculous
interposition of heaven in cases where human reason is sufficient
for our protection i have my doubts in the truth of another maxim
of great acceptation in the world namely that a man never grows
poor by giving i believe indeed that the charity of a discreet and
truly conscientious man never injures his fortune but may in many
instances actually tend to its increase since the love of benevolence
may stimulate him to new labours of acquisition that he may have the
greater means of doing good but i am also of opinion and i think it
may be demonstrated by a good accountant that a man who has a revenue
of a thousand a year and bestows fifteen hundred in charity will in
due course of time find himself as poor as his pensioners when a man
hath a goose with golden eggs whatever he may do with the eggs he
should take great care of the goose

the reader may infer from these remarks that my philanthropy was as
little profitable to my pocket as it proved to my person and such
indeed was the truth i am of opinion i should myself in a very few
years have consumed the whole estate of zachariah longstraw ample as
it was in works of charity how much faster it went with my nephew and
my friend abel to assist me may be imagined my nephew became a very
dragon of charity and dispensed my money upon such objects of pity as
he could find for he soon began to practise the profession upon what
abel called his own hook with a zeal little short of fury so that
to supply his demands i was sometimes obliged even to stint myself
had abel snipe been equally profuse there is no saying how soon i
might have found myself at the end of my estate but abel snipe was a
jewel his charity was great but his conscientiousness was greater he
had ever a watchful eye to my good and his solicitude to husband and
improve my means kept his benevolence within the bounds of discretion

but notwithstanding all his care abel perceived that our philanthropy
was beginning to eat holes into my possessions and coming to me one
day with a long face he assured me that unless some means were
devised to increase my income we should soon find ourselves driven to
resort to the capital

verily and of a truth said i not a whit frighted at this
communication and why should that chill us in the good work abel
snipe of a surety all that i possess is it not the property of the
poor

verily said abel verily and yea but if we betake us to the
capital verily it will happen that sooner or later it shall be
consumed and nothing left to us wherewithal to befriend the afflicted
i say to thee zachariah thy wealth is as thou sayest the property
of the poor and it becomes thee as a true and faithful servant
thereof to see that it be not wasted but on the contrary husbanded
with care and foresight and put out to profit so that the single
talent may become two and peradventure three whereby the poor as
aforesaid shall be twice and it may be thrice benefited

thou speakest the words of sense and seriousness said i struck by
the new view of the case but how shall this happy object be effected
what shall we do abel snipe to make the one talent three and thereby
increase our means of doing good

thee nephew jonathan said abel snipe with a look of devout joy is
now a changed man a man of seriousness and virtue a scorner of vain
things and a giver of alms a man whom we can trust i say to thee
zachariah thee shall establish thee nephew in a gainful business and
he shall make money thee shall give him what is thee property for
his capital remaining theeself but as a sleeping partner and thus
it shall happen that thee capital shall be turned over three times a
year producing on each occasion dividends three times as great as
now accrue from thy investments and thus zachariah and verily it
is pleasant to think upon where thee now has a thousand dollars of
revenue thee shall then have nine and where thee now relieves nine
afflicted persons thee shall there-upon relieve nine times nine which
is eighty-one

i need not assure the reader that this proposition of abel's fastened
mightily upon my imagination and that i was eager to embrace it and
jonathan coming in at the moment i repeated the conversation to him
assuring him that if he thought himself able with abel's assistance
to undertake such a business he should have my money to begin upon
instanter and marry the maiden ellen into the bargain

nay verily said jonathan i will not marry and i will not do
this thing whereof thee speaks uncle zachariah thee may think me
light of mind thus to speak of ellen wild who is much lighter but
of a surety i find the spirit moves me to regard her as one not to be
regarded any longer in the matter of the money-making i say let abel
snipe be thy merchant or whatsoever it may be thee has determined on
for abel snipe is a good business man and he knows how to make money
he shall have my advice and assistance as far as may be in my power
but truly my thoughts now run in the paths of the unfortunate and
thither let my footsteps follow also

to this proposal the faithful abel with tears in his eyes for he
was moved that jonathan should express such confidence in him at
last demurred averring that it would be better and more seemly
for jonathan himself to undertake the affair he abel snipe giving
help and counsel according to his humble ability jonathan objected
as before and again declared that abel and abel alone was as he
expressed it the man for my money in short the two young men
now the best friends in the world contested the matter each arguing
so warmly in favour of the other that it was plain the thing could
never be determined without my casting vote which i seeing that
jonathan was positive and bent upon a life of virtue gave in abel's
favour and it was resolved accordingly that abel should be made the
money-maker




 chapter x


in what manner mr zachariah longstraw determined to improve his
fortune


and now the question occurring to me i demanded into what kind of
business we should enter

that said jonathan is a question more easily made than answered
seeing that there are so many ways of making money in this wicked
world that an honest man can scarce tell which to choose among them
and then proceeded with great gravity to indicate divers callings
which he pronounced the most gainful in the world and all or any of
which he thought abel could easily turn his hand to

the first he advised was quackery the making and vending of nostrums
to cure all manner of diseases including corns and the toothache
which was a business that had the merit of requiring no previous study
or education a tinker or cobbler being just as fit to follow it as
a man that had read paracelsus and which besides as was evident
from the speed with which its professors in general stepped from the
kitchen-pot to the carriage was the quickest way of making a fortune
that could be imagined i should have thought the young man was joking
for he had that vice in him to the last had it not been for the
fervour with which he pointed out the advantages of the vocation a
great recommendation he averred was that it required no capital
beyond a few hundred dollars to be laid out in bottles and logwood
or some other colouring material pump-water he said was cheap and
as for the other sovereign ingredient it was furnished by the buyer
himself yes said jonathan faith is furnished by the buyer who
pays us for the privilege of swallowing it we sell men their own
conceits bottled up with green red and brown water and thereby we
make them their own doctors who then can say the calling of the quack
is not honest nay even philanthropic he is a public benefactor a
friend even of physicians for he frees them from the painful necessity
of killing by making men their own executioners

and thus he went on until i cut him short by averring that the whole
business was little better than wholesale cheating and murder he then
recommended we should make abel a tailor solemnly declaring that
next to quackery tailoring which was a quackery of another sort was
the most profitable trade that could be followed the mere gain from
cabbaging considering that an ingenious tailor got at least one inch
of cloth out of every armhole without counting the nails cribbed from
other parts of a coat being immense and his profits seeing that he
lost nothing by a bad customer that he did not charge to a good one as
certain and immutable as the laws of the medes and persians

in short my nephew jonathan was in the mood for expatiating on the
merits of all money-making vocations in which i should follow him
were i not urged by the exigencies arising from limited time and space
to adhere to my story he made divers recommendations none of which i
thought of weight and upon abel who had heard him with gravity and
attention i was at last forced to call for advice and assistance it
was his opinion and he advised accordingly that all the money i could
raise should be thrown into the stock-market where being applied to
purchase and sale in the usual way he had no doubt it could be made
to yield a revenue of at least twenty per cent and perhaps twice as
much and this proposal strange as it may seem to the reader after
the experience abram skinner had given me in such matters i did after
sundry doubts and hesitations finally agree to

verily said i this is a gainful business friend abel but of a
surety neither honest nor humane seeing that it is practised at the
expense of the ignorant and often the needy

verily no said abel snipe with fervour it shall be at the
expense of the rich and niggardly the man that is a miser and
uncharitable the broker and the gambler the bull and the bear our
dealings shall not be with the poor and ignorant man that dabbleth
in stocks but him will we charitably pluck from the grasp of the
covetous and thus protect while drawing from the covetous man those
alms of benevolence which he would never himself apply to the use of
the afflicted

verily said i pleased with the idea if we can make the covetous
man charitable it will be a good thing and if we can protect the
foolish ignorant person from his grasp it will be still better but
of a surety abel snipe this business will be as gambling

yea and verily said abel snipe it is as gambling when a gambler
follows it but in the hands of an honest man it is an honest
profession is not money bagged up in stocks and other investments as
merchandise and as merchandise shall it not be lawfully bought and
sold

and moreover said jonathan with equal earnestness if it be no
better than cheating and swindling this same buying and selling are
we not embarking in it out of charity verily uncle zachariah in
such a case as this the end sanctifies the means behold what is the
crying evil arising from money that is chartered in stocks whether it
be in banks rail-roads loans or otherwise this is money that is
not taxed for charitable purposes it is money appropriated solely to
the purposes of gain why is it that a private man should be taxed to
support the poor and a bank that has greater facilities for making
money be not taxed for the purpose at all verily uncle zachariah
we will do what the commonwealth should be doing we will impose a tax
upon the gains of chartered money and distribute the proceeds among
the needy

to make short work of the matter i will not pursue our debate further
but merely state that i was soon brought to consider abel snipe's
scheme the best honestest and most philanthropic in the world and
to agree that he should open an office as a stock-broker turning a
penny or two in that way while making much more by buying and selling
on his own account to this i was brought in a great measure by
the representations and arguments of jonathan among which i esteem
as still worthy of consideration that which stands above expressed
in his own words i am still of opinion that a tax and a round one
should be imposed upon the profits of all banks and other money-making
corporations the same to be specifically appropriated to hospitals
and other charitable foundations and perhaps also to public schools
in this way evil might be made productive of good and our avarice
rendered the parent of benevolence and knowledge of a verity my
philanthropy is not yet got out of me

the aforementioned arrangement was made at an early period of my new
existence that is to say at the close of spring and the faithful
abel soon began to render a good account of his stewardship by handing
me over divers handsome sums of money the profits of his speculations
which jonathan and myself disbursed with rival enthusiasm the
experiment was continued in a prosperous manner until the month of
september when there happened a catastrophe not less unexpected than
calamitous




 chapter xi


in which a catastrophe begins


the various mischances and afflictions as narrated in the preceding
chapter which rewarded my virtue had begun to affect my mind with
sundry pangs of melancholy and misgiving i perceived that the world
was ungrateful and i had my doubts whether it was a whit the better
for my goodness these doubts and this persuasion were confirmed by
the experience of each succeeding day and by the month of september
as aforesaid i found myself becoming just as miserable a man as i
had ever been before and perhaps more so being pierced not merely
with the ingratitude of those i had befriended but convinced that the
unworthiness of man was a thing man was determined to persevere in

it was at the moment of my greatest distress that the catastrophe
alluded to before happened and this was nothing less than the
sudden bankruptcy of abel snipe whereby i was reduced in a moment
from affluence to destitution and what made the calamity still more
painful was a conviction forced upon me by my own reflections as
well as the representations of others that the failure could not have
happened without a fraudulent design on the part of the fiduciary
it is true this worthy gentleman was the first to inform me of his
mishap which he did with tears in his eyes and with divers outbreaks
of self-accusation and despair he declared that his imprudence had
ruined me his benefactor and implored me his benefactor to knock
him on the head with a poker i had begun to embrace in my agitation
but how he had effected such a catastrophe i could not bring him
clearly to explain the only answers i could get from him were
speculation speculation bad speculation ruined my benefactor
might as well have murdered thee and so on and having given vent to
some dozen or more of such frantic interjections he ran out of the
house

enter jonathan the very next moment the sight of him renewed my grief
he poor youth was ruined as well as myself yet not wholly for
as good luck would have it i had a week or two before after long
cogitation on the subject resolved to marry him to the maid ellen
wild and so secure his happiness more certainly than it appeared
to me it could be secured by a life of philanthropy to effect this
desirable purpose i bestowed upon him the only property which i had
not thought fit to put into abel snipe's hands being the new house i
was then building promising also to add a sum of money as soon as it
could be conveniently withdrawn from the concern he received the gift
and the promise with much joy and gratitude but betrayed surprising
indifference on the score of matrimony saying that he was in no great
hurry and in fact giving me to understand that there was a difference
between him and the maiden

jonathan said i as soon as i saw him thee is a ruined young man
abel has broken

all to smash said jonathan i know all about it horrible pickle
we're in but i say uncle if thee can borrow twenty thousand dollars
we can save friend abel yet

does thee say so said i is it true

verily said jonathan i have looked over the demands and twenty
thousand dollars by nine o'clock to-morrow will make all straight but
where will thee get twenty thousand dollars

where said i fairly dancing for joy it was but two days since
that thy friend ebenezer wild did offer me exactly the sum of twenty
thousand dollars for the new house as it stood not knowing i had
conveyed it to thee until i told him the same as a reason why i could
not take such a handsome offer

well said jonathan opening his eyes what then

surely said i if he would give twenty thousand then he will give
twenty thousand now and so jonathan 

and so said jonathan thee wants me to sell the house does thee
and give thee back the money uncle zachariah thee should be a little
more reasonable thee must remember that the house is mine and as
it seems to be all i am ever to get why uncle thee must excuse me
but i have no notion of parting with it

if jonathan had picked up the poker and served me the turn abel snipe
had so piteously entreated me to serve him that is knocked me on the
head i could not have been more shocked and horror-struck than i was
by these words

what jonathan said i does thee refuse to save me from ruin me
who have been a father to thee and given thee all that thou hast

no said jonathan coolly i am not so bad as that but as this
house is all i have i can't think of running too much risk with it
suppose thee borrows that twenty thousand dollars that ebenezer wild
has so handy he is thy friend as well as mine or suppose thee tries
some of thy other friends thee has often loaned to them and not often
borrowed sure thee has many friends who can spare money better than i
can

oh thou ungrateful young man said i

don't go to call me hard names said the perfidious and unfeeling
youth for if thee comes to that uncle zachariah i can tell thee
thee is the ungrateful man though not a young one haven't i been
as a son to thee for eighteen long years haven't i humoured all thy
foolish old notions even to the point of giving alms talking about
virtue and philanthropy and so on haven't i given up ellen wild to
please thee and hasn't thee after all my pains choused me out of
the portion i had a right to expect of thee except a poor beggarly
unfinished house only worth twenty thousand dollars yes thee
has uncle zachariah thee can't deny it don't thee talk to me of
ingratitude

thou art a viper said i

if i am said jonathan in a huff i won't stay to be trodden on

and with that the heartless creature tossing up his head like an
emperor stalked out of the house leaving me petrified by the enormity
of his baseness




 chapter xii


in which the catastrophe is continued


i was indeed so shocked so overwhelmed by ingratitude coming
from such a quarter that it was some time before i could recover
myself sufficiently to think of the steps necessary to be taken for
my preservation i remembered however that he even he my thrice
unfeeling nephew had recommended me to borrow of my friends what would
be enough to retrieve my affairs from ruin i ran from the house not
doubting that i could easily raise the sum fifty paces distant was my
new house that is jonathan's my old friend ebenezer the father of
the maid ellen was standing before it looking up to the carpenters
who were nailing the shingles on the roof

ebenezer said i thee is my friend does thee know i am on the
brink of ruin

very sorry said ebenezer all the town-talk looked for nothing
better perhaps thee will sell the house pho i forgot thee gave it
to jonathan

ebenezer wild said i if thee is my friend lend me that twenty
thousand dollars it will save me from ruin

really mr longstraw said ebenezer wild who was no quaker though
his father had been before him i am surprised a reasonable man
should make such a request i have told you twenty times you would ruin
yourself by your cursed philanthropy can't consent to be ruined with
you pity you mr longstraw awfully swindled wonder you could trust
such a knave as abel snipe sorry to hear matters look so black for
jonathan thought better of him quite unnatural to be defrauded by
one's own flesh and blood

what ebenezer meant by his concluding remarks i did not at that
moment understand but i comprehended them well enough when i had run
to five or six other friends rich men like him all of whom treated
my request to borrow with as little respect while all wound up their
commonplace condolings by assuring me first that abel snipe had
swindled me and secondly that there was much reason to believe my
nephew jonathan had done the same thing

reader this is a very wicked world we live in my philanthropy did not
make me as philanthropy often does selfish with my friends i felt as
much pleasure in obliging one who happened to be in a difficulty with
a loan of any sum within my reach as in relieving actual distress of
twelve different persons whom i now sought in my dilemma i had in this
manner at different times obliged no less than eleven of not one
of whom could i now borrow a dollar every man pitied my misfortune
every one inveighed with becoming severity against the villany of those
by whom i was ruined but every one was astonished that a reasonable
man like me should expect another reasonable man to part with his
money in short it was evident that my friends loved borrowing better
than lending and i left the door of the twelfth with the agreeable
conviction on my spirit that human nature was of the nature of a
stone i being the only man of the thousand million in the world that
had actually a heart in my bosom

this consideration was racking enough but it made a small part of my
distress every man had charged my friend honest abel snipe with
having swindled me as ebenezer wild had charged before and every one
in like manner swore that my nephew jonathan had borne a part in the
nefarious transaction this seemed to me incredible enough but when
i remembered jonathan's late behaviour his unexpected defection his
hard unfeeling nay his treacherous selfishness i felt prepared to
believe almost any wickedness that might be said of him

i ran to abel's office resolved to sift the affair to the bottom the
work was already done to my hands i found the office full of people
some of whom were officers of the police who had seized upon books and
papers and awful to be said the body of abel snipe and all raging
with vociferation and confusion except the latter worthy who looked
as if astounded out of his senses it's a clear case of swindling
cried a dozen voices as i entered a design to defraud fraud from
beginning to end flagrant scandalous scoundrelly swindling  nay
worse than swindling it is a conspiracy jonathan has confessed
it been going on this three months jonathan has confessed it

jonathan had confessed it confessed what why confessed as every one
gave me to understand and confessed in the hands of justice for it
seems he had been arrested that he and abel snipe had entered into a
conspiracy to defraud me of my property which had been carried on from
the moment that the latter was established in business and was now
completed by a long-designed bankruptcy

let the reader imagine my feelings at this disclosure of ingratitude
and villany so monstrous

my best friend a man whom i had wrested from the extremity of poverty
and disgrace and my only relative a youth whom i had adopted and
reared as my son who was my heir at law and the living partner as
i may say in all my possessions had leagued together feloniously to
deprive me of what i never denied them the privilege to share to rob
to fleece to reduce me to beggary

words cannot paint my grief i crept away from the scene of confusion
ashamed of my manhood ashamed even of my philanthropy i reached the
door of my house it was just dusk a poor man standing at the door
implored my charity for a miserable creature as he called himself go
to the devil said i

you are zachariah longstraw said another man tapping me on the
shoulder i am said i supposing he was a beggar like the other
and you may go to the devil too

very much obliged to you said the man but you're my prisoner and
so come along if you please and with that he took me by the arm and
began to march me down the street




 chapter xiii


the dănouement of the drama


why i was arrested and at whose instance i knew not i was too
downcast and spirit-broken to inquire i had doubtless divers small
debts due to persons with whom i was accustomed to deal and it seemed
to me natural enough as all men were ungrateful rascals that all
such persons now that i was known to be penniless should fall upon
me without shame or mercy demanding their dues i say i thought such
a consummation was natural enough and i asked no questions of my
captor i let my head drop upon my bosom and without resisting or
remonstrating and looking neither to the right nor the left suffered
him to conduct me whither he would

our progress was rapid our journey short in a few moments i found
myself led into a house and ushered into a lighted apartment

i looked up to see into what alderman's hands i had fallen the reader
may judge of my surprise amounting almost to consternation when i
beheld myself in an elegant saloon brilliantly lighted and surrounded
by a dozen or more gayly-dressed people of both sexes among whom was
my friend ebenezer wild and two or three others whose countenances
seemed familiar but whom in my surprise and confusion i did not
immediately recognise

a maiden beautiful as the morning and smiling as if her little heart
was dancing out of her eyes ran from the throng and seized me by the
hands crying 

now uncle zachariah thee shall pay me what thee owes me or be
turned over to some other creditor

i looked upon her in astonishment and began to fancy i was in a dream

what said my friend ebenezer don't you know my little ellen and
thereupon he added other expressions but what they were i retain no
remembrance of my wits being utterly amazed and confounded

to make my confusion still greater the door suddenly opened and in
rushed my nephew jonathan dressed like a dandy of the first water
in a blue cloth coat with shining buttons white trousers and satin
waistcoat and exclaiming bravo and victoria as if a very demon
of joy and exultation possessed him as soon as he beheld me he ran
forward snatched one of my hands from the maiden and dropping on his
knees cried with a comical look of contrition 

forgive me all my sins uncle zachariah and i'll behave better for
the future

oh thou ungrateful wretch said i how canst thou look me in the
face having ruined me

don't say so cried ellen wild you don't know how jonathan has
saved you

the deuse he don't said jonathan jumping up why then we've got
the play all wrong i say uncle don't look so solemn and wrathful
you are no more ruined than i am and you are out of the clutches of
the harpy

haven't i been swindled said i

unutterably said jonathan but as the swindler has been swindled
also there's no great harm done uncle zachariah a'n't you satisfied
abel snipe is a rascal

i am said i but what shall i say of thee

that i have broken the spell the villain cast over your senses said
jonathan and so saved you from the ruin your confidence invited him
to attempt uncle zachariah you think i am as bad as abel now listen
to my story i knew that abel snipe was a rogue and hypocrite but
could not make you believe it i saw that he was daily fleecing you
of sums of money under pretence of giving to the poor that he was
artfully goading and inflaming your benevolence into a passion nay
into a monomania for uncle everybody said you were mad for his
own base purposes and that sooner or later he would strip you of
every thing this i could not make you believe i resolved you should
see it i turned hypocrite myself and began to fleece you ten times
harder than abel the rogue was alarmed he perceived i was ousting him
from his employment that i had greater facilities for cheating having
more of your affection than himself his alarm added to another
feeling which you shall hear all about brought him into the trap from
which cautiousness at first secured him i convinced him i was as great
a rogue as himself and he then agreed with me yes uncle formally
agreed to join in a plan to strip you of fortune we arranged the
whole scheme from beginning to end the business the speculations the
bankruptcy abel was to play sir smash his reputation could stand it
the sums received from you were to be handed over to me and accounted
for as lost in bad speculations to make which appear straight his
books were filled with fictitious sales and purchases very ingeniously
got up after the grand crash we were to make a division of the
plunder he being content honest man to receive one fourth of which
he considered himself secure enough as long as i had any value for
good name or fear of the penitentiary now you may wonder how such a
cautious rogue could be so easily gulled here stands the fairy said
jonathan pointing to the maid ellen who dazzled the eyes of his
wisdom yes uncle would you believe it the impudent the audacious
fellow had the vanity to think he had found favour in her eyes at a
time when i had lost favour in those of her father you must know we
had a coolness that is father wild and i it was about you that
confounded philanthropy but we'll say nothing of that i used to
communicate with ellen by letter and abel was often my ganymede now
you must know ellen is a coquette 

fy jonathan said the damsel it was all that vicious abel's
presumption and folly because i was glad to see him and treated him
well just because he brought me letters oh the monster i soon saw
what was running in his head

yes said jonathan ellen's a much smarter girl than people suppose
her

oh you great quaker bear said the maiden

well continued jonathan she boasted her conquest and then i saw
i had the ogre by the nose it was this put me upon turning swindler
i had a talk with father wild who approved my plan and ellen agreed
to cultivate abel's good opinion as far as a smile or two we affected
to quarrel i began to coquet with another abusing poor ellen to abel
as hard as i could until he was persuaded the breach between us was
incurable ellen gave him a smile her papa became condescending in a
word the rascal thought nothing was wanting to make him the happiest
man in the world save the one full fourth of his patron's estate and
as much more as he could cheat me of here was the rock upon which abel
split and split he has he is now safe the moment matters came to
a crisis which was this afternoon i ran to a magistrate my friend
jones there pointing to an elderly gentleman who had entered with
him and made confession of our roguery deposed the whole matter
accused myself and abel of conspiracy to defraud and so forth and so
forth and was admitted to the honourable privileges of evidence for
the commonwealth and allowed to walk about on bail while my rascally
colleague takes up his lodgings in prison there's the whole story i
have exposed snipe's rogueries and secured his conviction and what
is equally agreeable i have saved your property here uncle you
called me a viper i only wanted to make you believe i could be
ungrateful as well as others by-the-way that was a plan of father
wild's to have your friends refuse to assist you they were let into
the secret and i recommended you to apply to them here uncle you'll
see what a viper i am he continued a little impetuously here are
the deeds for the house here is a roll of bank-notes i cheated you
of to play the philanthropist you will be surprised at the amount
but i did spend some i confess for there are wretches who deserve
our charity and here and here and here you have the property out of
which abel and i conspired to cheat you at least the chief part of
it the rest we will soon get possession of having laid the villain in
limbo here uncle zachariah take them and be as philanthropic as you
please we have no fear of you now your familiar is tied up take your
property and much good may it do you as for me i am content to take
ellen that is if you have no objection

this was a turn of circumstances that confounded me more than ever
and verily i knew not whether i was standing on my head or feet i
stood staring jonathan in the face without saying a word until the
youth was seized with the idea that the surprise of the thing had
turned my wits at which being alarmed he took me again by the hand
and said with the tears in his eyes 

oh my dear uncle do consider it is nothing more than a joke and
that i never meant to offend thee

no said i thee did not therefore thee shall have it all and thee
shall marry the maiden

and with that being seized with uncommon generosity or perhaps not
well knowing what i did i put into his hands the conveyance of the
house the bank-bills and other papers which he had given me but a
moment before and turned to leave the house

stay uncle i am just going to be married said he and stay
zachariah said a dozen others when some one suddenly calling
out let him go he is afraid of being turned out of meeting if he
witnesses the ceremony i was suffered to obey the impulses of the
spirit within me and walk out of the house which i did without
exactly knowing what i was doing

to tell the honest truth as indeed i have been trying to do all
along i was in a kind of maze and bewilderment of mind which the
first shock of ruin had produced and which jonathan's story rather
increased than diminished the effect of this was divided in my brain
with the impression of the various proofs of ingratitude and baseness
to which the day had given birth the latter however being greatly
preponderant of one feeling only i had entire consciousness and that
was a hearty disgust of philanthropy coupled with a sense of shame at
having been so basely cheated as i seemed to have been on all sides i
had been cheated out of my senses as the saying is and the only cure
for me was to be cheated into them again which was not an agreeable
reflection the whole affair being a reproach on my good sense

on the whole i felt very melancholy and lugubrious and began to
have my thoughts of leaving zachariah longstraw's body at the first
convenient opportunity the great difficulty was however to find a
tenement in which i might promise myself content the disappointment i
had experienced in my present adventure having filled me with doubts
as to the reality of any human happiness at least said i to myself
i will henceforth look before i leap i will cast mine eyes about me
i will gird up my loins and look abroad into the human family and
peradventure i shall find some man whose body is worth reanimating
yea verily i will next time be certain i am not putting my soul as
the pickpocket did his hand into a sack of fish-hooks

with this resolution on my mind i walked towards my house and was just
about to pass the door when an adventure befell me which knocked the
aforesaid resolution entirely on the head but before i relate it my
conscience impels me to make one remark which i beg the reader if he
be a man of fortune and blood to peruse without excusing himself on
the score of its dulness




 chapter xiv


a remark in which the author appears as a politician and abuses both
parties


there are other persons besides zachariah the philanthropist who
have experienced the ingratitude of the poor and truth to say if
we can believe the accounts of those who profess to have the best
means of judging there is more of it among that class of beings in
the united states than in any other christian land if it be so let
not the reader wonder at its existence it springs like a thousand
other evils of a worse because of a political complexion from that
constitution of society which notwithstanding its being in opposition
to all the interests of the land and the character of our institutions
is founded in and perpetuated by the folly of the richer classes it
lies not in the natural enmity supposed to exist between the rich
and the poor but in the unnatural hatred provoked in the bosoms of
the one by the offensive pride and arrogance of the other the poor
man in america feels himself in a political view as he really is
the equal of the millionaire but this very consciousness of equality
adds double bitterness to the sense of actual inferiority which the
richer and more fortunate usually do their best as far as manners
and deportment are concerned to keep alive why should the folly of
a feudal aristocracy prevail under the shadow of a purely democratic
government it is to the stupid pride the insensate effort at pomp and
ostentation the unconcealed contempt of labour the determination
manifested in a thousand ways and always as unfeelingly as absurdly
to keep the base mechanical aware of the gulf between him and his
betters in a word to the puerile vanity and stolid pride of the
genteel and refined that we owe the exasperation of those classes in
whose hands lie the reins of power and who will use them for good or
bad purposes according as they are kept in a good or bad humour it
is to these things we trace besides the general demoralization ever
resulting from passions long encouraged besides the unwilling and
unthankful reception of benefits coming from the hands of the detested
all those political evils which demagoguism agrarianism mobocracism
and all other isms of a vulgar stamp have brought upon the land
there is pride in the poor as well as the rich the wise man and the
patriot will take care not to offend it

reader if thou art a rich man and despisest thy neighbour remember
that he has a thousand friends of his class where thou hast one of
thine and that he can beat thee at the elections if thou art a
gentleman remember that thy cobbler is another or thinks himself
so which is all the same thing in america at all events remember
this namely that the poor man will find no fault with thy wealth
if thou findest none with his poverty




 chapter xv


an uncommon adventure that befell the author


i said that just as i arrived at the door of my dwelling an adventure
befell me and truly it was such an extraordinary one as has happened
to no other individual in the land since the days of the unfortunate
william morgan as i passed towards the door a man whose countenance i
could not see for it was more than two hours after nightfall and who
seemed to have been lying in wait on the stoop suddenly started up
exclaiming in accents highly nasal and somewhat dolorous

well i guess if there's no offence there's no mistake i rather
estimate that you're mr zachariah longstraw

well friend and what is that thy business said i in no amiable
tone

well not above more than's partickilar said the stranger but
i've heern tell much on your goodness and i'm in rather a bit of the
darnedest pickle jist now with a sick wife and nine small children
the oldest only six years old that ever you heerd tell on and so i
rather estimated 

thee may estimate theeself to the devil said i how can the oldest
child of nine be only six years old

oh darn it said the fellow there was three on em twins but if
you'll jest step round to my wife she'll tell you all about it always
heern you was a great andyfist or what-d-ye-call-it

then thee has heard a great lie said i and so thee may go about
thee business for i'll give thee nothing

well now do tell said the man with a tone of surprise that
conveyed a part of the emotion to myself particularly when by way
of pointing his discourse with the broadest note of admiration he
suddenly clapped a foot to my heels and laid me sprawling on the broad
of my back

my astonishment and wrath may well be imagined but they were nothing
to the terror that beset me when recovering a little from the
stunning effects of the fall i opened my mouth to cry aloud and found
it instantly stuffed full of handkerchiefs or some such soft material
which the pretended beggar took that opportunity to gag me with the
next moment i felt myself whipped up from the ground and borne aloft
like a corpse on the shoulders of two men who trudged along at a
rapid pace and apparently with the greatest unconcern possible for
some of the people in the street hearing my groans which were the only
sounds i could make and demanding what was the matter were answered
by my cool captors oh nothing more than's partickilar only a poor
mad gentleman that broke hospital guess he won't do it again raving
mad and hollers a gag out i say sam hold fast to his legs and
don't let him jump for i rather estimate if he gets loose he'll kill
some on these here people

the villain i had begun to hope my moans and struggles which i made
for the purpose as loud and furious as i could having no other way of
calling for help would cause some of the persons collected to arrest
the rogues and inquire into the matter a little more closely but no
sooner had the villain expressed his fears of the mischief i might do
than all inquiries ceased and a horrible scraping and rattling of feet
told me that assistance and curiosity had scampered off together

in three minutes more i found myself clapped into a little covered
or rather boxed wagon such as is used by travelling tinmen and
held fast by one of the rogues while the other seized upon the reins
and whipping up a little nag that was geared to it we began to roll
through the streets at a round gait and with such a rattle of wheels
and patty-pans that there was little hope of making myself heard had
i possessed the voice even of an oyster-man my companion took this
opportunity to secure my wrists in a pair of wooden handcuffs and
to lock my feet in a sort of stocks secured against the side of the
wagon then overhauling the handkerchiefs and arranging them more to
his liking though not a whit more to mine he opened his mouth and
spoke saying

now uncle longlegs i estimate we'll be comfortable so keep easy
or if you will grunt just grunt in tune and see what sort of a
bass you'll make to old hundred

with that the rascal after pitching his voice so as to accommodate
mine as much as possible began to sing a song of which all that i
recollect is that it related the joys of a travelling tinman tricks
rogueries and all that it began somewhat in the following fashion 

 when i was a driving along down east
 i met old deacon dobbs on his beast
 the beast was fat and the man was thin 
 i'll cheat deacon dobbs says i to the skin 

that it was as long and soporific as a state constitution or a
governor's message that it was actually sung to a psalm-tune or
something like it and that during the eleventh twelfth thirteenth
and half of the fourteenth stanza the little wagon rolled leisurely
over a long and hollow-sounding bridge which i had no doubt was one of
the wooden rialtos of the schuylkill having passed which the driver
whipped up and away we went at a speed of at least six miles an hour




 chapter xvi


in which sheppard lee takes a journey and discovers the secret object
of his captors


verily reader the thing was to me as an amazement and a marvel and
the wonder thereof filled my spirit with anguish and perturbation
but if i was dismayed at my seizure and abduction at my involuntary
journey prolonged through the space of a whole night how much greater
was my alarm to find it continued for five days and nights longer
during which i was never allowed to speak or breathe the fresh air
except when my captors halted to rest and eat which they did at
irregular intervals and always in solitary places among woods and
thickets it was in vain that i demanded by what authority they treated
me with such violence what purpose they had in view and whither
they were conducting me the rogues assured me they were very honest
fellows who made their living according to law and had no design to
harm me and as to what they designed doing with me that they said
i should know all in good time recommending me in the meanwhile
to take things patiently i studied their appearance well they were
common-looking personages with a vulgar shrewdness of visage and
would have been readily taken for yankee pedlers of the nutmeg and
side-saddle order that is of the inferior branch of that adventurous
class as indeed they were there was nothing of the cut-throat about
them whatever and i soon ceased to feel any apprehension of their
doing me a personal injury but what did the villains mean what was
their object in carrying me off what did they design doing with me
to these questions which i asked myself and them in vain i had on
the sixth day of my captivity an answer and verily it was one that
filled me with horror and astonishment oh the wickedness of man
the covetousness the depravity the audacity the enterprise and
originality thereof

during the first three days of my captivity my roguish captors had
taken great pains to conceal me from and to prevent any noises i might
make from being heard by any persons they met on the road on the
fourth day they relaxed somewhat from their severity on the fifth they
unbound my arms and on the sixth they even removed the gag from my
mouth assuring me however that it should be replaced if i attempted
any outcries and giving me moreover to understand that i was now
in a land where outcries would be of no service to me whatever and
indeed i had soon the most mournful proof that in this particular
they spoke nothing but the truth

the evening before i heard while passing by a farmhouse a great
sawing of fiddles and strumming of banjoes with a shuffling of feet
as of people engaged in a dance while a voice which i knew by its
undoubted congo tang could be none but a negro's sang in concert
with the fiddles 

 ole vaginnee nebber ti ah
 kick'm up juba a leetle high ah 

or something to that effect and while i was marvelling what could
make a negro in pennsylvania chant the praises of virginia having
rolled a little further on i heard far in the distance while our
little nag stopped to drink from a brook the sound of many voices
which i knew also were those of negroes they were labourers husking
corn in the light of the moon and singing as they laboured and
verily there was something uncommonly agreeable in the tones now
swelling now dying in the distance as many or fewer voices joined
in the song there was a pleasing wildness in the music but it was
to me still more enchanting as showing the light-heartedness of the
singers verily said i forgetting my woes in a sudden impulse of
philanthropy the negro that is free is a happy being not doubting
that i was still in pennsylvania

but oh how grievously this conceit was dispersed on the following
morning i was roused out of sleep by the sound of voices and clanking
of chains and looking from the door of my prison which my conductors
had left open to give me air i spied just at the tail of the cart a
long train of negroes men women and children of whom some of the
males were chained together the children riding for the most part in
covered wagons while two white men on horseback armed with great
whips and pistols rode before and behind keeping the whole procession
in order

what said i filled with virtuous indignation and thrusting my head
from the cart so as to address the foremost rider what does thee
mean friend are these people slaves or freemen and why dost thou
conduct them thus in chains through the free state of pennsylvania

pennsylvanee cried the man with a stare i reckon we're fifty
miles south of mason's and dixon's and fast enough in old virginnee

virginia said i seized with dismay before i could add any thing
farther one of my captors jumping from the front of the cart where
he had been riding with the other clapped to the door of the box
swearing at me for an old fool who could not keep myself out of
mischief

hillo stranger i heard the horseman cry to my jailer what white
man's that you've got locked up thaw

oh darn it was the answer it's an old fellow of the north jist
as mad as the dickens

friend cried i from my prison seized with a sudden hope of escape
the man tells thee a fib if thee is an honest man and a lover of the
law i charge thee to give me help for these men are villains who
have dragged me from my home contrary to law and now have me fastened
up by the legs

i say strange-aw by hooky cried the horseman in very emphatic
tones addressing himself to my captor as i saw through a crack while
his companion rode up to his assistance what's the meaning of all
this he-aw what aw you doing toting a white man off in this style
like a wild baw

what a wild baw was i could not conveniently comprehend but i saw
that i had lighted on a friend who had the power to deliver me from
thraldom

my name said i is zachariah longstraw and i can reward thee for
thy trouble

you hear him said my jailer with all imaginable coolness well
now darn it if i must tell it is zachariah longstraw the famous
zachariah longstraw you understand and here he nodded and winked at
the questioner with great significancy but as it appeared all in
vain

never heard of the man in my life said my friend and i've followed
niggur-driving ever since i could hold a two-year-old bo pig

what cried my jailer never heard of zachariah longstraw the
famous abolitionist

abolitionist cried the two horsemen together and they cried it
with a yell that made my hair stand on end can't say ever heard the
name but reckon he's one of them aw new-yorkers and yankees what
sends cendiary things down he-aw i say strange-aw is it a true
right up-and-down no-mistake abolitionist

darn it i think you'd say so if you had ever read the papers

jist open the box then and if i don't take the scalp off him call me
a black man

you won't do no sitch thing meaning no offence said my jailer
didn't go to the expense to fetch him so far for nothing and don't
mean him for the virginnee market bound down to louisianee stranger
that's the best market for abolitionists seen a public advertisement
offering fifty thousand dollars for fellers not half so bad i rather
estimate we'll get full price for our venture

with that my jailers whipped up and succeeded in putting a proper
distance betwixt them and that ferocious person who had such a desire
to rob me of my scalp




 chapter xvii


containing other secrets but not so important


reader if thou art an abolitionist and verily i hope thou art
not thou wilt conceive the mingled wo and astonishment with which
i listened to these words of the chief kidnapper whose christian
name by-the-way was joshua though as for his surname i must
confess i never heard it and appreciate even to the cold creeping
of the flesh the terrible situation in which i was placed i was an
abolitionist or at least my captors chose so to consider me and
they were now carrying me down south to sell me on speculation for
this they had kidnapped me for this they had fastened me up by the
legs like a wild baw for this but it is vain to accumulate phrases
expressive of their villany and my distresses what mattered it to my
captors if after all i was no abolitionist for of a verity
though opposed in principle to the whole institution of slavery my
mind had been so fully occupied with other philanthropic considerations
that i had had no time to play the liberator it was all one to my
captors the genius which could convert a hemlock-knot into a shoulder
of bacon a bundle of elder twigs into good havana cigars and bags of
carpet-rags into bologna sausages could be at no fault when the demand
was only to transform a peaceable follower of george fox into a roaring
lion of abolition i felt that they had got me into a quandary more
dreadful than any that had ever before afflicted my spirit i knew we
were already far south of mason's and dixon's

the moment my vile kidnappers slackened their speed a little having
ridden hard to escape the negro-drivers i called a parley in the
course of which two circumstances were brought to light which greatly
increased the afflictions of my spirit i began by remonstrating with
the villains upon the wickedness cruelty and injustice of their
proceedings to which joshua made answer that times was hard that
a poor man was put to a hard shift to get a living that for his
part he was an honest man who turned his hand to any honest matter 
that he knew what was lawful and what was not that he was agin all
abolition which was anti-constitutional and clear for keeping the
peace betwixt the north and south and twenty other things of a like
nature of which the most important was a declaration that the good
people of some parish or other in louisiana had offered a reward of
fifty thousand dollars for either of two individuals whose names i have
forgotten though they were very famous abolitionists and although
joshua to settle the matter at once showed me their names in the
advertisement which he had cut from a newspaper

friend said i i don't see that these foolish people have offered
any reward for me

well darn it i know it said joshua but i rather estimate they'll
give half price for you and that will pay us right smart for the
venture for you see what they want is an abolitionist and i rather
estimate they're not over and above partickilar as to who he may be
now i have heern tell of a heap of incendiary papers you sent down
south to free the niggurs 

i never did any such thing

oh well said joshua it's all one them there sugar-growing
fellers will think so and so it's all right and there's them runaway
niggurs you phil'delphy quakers are always hiding away from their
masters i rather estimate we'll make a good venture out of you

what said i will you sell my life for money

no said the vile joshua it's a mere trade in flesh and
blood wouldn't take a man's life on no consideration

friend thee shall have money if thee will permit me to escape

well said joshua with an indifferent drawl i estimate not abel
snipe told me you was cleaned out as clear as a gourd-shell

abel snipe said i is thee a friend of that villain abel snipe

a sorter said joshua or rather sam is him and abel was friends
together at sing 

oh blast your jaw said sam speaking for almost the first time on
the whole journey for he had been until then uncommonly glum and
taciturn where's the difference where it was says abel snipe to
me says he if you want's an abolitionist there's my old friend
zachariah he's your true go and so d'ye see that's what made us
snap you for we was thinking of snapping another

oh the wretch the base ungrateful hypocritical wretch

come blast it said sam don't abuse a man's friends

fellow said i hast thou no human feeling in that breast of thine
wilt thou sell me to violent men and madmen who will wrongfully take
my life

think what thou doest hast thou no conscience thou art selling a
fellow-being hast thou no fear of death and judgment of the devil and
the world of torment

oh hold your gab said the ruffian as for selling fellow-critters
why that was once a reggelar business of mine for d'ye see i was
a body-snatcher and i reckon i was more skeared once snapping up a
dead body than ever i shall be lifting a live one you must know i
was snatching for the doctors over there in jarsey for d'ye see
i'm a jarseyman myself i reckon it was some fourteen months ago it
was summer what the devil-be-cursed the doctor wanted with a body in
summer i don't know but it was none on my business so we went me
and tim stokes and the doctor to an old burying-ground where they had
just earthed a youngster that the doctor said would suit him well
d'ye see when we came to the grave up jumps a blasted devil as big
as a cow or it might ha been a ghost and set up a cry so we takes
to our heels but the doctor said twas a man's cry and no ghost's
and so d'ye see blast it we was for going back again after having a
confab when what should we do but find a poor devil of a feller lying
dead by a hole under a beech-tree the doctor said he would do better
nor the other and so blast it d'ye see we nabbed him

of a surety said i eagerly it was the beech-tree at the
owl-roost and that was the body of poor sheppard lee

well they did call him summat of that like and they made a great
fuss about him in the papers but i'm hanged if i wasn't skeared after
that out of all body-snatching

friend said i can thee tell me what the doctor did with that body

why cut him up blast him and made a raw-head-and-bloody-bones of
him the doctor was so cussed partickilar he wouldn't let us even
knock the teeth out though that was no great loss for jarseymen
hasn't no great shakes in the tooth way

alas what an ending for poor sheppard lee his body subjected to
the knife of an anatomist his bones scraped boiled bleached hung
together on wires and set up in a museum while his spirit was
wandering about from body to body enduring more afflictions in each
than it had ever mourned even in that unlucky original dwelling it
was so glad to leave i am not of a sentimental turn and i cannot
say that as zachariah longstraw i felt any peculiar sorrow for the
woes of sheppard lee nevertheless i did not hear this account of the
brutal way in which his body had been stolen and anatomized without
some touch of indignation and grief which perhaps i should have
expressed had not there arisen before the brutal samuel had quite
finished his remarks on jerseymen's teeth an occasion to exercise
those feelings on my own immediate behalf

this was produced by the vile joshua who had then the reins telling
a brace of horsemen whom we met that he had the great abolitionist
the celebrated zachariah longstraw in his cart and was carrying him
to be lynched in louisiana a confession that threw the strangers into
transports of satisfaction one of them swearing he would accompany my
captors to the mississippi or to the end of the earth for the mere
purpose of seeing me get my deservings




 chapter xviii


in which the author approaches a climax in his adventures


and now arose a train of incidents by which i was taught three things
namely first the manner in which my merchants designed giving a value
to their merchandise not inherent and intrinsic to it for of a truth
my abolition principles as i said before had never been carried to
the point of notoriety or even notice secondly the love with which
a southron regards those pious philanthropists who will have him good
and virtuous against his own will and thirdly the religious respect
for law and order which is so prominent a feature in the american
character

to make me valuable it was necessary i should be made famous and this
was easily accomplished in a land where men make up their opinions for
themselves according as they are instructed it was only necessary
to assure some half dozen or more independent sovereigns that i was
famous to ensure their making me so and this my kidnappers did they
told everybody they met that they had secured zachariah longstraw the
famous abolitionist the very life and soul of northern incendiarism
whom they were carrying to louisiana to be lynched according to law
and as the circumstance would of course get into every patriotic
newspaper along the way it was certain i should be made famous enough
before i got there and they thus enjoy the advantage of advertising
their commodity without paying a cent to the printer

it was astonishing and to none more than myself to witness the
suddenness with which i was exalted from obscurity to distinction and
the readiness with which every living soul upon being told my name
character and reputation remembered all about me and my misdeeds
yes cried one worthy personage shaking at me a fist minus two
fingers and a half i have heerd of him often enough he lives in
new-york and he sells sendary pictures packed up between the soles
of niggur shoes yes cried another who had but one eye i have
read all about him he lives in boston keeps a niggur school and
prints sendary papers a hundred thousand at a time to set niggurs
insurrecting in short they remembered not only all that the unworthy
joshua told them to my disparagement but a thousand things that the
imagination of one suggested to the credulity of another it was in
vain that i endeavoured to say any thing in denial or defence ridicule
and revilement threats and execrations were my only answers it
was clear that by the time we reached the mississippi i should be
the most important personage in america and that if my value as an
article of merchandise was to be determined by the distinction i won on
the road my friends joshua and samuel would make their fortunes by
the speculation but it was not my fate to travel beyond the bounds of
the ancient dominion

it happened that on this day an election was held in the district
through which we were travelling to return a representative to
congress in lieu of one who had fought his way into the shoes of a
chargăš all the world that is all the district was therefore in
arms and men and boys americans and irishmen were making their way
to the polls as fast and comfortably as two-mile-an-hour hard-trotting
horses could carry them and thither also as it appeared or in that
direction we were ourselves bending our course as we advanced
therefore we found ourselves gliding into a current of human
bodies honest republicans moving onward to the polls all of whom
were ready to add their approval to my claims or those the kidnappers
made for me to the honour of lynchdom the word was passed from one
to another that the yankee cart contained the famous abolitionist
zachariah longstraw they pressed around to look at and revile me to
discourse with the kidnappers on my demerits and to express their
delight that such a renowned member of the incendiary gang as they
called that class of conscientious people should at last be on the
road to justice

and thus i was rolled along attended by sundry groups which grew fast
into crowds consisting of persons who rejoiced over my capture and
painted to my ears in words uncommonly rough and ferocious the fate
that awaited me when arrived at my place of destination

that place as it chanced was nearer than i either expected or
desired as the crowd thickened the sounds of wrath and triumph
increased becoming more terrible to my auditories a new idea came
into the minds of the sovereigns a villain seven feet and a half
high mounted on a horse just half that altitude who had a great
knife-scar across his nose and cheek and a dozen similar seams on his
hands rode up to the cart and giving me a diabolical look cried out
whaw what aw the use of carrying the crittur so faw i say vawginnee
is the place for lynching atter all i say gentlemen and vawginians
i go for lynching right off-hand old vawginnee for evvaw

loud and terrible was the roar of voices with which the throng
testified their approbation of the barbarian's proposal it was agreed
i ought to be and should be lynched on the spot the kidnappers
appealed to the justice of virginians requesting them not to invade
the sacred rights of private property they could not think of
giving up their prisoner for nothing they meant him solely for the
louisiana market but things were coming to a crisis and that my
conductors perceived they whipped up to escape the throng but in
vain the further they went the more they became involved in the
crowd having now arrived at the village where the favourite candidate
was stumping among his constituents and promising them worlds of
reform retrenchment and public virtue provided they would send him
to congress i could hear from my box my friend joshua having taken
care to lock me up at the first sign of danger as we entered the
village the distant cries of hampden jones for ever mingled with
those nearer ones of my persecutors lynch the abolitionist and the
loudly-expressed remonstrances of my friends against invasion of their
rights coupled with threats to have the law of any one who robbed them
of their property

but threats and appeals were alike wasted on the independent freemen
of that district joined by the voters and others already assembled at
the polls who at the cry of lynch the abolitionist had deserted
their orator to join in the nobler sport of lynching they increased
in wrath and enthusiasm and stopping the cart and breaking open my
prison-house they dragged me into the light of day one man calling
for a pistol another a knife a third a rope and a fourth a cord
of good dry wood and a coal of fire to burn the villain alive
such a horrible clamour never before afflicted my ears or soul i saw
that abolitionist or not it was all over with me and so saw honest
joshua and samuel whose only solace for this unlucky interruption to
their speculation was a call some one generously made to take up a
subscription for their benefit seeing that it was beneath the dignity
of the chivalry of virginia to cheat even a yankee of what was justly
his due




 chapter xix


containing a specimen of eloquence with some account of the dangers of
lynchdom


at this moment the orator and candidate of the day stalking up in
high dudgeon to find what superior attraction had robbed him of his
audience laid eyes upon me i thought i had seen him before and
verily i had he was that identical gentleman the master of the
fugitive slave whom i had concealed in my house in philadelphia and
then clapped into prison for robbing me whence his master recovered
him there was no mistaking the gentleman he was a young man of
twenty-six or seven six feet high and one foot wide long-limbed with
small feet and huge hands a great shock of indian-looking hair vast
solemn black eyes a mouth wide and square and a brow that might have
suited a patriarch it was so wide and lofty and wrinkled he was
evidently a man destined to shake the walls of the capitol and cause
stenographers to groan the tully shone in his eye the demosthenes
moved on his lip there was genius even in the shape of his nose

i recollect the man said he with a voice that might have come from
the bowels of a double-bass it was so deep rolling and sonorous
he hid my boy pompey his name is longshanks he is a quaker a
philanthropist an abolitionist

hampden jones for ever cried the delighted sovereigns we'll hang
him meaning me however and not the orator over the poll-window
and then vote for hampden jones the friend of the law the friend of
the constitution the friend of the south

stay friends said hampden jones and his voice stilled the tumult
i have a word to say on the subject of abolition

hampden jones for ever cried the republicans and hampden jones
stepped up on the head of a barrel and stretched forth his right arm
he stretched forth his left also and then clinching both fists and
pursing his brows together until the balls beneath them looked like
rolling grape-shot he said 

gentlemen fellow-freemen of virginia the bulwarks of a nation's
liberties are the virtues of her children compared with these what is
wealth what is grandeur what even are power and glory these riches
and greatness power and renown are the possessions of the old world
yet what have they availed her look around that ancient hemisphere
and tell me where among its blood-stained battle-fields where
under its polluted palaces where in its haunts of the despot and the
slave you can find the love of liberty the love of law the love of
order the love of justice that give permanence to the institutions
they adorn and like the laurel crown of the cesars guard from
the thunderbolt the temples they bind in the wreath of honour look
for them in the old world but look in vain the mighty colossus of
christendom once vital with virtue lifts its decrepit bulk beyond
the verge of the atlantic a vast and mournful monument of decay
age and the shocks of the elements the wash of the tempest and the
lightning-stroke have ploughed its marble forehead with wrinkles
mosses hang from its brows and the dust of its own ruin dust animated
only by insects and reptiles the offspring of corruption moulders
over its buried feet the virtues that once distinguished that almost
deified the immortal colossus have fled from the old to find their
home in the new world i look for them only in the bosoms of americans

here the orator who had pronounced this sublime exordium with
prodigious earnestness and effect paused while the welkin rung with
the shouts of rapture its complimentary close was so well fitted to
inspire as for me i felt a doleful skepticism as to the justness of
the compliment having the very best reason to distrust that love of
liberty law order and justice which was about to consign me to
ropes and flames without asking the permission of a judge and jury
moreover i could not exactly see how mr hampden jones's remarks
on the old and new world had any thing to do with the subject of
abolition which he had risen to discuss and indeed this difficulty
seemed to have beset others as well as myself several crying out with
great enthusiasm let's have something on abolition and then to the
lynching while others exclaimed let's have the lynching first and
the speech afterward

abolition my fellow-citizens said the orator it is my intention
to address you on the subject of abolition but first let me apply
what i have already said i have said and i repeat that the love of
liberty of law of order of justice belongs peculiarly to the free
sons of america let me counsel let me advise let me entreat you to
have this noble truth in remembrance on this present occasion beware
lest in what you now intend to do you give occasion to the enemies of
freedom to doubt your virtue to suspect the reality of your love of
law order and justice to stigmatize you as friends only of riot and
outrage

these words filled me with joyful astonishment i began to believe
the youthful tully was about to interfere in my favour to rebuke
the violence of his adherents and so save them from the sin of
blood-guiltiness

so also thought the indignant sovereigns themselves and many
elevating their voices demanded furiously if he meant to protect the
bloody abolitionist

by no means said mr hampden jones with great emphasis what i
have to advise is that if we are to do execution upon the wretch
we shall proceed about it in an orderly and dignified way resolve
ourselves into a great and solemn tribunal and so adjudge him to death
with a regularity and decorum which shall excite the admiration and win
the approbation of the whole world

hampden jones for ever cried the sovereigns and so it appeared that
all the benefit i was to derive from his interference was only to be
despatched in an orderly manner




 chapter xx


in which sheppard lee reaches the darkest period of his existence


seeing this i became horribly frightened indeed so much so that
i was incapable of observing properly what ensued i have a faint
recollection that mr hampden jones resumed his discourse and harangued
those who would listen on the subject he had promised to discuss and
i remember that his auditors echoed every tenth word with tremendous
shouts but what i remember better than all was a spectacle that soon
attracted my attention being nothing less than the apparition of
five or six stout negroes climbing up a tree hard by dragging a rope
after them and tying it round a branch all which they executed with
uncommon spirit and zeal shaking their fists at me all the time and
calling me a cussed bobolitionist

what was to become of me now had i entered the body of the most
generous and humane of men only to be hanged a cold sweat broke over
me my knees knocked together the men who held me held me faster my
judges the members of the great and solemn tribunal began to decide
upon my fate with the regularity and decorum advised by their orator
which were to win the approbation and admiration of the whole world 
that is to say by each man marching up to the orator's barrel where
stood a committee appointed to receive the votes pronouncing his name
and voting to hang the incendiary

all this while i believe i was endeavouring to say something in my
defence but i have not the slightest recollection of what it was
matters were coming i may say had come to a crisis and my life
hung upon a thread when suddenly a negro who had been among the
most active and zealous of the volunteers on the tree fell from a
high branch to the ground and besides breaking his own neck as i
understood by the cry that was set up crushed two or three white men
that stood below

this produced a great hubbub and those who had stationed themselves
about me as guards ran forward to see what mischief had been done as
they ran one way i betook me to my heels and ran another i rushed
into the nearest house but being instantly pursued and ousted i fled
into a garden from which i was as quickly chased by men and dogs the
first screaming and the second howling and barking so that the uproar
they made was inexpressible

fear lent me wings but i was surrounded and run whithersoever
i might i always found myself brought up by some party or other
presenting itself in front the exercise while it inflamed my own
terrors only exasperated the rage of my persecutors and i was
persuaded they would tear me to pieces the moment they caught me judge
of my feelings then when i found myself hemmed in on all sides in a
little field on the skirts of the village with a party close at my
elbow on which i had stumbled without seeing it until roused by its
cries

i looked up and saw that it consisted of about a dozen negroes who
were carrying the body of their companion the unlucky volunteer who
had broken his neck falling from the tree but which body they now
threw upon the ground and with loud screams of he-ah mossa john
and he-ah mossa dickey began to scamper after me with all their
might

there was but one resource left me and that let the reader determine
hereafter of how deplorable a character i made a successful dodge
followed by a dash right through the screaming africans who perhaps
hesitated to lay a rough hand on one of my colour and reaching
the body of their companion cried half to myself and half to the
insensible clay it is better to be a slave than a dead man and
the scourge whatever romantic persons may say to the contrary is
preferable at any time to the halter if thou art dead my sable
brother yield my spirit a refuge in thy useless body

that was the last i remember of the adventure for i had no sooner
uttered the words than i fell into a trance




book vi


containing a history and a moral


 chapter i

in which sheppard lee finds every thing black about him


when i opened my eyes i found that i was lying in a hovel very mean
of appearance yet with a certain neatness and cleanliness about it
that prevented it from looking squalid it is true that the floor
which was of planks was somewhat awry and dilapidated that the little
window which with the door furnished or was meant to furnish its
only light was rather bountifully bedecked with old hats and scraps
of brown paper and that the walls of ill-plastered logs displayed
divers gleaming chinks and vistas through them of the sunny prospects
without nevertheless the place did not look amiss for a poor man
and in my experience as a philanthropist i had seen hundreds much
more miserable

an old woman sat at the fireplace nodding over a stew the fumes of
which were both savoury and agreeable the old woman was however as
black as the outside of her stew-pan in other words a negress and
this circumstance striking upon the chords of association i began to
remember what had lately befallen me a terrible suspicion flashed
into my mind had i not but before i could ask myself the question
my hand which i had raised to scratch my head came into contact with
a mop of elastic wool such as never grew upon the scalp of a white
man i started up in bed and looked at my hands and arms they were of
the hue of ebony or to speak more strictly of smoked mahogany i
saw a fragment of looking-glass hanging on the wall within my reach
i snatched it down and took a survey of my physiognomy miserable
me my face was as black as my arms and indeed somewhat more
so presenting a sable globe broken only by two red lips of immense
magnitude and a brace of eyes as white and as wide as plain china
saucers or peeled turnips

whaw dah cried the old woman roused by the noise i made whaw dat
you nigga tom what you doin dah lorra bless us if a nigga break a
neck can't a nigga hold-a still

alas and had my fate brought me to this grievous pass was there no
other situation in life sufficiently wretched but that i must take
up my lot in the body of a miserable negro slave how idle had been
all my past discontent how foolish the persuasion i had indulged
five different times that i was on each occasion the most unhappy
of men i had forgotten the state of the bondman the condition of
the expatriated african now i was at last to learn in reality
what it was to be the victim of fortune what to be the exemplar of
wretchedness the true repository of all the griefs that can afflict
a human being already i felt in imagination the blow of the
task-master on my back the fetter on my limb the iron in my soul and
when the old woman made a step towards me perhaps to discover why i
made no reply to her questions i was so prepossessed with the idea of
whips and lashes that i made a dodge under the bedclothes as if to
escape a thwack

golly matty is de nigga mad cried the jezebel i say you nigga
tom what you doin how you neck feel now

my neck thought i recollecting that it had been broken and
wondering in what way it had been mended i clapped my hands to it
it was very stiff and sore while i felt at it the old woman told me
some great doctor had twisted a great kink out of it but i bestowed
little notice on what she said my mind ran upon other matters i could
think of nothing but cowhides and cat-o-nine-tails that were to
welcome me to bondage

aunty said i why i addressed the old lady thus i know not but i
have observed that negroes always address their seniors by the titles
of uncle and aunt and i suppose the instinct was on me am i a
slave

what a fool nigga to ax a question said she what you gwying to be
den but old massa jodge's nigga-boy tom what you git up faw ha
 i was making an attempt to rise 

massa docta say you stay a-bed what you git up faw ha

i intend to run away said i and truly that was the notion then
uppermost in my mind and it is very likely i should have made a bolt
for the door that moment had i not discovered an uncommon weakness in
my lower limbs which prevented my getting out of bed

whaw what a fool cried the beldam regarding me with surprise and
contempt what you do when you run away ha who'll hab you who'll
feed you who'll take care of you who'll own a good-fo-nothin
runaway nigga i say ha kick him bout h'yah kick him bout dah
poor despise nigga wid no massa jist as despise as any free nigga you
run away ha what den continued my sable monitress warming into
eloquence as she spoke take up constable clap him in jail salt him
down cowskin dat all no sell him low price send mississippi what
den work in de cotton-field pull at de cane dat all no cussed
overseer wid a long whip cut h'yah cut dah cut high cut low whip
all day cuff all night take all de skin off oh dey do whip to de
debbil in de mississippi and as the old lady concluded to give more
effect to her expressions she fell to rubbing her back and dodging her
head from side to side until i had the liveliest idea in the world of
that very castigation of which i stood in such horror




 chapter ii


in which sheppard lee is introduced to his master


just at this moment to make my anguish more complete in stepped a
tall and dignified person bearing a huge walking-stick with which i
was so certain he would proceed to maul me that i made a second dive
under the bedclothes loudly beseeching him for mercy

to my surprise however instead of beating me he spoke to the old
woman whom he called aunt phoebe and who in return entitled him
massa jodge asked if i was not light-headed said that it was a
great pity i had so hard a time of it that i was very much hurt
that he would be sorry to lose me and so on and in fine expressed
what he said in accents so humane and gentle that i was encouraged
to steal a peep at him seeing which he sat down on a stool felt my
pulse and giving me quite a good-natured look asked me if i felt in
much pain

i was astonished that he should treat me thus if my master but
surveying him more intently i perceived there was little in his
appearance to justify any fears of cruelty he was an aged man with
a head of silver that gave him an uncommonly venerable air and
though his visage was grave it expressed a native good-humour and
amiableness my terrors fled before his soothing accents and benevolent
looks but being still confused i was unable to reply in proper terms
to his questions so that when he asked me as he soon did what i
meant by crying for mercy i made answer oh lord sir i was afraid
you was going to beat me at which he laughed and said my conscience
was growing tenderer than common adding that there was no doubt i
deserved a trouncing as did every other boy on his estate for a set
of greater scoundrels than his was not to be found in all virginia and
if they had their deserts they would get a round dozen apiece every
day

he then began to ask me particularly about my ailments and i judged
from his questions and certain occasional remarks which he let fall
that i had been lying insensible for several days that my neck had
been put out of place or dislocated and reduced again by some
practitioner of uncommon skill and here lest the reader should think
such a circumstance improbable i beg leave to say that i have lately
seen an account of a similar operation performed by an english surgeon
on the neck of a fox-hunting squire and as the story appeared in the
newspapers there can be no doubt of its truth

while the gentleman my master was thus asking me of my pains and
betraying an interest in my welfare that softened my heart towards him
there came into the hovel a young lady of a very sweet countenance
followed by two or three younger girls and a little boy all of whom
seemed glad to see me the little boy in particular shaking me by the
hand while his youthful sisters for all were my master's children
began to drag from a basket and display before my eyes the legs of
a roasted chicken a little tart a jelly and divers other dainty
viands which they had brought with them as they said for poor sick
tom and insisted upon seeing him eat on the spot as for the young
lady the eldest sister she smiled on them and on me for i was not
backward to accept and dispose of the savoury gifts but told me i
must not be imprudent nor eat too much and i would soon be well
what thought i does a slave ever eat too much

it is astonishing what a revolution was effected in my feelings by the
gentle deportment of my master and the kindly act of his children
i looked upon them and myself with entirely new eyes i felt a sort
of affection for them steal through my spirit and i wondered why i
had ever thought of them with fear i took a particular liking to the
little boy who by-the-by was a namesake of mine he being massa
tommy and i plain tom and i had an unaccountable longing come over me
to take him on my back and go galloping on all-fours over the grass at
the door i had no more thoughts of running away to avoid the dreadful
lash and the shame of bonds and my master and his children presently
leaving the hovel having first charged me to keep myself quiet and
easy i fell sound asleep and dreamed i lay a whole day on my back on
a clay-bank eating johnny-cake and fried bacon




 chapter iii


an old woman's cure for a disease extremely prevalent both in the
coloured and uncoloured creation


the next day i was visited again by my master and by other members of
his family whom i had not seen before and of whom i shall say nothing
now having occasion to mention them hereafter the children brought me
goodies as before and little tommy told me to make haste and get
well for there were none of the other boys meaning negroes who
knew how to gallop the cock-horse half so well as i in short i was
treated like a human being and fed like a king and began to grow
wondrous content with my situation the doctor also came and having
fingered about my neck for a while declared my case to be the most
marvellous one ever known and concluded by telling me i was well
enough to get up and that i might do so whenever i chose

now this was a matter of which i was as well satisfied as he could be
being quite certain i never was better in my life but i felt amazing
delight in lolling a-bed doing nothing except feeding on the good
things with which my master's children so liberally supplied me and
i believe had they left the matter to be decided by my own will i
should have been lying on that bed luxuriating in happy laziness to
this day it is certain i fabricated falsehoods without number for
the mere purpose of keeping my bed for whenever my master who came
to inquire about me at least once a day ventured to hint i was well
enough to get up if i would but choose to think so i felt myself
unaccountably impelled to declare with sighs and groans that i could
scarce move a limb and that i suffered endless pangs all which was
false for i was strong as a horse and without any pain whatever

well well my venerable master used to say i know you are cheating
me you rascal but that's the way with you all a negro will be a
negro and sure i have the laziest set of scoundrels on my estate
that ever ate up a good-natured master

unhappily for so i then thought it old aunt phoebe who had been
appointed to nurse me and who was very conscientious about her
master's interest in all cases where her own was not involved was
by no means so easily imposed upon as the old gentleman and on the
seventh day after i opened my eyes she dispelled a pleasing revery in
which i was indulging by bidding me arise and begone i began to plead
my pains can't play possum with me said she good-for-nothin
nigga not worth you cawn and not deigning to employ any other
argument she took a broomstick to me and fairly beat me out of the
hovel i thought it was very odd i should get my first beating of a
fellow-slave and i was somewhat incensed at the old woman for her
cruelty but by-and-by when i had taken a seat in the sunshine
snuffed the fresh autumn air and looked about me a little i fell into
a better humour with her and if that were possible with myself




 chapter iv


some account of ridgewood hill and the author's occupations


my master's lands lay on and near the potomac and his house was
built on a hill which bore his own name and gave name also to the
estate that is ridgewood hill it overlooked that wide and beautiful
river being separated from it only by a lawn which in the centre was
hollow and ran down to the river in a ravine while its flanks or
extremities sloping but gently in their whole course suddenly fell
down to the shore in wooded bluffs that looked very bold and romantic
from the water in the hollow of the lawn was a little brook that
rose from a spring further up the hill and found its way to the river
through the ravine where it made many pretty little pools and cascades
among the bushes while a creek that was wide but shallow swept in
from the river above and went winding away among the hills behind

my master's house was ancient and i must say not in so good repair
as it might have been but there were so many beautiful trees about
it that one would not think of its defects the more especially as it
appeared only the more venerable for them it looked handsome enough
from the river and even from the negro-huts which were nearer the
creek it had an agreeable appearance particularly when the children
were playing together on the lawn which they did and sometimes white
and black together nearly all day long they were thus engaged in
their sports when aunt phoebe drove me from the hovel and i remember
how soon my indignation at the unceremonious ejection was pacified by
looking on the happy creatures thus enjoying themselves on the grass
while my master and his eldest daughter sat on the porch regarding
them with smiles

how greatly i had changed within a few short days instead of being
moved by the sight of juvenile independence and happiness to think of
my own bitter state of servitude i was filled with a foolish glee and
little tommy running up to me with shouts of joy down i dropped on my
hands and knees and taking him on my back began to trot and gallop
and rear and curvet over the lawn to the infinite gratification of
himself his little sisters and the children of my own colour all of
whom rewarded my efforts of horseship with screams of approbation now
the reader will be surprised to hear it but i tom the slave i never
remember to have heard myself called any thing but tom enjoyed this
foolish sport just as much as tommy the rider to whom i felt i think
some such feelings of affection i know not how i got them but feel
them i did as a father experiences while playing the courser to his
own child nay i was thrown into such good-humour and felt so content
with myself that when my master came to me and bade me take care
lest i should hurt myself by my exertions i told him in the fervour
of my heart i was doing very well and that i was as strong as ever i
had been which caused him to laugh and say i was growing marvellous
honest of a sudden

about this time the field-hands returned from their daily labour and
having despatched their evening meal they came the women and children
with them under the trees before the door with banjoes fiddles and
clacking-bones that is a sort of castanets made of the ribs of an
ox and began to sing and dance as was their custom always every fair
evening for my master greatly delighted as he said to see the poor
devils enjoy themselves in which the poor devils were ever ready to
oblige him they had no sooner begun the diversion than i was seized
with an unaccountable desire to join them which i did dancing with
all my might and singing and clapping my hands the merriest and
happiest of them all and this sort of amusement i may as well now
inform the reader we were in the habit of repeating so long as the
mildness of the weather permitted




 chapter v


in which the author further describes his situation and philosophizes
on the state of slavery


having thus shown myself to be perfectly cured of my broken neck it
followed that as a slave i was now compelled to go into the fields
and labour this i did at first very reluctantly but by-and-by i
discovered there was but little toil expected of me or indeed of
any other bondman for the overseer was a good-natured man like his
employer and lazy like ourselves i do not know how it may be with the
slaves on other estates but i must confess that so far as mere labour
went there was less done by and less looked for from my master's
hands than i have ever known to be the case with the white labourers
of new-jersey my master owned extensive tracts of land from which
although now greatly empoverished and almost exhausted he might have
drawn a princely revenue had he exacted of his slaves the degree of
labour always demanded of able-bodied hirelings in a free state but
such was not the custom of virginia or such at least was not the
custom of my master he was of a happy easy temper neglectful of his
interest and though often nay i may say incessantly grumbling at
the flagrant laziness of all who called him master and at the yearly
depreciation of his lands he was content enough if the gains of the
year counterbalanced the expenses and as but a slight degree of toil
was required to effect this happy object it was commonly rendered and
without repugnance on the part of his slaves his great consolation
and he was always pronouncing it to himself and to us was that his
hands were the greatest set of scoundrels in the world which if
unutterable laziness be scoundrelism was true he was pretty generally
beloved by them which i suppose was because he was so good-natured
though many used to tell me they loved him because he was their
right-born master that is put over them by birth and not by
purchase for he lived upon the land occupied by his fathers before
him and his slaves were the descendants of those who had served them

the reader who has seen with what horror and fear i began the life
of a slave may ask if after i found myself restored to health and
strength i sought no opportunity to give my master the slip and make
a bold push for freedom i did not a change had come over the spirit
of my dream i found myself for the first time in my life content
or very nearly so with my condition free from cares far removed
from disquiet and if not actually in love with my lot so far from
being dissatisfied that i had not the least desire to exchange it for
another

methinks i see the reader throw up his hands at this crying what
content with slavery i assure him now i ponder the matter over
that i am as much surprised as himself and that i consider my being
content with a state of bondage a very singular and unaccountable
circumstance nevertheless such was the fact i was no longer sheppard
lee zachariah longstraw nor anybody else except simply tom thomas
or tommy the slave i forgot that i once had been a freeman or to
speak more strictly i did not remember it the act of remembering
involving an effort of mind which it did not comport with my new habits
of laziness and indifference to make though perhaps i might have
done so had i chosen i had ceased to remember all my previous states
of existence i could not have been an african had i troubled myself
with thoughts of any thing but the present

perhaps this defect of memory will account for my being satisfied
with my new condition i had no recollection of the sweets of liberty
to compare and contrast with the disgusts of servitude perhaps my
mind was stupified sunk beneath the ordinary level of the human
understanding and therefore incapable of realizing the evils of my
condition or perhaps after all considering the circumstances of my
lot with reference to those of my mind and nature such evils did not
in reality exist the reader may settle the difficulty for himself
which he can do when he has read a little more of my history in
the meanwhile the fact is true i was satisfied with my lot i was
satisfied even with myself the first time i looked at my new face
i was shocked at what i considered its ugliness but having peeped at
it a dozen times or more my ideas began to alter and by-and-by i
thought it quite beautiful i used to look at myself in aunt phoebe's
glass by the hour and i well remember the satisfaction with which i
listened to the following rebuke of my vanity from her namely all
you pritty young niggurs with handsome faces is good for nothin not
wuth so much as you cawn in short i was something of a coxcomb and
nothing could equal the pride and happiness of my heart when of a
sabbath morning dressed in one of my master's old coats well brushed
up a bran-new rabbit-fur hat the gift of little tommy a ruffled
shirt and a white neckcloth with a pair of leather gloves swinging in
one hand and a peeled beechen wand by way of cane in the other i went
stalking over the fields to church in the little village near to which
my master resided

i say again i cannot account for my being so contented with bondage
it may be however that there is nothing necessarily adverse to
happiness in slavery itself unaccompanied by other evils and that
when the slave is ground by no oppression and goaded by no cruelty he
is not apt to repine or moralize upon his condition nor to seek for
those torments of sentiment which imagination associates with the idea
of slavery in the abstract

of one thing at least i can be very certain i never had so easy and
idle a time of it in my whole life my little master tommy had grown
very fond of me it is strange anybody should be fond of a slave but
it is true it appears i was what they call a mere field-hand that
is a labourer and quite unfit for domestic service nevertheless to
please tommy i was taken from the tobacco-fields and without being
appointed to any peculiar duty about the house was allowed to do what
i pleased provided i made myself sufficiently agreeable to young
master so i made him tops kites wind-mills corn-stalk fiddles and
little shingle ships with paper sails gave him a trot every now and
then on my back and had in return a due share of his oranges and
gingerbread

in this way my time passed along more agreeably than i can describe my
little master it is true used to fall into a passion and thump me now
and then but that i held to be prime fun particularly as provided
i chose to blubber a little and pretend to be hurt the little rogue
would relent and give me all the goodies he could beg borrow or
steal to make up with me as he called it

little tommy and his sisters four in number were the children of my
master by a second wife who had died two years before the oldest was
the young lady of whom i have already spoken and she was i believe
not above seventeen her name was isabella and she was uncommonly
handsome a young gentleman of the neighbourhood named andrews was
paying court to her indeed she had a great many admirers and there
was much company came to see her

my master's oldest son the only child left by his first wife lived
on a plantation beyond the creek being already married and having
children his name was george like his father and the slaves used
to distinguish them as massa cunnel jodge and massa maja jodge
for all the gentlemen in those parts were either colonels or majors
the major's seat being at so short a distance and the plantation he
cultivated a part of the colonel's great estate of ridgewood hill
we used to regard him as belonging still to our master's family and
the slaves on both plantations considered themselves as forming but
a single community nevertheless we of the south side had a sort
of contempt for those of the north for massa maja though a good
master was by no means so easy as his father he exacted more work
and when he rode into the fields on our side as he often did he used
to swear at us for lazy loons and declare he would some day or other
turn over a new leaf with us




 chapter vi

recollections of slavery


i must again repeat what i have said namely that i was contented with
my servile condition and that i was so far from looking back with
regret to my past life of freedom that i ceased at last to remember
it altogether i was troubled with no sense of degradation afflicted
with no consciousness of oppression and instead of looking upon my
master as a tyrant who had robbed me of my rights i regarded him as a
great and powerful friend whose protection and kindness i was bound to
requite with a loyal affection and with so much of the labour of my
hands as was necessary to my own subsistence what would have been my
feelings had my master been really a cruel and tyrannical man i will
not pretend to say but doubtless they would have been the opposite of
those i have confessed

the above remarks apply equally to my fellow-bondmen of whom there
were young and old and men and women together more than a hundred
on the two estates the exact number i never knew but i remember
there were above twenty able-bodied men or full hands as they were
called when all were mustered together there were many especially
among the women who were great grumblers but that was their nature
such a thing as serious discontent was i am persuaded entirely
unknown the labours of the plantation were light the indulgences
granted frequent and many there was scarce a slave on the estate
who if he laboured at all did not labour more for himself than his
master for all had their little lots or gardens the produce of which
was entirely their own and which they were free to sell to whomsoever
they listed and hard merchants they were sometimes even to my master
when he would buy of them as he often did i remember one day seeing
old aunt phoebe to whom he had sent to buy some chickens fall into a
passion and refuse to let the messenger have any because her master
had forgotten to send the money go tell old massa jodge said she
with great ire i no old fool to be cheated out of my money and i
don't vally his promise to pay not dat snapping her fingers he
owe me two ninepence already and the old gentleman was compelled to
send her the cash before she complied with his wishes

the truth is my master was in some respects a greater slave than
his bondmen and all the tyranny i ever witnessed on the estate was
exercised by them and at his expense for there was a general
conspiracy on the part of all to cheat him as far as was practicable
out of their services while they were all the time great sticklers
for their own rights and privileges he was as i have said before
universally beloved but his good-nature was abused a thousand times a
day

there existed no substantial causes for dissatisfaction and there was
therefore the best reason for content singing and dancing were more
practised than hard work in a word my master's slaves were an idle
worthless set but as happy as the day was long i may say the same
of myself i certainly was a very merry and joyous personage and my
companions who envied me for being the favourite of young master used
to call me giggling tom

but there is an end to the mirth of the slave as well as the joy of
the master a cloud at last came betwixt me and the sun a new thought
awoke in my bosom bringing with it a revolution of feeling which
extended to the breasts of all my companions it was but a small cause
to produce such great effects but an ounce of gunpowder may be made to
blow up an army and a drop of venom from the lip of a dog may cause
the destruction of a whole herd





 chapter vii


a scene on the banks of the potomac with the humours of an african
improvisatore


beneath the bluff and at the mouth of the creek which divided the two
plantations was a wharf or landing where our fishing-boats for we
had a good fishery hard by used to discharge their cargoes and where
also small shallops coming with supplies to the plantation put out
their freight here one day some seven or eight of the hands were
engaged removing a cargo of timber which had just been discharged by
a small vessel my master having bought it for the express purpose of
repairing the negro-houses and building a new one for a fellow that
was to be married for it seems his crops of corn and tobacco had
turned out unusually well and when that happened the slaves were the
first who received the benefit

hither i strolled having nothing better to do to take a position
on the side of the bluff where i could both bask in the sunshine
which was very agreeable for it was now the end of october though
fine weather and overlook the hands working which was still more
agreeable for i had uncommon satisfaction to look at others labouring
while i myself was doing nothing

having selected a place to my liking i lay down on the warm clay
enjoying myself while the others intermitted their labour to abuse
me crying cuss lazy nigga gigglin tom dah why you no come down
work having employed themselves at which for a time they resumed
their labours and i turning over on my back and taking a twig that
grew nigh betwixt my teeth began to think to myself what an agreeable
thing it was to be a slave and have nothing to do

by-and-by hearing a great chattering and laughing among the men below
i looked down and beheld one of them diverting himself with a ludicrous
sport frequently practised by slaves to whom the lash is unknown he
was frisking and dodging about pretty much as aunt phoebe had done
when endeavouring to show me how the whip was handled in mississippi
and like her he rubbed his back now here now there now with the
right now with the left hand now ducking to the earth now jumping
into the air as though some lusty overseer were plying him whip in
hand with all his might the wonder of the thing was however that
governor for that was the fellow's name had in his hand a pamphlet
or sheet of printed paper the contents of which he was endeavouring
both to convey to his companions and to illustrate by those ridiculous
antics the contents of the paper were varied for varied also was the
representation

dah you go nigga he cried leaping as if from a blow slap on'e
leg hit right on'e shin yah yah yah chah chah ch-ch-ch-ch-ah
chah chah massa oh de dam overseeah dat de way he whip a nigga
then pausing a moment and turning a leaf of the book he fell to
leaping again crying what dat dat you rose what you been
doin stealin sugah

 jump you nigga gal

 so much you git for stealin sugah
 so much for lickin lassa

dem hard massa licky de gals

nigga jump two white men whip a nigga gib a nigga fay-ah play

 when de white man comes to sticky sticky
 lorra-gorr he licky licky

gib a nigga fay-ah play

and so he went on describing and acting what he affected to read
to the infinite delight of his companions who ceasing their work
crowded round him to snatch a peep at the paper which i observed no
one got a good look at without jumping back immediately rubbing his
sides and launching into other antics in rivalry with governor




 chapter viii


the author descends among the slaves and suddenly becomes a man of
figure and an interpreter of new doctrines


i was moved with curiosity to know what they had laid their hands
on and i descended the bank to solve the mystery the paper had
passed from the hands of governor to those of a fellow named jim or
parson jim as we usually called him for he was fond of praying and
preaching which he had been allowed to do until detected in a piece
of roguery a few weeks before by master major who besides putting a
check on his clerical propensities for the future saluted him with
two or three kicks well laid on on the spot it was to this personage
and his punishment that governor alluded when he cried what he-ah
massa maja kickin de pawson as mentioned above although a great
rogue he was a prime favourite among the negroes who had a great
respect for his learning for he could read print and was even thought
to have some idea of writing this fellow was employed on the present
occasion at the ox-cart and as it is no part of a slave's system to
do the work of others he had been sitting apart singing a psalm while
the others were loading his cart and apart he had remained until
a call was made upon him to explain so much of the paper being the
printed portion as governor could not the paper it is here proper
to observe had been found by governor among the boards and scantling
though how it got there no one knew nor was it ever discovered it
was a pamphlet or magazine i know not which and the name i have
unfortunately forgotten containing besides a deal of strange matter
about slavery some half a dozen or more wood-cuts representing
negroes in chains under the lash exposed in the market for sale and
i know not what other situations and it was these which had afforded
the delighted governor so much matter for mimicry and merriment
there was one cut on the first page serving as a frontispiece it
represented a negro kneeling in chains and raising his fettered hands
in beseeching to a white man who was lashing him with a whip beneath
it was a legend which being or being deemed explanatory of the
picture and at the same time the initial sentence of the book parson
jim was essaying to read and thus it was he proceeded 

t-h-e the dat's de f-a-t-e fat de fat o-f ob de
fat ob t-h-e de de fat ob de s-l-a-v-e slave de fat ob
de slave my gorry what's dat brederen i can't say as how i
misprehends dat

yah yah yah roared governor plain as de nose on you face de
fat ob de slave what he mean heh why gorry you dumb nigga he
mean massa dah is whippin de fat out ob de nigger dem hard massa
dat-ah heh whip de fat out

lorra-gorry massa don't like you whippy
don't sell gubbe'nor down a mississippi

let me read it said i

you read you nigga whar you larn to read cried my friends it
was a question i could not well answer for as i said before the
memory of my past existence had quite faded from my mind nevertheless
i had a feeling in me as if i could read and taking the book from
the parson i succeeded in deciphering the legend the fate of the
slave

whaw dat said governor de chain and de cowhide does de book say
dat's de luck for nigga don't b'leeb m dem lie massa cunnel
nebber lick a nigga in m life

the reading of that little sentence seemed i know not why to have
cast a sudden damper on the spirits of all present until that moment
there had been much shouting laughing and mimicking of the pains of
men undergoing flagellation every picture had been examined commented
on and illustrated with glee it associated only the idea of some idle
vagabond or other winning his deserts a new face a new interpretation
was given to the matter by the words i had read the chain and scourge
appeared no longer as the punishment of an individual they were to be
regarded as the doom of the race the laughing and mimicry ceased and
i beheld around me nothing but blank faces it was manifest however
that the feeling was rather indignation than anxiety and that my
friends looked upon the ominous words as a libel upon their masters and
themselves

what for book say dat cried governor who from being the merriest
had now become the angriest of all who ebber hear of chain a nigga
escept nigga runaway or nigga gwyin down gin will to mississippi
who ebber hear of lash a nigga escept nigga sassbox nigga thief
nigga drunk nigga break hoss leg

brudders said parson jim this here is a thing what is portant to
hear on for blessed be gorra-matty there is white men what writes
books what is friends of the vaginnee niggur

all cuss bobbolitionist said governor with sovereign
contempt don't b'leeb in m who says chain nigga in vaginnee who
says cowhide nigga in vaginnee de fate ob de slave cuss lie an't
i slave hah who chains gubbe'nor who licks gubbe'nor little book
big lie

and little book big lie echoed all in extreme wrath the parson
took things more coolly he rolled his eyes hitched up his collar
stroked his chin and suggesting the propriety of reading a little
farther proposed that brudder tom who had an uncommon good hidear
of that ar sort of print should hunt out the root of the matter and
lamented that it was a sort of print he could not well get along
with without his spectacles




 chapter ix


what it was the negroes had discovered among the scantling


thus called upon i made a second essay and succeeded though not
without pain in deciphering enough of the text to give me a notion of
the object for which the tract had been written it was entitled an
address to the owners of slaves and could not therefore be classed
among those incendiary publications which certain over-zealous
philanthropists are accused of sending among slaves themselves to
inflame them into insurrection and murder no such imputation could be
cast upon the writer his object was of a more humane and christian
character it was to convince the master he was a robber and villain
and by this pleasing mode of argument induce him to liberate his
bond-men the only ill consequence that might be produced was that the
book might provided it fell into their hands convince the bondmen
of the same thing but that was a result for which the writer was not
responsible he addressed himself only to the master it began with the
following pithy questions and answers or something very like them 
for i cannot pretend to recollect them to the letter

why scourgest thou this man and why dost thou hold him in bonds is
he a murderer a house-burner a ravisher a blasphemer a thief no
what then is the crime for which thou art punishing him so bitterly he
is a negro and my slave

then followed a demand how he became and by what right the master
claimed him as a slave to which the master replied by right of
purchase exhibiting at the same time a bill of sale at this the
querist expressed great indignation and calling the master a robber
cheat and usurper bade him show as the only title a christian would
sanction a bill of sale signed by the negro's maker who alone had
the right to dispose of man's liberty and he concluded the paragraph
by averring that the claim was fraudulent that the slave was
unjustly treacherously unrighteously held in bonds and that he was
or of right should be as free as the master himself

here i paused for breath my companions looked at me with eyes staring
out of their heads astonishment suspicion and fear were depicted in
their countenances a new idea had entered their brains all opened
their mouths but governor was the only one who could speak and he
stuttered and stammered in his eagerness so much that i could scarcely
understand him

wh-wh-wh-wh-what dat he cried hab a right to fr-fr-fr-freedom
case gorra-matty no s-s-s-sell me why den wh-wh-wh-who's slave
gorra-matty no trade in niggurs i say you pawson jim wh-wh-wh-what
you say dat doctrine the parson was dumb-founded the difficulty
was solved by an old negro who rolled his quid of tobacco and his eyes
together and said

whaw de debbil's de difference massa cunnel no buy us we born
him slave ebbery nigga he-ah

unluckily the very next paragraph was opened by the quotation from the
declaration of independence that all men were born free and equal
which was asserted to be true of all men negroes as well as others
from which it followed that the master's claim to the slave born in
thraldom was as fraudulent as in the case of one obtained by purchase

whaw dat said governor decoration of independence say dat
gen'ral jodge washington him make dat and gen'ral tommie jefferson
him put hand to it all men born free and equal a nigga is a man
who says no to dat how come massa cunnel to be massa den

that question had never before been asked on ridgewood hill but all
now asked it and all for the first time in their lives began to
think of their master as a foe and usurper the strangely-expressed
idea in the pamphlet namely that none but their maker could
rightfully sell them to bondage and that other in relation to natural
freedom and equality had captivated their imaginations and made an
impression on their minds not readily to be forgotten black looks
passed from one to another and angry expressions were uttered and i
know not where the excitement that was fast awaking would have ended
had not our master himself suddenly made his appearance descending the
bluff

for the first time in their lives the slaves beheld his approach with
terror and all darting upon the timber began to labour with a zeal
and bustling eagerness which they had never shown before but first
the pamphlet was snatched out of my hands and concealed in a hollow of
the bank our uncommon industry for even parson jim and myself were
seized with a fit of zeal and gave our labour with the rest somewhat
surprised the venerable old man but as the timber was destined to
contribute to our own comforts he attributed it to a selfish motive
and chiding us good-humouredly and with a laugh said that's the
way with you you rogues you can work well enough when it is for
yourselves

dat's all de tanks we gits muttered governor hard by wonder if we
ha'n't a better right to work than massa jodge to make us




 chapter x


the effect of the pamphlet on its reader and hearers


we had seen the last day of content on ridgewood hill that little
scrap of paper thrown among us perhaps by accident or as i have
sometimes thought dropped by the fiend of darkness himself had
conjured up a thousand of his imps who one after another took
up their dwelling in our breasts until their name was legion my
fellow-slaves cared little now for singing and dancing their only
desire in the intervals of labour was to assemble together below the
bluff and dive deeper into the mysteries of the pamphlet and as i
was the only one who could explain them and was ready enough to do
so i often neglected my little friend tommy to preside over their
convocations

nor were these meetings confined to the original finders of the
precious document the news had been whispered from man to man and
the sensation spread over the whole estate so that those who lived
with the major were as eager to escape from their labours and listen to
the new revelation as ourselves nay so great was the curiosity among
them that many who could not come when i was present to expound the
secrets of the book would betake themselves to the bluff to indulge a
look at it and guess out its contents as they could from the pictures
and by-and-by the news having spread to a distance we had visiters
also from the gangs of other plantations

it was perhaps a week or more before the composition was read through
and understood by us all and in that time it had wrought a revolution
in our feelings as surprising as it was fearful and now lest the
reader should doubt that the great effects i am about to record should
have really arisen from so slight a cause as a little book i think it
proper to tell him more fully than i have done what that little book
contained

it was as i have said an address to the owners of slaves and its
object purported to be to awaken their minds to the cruelty injustice
and wickedness of slavery this was sought to be effected in the
first place by numerous cuts representing all the cruelties and
indignities that negro slaves had suffered or could suffer either in
reality or in the imaginations of the philanthropists some of these
were horrible many shocking and all disgusting and some of them
i think were copied out of fox's book of martyrs though of that i
am not certain the moral turpitude and illegality of the institution
were shown or attempted to be shown now by arguments that were
handled like daggers and broad-axes and now by savage denunciations
of the enslaver and oppressor who were proved to be murderers
blasphemers tyrants devils and i know not what beside the vengeance
of heaven was invoked upon their heads coupled with predictions of
the retribution that would sooner or later fall upon them these being
borne out by monitory allusions to the servile wars of rome syria
egypt sicily st domingo c c it was threatened that heaven would
repeat the plagues of egypt in america to punish the task-masters of
the ethiopian as it had punished those of the israelite and that
in addition the horrors of hayti would be enacted a second time and
within our own borders it was contended that the negro was in organic
and mental structure the white man's equal if not his superior and
that there was a peculiar injustice in subjecting to bondage his
race which had been or so the writer averred in the earlier days of
the world the sole possessors of knowledge and civilization and there
were many triumphant references to hannibal queen sheba cleopatra
and the pharaohs all of whom were proved to have been woolly-headed
and as bright in spirit as they were black in visage in short the
book was full of strange things and among others of insurrection and
murder though it is but charitable to suppose that the writer did not
know it

there was scarce a word in it that did not contribute to increase the
evil spirit which its first paragraph had excited among my companions
it taught them to look on themselves as the victims of avarice the
play-things of cruelty the foot-balls of oppression the most injured
people in the world and the original greatness of their race which
was an idea they received with uncommon pleasure and its reviving
grandeur in the liberated hayti convinced them they possessed the
power to redress their wrongs and raise themselves into a mighty
nation

with the sense of injury came a thirst for revenge my companions began
to talk of violence and dream of blood a week before there was not one
of them who would not have risked his life to save his master's the
scene was now changed my master walked daily though without knowing
it among volcanoes all looked upon him askant and muttered curses
as he passed a kinder-hearted man and easier master never lived
and it may seem incredible that he should be hated without any real
cause imaginary causes are however always the most efficacious in
exciting jealousy and hatred in affairs of the affections slaves and
the members of political factions are equally unreasonable the only
difference in the effect is that the one cannot while the other can
and does change his masters when his whim changes

that fatal book infected my own spirit as deeply as it did those of
the others and made me as sour and discontented as they i began to
have sentimental notions about liberty and equality the dignity of
man the nobleness of freedom and so-forth and a stupid ambition a
vague notion that i was born to be a king or president or some such
great personage filled my imagination and made me a willing listener
to and sharer in the schemes of violence and desperation which my
fellow-slaves soon began to frame it is wonderful that among the many
thoughts that now crowded my brain no memory of my original condition
arose to teach me the folly of my desires but and i repeat it again
the past was dead with me i lived only for the present

a little incident that soon befell me will show the reader how
completely my feelings were identified with my condition and how
deeply the lessons of that unlucky pamphlet had sunk into my spirit
my little playmate master tommy who was not above six years old
being of an irascible temper sometimes quarrelled with me on which
occasions as i mentioned before he used to beat me a liberty i
rather encouraged than otherwise since i gained by it though my
master strictly forbade the youth to take it now as soon as my
head began to fill with the direful and magnificent conceptions of a
malecontent and conspirator i waxed weary of child's play and master
tommy who falling into a passion with me for that reason proceeded
on a certain occasion to pommel my ribs with a fist about equal in
weight to the paw of a gadfly i was incensed i may say enraged at
the poor child and repaid the violence by shaking him almost to death
indeed i felt for a while as if i could have killed him and i know
not whether i might not have done it for the devil had on the sudden
got into my spirit had not his father discovered what i was doing
and run to his assistance

i then pretended that i had shaken him in sport and thus escaped
a drubbing of which i was at first in danger the threat of this
however sank deeply into my mind and i ever after felt a deep hatred
of both father and son this may well be called a blind malice for
neither had given me any real cause for it




 chapter xi


the hatching of a conspiracy


in the meanwhile the devil was doing his work among the others and
disaffection grew into wrath and fury that were not so perfectly
concealed but that my master or rather his eldest son who was of a
more observant disposition began to suspect that mischief was brewing
and in a short time it was reported among us that our master had
marked some of us as being dangerous and was resolved to sell us to a
mississippi trader who was then in the county this was reported by a
spy a house-servant who professed to have overheard the conversation
and who reported besides that our master and his son were furbishing
up their fire-arms and laying in terrible supply of balls and powder

now whether this account was true or not i never knew and i suppose i
never shall until i am in my grave it was enough however to drive
us to a phrensy those in particular who had been indicated as the
intended victims of the mississippi trader and the more especially
as those men had wives and children from whom they were told they
were to be parted one of these was the blacksmith of the estate
who being a resolute and fierce-tempered fellow instantly began to
convert all the old horseshoes and iron hoops about his shop into a
kind of blades or spear-heads which we fastened upon poles and hid
away in secret places there were among us three or four men who had
muskets with which they used to shoot wild fowl on the river there
being great abundance at this season these weapons were also put into
requisition besides which we stored away butcher-knives and bludgeons
old scythe-blades and sickles beaten straight until we could boast
quite an armory and here i may observe that the faster these weapons
increased upon our hands the more deadly became our resolutions the
more fierce and malignant our desires until having at last what we
thought a sufficiency for our purpose we gave a loose to our passions
and determined upon a plan of proceedings that may well be called
infernal

i believe that when we began to collect these offensive weapons
we had but vague ideas of mischief thinking rather of defending
ourselves from some meditated outrage on the part of our master than
of beginning an assault upon him ourselves but now the armory being
complete and several cunning fellows who had been spying out among
the surrounding plantations bringing us word that the gangs so they
sometimes call the whole number of hands on a farm of most of them
were ready to strike with us for freedom another having brought us
word that a great outbreaking had already taken place south of james
river which however was not true a third reminding us that we were
more numerous than our masters and a fourth bidding us remember that
the negroes had once as the little book told us been the masters of
all the white men in the world and might be again i say these things
being represented to us as we were handling our arms and thinking what
execution we could do with them we shook hands together and kissing
the little pamphlet for which we had conceived a high regard as we
had seen white men kiss the book in courts of law we swore we would
exterminate all the white men in virginia beginning with our master
and his family




 chapter xii


how the spoils of victory were intended to be divided


the chief men in the conspiracy were by all consent the fellow called
governor of whom i have said so much before parson jim who although
a little in the background at first had soon taken a foremost stand
and was indeed the first to propose murder myself not that i was
really very active or fiery in the matter but because i had become
prominent as the reader of the little book cesar the blacksmith
and a fellow named zip or scipio who was the chief fiddler and
banjo-player and had been therefore in great favour with the family
until he lost it by some misconduct

the parson having uttered the diabolical proposal i mentioned before
and seeing it well received got up to make a speech to inflame our
courage there was in his oration a good deal of preaching with a
considerable sprinkling of scraps from the bible such as he had picked
up in the course of his clerical career what he chiefly harped on was
that greatness of the negro nation spoken of before and he discoursed
so energetically of the great kings and generals the great faroes and
cannibals as he called them who had distinguished the race in olden
time that all became ambitious to figure with similar dignity in story

what you speak faw pawson said governor interrupting him and
looking round with the air of a lord i be king hah and hab my
sarvants to wait on me

what you say dah gub'nor cried zip the fiddler with equal spirit
you be king i be president

i be emp'ror like dat ah nigga in high-ty said another

i be constable cried a fourth

you be cuss you no go for de best man cried governor in a heat
i be constable myself and i lick any nigga i like who say me no
hah i smash him brain out dem nigga governor was a tyrant already
and all began to be more or less afraid of him i'll be de great man
and i shall hab my choice ob de women what you say dat i sall hab
missa isabella faw my wife who say me no dah

berry well cried scipio i hab missa edie that is miss edith
the next in age who was however not yet thirteen and therefore but
a poor little child

brudder zip said jim the parson i speak fust dah the labourer is
wordy ob his hiah i shall put my hand to de plough and i shall hab
missa edie for my wife arter me if you please brudder zip

hold you jaw zip said king governor to the fiddler who was ready
to knock the parson down you shall hab massa maja's wife and you
shall cut his head off fust as faw de oder niggas he-ah what faw use
ob quar'lin we shall have wifes enough when we kills white massas
gorry we shall hab pick

and thus my companions apportioned among themselves in prospective
the wives and daughters of their intended victims and thus doubtless
they would have apportioned them in reality had the bloody enterprise
been allowed the success its projectors anticipated i remember that my
blood suddenly froze within my veins when the conspiracy had reached
this point and the idea of seeing those innocent helpless maidens
made the prey of brutal murderers was so shocking to my spirit that i
lost speech and could scarce support myself on my feet

while i stood thus confused among them the conspirators determined
upon a plan of action by which as far as i understood it the houses
of my master and his son the two being previously murdered were to
be set on fire at the same moment on the following night and at the
sight of the flames the slaves on several neighbouring plantations were
to fall upon their masters in like manner after which the gangs from
all the burnt estates were to meet at a common rendezvous and march
in a body against the neighbouring village the sacking of which they
joyously looked forward to as the first step in a career of conquest
and triumph in other words of murder and rapine

who would have thought that a little book framed by a philanthropist
for the humane purpose of turning his neighbour from the error of his
way should have lighted a torch in his dwelling only to be quenched
by blood i am myself a witness that the pamphlet was not one of those
incendiary publications of which so much is said as being designed
for the eyes of slaves themselves to exasperate them to revolt by no
means it was addressed to the master and of course was only designed
for him why the pictures were put in it however i cannot imagine
since it may be supposed the master could understand the argument and
exhortation of the writer well enough without them perhaps they were
intended to divert his children

the book however whatever may have been the object for which it was
written had the effect to make a hundred men who were previously
contented with their lot in life and perhaps as happy as any other men
ordained to a life of labour the victims of dissatisfaction and range
the enemies of those they had once loved and in fine the contrivers
and authors of their own destruction




 chapter xiii


the attack of the insurgents upon the mansion at ridgewood hill


i said that when the conspiracy reached the crisis mentioned before
i was suddenly seized with terror i began to think with what kindness
i had been treated by those i had leagued to destroy and the baseness
and ingratitude of the whole design struck me with such force that
i was two or three times on the point of going to my master and
revealing it to him while he had yet the power to escape but my fears
of him and of my fellow-ruffians deterred me i thought he looked
fierce and stern and as for my companions i conceited that they were
watching me dogging my every step prepared to kill me the moment i
attempted to play them false it was unfortunate that my rudeness to
master tommy had caused me to be banished the house for although my
master did not beat me he was persuaded my violence in that case was
not altogether jocose and therefore punished me by sending me to the
fields hence i had no opportunity to see him in private unless i had
sought it which would have exposed me to observation

the night came and it came to me bringing such gloom and horror that
my agitation was observed by governor and others who railed at me for
a coward and threatened to take my life if i did not behave more like
a man this only increased my alarm and truly my disorder of mind
became so great that i was in a species of stupid distraction when the
moment for action arrived for which reason i retain but a confused
recollection of the first events and cannot therefore give a clear
relation of them

i remember that there was some confusion produced by an unexpected act
on the part of our master who it was generally supposed designed
crossing the creek to visit the major having ordered his carriage and
the ferry-boat to be got ready and it was resolved to kill him while
crossing the creek on his return after which we were to fire a volley
of guns as a signal to the major's gang and then assault and burn our
master's dwelling instead of departing however when the night came
he remained at home shut up with the overseer and young mr andrews
his daughter's lover and it was reported that they had barred up the
doors and windows and were sitting at a table covered with loaded
pistols thus making it manifest that they suspected our intentions
and were resolved to defend themselves to the last

for my part i have never believed that our master suspected his
danger at all he perceived indeed that an ill spirit had got among
his people but neither he nor any of his family really believed that
mischief was intended had they done so he would undoubtedly have
procured assistance or at least removed his children the windows were
barred indeed and perhaps earlier than usual which may have been
accidental and as for the fire-arms on the table i believe they were
only fowling-pieces which my master mr andrews and the overseer
who was a great fowler and therefore much favoured by my master who
was a veteran sportsman were getting ready to shoot wild ducks with in
the morning

my companions however were persuaded that our victims were on their
guard and the hour drawing nigh at which they had appointed to strike
the first blow and give the signal to the neighbouring gangs they
were at a loss not knowing what to do for they were afraid to attack
the house while three resolute men armed with pistols stood ready to
receive them in this conjuncture it was proposed by governor who
from having been a fellow notorious for nothing save monkey tricks and
waggery was now become a devil incarnate he was so bold cunning and
eager for blood to fire the pile of timber where it stood near the
quarters or negro-huts the burning of which would serve the double
purpose of drawing our intended victims from the house and giving the
signal to the neighbouring estates

the proposal was instantly adopted and in a few moments the pile of
dry resinous wood was in a flame burning with prodigious violence
and casting a bright light over the whole mansion the lawn and even
the neighbouring river at the same moment and just as we were about
to raise the treacherous alarm we heard a sudden firing of guns and
shouting beyond the creek at the major's house which made us suppose
the negroes there had anticipated us in the rising

emulous not to be outdone our own party now set up a horrid alarm of
fire accompanied with screams and yells that might have roused the
dead and ran to the mansion door as if to demand assistance of their
master

never shall i forget the scene that ensued i stood rooted to the
ground not twenty steps from the house when the door was thrown
open and my master rushed out followed by andrews and the overseer
they had scarce put foot on the porch before six or seven guns being
all that the conspirators could muster and which the owners held in
readiness were discharged at them and then they were set upon by
others with the spears the light of the fire illuminated the porch
so that objects were plainly distinguishable yet so violent was the
rush of assailants so wild the tumult so brief the contest that i
can scarce say i really witnessed the particulars of the tragedy i
beheld indeed my master's gray hairs for he was of towering stature
floating an instant over the heads of the assailants but the next
moment they had vanished and i saw but a single white man struggling
in the hall against a mass of foes and crying out to miss isabella
by name to escape with the children vain counsel vain sacrifice
of safety to humanity the faithful overseer for it was he who made
this heroic effort to save his master's children his master and young
andrews lying dead or mortally wounded on the porch was cut down on
the spot and the shrieks of the children as they fled some into the
open air by a back door and others to the upper chambers and the
savage yells of triumph with which they were pursued told how vainly
he had devoted himself to save them




 chapter xiv

the tragical occurrences that followed


while i stood thus observing the horrors i had been instrumental in
provoking as incapable of putting a stop to as of assisting in them
i saw two of the children little tommy and his youngest sister lucy
a girl of seven or eight years running wildly over the lawn several
of my ruffian companions pursuing them the girl was snatched up by old
aunt phoebe who with other women had come among us wringing her
hands and beseeching us not to kill their young misses and was thus
saved as for the boy he caught sight of me and sprang into my arms
entreating me not to let them kill him and he would never hurt me
again in all his life and would give me all his money

poor child i would have defended him at that moment with my life for
my heart bled for what had already been done but he was snatched out
of my hands and i saw no more of him i heard afterward however that
he was not hurt having been saved by the women who had protected in
like manner his two little sisters jane and lucy as for the others
that is isabella and edith i witnessed their fate with my own eyes
and it was the suddenness and horror of it that by unmanning me
entirely prevented my giving aid to the boy when he was torn from my
arms

the fire had by this time spread from the timber to an adjacent cabin
and a light equal to that of noon though red as blood itself was
shed over the whole mansion on the roof of which was a little cupola
or observatory open to the weather where was room for five or six
persons to sit together and enjoy the prospect of the river and
surrounding hills and on either side of this cupola was a platform
though without a balustrade on which was space for as many more

the observatory being strongly illuminated by the flames and my
eyes being turned thitherward by a furious yell which was suddenly
set up around me i beheld my master's daughter isabella rush into
it that is into the observatory from the staircase below hotly
pursued as was evident from what followed she bore in her arms or
rather dragged after her for the child was in a swoon her sister
edith who was but small of stature and light and as she reached this
forlorn place of refuge she threw down the trapdoor that covered its
entrance and endeavoured to keep it down with her foot there was
something inexpressibly fearful in her appearance independent of the
dreadfulness of her situation separated only by a narrow plank from
ruffians maddened by rage and carnage from whom death itself was a
boon too merciful to be expected and from whom she was to guard not
only herself but the feeble unconscious being hanging on her neck
her hair was all dishevelled her dress torn and disordered and her
face as white as snow yet there was a wild energy and fierceness
breathing from every feature and she looked like a lioness defending
to the last her young from the hunters from whom she yet knows there
is no escape

the trapdoor shook under her foot and was at last thrown violently
up and up with screams of triumph darted the infuriated governor
followed by jim and others to grasp their prey their prey had fled
without uttering a word or scream she sprang from the cupola to the
platform at its side and then with a fearlessness only derived from
desperation and still bearing her insensible sister she stepped upon
the roof which was high and steep and ran along it to its extremity

even the ferocious governor was for a moment daunted at the boldness of
the act and afraid to follow until the parson well worthy he of the
name set him the example by leaping on the shingles and pursuing the
unhappy girl to her last refuge he approached he stretched forth his
arm to seize her but he was not destined to lay an impure touch on the
devoted and heroic creature i saw her lay her lips once on those of
the poor edith the next instant the frail figure of the little sister
was hurled from her arms to be dashed to pieces on the stones below
in another the hapless isabella herself had followed her having
thrown herself headlong from the height to escape by death a fate
otherwise inevitable

of what followed i have but a faint and disordered recollection i
remember that the fall of the two maidens caused loud cries of horror
from the men and of lamentation from the women and i remember also
that these were renewed almost immediately after but mingled with the
sound of fire-arms discharged by a party of foes and the voices of
white men among which i distinguished that of my master's son the
major calling upon one another to give no quarter to the miscreants
a party of armed horsemen had in fact ridden among us and were now
dealing death on all hands from pistols and sabres from one of the
latter weapons i myself received a severe cut and was at the same time
struck down by the hoofs of a horse and left insensible




 chapter xv


the results of the insurrection with a truly strange and fatal
catastrophe that befell the author


when i recovered my senses i found myself a prisoner bound hand
and foot and lying with six or seven of my late companions in a
cart in which groaning with pain for most of us were wounded and
anticipating a direful end to our dreams of conquest and revenge we
were trundled to the village and there deposited in the county jail
to repent at leisure the rashness and enormity of our enterprise

the power of that little pamphlet of which i have said so much to
produce an effect for which we must charitably suppose it was not
intended was shown in the numbers of wretches by whom the prison
was crowded for it had been used to inflame the passions of the
negroes on several different estates all of whom had agreed to rise
in insurrection although as it providentially happened the revolt
extended to the length of murder only on ridgewood hill the conspiracy
was detected i believe confessed by a slave on a plantation adjacent
to that of my master's son who being informed of it and assisted
by a party that brought the news proceeded to seize the ringleaders
in his own gang some of whom attempting to make their escape were
fired on and this was the cause of the volley which we had heard
and supposed was fired by our fellow-conspirators beyond the creek
the major then crossed over to his father's estate but too late to
avert the tragedy which i have related his father his eldest sister
and her lover were already dead as for the younger edith she was
taken up alive but cruelly mangled and she expired in a few hours
the faithful and devoted overseer i have the happiness to believe
ultimately escaped with his life for although covered with wounds
and at first reported dead he revived sufficiently to make deposition
to the facts of the assault and murder as far as he was cognizant of
them and i heard he was expected to recover

of those who perished the father the children and the gallant
friend there was not one who was not a fortnight before respected
and beloved by those who slew them and at their death-hour they were
as guiltless of wrong and as deserving of affection and gratitude
as they ever had been how therefore they came to be hated and why
they were killed i am unable to divine all that i know is that we
who loved them read a book which fell in our way and from that moment
knew them only as enemies objects on whom we had a right to glut our
fiercest passions

as for ourselves my deluded companions at least their fate can be
easily imagined some were killed at the scene of murder among others
the chief leader governor who was shot on the roof of the house
parson jim was wounded on the same place and rolling from the roof
was horribly crushed by the fall but lingered in unspeakable agonies
for several days and then died scipio the fiddler was taken alive
tried condemned and executed with many others whose participation in
the crime left them no hope of mercy

with these i was myself put upon trial and adjudged to death for
although it was made apparent that i had not lifted my hand against any
one it was proved that i was more than privy to the plot that i had
been instrumental in fomenting it and the known favour with which i
had been treated added the double die of ingratitude to my offence i
was therefore condemned and bade to expect no mercy nor did i expect
it for the fatal day appointed for the execution having arrived a
rope was put round my neck and i was led to the gibbet

and now i am about to relate what will greatly surprise the reader i
was not only found guilty and condemned i was hanged escape was
impossible and i perceived it the anguish of my mind for in anguish
it may be supposed i looked forward to my fate was increased by the
consciousness so long slumbering that flashed on it as i was driven
to the fatal tree that i was in reality not tom the slave but
sheppard lee the freeman and that i possessed a power of evading
the halter or any other inconvenience provided i were allowed but
one opportunity to exercise it but where was i now to look for a
dead body it is true there were bodies enough by-and-by when my
accomplices were tucked up around me but what advantage could i derive
from entering any one of them since my fate must be equally certain to
be hanged

my distress i repeat was uncommonly great and in the midst of it i
was executed which put an end to the quandary




 chapter xvi


in which it is related what became of the author after being hanged


here it would seem that my history should find its natural close
but i hope to convince the world that a man may live to record his own
death and burial i say burial for from all i have heard i judge
that i was buried as well as hanged and that i lay in the earth in a
coarse deal coffin from two o'clock in the afternoon of a november
day until nine at night when certain young doctors of the village
who were desirous to show their skill in anatomy came to the place of
execution and dug up the three best bodies of which as my good luck
would have it my own was one zip the fiddler's being another while
the third was that of a young fellow named sam notorious for nothing
so much as a great passion he had for butting with his head against
brick walls or even stone ones provided they were smooth enough

the young anatomists previous to hacking us resolved to try some
galvanic experiments on us having procured a battery for that purpose
and they invited a dozen or more respectable gentlemen to be present
and witness the effects of that extraordinary fluid galvanism on our
lifeless bodies

the first essayed was that of the unfortunate scipio who being well
charged began to the admiration of all present to raise first one
arm and then the other then to twist the fingers of his left hand in
a peculiar way as if turning a screw inclining his head the while
towards his left shoulder and then to saw the air sweeping his right
hand to and fro across his breast with great briskness and energy
the fingers of his left titillating at the air all the while so as to
present the lively spectacle of a man playing the fiddle and indeed
it was judged so natural was every motion that had the party been
provided with a fiddle and bow to put into his hands they would have
played such a jig as would have set all present dancing

the next experiment tried was upon the body of sam whose muscles
were speedily excited to exercise themselves in the way to which they
had been most accustomed though not in one so agreeable to the chief
operator for in this case the lifeless corse suddenly lifting up its
head bestowed it with a jerk of propulsion equal in force to the but
of a battering-ram full against the stomach of the operator whereby
he was tumbled head over heels and all the breath beaten out of his
body

the reader may suppose as it was proved to be the virtue of galvanism
to set the dead muscles doing those acts to which the living ones had
been longest habituated that i upon being charged could do nothing
less than throw myself upon my hands and knees and go galloping about
the table as i had been used to do over the lawn when master tommy
was mounted upon my back

such however was not the fact the first thing i did upon feeling the
magical fluid penetrate my nerves was to open my eyes and snap them
twice or thrice the second to utter a horrible groan which greatly
disconcerted the spectators and the third to start bolt upright on
my feet and ask them what the devil they were after in a word i
was suddenly resuscitated and to the great horror of all present
doctors and lookers-on who fetching a yell that caused me to think
i had got among condemned spirits in purgatory fled from the room
exclaiming that i was the devil and no niggur what was particularly
lamentable though i was far from so esteeming it one of them a
young gentleman who had come to the exhibition out of curiosity being
invited by one of the doctors was so overcome with terror that before
he reached the door of the room he fell down in a fit and being
neglected by the others none of whom stopped to give him help expired
on the spot

as for me the cause of all the alarm i believe i was ten times
more frightened than any of the spectators especially when i came
to recollect that i had just been hanged and that i would in all
probability be hanged again unless i now succeeded in making my
escape as for the cause of my resuscitation and the events that
accompanied it i was then entirely ignorant of them and indeed
i must confess i learned them afterward out of the newspapers i
knew however that i had been hanged and that i had been by some
extraordinary means or other brought to life again and i perceived
that if i did not make my escape without delay i should certainly be
recaptured by the returning doctors

i ran towards the door and then for the first time beheld that
unfortunate spectator who had fallen dead as i mentioned before and
lay upon the floor with his face turned up i recollected him on the
instant as being a young gentleman whom i had once or twice seen at
my late master's house all that i knew of him was that his name was
megrim that he was reputed to be very wealthy and a great genius or
as some said eccentric and that he was admired by the ladies and
doubtless because he was a genius

as i looked him in the face i heard in the distance the uproar of
voices which had succeeded the flight of the doctors suddenly
burst out afresh with the sound of returning footsteps and a
loud bully-like voice which i thought very much like that of the
under-turnkey at the prison a man whom i had learned to fear cried
out let me see your devil for may i be cussed up hill and down
hill if i ever seed a bigger one than myself

horrible as was the voice i was not dismayed i saw at my feet a city
of refuge into which my enemies could not pursue me my escape was
within my own power

master said i touching my head for i had no hat to the corpse
if it is all the same to you i beg you'll let me take possession of
your body

as i pronounced the words the translation was effected and that so
rapidly that just as i drew my first breath in the body of mr megrim
it was knocked out of me by the fall of my old one which i not
having taken the precaution to stand a little to one side fell down
like a thunderbolt upon me bruising me very considerably about the
precordia

in this state being half suffocated and somewhat frightened i was
picked up and carried away by my new friends and put to bed where
having swallowed an anodyne i fell directly sound asleep

and here before proceeding farther i will say that the doctors and
their friends were greatly surprised to discover my late body lying
dead having expected to find it as animated as when they left it but
by-and-by having reflected that the galvanism or artificial life
infused into its nerves had been naturally exhausted at last whereupon
it as naturally followed that the body should return to its lifeless
condition they began to aver that the most surprising part of the
business was that it had kept me alive so long and enabled me after
groaning and speaking as i had actually done to walk so far from the
table on which i had been lying

on the whole the phenomenon was considered curious and wonderful
and an account of it having been drawn up by the doctors and headed
extraordinary case of the effects of galvanism on a dead body it was
printed for the benefit of scientific men throughout the world in a
medical journal where i doubt not it may be found at this day





book vii

which is intended as a pendant to book i and contains the history of
a young gentleman of fortune





 chapter i


containing an inkling of the life and habits of mr arthur megrim


having been carried from the scene of my late transformation as i
mentioned before physicked put to bed and allowed to sleep off
my troubles i awoke late on the following morning feeling very
comfortable notwithstanding the bruises on my ribs and with an
uncommonly agreeable though lazy sense of the enjoyment of lying
a-bed indeed this was my only feeling i woke to a consciousness
though a vague one of the change in my condition and this together
with what i saw around me when i had succeeded after some effort in
getting my eyes a little opened it may be supposed would have filled
me with surprise and excited in me a great curiosity to inquire into
matters relating to mr arthur megrim

such however was not the case i looked upon the elegantly-adorned
chamber in which i lay and the sumptuous robes of my bed with as much
indifference as if i had been accustomed to them all my life and as
for the happy destiny that now seemed opening upon me i scarce thought
on it at all

nor can i say that i felt in any way elated at my fortunate escape
from the hangman and the anatomists i remembered that affair with a
drowsy indifference as being a matter of no further consequence to me
and as for mr arthur megrim's friends and kinsmen his interests and
relations in life i thought to myself with a yawn i shall know them
all in good time

i was content to take things as they might come and eschew labours of
mind as well as efforts of body curiosity i felt was a tumultuous
passion and i therefore resolved to avoid it in this mood i turned
over on the other side and took a second nap

from this i was roused after a time by some one tugging at my
shoulder who proved upon examination to be a very elegant-looking
mulatto-boy that is a boy of twenty-five years or thereabouts who
signified in language as genteel as his person that it was exactly
half past eleven o'clock and therefore time for me to get up

augh well said i taking about thirty seconds to gape out each
word it seemed such tiresome work to articulate what do you want

want you to get up sah missie ann says it does you no good to sleep
so long

augh who is missie ann

lar bless us said the gentleman turning up the white of his eye
missie ann is massa's sister

who is massa

you massa massa arthur

augh well and who are you

paminondas massa coat very nicely brushed very fine day will do
you good sah to get up and taste the air regular indian summer sah

you may go to the devil

yes sah

with that i turned over for another nap which i should undoubtedly
have taken had i not been interrupted just as i was falling asleep
by the entrance of a lady of a somewhat starched and venerable
appearance though not more than six or seven years older than myself
i being perhaps twenty-five or six

a'n't you ashamed of yourself arthur said she do tell me do you
intend to lie a-bed for ever

augh pshaw said i pray madam be so good as to inform me who you
are and augh what you want in my chamber

come said the lady don't be ridiculous and fall into any of
your hyppoes again don't pretend you don't know your own sister ann
megrim

i won't said i but augh sister if you have no objection i
should like augh to sleep till dinner is ready

dinner screamed my sister ann megrim don't suppose you will ever
be able to eat a dinner again you know the doctor says it is your hard
eating and your laziness together that have destroyed your digestive
apparatus and that if you don't adhere to the bran bread and hickory
ashes tea you'll never be cured in the world

what said i am i sick

undoubtedly said my sister ann your digestive apparatus is all
destroyed and your nerves too did not you faint last night when they
were galvanizing the bodies have you not lost all muscular power so
that you do nothing but lie on a bed or sofa all day long oh really
brother arthur megrim i am ashamed of you a man like you a young man
and a rich man a man of family and genius a gentleman and a scholar
a man who might make himself governor of the state or president of
the nation or any thing yet to be nothing at all except the laziest
man in virginia a man with no digestive apparatus a poor nervous
hyppo oh it is too bad do get up and stir yourself mount your
horse or go out in the carriage exercise you know is the only thing
to restore strength to the digestive apparatus

sister ann said i the more you speak of my digestive apparatus
the more augh the more i am convinced you don't know what you are
talking about i am resolved to get up and eat my dinner 

of bran bread and hickory ashes said my sister

of canvass-back ducks and terapins said i at which miss ann megrim
expressed terror and aversion and endeavoured to convince me that such
indulgence would be punished by a horrible indigestion as had been the
case a thousand times before

but cogent as were her arguments i had or felt one still stronger
on my side being a savage appetite which was waking within that very
digestive apparatus she held in such disesteem and which became the
more eager the more she besought me to resist it

the discussion was so far advantageous that it set me wide awake and
by-and-by the zealous epaminondas having made his second appearance
i succeeded with his assistance in getting on my clothes and
descending to the dining-room where to the great horror and grief
of my affectionate relative i demolished two ducks and a half being
the true canvass-backs or white-backs as they call them in that
country and a full grown tortoise of the genus emys and species
palustris and in this operation i may say i found the first
excitement of pleasure which i had yet known in my new body and
displayed an energy of application of which i did not before know that
i was capable nor am i certain that any ill consequences followed the
meal i felt indeed a strong propensity to throw myself on a sofa and
recruit after the labours of eating but this miss megrim resisted
insisting i should get into my carriage for it seems i had one and a
very handsome one too and drive about to avoid a surfeit

in this i consented to gratify her wishes whereby i gratified one of
my own for i fell sound asleep within five minutes after starting and
so remained until the excursion was over

then being as hungry as ever and not knowing what else to do i
picked my teeth over a newspaper and nodded at a novel until supper
was got ready which disregarding miss megrim's exhortations as
before i attacked with the good-will i had carried to my dinner
eating on this occasion two terapins and a half and one whole duck of
the genus anas and species vallisneria

the only ill consequences were that i dreamed of the devil and his
imps all night and that i awoke in a crusty humour next morning


footnote i had these learned names of a scientific doctor in the
village and i have see them also in the newspapers




 chapter ii


the happy condition in which sheppard lee is at last placed


if there be among my readers any person so discontented with his lot
that he would be glad to exchange conditions with another i think had
he been acquainted with mr arthur megrim he would have desired an
exchange with him above all other persons in the world for mr megrim
possessed all those requisites which are thought to ensure happiness to
a human being he was young rich and independent of a good family
he boasted the chivalrous blood of the megrims of a sound body
and serene temper and with no appetite for those excesses which ruin
the reputation while they debase the minds and destroy the peace of
youth his years as i have mentioned already were twenty-five or six
his revenues were far above his wants and enabled him to support his
town-house which was the most elegant one in the village where he
lived remote from the care and trouble of his plantations and as for
independence that was manifestly complete he being a bachelor and
the sole surviver of his family excepting only his sister miss ann
megrim who managed his household and thus took from his mind the only
care that could otherwise have disturbed it

what then in the whole world had mr megrim to trouble him nothing
on earth and for that reason to speak paradoxically he was more
troubled than any one else on earth labour pain and care the
evils which men are so apt to censure providence for entailing upon
the race i have had experience enough to know are essential to the
true enjoyment of life serving like salt pepper mustard and
other condiments and spices which are by themselves ungrateful to
the palate to give a relish to the dish that is insipid and cloying
without them who enjoys health who is so sensible of the rapture of
being well as he who has just been relieved from sickness who can
appreciate the delightful luxury of repose so well as the labourer
released from his daily toil who in fine tastes of the bliss of
happiness like him who is introduced to it after a probation of
suffering the surest way to cure a boy of a love of cakes and comfils
is to put him apprentice to a confectioner the truth is that the
sweets of life enjoyed by themselves are just as disgusting as the
bitters and can only be properly relished when alternated or mingled
with the latter

but as this is philosophy and the reader will skip it i will pursue
the subject no further but jump at once from the principle to the
practical illustration as seen in my history while a resident in the
body of mr arthur megrim

i was on the sudden a rich young man with nothing on earth to
trouble me i had lands and houses rich plantations a nation or two
of negroes herds of sheep and cattle with mills fisheries and some
half dozen or more gold-mines which last and it may be considered
out of virginia a wondrous evidence of my wealth were decidedly the
least valuable of all my possessions with all these things i was made
acquainted by my sister ann or otherwise it is highly probable i
should have known nothing about them for during the whole period of my
seventh existence i confined myself to my property in the village not
having the least curiosity to visit my plantations which as everybody
told me were in good hands

in the village itself i had every thing about me to secure happiness a
fine house abundance of servants the whole under the management of
the best of housekeepers my sister ann with horses and carriages for
which however i cared but little thinking it laborious to ride and
as tedious to be driven and above all friends without number who
treated me with a respect amounting to veneration for it must be
remembered i was the richest man in the county and with a degree of
affection little short of idolatry but whom however i thought very
troublesome tiresome people seeing that they visited me too often
and wearied me to death with long conversations about every thing

among them all there was but one for whom i felt any friendship and
he was a young doctor named tibbikens for whom my sister ann had a
great respect and who had been retained by her to assist in taking
care of my digestive apparatus that same digestive apparatus of mine
being a hobby on which my sister lavished more thought and anxiety than
i believe she did upon her own soul not meaning to reflect upon her
religion however for she was a member of the presbyterian church and
quite devout about the time of communion the cause of her solicitude
as she gave me frequent opportunity to know by her allusion to the
fact was her having been once afflicted in her own person with a
disorder of the digestive apparatus which it had been the good fortune
of doctor tibbikens to cure by a regimen of bran bread and hickory
ashes water and hence her affection for the doctor and the remedy i
liked the doctor myself because he had the same solicitude about my
health without troubling me with advice except when i asked it or
finding much fault when i did not follow it because his conversation
was agreeable except when he was in a scientific humour and did not
require any efforts on my part to keep it up because he liked terapins
and white-backs as well as myself and was of opinion they were
wholesome provided one ate them in moderation and in fine because
he took pains to help me to amusement and was of great assistance in
dissipating somewhat of that tedium which was the first evil with which
i was afflicted in the body of mr arthur megrim i believe the doctor
had a strong fancy for my sister but she used to declare she could
never think of marrying and thus being drawn from what she felt to
be the chief duty of her existence namely the care of my digestive
apparatus




 chapter iii


the employments of a young gentleman of fortune


and now having mentioned tedium of existence as being an evil to
which i soon felt myself subject i will say that it was one i found
more oppressive than the reader can readily imagine i had nothing
in the world to do and as it happened my disposition did not lead
me to seek any thing i was in a word the very man my sister had
so reproachfully called me in our first conversation that is the
laziest man in all virginia and upon reflection i can think of
no person in the world who would bear a comparison with me in that
particular except myself none but himself can be his parallel as
somebody or other says i don't know who a sentiment that is supposed
to be absurd inasmuch as it involves an impossibility but which
becomes good sense when applied to me in my original condition in
the body in which i was first introduced to life i certainly had a
great aversion to all troublesome employments whether of business or
amusement being supposed by many persons to be then what as many
considered me now to wit the laziest man in my state whether i was
lazier as sheppard lee the jerseyman or arthur megrim the virginian
i am not able to say in both cases indolence was at the bottom of
all my troubles there was this difference however between the two
conditions that whereas i had felt in one the evils of laziness to a
poor man i was now to discover in the other what were its evils to a
man of fortune

my chief employments in the body of mr arthur megrim were eating and
sleeping and i certainly should have done nothing else had i been
allowed to follow my own humours eating and sleeping therefore
consumed the greater portion of my time but it could not consume all
nor could the residue be filled up by the occasional excursions in my
curricle and the still more unfrequent strolls through the village
into which i was driven by my affectionate sister or cajoled by her
coadjutor the doctor in their zealous care of my digestive apparatus
as for visits and visitations i abhorred them all whether they
related to the bustling young gentlemen of the neighbourhood or the
loquacious ladies old and young who cultivated the friendship of my
sister

employ myself however as i might there always remained a portion
of each day which i could not get rid of either in bed or at the
table on such occasions i was devoured by ennui and thought that even
existence was an infliction that it was hard work to live according
to my sister's account i was a scholar and a genius in which case i
ought to have found employment enough of an intellectual nature either
in books or the reflections of my own mind i certainly had a very
large and fine library in my house and there was scarce a week passed
by in which i did not receive a huge bundle of the newest publications
from a book-seller who had long had it in charge thus to supply me
of these i usually read the title-pages and then turned them over to
my sister or which was more common lent them to my neighbours who
male and female together came flocking to borrow the day after and
sometimes the day before the arrival of each package taking good care
to rob me of those that were most interesting the truth is if i ever
had had the power of reading i had now lost it books only set me
nodding

as for exercising my mind in reflections of its own that was even more
laborious than reading and i contracted a dislike to it particularly
as my mind wore itself out every night in dreaming that being a result
of the goodly suppers i used to eat it is true that i one day fell
into a sudden ferment and being inspired actually seized upon pen and
paper and wrote a poem in blank verse forty lines long with which i
was so pleased that i read it to tibbikens and my sister both of whom
were in raptures with it the former carrying it off to the editor of
the village paper who printed it with such a eulogium upon its merits
as made me believe byron was a fool to me while all the young ladies
immediately paid my sister ann a visit that they might tell me how
they admired the beautiful piece and lament that i wrote so seldom i
forget what the poem was about but i remember i was so delighted with
the praise bestowed on it that i resolved to write another which
however i did not do having unfortunately begun it in rhyme which
was difficult and my fit of inspiration and energy having left me
before i got through with my next dinner it was my writing verses i
suppose that caused me to be called a genius but it seems i was too
lazy to be inspired more than once or twice a year

i relapsed into ennui and truly i became more tired of it before it
was done with me than was ever a labourer of his hod or mattock




 chapter iv


some account of the inconveniences of having a digestive apparatus


but ennui was not the worst of the evils that clouded my happy lot
some touches of that diabolical disorder the curse of the rich man
which as my sister so often gave me to know had threatened the peace
of mr arthur megrim several times before now began to assail my own
serenity and threw gall and ratsbane over my dinners i had slighted
her warnings and despised her advice and now i was to pay the price
of indiscretion in a word that very digestive apparatus on which she
read me a lecture at least thrice a day began to grumble refuse to do
duty and strike though unlike the industrious artisans who were
in all quarters setting it the example it struck not for high wages
of which it had had a surfeit but for low ones in which however its
master was scarce able to oblige it having an uncommonly good appetite
most of the time and even when he had not not well knowing how to
dispose of his time unless at the table

my faithful sister who had been so constant to predict was the first
to detect the coming evil and step by step she pointed it out to my
unwilling observation

arthur said she one morning as we sat at breakfast your eyelid is
winking

augh  said i yes it is winking

it is a sign said she your digestive apparatus is getting out of
order

augh said i hang the digestive apparatus for i was tired of
hearing it mentioned

arthur said she the next day you are beginning to look yellow and
bilious

yes said i on which she declared that the alkalis of my biliary
fluids she had studied the whole theory and nomenclature of dyspepsy
out of a book the doctor lent her were beginning to fail to coalesce
in the natural chymical way with the acids of the chymous mass and
that no better argument could be desired to prove that my digestive
apparatus was getting out of order and she concluded by recommending
me to regulate my diet and fall back upon bran bread and hickory ashes

in short my dear sister assailed me with a pertinacity equal to the
disease itself so that i came in a short time to consider her as one
of its worst symptoms

to add to my woes dr tibbikens began to go over to her opinion to
talk of my digestive apparatus and to drop hints in relation to bran
bread and hickory ashes which would decidedly have robbed him of my
friendship had i not at last found myself unable to do without him

to make a long story short i will omit a detailed history of my
tribulations during the winter and skip at once to the following
spring at the opening of which i found myself young rich and
independent as i was the bond-slave and victim of a malady to which
the woes of age and penury are as the sting of moschetoes to the teeth
of raging tigers

reader i have in the course of this history related to thee many
miseries which it was my lot on different occasions to encounter
and some of them of a truly cruel and insupportable character could
i however give thee a just conception of the ills i was now doomed
to suffer which of a certainty i cannot do unless thou art at this
moment the victim of a similar infliction i am convinced thou wouldst
agree with me that i had now stumbled upon a grief that concentrated
in itself all others of which human nature is capable

dost thou know what it is to have thy stomach stuffed like an
ostrich's with old iron hoops and brickbats or feeling as if it were
to have it now drowned in vinegar now scorched as with hot potatoes
thy head filled with achings dizziness and streaks of lightning thy
heart transformed into the heels of a hornpipe-dancer and plying thy
ribs lungs and diaphragm with the energy of an artiste in the last
agony

if thou dost then thou wilt know that bodily distress of which the
above miseries form but a small portion is the least of the evils of
dyspepsy that its most horrible symptoms develop themselves in the
mind what care those devils falsely called blue for they are as
black as midnight or the bile which engenders them for the youth
the wealth the independence the gentility of a man whose digestive
apparatus is out of order the less cause he may have in reality to
be dissatisfied with his lot the more cause they will find him the
greater and more legitimate his claims to be a happy man the more
fierce and determined their efforts to make him a miserable one

the serenity of my mind gave way before the attacks of these monsters
sleeping and waking by day and by night they assailed me with equal
pertinacity and fury if i slept it was only to be tormented by demon
and caco-demon to be ridden double by incubus and succuba under whose
bestriding limbs i felt like a shetland pony carrying two elephants my
dreams indeed so varied and terrific were the images with which they
afflicted me i can compare to nothing but the horrors or last delirium
of a toper hanging drowning and tumbling down church-steeples were
the common and least frightful of the fancies that crowded my sleeping
brain now i was blown up in a steamboat or run over by a railroad
car now i was sticking fast in a burning chimney scorching and
smothering and now head downwards in a hollow tree with a bear
below snapping at my nose now i was plastered up in a thick wall with
masons hard at work running the superstructure up higher and now i was
enclosed in a huge apple-dumpling boiling in a pot over a hot fire
one while i was crushed by a boa constrictor another perishing by
inches in the mouth of a bengal tiger and again i was in the hands
of dr tibbikens and his scientific coadjutors of the village who
were dissecting me alive in short there was no end to the torments
i endured in slumber and nothing could equal them except those that
beset me while awake

a miserable melancholy seized upon my spirits in which those very
qualifications which everybody envied me the possession of were
regarded with disgust as serving only the purpose of adding to my
tortures what cared i for youth when it opened only a longer vista of
living wretchedness what to me was the wealth which i could not enjoy
which had been given me only to tantalize and as for independence
the idea was a mockery the servitude of a galley-slave was freedom
unlimited license compared with my subjection to dyspepsy and for
the truth must be confessed the doctor to whom i was at last obliged
to submit nolens volens




 chapter v


the same subject continued with an account of several surprising
transformations


whether dr tibbikens treated me secundum artem or not i cannot
say but true it is that instead of getting better i grew gradually
worse until my melancholy became a confirmed hypochondriasis and
fancies gloomy and dire wild and strange seized upon my brain and
conjured up new afflictions

getting up early one morning i found to my horror that i had been
in my sleep converted into a coffee-pot a transformation which i
thought so much more extraordinary than any other i had ever undergone
that i sent for my sister ann and imparted to her the singular secret

oh said she bursting into tears it is all on account of your
unfortunate digestive apparatus but oh brother arthur don't let
such notions get into your head a coffee-pot indeed that's too
ridiculous

i was quite incensed at her skepticism but still more so at the
conduct of dr tibbikens who being sent for hearing of my
misfortune and seeing me stand in the middle of the floor with my
left arm akimbo like a crooked handle and the right stretched out
in the manner of a spout seized me by the shoulders and marched me
towards a great hickory fire that was blazing on the hearth

what do you mean tibbikens said i

to warm you said he i like my coffee hot and so i intend to
boil you over again on that very fire

at these words i started trembled and awoke as from a dream assuring
him i had made a great mistake and was no more of a coffee-pot than
he was an assurance that doubtless prevented my undergoing an ordeal
which i was neither saint nor fire-king enough to endure with impunity
indeed i was quite ashamed of having permitted such a delusion to
enter my brain

the next day however a still more afflicting change came over me for
having tried to read a book in which i was interrupted by a great dog
barking in the street i was seized with a rage of a most unaccountable
nature and falling on my hands and feet i responded to the animal's
cries and barked in like manner being quite certain that i was as
much of a dog as he nay my servant epaminondas coming in i seized
him by the leg and would have worried him had he not run roaring out
of the chamber and my sister ann coming to the door i flew at her
with such ferocity that she was fain to escape down stairs the doctor
was again sent for and popping suddenly into the chamber he rushed
upon me with a great horsewhip he had snatched up along the way and
fell to belabouring me without mercy crying out all the while get
out you rascal get out

villain said i jumping on my hind legs and dancing about to avoid
his lashes what do you mean

to whip you down stairs you cur said he flourishing his weapon
again

on which i assured him as earnestly as i could that i was no cur
whatever and indeed i was quite cured of the fancy

my next conceit was the morning being cold and my fire having gone
out that i was an icicle which fancy was dispelled by the doctor
saluting me with a bucket of water on pretence of melting me and i
was doubtless melted all the sooner for being drenched in water exactly
at the freezing-point

after this i experienced divers other transformations being now
a chicken now a loaded cannon now a clock now a hamper of
crockery-ware and a thousand things besides all which conceits the
doctor cured without much difficulty and with as little consideration
for the roughness of his remedies being a chicken he attempted to
wring my neck calling me a dunghill rooster fit only for the pot he
discharged the cannon from my fancies by clapping a red-hot poker to
my nose and the crate of crockery he broke to pieces by casting it on
the floor to the infinite injury of my bones the clock at first gave
him some trouble until pronouncing it to have a screw out of order
he seized upon one of my front teeth with a pair of pincers and by a
single wrench dissipated the delusion for ever




 chapter vi


an account of the woes of an emperor of france which have never before
appeared in history


in short for i do not design particularizing my transformations
further there was no conceit entered my brain which dr tibbikens
did not cure by a conceit until one morning by some mysterious
revelation the nature and means of which can only be guessed at i
found that i had been elected the emperor of france and announced my
intention to set sail for my government immediately in the first ship
of the line which the american executive could put at my disposal

this fancy quite disconcerted dr tibbikens and i heard him say to
my sister he is a gone case now quite mad i assure you which
expression so much offended me that i ordered him from my presence
and told him that were it not for my respect for the american
government whose subject he was i would have his head for his
impertinence

but wo betide the day the doctor returned to me in less than an hour
bringing with him every physician in the village who having looked
at me a moment went into another apartment where they argued hotly
together for another hour at the expiration of this they returned led
by tibbikens who to my great satisfaction now fell on his knees
and begged my imperial majesty's pardon for presuming to request that
i would allow myself to be dressed in my imperial majesty's robe of
state which robe of state although i was surprised at its plainness
for it was of a coarse linen texture without gold lace or jewels
and of a very strange shape closed in front and open in the rear i
immediately consented to put on so pleased was i with the homage of
the doctor

if i was surprised at the appearance of the imperial garment much more
was i astonished when having slipped my arms into its sleeves i found
them that is my arms suddenly pinioned buried sewed up as it
were among the folds of the robe so that when it was tied behind me
as it immediately was i was as well secured as when i was tied up for
execution on a former occasion alas the disappointment to my pride
i understood the whole matter in a moment my imperial robe of state
was nothing less nor more than a strait waistcoat constructed upon the
spur of the moment but still on scientific principles

and now being entirely at the mercy of the deceitful tibbikens i was
seized upon with a strong hand my head shaved and thrust into a sack
of pounded ice from which it was not taken until after a six days
congelation and then only to be transferred to a nightcap of spanish
flies exceedingly comfortable on the first application but which
within a few hours i had every reason to pronounce the most execrable
covering in existence and what made it still more intolerable i never
complained of it that tibbikens did not assure me it was the imperial
coronet of france and then exclaim in the words of some old play
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

and then i was physicked and starved phlebotomized soused in cold
water and scalded in hot rubbed down with rough blanket cloths and
hair-brushes as stiff as wool-cards scorched with mustard plasters
bombarded by an electrical machine and in general attacked by every
weapon of art which the zeal of my tormentors could bring into play
against me

in this way if i was not cured of my disease i was at least brought
into subjection i ceased complaining which i did at first and with
becoming indignation of the traitorous and sacrilegious violence done
to my anointed body for such i at first considered it the arguments
of my persecutors however to prove the contrary were irresistible
being chiefly syllogisms of which the major proposition was calomel
and jalap the minor mustard plasters and blisters and the conclusion
cold water phlebotomy and flax-seed tea the same arguments varied
categorically according to circumstances convinced me that if my
imperial elevation or the notion thereof was not sheer insanity on my
own part my doctors thought so which was the same thing in effect
and i therefore took good care when bewailing my hard fate not to
charge it as i at first did to the democratic wrath and jealousy of
my tormentors




 chapter vii


in which sheppard lee is convinced that all is not gold which glistens


this conversion of mine to their own opinion or if the reader
will so have it my return to rationality had a favourable effect
on my doctors they removed very circumspectly indeed the strait
jacket from my arms and then seeing i made no attempt to tear them
to pieces but was on the contrary very quiet and submissive and
that instead of claiming to be charlemagne the second of france i
was content to be mr arthur megrim of virginia they were so well
satisfied of the cure they had effected that they agreed to free me of
their company and so left me in the sole charge of tibbikens and my
affectionate sister

in this manner i was cured of hypochondriasis for although i felt
ever and anon a strong propensity to confess myself a joint-stool
a greek demigod or some such other fanciful creature i retained so
lively a recollection of the penalties i had already paid for indulging
in such vagaries that i put a curb on my imagination and resolved
for the future to be nothing but plain mr megrim a gentleman with a
disordered digestive apparatus

i was cured of my hypochondriasis i may say also of my
dyspepsy being kept by tibbikens and my sister in such a starved
condition that it was impossible i should ever more complain of
indigestion but i was not yet cured of my melancholy nothing but
canvass-backs and terapins could cure that and these alas were never
more to bless my lips tibbikens had pronounced their fate and with
them mine thenceforth and for ever my diet was to be looked for in
those next to my digestive apparatus chief favourites of my sister
bran bread and hickory ashes my stomach he solemnly assured me would
never be able to sustain any thing else

i say therefore i was melancholy and great reason had i to be so
condemned to live a life of ascetic denial with the means in my hand
to purchase all the luxuries in the world and which was worse an
eternal desire to enjoy them

to banish this melancholy alas never to be banished and perhaps to
give me a little appetite for my bran bread and ashes for which i
never could contract a relish the friendly tibbikens again seduced me
into the open air and my carriage and carried me about to different
places in which he thought i might find amusement in this way he had
conducted my prototype the true arthur megrim before me whenever
indolence and the luxuries of the table brought him too near to
dyspepsy and it was this uncommon kindness of the physician in
dragging the unfortunate gentleman to witness the galvanic experiments
on the bodies of the executed felons which had helped him so suddenly
out of his own dr tibbikens was not indeed very choice whither he
carried me lugging me along with equal alacrity to a horse-race a
barbacue or to the bedsides of his patients

all his efforts however were vain the memory of what i had suffered
with the anticipation of what i was yet to endure with doubtless
the addition of the ills for the time being preyed upon my spirit
i followed him mechanically and in a sort of torpor incapable of
enjoying myself incapable almost of noting what passed before me
i was tired of the life of the young and affluent mr megrim and i
should have been glad to exchange his body for some one's else but
unluckily my mind was so weighed down with indolence melancholy and
stupefaction that i really did not think of so natural a means of
ending my troubles

in this condition greatly to the concern of my friendly physician
i remained until towards the end of march when an incident happened
which gave an impulse to my spirit greater than it had ever before
experienced




 chapter viii


in which the author stumbles upon an old acquaintance


the doctor being accustomed to lead or drive me whithersoever he would
and i half the time following without question i found myself led
one day to a house in the town where was a remarkable exhibition or
show as our people called it which had for two days kept the whole
village in an uproar so great however was the abstraction and
indifference of my mind to all objects ordinary and extraordinary
alike that i had paid not the least attention to the accounts of the
matter which my sister and other persons and especially the faithful
epaminondas had during these two days poured into my ears hence
when i entered the exhibition-room i was ignorant of its nature and
indeed indifferent as to making myself better acquainted with it

tibbikens however appeared to be unusually delighted and saying
now megrim my lad you shall see a wonderful proof of the strides
that science is making led me through a crowd of the villagers
old and young and male and female who were present up to a large
table where truly enough in glass cases placed upon the same was a
spectacle quite remarkable though i must confess it did not make so
strong an impression upon me as tibbikens expected

it consisted of an infinite variety of fragments from the bodies of
animals and human beings imitations as i supposed at first in wax
or some other suitable substance and done to the life but tibbikens
assured me they were real specimens taken from animal bodies and
converted by scientific processes known only to the exhibiter into
the substances we now saw some being stony and harder than flint some
again only a little indurated while others retained their natural
softness elasticity and other peculiarities of texture there were
a dozen or more human feet as many hands three heads one of which
was a woman's with long hair and another a child's a calf's head
a dog's leg the ear of a pig the nose of a horse an ox's liver and
heart a rat a snake and a catfish and dozens of other things that i
cannot now remember all of which were surprisingly natural to behold
especially the head of the woman with the long hair which looked as
if it had just been cut off or rather not cut off at all for there
was no appearance of death about it whatever the lips and cheeks being
quite ruddy and the eyes open and bright though fixed

so much for science said tibbikens look at that boy's head it
don't look so well as the others but who would believe it was solid
stone sir it is stone and silicious stone too for last night i
did myself knock fire out of its nose with the back of my knife and
that's the cause of the nick there on the nostril well now there's
the man's head its texture is ligneous or to speak more strictly
imperfectly carbonaceous though the doctor calls it calcareous but
the wonder of all is the woman's head look at that that sir is
neither silicious nor carbonaceous but fleshy i say sir fleshy
it remains in its natural condition the skin is soft and resilient
you see the naturalness of the colour of the lips and above all
of the eyes and yet sir that head that flesh is indestructible
unless indeed by fire and strong acids or alkalis it is embalmed
sir embalmed according to the new process of this doctor with the
unpronounceable dutch name and i can tell you sir that the man
is a chymist such as was never heard of before davy lavoisier
berzelius sir i presume to say they are fools to him and will be
as soon forgotten as their stupid uncivilized system how little
they knew of the true science of chymistry they stopped short at the
elements our doctor here converts one element into another

tibbikens spoke with an air of consequence and some little oratorical
emphasis for he was surrounded by spectators who listened to what
he said with reverence as for me the little interest excited in my
bosom by the novelty of the exhibition had begun to wear away and i
was sinking again into apathy the faster perhaps for the doctor's
conversation of which i had a sufficiency every day and i suppose i
should in a few moments have lost all consciousness of what was going
on around me when suddenly a buzz began and a murmuring of voices
saying here comes the doctor now we shall have the grand show
at the same moment a grinding organ began its lugubrious grunting
and squeaking and the master of the exhibition stalking up to the
table and making his patrons a sweeping semicircular bow cried in a
rumbling bass voice and in accents strongly foreigh 

zhentlemens and leddees i peg you will excuse me for keep you
waiting vat you see here zhentlemens and leddees is very
strange pieces of de poddies human and animal shanged py a process
of philosophie very astonish misty and unknown to de multitude some
hard shtone some shtone not so hard and some not shtone at all but i
shall show you de representation vich is de triumph of art de vonder
of science de excellence of philosophie for zhentlemens and leddees
i am no mountepank and showmans put a man of de science a friend of
de species human and a zhentleman of de medical profession and vat i
make dese tings for is not for show nor for pastime nor for de money
but for de utilitie of de vorld

surely thought i to myself i have heard that voice before

i looked into the man's face as soon as the spectators had cleared away
a little for i was too indifferent to put myself to any trouble and
i said to myself nay i said aloud to tibbikens surely i have seen
that man before

where said tibbikens

in jersey i replied hastily for i could not forget the tall
frame the hollow jaws the solemn eyes and the ever-grinning mouth
of feuerteufel the german doctor who had made himself so famous in
my native village and who was one of the last persons i remembered to
have seen upon that day when i bade farewell to my original body

come said tibbikens looking alarmed at my last words you don't
pretend to say you were ever out of virginia in your whole life

augh oh said i recollecting myself i wonder what i was talking
about what augh what is the man's name

feuerteufel said tibbikens




 chapter ix


containing an account of the wonderful discoveries of the german doctor


i was not then mistaken it was feuerteufel himself only he had
learned a little more english this was the first and only one of my
original acquaintances whom i had laid eyes on since my departure from
new-jersey nearly two years before i felt some interest therefore
in the man but it was accompanied with a feeling of dislike and even
apprehension the truth is i never liked the german doctor though
why i never could tell but what was he doing what could be his
object going about the country with petrified legs arms and heads
i had scarce asked myself the question before it was answered by the
gentleman himself who had been speaking though i know not what all
the time i was talking with tibbikens and while i was cogitating
afterward

he had worked himself into a fit of eloquence warming with enthusiasm
as he dwelt upon the grandeur and usefulness of his discovery he made
antic gestures with hands head and shoulders he rolled and snapped
his eyes in the most extraordinary manner in the world and as for his
mouth there is no describing the grimaces and contortions which it
made over every particularly bright idea or felicitous word

zhentlemens said he i have discover de great art to preserve de
human poddie i can make him shtone i can make him plaster-paree i

 chapter x


containing a more wonderful discovery on the part of sheppard lee with
perhaps the most surprising adventure that ever befell him


having thus completed his lecture or oration of which i must confess
i had begun to grow tired the german doctor suddenly stepped to a
great round box like a watchman's box that stood at the further end
of the room and unlocking the folding leaves of which it was composed
swung them round with a jerk exhibiting an inner case evidently
of glass but entirely covered over with a thick curtain this he
proceeded to remove by tugging at a string which hoisted it to the
ceiling and as it ascended there was disclosed to the eyes of the
wondering spectators a human figure within the case clad loosely in a
sort of roman garment and for all the world looking entirely like a
living being except that the eyes were fixed in a set unnatural stare
and the attitude was a little stiff and awkward

a murmur with twenty or more faint shrieks from the females present
attested the admiration with which the spectators caught sight of this
wonderful triumph of skill and science but i heavens and earth
what were my feelings what was my astonishment when i beheld in
that lifeless mummy my own lost body the mortal tenement in which i
had first drawn the breath and experienced the woes of life the
body of sheppard lee the jerseyman this then was its fate not to
be anatomized and degraded into a skeleton as the vile samuel the
kidnapper had told me but converted into a mummy by a new process for
the especial benefit of science and the world and dr feuerteufel
the man for whom i had always cherished an instinctive dislike and
horror was the worthy personage who had stolen it what time i had
myself interrupted his designs upon the body of the farmer's boy in
the old graveyard near the owl-roost i looked upon my face that is
the face of the mummy and a thousand recollections of my original home
and condition burst upon my mind the tears started into my eyes with
them what had i gained by forsaking the lot to which providence had
assigned me in a moment the woes of higginson of dawkins skinner
longstraw tom the slave and megrim the dyspeptic rushed over my
memory contrasted with those lesser ones of sheppard lee which i had
so falsely considered as rendering me the most miserable man in the
world

what other notions may have crowded my brain what feeling may have
entered my bosom i am now unable to describe the sight of my body
thus restored to me and in the midst of my sorrow and affliction
inviting me as it were back to my proper home threw me into an
indescribable ferment i stretched out my arms i uttered a cry and
then rushing forward to the astonishment of all present i struck my
foot against the glass case with a fury that shivered it to atoms or
at least the portion of it serving as a door which being dislodged
by the violence of the blow fell upon the floor and was dashed to
pieces the next instant disregarding the cries of surprise and fear
which the act occasioned i seized upon the cold and rigid hand of the
mummy murmuring let me live again in my own body and never no
never more in another's

happiness of happiness although while i uttered the words a boding
fear was on my mind lest the long period the body had lain inanimate
and more especially the mummifying process to which it had been
subjected might have rendered it unfit for further habitation i had
scarce breathed the wish before i found myself in that very body
descending from the box which had so long been its prison and stepping
over the mortal frame of mr arthur megrim now lying dead on the floor

indescribable was the terror produced among the spectators by this
double catastrophe the death of their townsman and the revival of the
mummy the women fell down in fits and the men took to their heels
and a little boy who was frightened into a paroxysm of devotion
dropped on his knees and began fervently to exclaim

 now i lay me down to sleep
 i pray the lord my soul to keep

in short the agitation was truly inexpressible and fear distracted
all but on no countenance was this passion mingled with a due degree
of amazement more strikingly depicted than on that of the german
doctor who thus compelled to witness the object of a thousand cares
the greatest and most perfect result of his wonderful discovery
slipping off its pedestal and out of his hands as by a stroke of
enchantment stared upon me with eyes nose and mouth speechless
rooted to the floor and apparently converted into a mummy himself as
i stepped past him however hurrying to the door with a vague idea
that the sooner i reached it the better his lips were unlocked and
his feelings found vent in a horrible exclamation der tyfel which
i believe means the devil der tyfel i have empalm him too well

then making a dart at me he cried in tones of distraction stop my
mummy mine gott which has cost me so much expense stop my mummy

i saw that he designed seizing me and being myself as much overcome
with fear as the others i made a bolt for the door knocking down my
friend tibbikens and half a dozen other retreating spectators as i left
it darted into the air and in a moment was flying out of the village
on the wings of the wind

i had a double cause for terror for first before i had got twenty
steps from the exhibition-room for my roman garments were in the way
of my legs and i did not run so fast as i managed to do afterward
i heard certain furious voices cry from the room it is all a cheat
the mummy was a living man let us lynch him and the doctor and
secondly i could also hear close at my heels the voice of the doctor
himself who had escaped close behind me eagerly vociferating stop
my mummy and i will pay twenty dollare stop my mummy by both which
noises it was made apparent that i was in danger of being lynched or
subjected to a second process of mummification

nerved therefore by my fears i gathered the skirts of my toga about my
arms and fled with all my might blessing my stars that i had at last
recovered that mortal tenement which with all its troubles i was now
convinced was the best for my purposes in the whole world

 chapter i


sheppard lee flies from the german doctor and finds himself again in
new-jersey


the faster i fled the faster it seemed to me i was followed by the
german doctor who i have always believed was driven crazy by the
sudden loss of his beloved mummy and who i had therefore the greatest
reason to fear would if he succeeded in retaking me be content with
nothing short of clapping me again into his glass case were it even
a needful preliminary as in truth it must have been to kill and
embalm me over again and indeed i think the reader will allow that
the fact of his following me three days and three nights still calling
me a mummy charging everybody he met to stop me and persisting to
claim me as his property even after i had got among my own friends
was a proof not only of insanity but of a desperate determination to
rob me of life and liberty

of this determination on his part i was myself so strongly persuaded
and in consequence so overcome by terror that i am inclined to think
i was for a time nearly as mad as himself and i fled from before him
with a speed which the reader can only conceive when i tell him that
i ran from the scene of my transformation on the banks of the potomac
to my native village in new-jersey a distance which i estimate at full
one hundred and eighty miles in the short space of three days and
three nights during which period i rested but once and that on the
second night when being very faint and weary i lay down on the earth
and slept two hours

this may be justly esteemed a truly wonderful exploit and it exceeds
that of the great daniel boone of kentucky of whom it is related that
he ran before a band of wild indians the same distance or thereabouts
in four days time but it must be remembered that i was fleeing from
a raging madman whose speed was so nearly equal to my own that if i
chanced but to flag a little in my exertions at any time i was sure to
see him make his appearance on the rear or to hear his voice screaming
on the winds to stop his mummy indeed i ran with such haste that
i took no note of the road upon which i travelled and to this day i
am ignorant how i succeeded in passing the three great rivers the
potomac the chesapeake and the delaware which lay in my route and
which i must have crossed in some way or other and for the same
reason i am ignorant in what manner i sustained existence during those
three days having not the slightest recollection of eating a single
meal on the whole journey

all that i can remember of the journey is that i ran i knew not
whither but with an instinctive turning of my face towards the north
that i was closely followed by the german doctor and that about
sundown on the third day i found myself to my unspeakable joy
rushing through the owl-roost swamp across the meadow and by that
identical beech-tree where i had first lost my body in full view of
my own house the sight of that once happy home of my childhood filled
me with rapture i rushed towards it hailed by a shout from old jim
jumble my negro-man backed by another from his wife dinah that might
have waked the dead they were so loud and uproarious and found myself
in the arms of my dear but long-neglected sister prudence who with
her husband alderwood and her three young children was standing on
the porch

then being wholly overcome by exhaustion of body and mind and having
endured such fatigues and sufferings from hunger and thirst without
speaking of terror as have seldom oppressed a poor feeble human
being i fell into a swoon from which i awoke only to be assailed by
a violent fever and delirium the direct consequences of my superhuman
exertions that kept me a-bed in a condition between life and death
for more than two weeks

during all this period i recollect being tormented by the hateful
visage of the german doctor who having followed me like a bloodhound
daily forced himself into my chamber claimed me as his property and
would doubtless have carried me off had it not been for my sister my
brother-in-law and the faithful jim jumble the first of whom watched
at my bedside like an angel while the two others opposed themselves
to the enemy and drove him from the room his persecutions indeed
affected me to a degree i cannot express and were the cause that at
the end of the two weeks as above mentioned i suddenly fell into a
lethargy or trance the crisis of my disease in which i lay two days
and then awoke in my full senses free from fever and convalescent

how great was my satisfaction then to behold myself surrounded by my
friends and in my own house how much greater to know i was no longer
to be persecuted by the odious german doctor who my brother-in-law
gave me to understand in reply to my anxious questions had not only
given over all designs on my person but had actually departed from the
neighbourhood and from the state of new-jersey satisfied doubtless
that i was a living man and no longer a mummy




 chapter ii


what had happened at watermelon hill during the author's absence


this intelligence was balm to my spirit and medicine to my body and
the consequence was that i recovered so rapidly as to be able to leave
my bed in less than a week and receive the visits and congratulations
of many old friends who seemed really glad of my return and recovery
though i have no doubt they were moved as much by curiosity to learn
where i had been and what adventures had befallen me during the long
period of my exile in which however i did not think it advisable to
gratify them

and now it was that i discovered that many changes personally
interesting to myself had happened during my absence when i first
got upon my porch and looked about me i almost doubted whether i
was really on the forty-acre my house had been carefully reparied
both within and without a new and substantial stable with other
outbuildings had been erected new fences had been put up around my
fields and orchards cattle were lowing on my meadows and horses
whinnying in the stable to be let loose with them upon the early
grass in a word the forty-acre now looked more prosperous and
flourishing than it had ever before looked mean and empoverished it
looked almost as well as it had done in the days of my father

how was all this change brought about i demanded of my
brother-in-law who with my sister had accompanied or indeed
rather led me to the porch

by the magic of money industry and a little common sense said
alderwood who although a plain and bluff man was a sensible one and
a most excellent farmer you must know my dear sheppard said he
that when we found you were so far gone 

how said i in surprise how did you know i had gone far i thought
the general opinion was that i was murdered

oh yes said my sister nodding at her husband it was just as you
say

with that alderwood smiled and nodded back again saying

prue is right when we discovered your condition that is when we
found you had been murdered as you say and that there was no one to
look to the poor forty-acre except the sheriff and the mortgagee it
was agreed between your sister and myself that i should take the matter
in hand for we were loath the property should go into the possession
of strangers besides prudence insisted upon being near you 

that is said prudence near to where we supposed the murderers must
have concealed your body

exactly so said alderwood for this reason i left my own farm
in the hands of my young brother robert came down hither bag and
baggage applied a little of my loose cash for i believe i have been
somewhat more prosperous than you to stopping the mouth of your
mortgagee building fences banking meadows spreading marl and so on
and the consequence is that we are getting the forty-acre into good
condition again so that in a few years it will pay the debts and
perhaps begin to make the fortune of its owner

i grasped my brother-in-law's hand i was moved by his kindness and
remembering how after quarrelling with him as related in the first
book of this history i had refused a reconciliation and rejected his
offers of assistance his friendship and generosity appeared still more
worthy of my gratitude

poh said he interrupting my thanks and professions of regard but
looking well pleased that i should be disposed to make them i was
persuaded you would come to some day that is i mean come back

that is said prudence we always had a notion you were not really
dead and that we should see you again some time alive and happy

i trust said i you will long see me so for i am now a changed
i hope a wiser man disposed to make the best of the lot to which
heaven has assigned me and to sigh no longer with envy at the supposed
superior advantages of others i think brother alderwood i shall
now be contented with my condition humble and even toilsome as it
may be i have seen enough of the miseries of my fellows those even
whom i most envied during the two years of my absence to teach me
that every man has his share of them that there is nothing peculiarly
wretched in my own lot and that i can be happy or not just as i
may choose to make myself for this reason i shall now bid adieu to
indolence and discontent the vile mother and viler daughter together
and do as my father did before me that is cultivate these few acres
which my folly has left me with my own hands nor will i rest from my
labours until i have discharged every claim against it your own my
dear alderwood first of all though i am sensible i can never repay
the debt of kindness i owe you and this is really your intention
demanded alderwood looking prodigiously gratified your possessions
are now limited indeed yet you have enough with a little industry
and care to render you independent for life and if you will really
apply yourself to the farm 

i will said i if labour and perseverance can do it i will attain
the independence you speak of i will remove every encumbrance on the
forty-acre and then trust to pass such a life as modest wishes and a
contented temper can secure me

you may begin to pass it immediately then said alderwood for the
forty-acre is already clear of every encumbrance yes he continued
seeing me look surprised i tell you nothing but the truth aikin
jones your old friend and overseer 

he is a villain said i and he defrauded me

so it is pretty commonly supposed but as we have no legal proof
of his dishonesty the less we say of it the better he has gone to
settle his accounts at a tribunal where craft and policy can avail him
nothing he died eight months ago and they say who know best in great
agony and fear of spirit now whether he was moved by old feelings of
friendship or was struck with remorse at seeing the condition to which
he had reduced you 

what condition said i

oh said my sister the ruin of your affairs nothing more and
alderwood nodded his head by way of assent to the explanation

in short said he mr aikin jones whatever may have been his
motive thought fit to bequeath you a legacy 

what said i how could he leave a legacy to a man universally
considered dead

oh said my sister he never would believe that there were a good
many people had their doubts on that subject

yes said alderwood and mr aikin jones was one of them and so
finding himself dying and being seized perhaps with compunction for
the wrongs he had done you he left you a legacy no great matter
indeed considering how much of your estate he died possessed of it
sufficed however to pay off your mortgage principal and interest
and to improve and stock the forty-acre just as you now see it so you
see my dear sheppard you are not so badly off as you supposed your
farm is small yet your father drew from it a fortune and i believe a
good farmer might do the same thing a second time but you are not very
learned in agricultural matters i will remain with you a while at
least until your health is re-established and be your teacher when
you find yourself competent to the management of the farm i will bid
you farewell assured that you will lead a happier life than you ever
knew before

this intelligence with regard to my little homestead was highly
agreeable to me nor was i less pleased with my brother-in-law's
resolution to remain with me for a time while i acquired a knowledge
of agriculture and confirmed myself in new habits of industrious and
active application




 chapter iii


containing the substance of a singular debate betwixt the author and
his brother with a philosophic defence of the author's credibility


and now having arrived at the close of my adventurous career i have
but a few additions to make to my story before concluding it entirely

i took an early opportunity to impart to my brother-in-law a faithful
account of my adventures as well as a resolution which i had already
formed to commit them to writing and publish them for the benefit of
the world for i was persuaded they contained a moral which might prove
of service to many persons who like myself had fallen into the error
of supposing they were assigned to a harsher lot than their fellows

this resolution alderwood opposed with all his might being concerned
lest such an enterprise as writing a book should divert my mind from
the labours of the farm and indeed seduce me again into habits of
idleness besides he was afraid the strangeness of my adventures
would cause them to be received with incredulity whereby i might
suffer in reputation and be looked upon only as a dreamer and teller
of falsehoods his chief reasons however i doubt not were the two
first mentioned for he was anxious i should now think of nothing but
my farm his dislike to my design was in truth so great that having
exhausted all the arguments he could muster in the vain design to
overcome it he had resort to a new mode of opposition an expedient
highly ingenious but not a little ridiculous he endeavoured to
shake my own faith in my story to convince me that i had imagined
all i have related and that in a word i had never encountered any
adventures at all i protest i am diverted to this day when i think of
the mingled anxiety and address which he displayed on the occasion he
assured me and that quite plumply that during the whole two years
to speak strictly it was only twenty months of my wanderings i had
never once been off the forty-acre farm that i had never been in any
body besides my own and that the whole source of the notion on my
part lay in a hallucination of mind which had suddenly attacked me
filling me with ridiculous conceits of various transformations such
as never had happened and never could happen to any human being
and this absurd account he persisted in as long as he could with any
decency giving me repeated hints that my mother had died insane
and that it was not therefore strange i should have been a little
odd once in my life i showed him the place where i had been digging
under the beech-tree where by-the-way i was weak enough afterward
to make jim jumble sink a pit twelve feet deep to satisfy myself that
captain kid's money really did not lie there which place however
he averred was as great a proof of the truth of his story as of mine
for said he none but a madman would dig for captain kid's money
i led him to the willow-bushes and the old worm fence in the marsh
where i had found squire higginson's body which he allowed i might
have done but protested that other persons had found it also and that
instead of going home alive in squire higginson's barouche it had
been carried to philadelphia in a coffin and as for higginson's being
clapped into prison for my murder it was i he said who had been
confined on suspicion of having been concerned in his until as he
said it was found that i was out of my wits and that higginson had
died of an apoplexy

i then referred to a circumstance that had happened during my late
sickness as affording the fullest confirmation of my story the
circumstance was this while still lying tormented with fever but at
a moment when my mind was sound and lucid jim jumble put a newspaper
into my hand in which by a singular coincidence appeared an account
of my late transformation in virginia with an allusion to the fate
of zachariah longstraw by which i learned for the first time what
had become of his body after i left it from the article which
strangely and yet naturally enough was headed outrageous humbug
and fatal consequence thereof it seemed to be universally believed
that dr feuerteufel's mummy was no mummy at all but a living man as
i myself had heard it called in the village with whom he had leagued
in a conspiracy to hoax and swindle the good people of the south out
of their money and that the imposture had been detected by mr arthur
megrim who proceeding to force the glass box was knocked down by
the pretended dead man and so unfortunately killed the mummy and
his accomplice the doctor making their escape in the confusion the
editor of the paper after noticing a second account by which it
was asserted that the unfortunate megrim though overturned by the
pretended mummy in his flight had received no injury from him but on
the contrary had died of sheer fright and horror being of a nervous
hypochondriacal turn and acknowledging that this account was more
probable inveighed warmly against the villany and audacity of the
swindlers who he said were more legitimate objects on whom to wreak
the vengeance of lynchdom than the people of that district had found in
zachariah longstraw the philanthropist and here the editor reminded
his readers of the fate of that excellent and distinguished individual
who had died in the lynchers hands the preceding autumn against the
ringleaders of whom his nephew mr jonathan truelove had so vainly
attempted to establish legal proceedings

to this account i say i referred as containing an argument of my
truth not to be resisted but unfortunately the paper had by some
means or other vanished and alderwood said my story went for nothing
without it that paper i have always thought he had himself got
possession of and secreted but had i even retained and shown it to
him i doubt whether it would have affected him in the least for he
was one of those skeptical men who believed a thing none the sooner for
finding it in a newspaper

in a word there is no expressing the obstinacy of my brother in
rejecting my story nor the adroitness with which he met such proofs
as i could give him of the truth of it the last instance of it
which i shall relate was his taking the part of the german doctor
feuerteufel who he declared had not only never made a mummy of me
but had not laid claim to me as his property though he himself that
is my brother-in-law had been present at least a dozen times when
the german doctor did so in my sick-chamber from which alderwood was
so instrumental in expelling him he even insisted that this man
having made a second and last visit to our village to hunt plants and
reptiles had been employed and at his own instance too to cure me
of that very malady he so ridiculously would have me believe i had
been afflicted with and that it was to him under heaven i owed my
restoration to health nay he even went the length of showing me what
he called the doctor's bill and true enough it was a bill with a
receipt in full upon it but the amount being prodigiously great i saw
at once into the whole affair which was nothing less than a masked
contract betwixt my brother-in-law and the doctor whereby the latter
secretly covenanted in consideration of the large sum received from
the former to persecute me no longer with his claims and perhaps to
leave the country altogether

besides all this my brother attacked me by demanding by what means
it was that i had transferred my spirit so often and so easily from
one body to another and this being a question on which the reader
may require satisfaction as well as my brother i must allow that it
presents a difficulty and a very great one all that i can say to
this is first that i did transfer my spirit from body to body
and no less than seven different times secondly that these seven
translations of spirit indicated in me the possession of a peculiar
power to make them and thirdly that the existence of such a peculiar
power however wonderful it may appear is not beyond the bounds of
philosophic probability

no man can be so ignorant or skeptical as to deny that there are
several different faculties of a most marvellous nature with which a
few individuals in the world are mysteriously endowed while the great
mass of men are entirely without them and to the number of these
supernatural endowments there is scarce a year passes by without adding
a new one what can be or ought to be considered a more surprising
faculty than that of ventriloquism the art of throwing the voice
into places and things afar from the operator of taking as it were
the lungs glottis c from his body and clapping them into a chest
log stone wall or other inanimate substance or into the body of
another and how few are there in the world who possess the power of
doing so one man thumps his chin with his fingers and draws from it
pure and agreeable musical tones and another whistles a melody in
parts while men in general might thump and whistle till their teeth
fell out without producing any music worth listening to what can be
more wonderful than the faculty recently developed by the advocates and
practitioners of a new system of medicine who by shaking a bottle in
a peculiar way give to its contents a medical virtue which did not
exist before and which another man the patient for example might
shake till doomsday without imparting

the natural bonesetter is one instance of the possession of a faculty
both rare and astonishing and so is any old woman who can pow-wow the
fire out of a burn not to multiply inferior instances however i will
ask the reader if any faculty can be deemed more incredible than that
of the magnetizer who by flourishing his digits about your body
now cures your rheumatism and now sets you sound asleep unless it
be that of the magnetized slumberer who reads a sealed letter laid
on his epigastrium sees through millstones and men's bodies and
renders oraculous responses to any question that may be proposed him
even though it be upon subjects of which while awake he is entirely
ignorant

in fine granting all these things to be true and who shall dare to
doubt them why should it not be granted that an individual should
possess the power of transferring his spirit from body to body at
will a power but little more extraordinary if indeed it be more
extraordinary than the other faculties which are admitted to have
actual existence

to me it seems that the thing is natural enough though still i
grant extremely wonderful many persons are thought to possess the
ventriloquial and even the magnetic power without being conscious of
the endowment accident having been in all cases the cause of their
being made acquainted with its existence in the same way it is not
improbable that other persons besides myself may possess the faculty
of reanimating dead bodies without suspecting it for i can scarce
believe the faculty should be confined entirely to myself




 chapter iv


being the last chapter of all


i never could succeed in convincing my brother-in-law of the truth of
my relation or rather for i have always thought his incredulity
was assumed for the purpose mentioned i never could overcome his
opposition to the design i formed of writing and committing it to the
press for this reason i ceased talking of it more and even affected
to believe the foolish story he had told me of my having conceived
my adventures in a mere fit of delirium this i did not so much out
of compliment to him as from a desire to have him believe i would
let nothing divert me from the business of my farm which indeed i
immediately addressed myself to in such good earnest as secured his
hearty approval and zealous congratulations

in secret however and in the intervals of toil i employed myself
recording my adventures while their impression was still strong on my
memory and now having happily brought them to a conclusion i commit
them to the world confident that if they surprise nobody else they
will cause some astonishment to my brother alderwood

it is now some time since i have been deprived of his and my sister's
company at watermelon hill they having retired to their own farm as
soon as my brother was well convinced i was capable of managing my own
affairs my only society now consists of honest jim jumble his wife
dinah and my sister's oldest son sheppard lee alderwood for he was
named after me a lad of fourteen years but uncommonly shrewd and
sensible for whom i have contracted a strong affection and to whom
if i should die unmarried as is quite probable i design bequeathing
my little patrimony

jim jumble is as independent and saucy as ever but i can bear with his
humours he is so faithful industrious and as i may add so happy
to see his master once more prospering in the world he and dinah are
singing all day long

my estate is small and it may be that it will never increase i am
however content with it and content is the secret of all enjoyment i
am not ashamed to labour in my fields on the contrary i have learned
to be grateful to providence that it ordained me to a lot of toil
wherein i find the truest source of health self-approbation and
happiness my only trouble is an occasional stiffness and sluggishness
of joints and muscles which jim jumble tells me is all owing to my
being naturally a lazy man but which i myself suppose was caused by
my remaining so long a mummy to counterbalance this evil however i
find in myself an astonishing hardiness of constitution particularly
in resisting quinsies catarrhs and defluxions on the breast to which
i was formerly very liable and this immunity i know not how to account
for unless by supposing that my body was hardened by the process of
mummifying and that it still continues to be water-proof

at all events be my body what it may hardy or frail stiff or supple
i am satisfied with it and shall never again seek to exchange it for
another

there can be little doubt that this otto de till
is the same person whose name appears as a witness
to several grants about the middle the
twelfth century and who was seneschal to the
earl conisborough it stood uninjured till
the great rebellion when the earl manchester's
army on their way from the south to the
siege york in the year chose to do the
vol n f
lord service by defacing it and the said
earl manchester's men endeavouring to pull
the whole shank down got a smith's forgehammer
and broke off the four corner crosses and
then fastened ropes to the middle cross which
was stronger and higher thinking by that to pull
the whole shank down but a stone breaking off
and falling upon one the men's legs which
was nearest it and breaking his leg they troubled
themselves no more about it this account
with a drawing the cross in its former state
was in fairfax's collection antiquities and
came afterwards into thereby's possession the
antiquarian society published an engraving 
it by that excellent and upright artist vertue 
whom it is recorded that he never would engrave
a fictitious portrait the pillar was composed 
five columns a large one in the middle and four
smaller ones around it answering pretty nearly
to the cardinal points each column was surmounted
by a cross that in the middle being the
highest and proportionally large there were
numeral figures on the south face near the top
which seem to have been intended for a dial the
circumference the pillar was eleven feet seven
the height eighteen feet
william paterson in the year his mayoralty
 beautified it with four dials ball and
fane in when henry heatonwas mayor
it was taken down because its decayed state
and a new one the same form was erected by
the road side a furlong to the south its former
site on hopcross hill this was better than
destroying the cross and as either renovation or
demolition had become necessary the corporation
are to be commended for what they did
but it is no longer the same cross nor on the
same site which had once been consecrated and
where many a passing prayer had been breathed
in simplicity and sincerity heart
what signifies the change both place and
monument had long been desecrated as little
religious feeling was excited by it as would have
been by the altar to the dee metres if it had
stood there and the hundreds travellers
who daily pass it in or outside stage coaches
in their own carriages on horseback or on foot
and the thousands who flock thither during
the races and the inhabitants doncaster
itself not a single soul cares whether it be the
original cross or not nor where it was originally
erected nor when nor wherefore nor by whom 
i wish i did not said dr dove when someone
advanced this consideration with the intent
 reconciling him to the change i am an old
man said he and in age we dislike all change
as naturally and therefore no doubt as fitly as
in youth we desire it the youthful generation
in their ardour for improvement and their love
 novelty strive to demolish what ought religiously
to be preserved the elders in their caution
and their fear endeavour to uphold what has
become useless and even injurious thus in the
order providence we have both the necessary
impulse and the needful check
but i miss the old cross from its old place
more than fifty years had i known it there and
if fifty years acquaintance did not give us some
regard even for stocks and stones we must be
stocks and stones ourselves

nothing more than the scanty notices which
have already been mentioned is recorded concerning
the history doncaster till king john
ordered it to be enclosed with headstone and
pale according as the ditch required and that
a light breast or barbican should be made upon
the bridge to defend the town if need should be
the bridge was then wood in the following
reign the townsmen gave aid to make a stone
bridge there in that reign a hospital for sick
and leprous people was built there the priories
 st james and st nicholas founded a dominican
convent and a franciscan one henry iii
slept there on his way to york in the d
year edward i the borough was first summoned
to send members to parliament from
which burthen as it was then considered it was
relieved in the ensuing year
in thomas earl lancaster held a
council here with other discontented barons
against edward ii in its results it brought
many them to an untimely death and lancaster
himself suffered by the axe at pomfret as
much in revenge for gaston as for this rebellion
 in this sort says an old chronicler
came the mighty earl lancaster to his 
being the greatest peer in this realm and one 
the mightiest earls in christendom for when he
began to levy war against the king he was possessed
 five earldoms lancaster lincoln salisbury
leicester and derby beside ether seigniories
lands and possessions great to his advancement
in honor and puissance but all this was limited
within prescription time which being expired

but now touching aforesaid earl lancaster
great strife rose afterwards amongst the people
whether he ought to be reputed for a saint or
no some held that he ought to be no less esteemed
for that he did many almsdeeds in his
lifetime honored men religion and maintained
a true quarrel till his life's also his enemies
continued not long after but came to evil ends
others conceived another opinion him alledging
that he favoured not his wife but lived in
spousebreach defiling a great number damsels
and gentlewomen if any offended him he
slew him shortly after in his wrathful mood
apostates and other evil doers he maintained
and would not suffer them to be punished by due
order law all his doings he used to commit
to one his secretaries and took no heed himself
thereof and as for the manner his death
he fled shamefully in the fight and was taken
and put to death against his will yet by reason
 certain miracles which were said to be done
near the place both where he suffered and where
he was buried caused many to think he was a
saint howbeit at length by the king's commandment
the church doors the priory where
he was buried were shut and closed so that no
man might be suffered to come to the tomb to
bring any offerings or to do any other kind 
devotion to the same also the hill where he
suffered was kept by certain gascoigners appointed
by the lord hugh spenser his son then
lying at pomfret to the that no people
should come and make their prayers there in
worship the said earl whom they took verily
for a martyr
the next confederacy at doncaster was more
successful though it led eventually to bloodier
consequences bolingbroke after landing at
ravensburg was met here by northumberland
hotspur westmorland and others who engaged
with him there some them probably not
knowing how far his ambitious views extended
and who afterwards became the victims their
own turbulent policy the dragon's teeth which
were then sown produced a plentiful harvest
threescore years afterwards when more than six
and thirty thousand englishmen fell by each
others hands at towton between this town and
york edward iv beheaded sir robert willis
and sir ralph grey here whom he had taken
in the rout losecoat field and when he mustered
his people here to march against warwick
and clarence whose intentions began then to be
discovered it was said that never was seen in
england so many goodly men and so well arranged
in a field afterwards he past through
doncaster when he returned from exile on the
way to his crowning victory at barnet
richard iii also past through this place on
the way to york where he was crowned in
henry viii's reign it became the actual seat 
war and a battle would have been fought there
if the don had not by its sudden rising twice
prevented aske and his army insurgents from
attacking the duke norfolk with so superior
l force that success would have been almost certain
and the triumph the popish party a probable
result here norfolk profiting by that
delay treated with the insurgents and finally by
offering them a free pardon and engaging that
a free parliament should be held in the north
induced them to disperse
in john grigge the mayor lost a thumb
in an affray at margate and next year the
prior doncaster was hanged for treason in
 the town was visited by the plague in
that persons died here
the next noticeable circumstance in the annals
 doncaster is that james i lodged there at
the sign the sun and bear on his way from
scotland to take possession the crown england

the maypole in the market place was taken
down in and the market cross erected therein
its place but the removal the maypole
seems to have been no proof any improved
state morals in the town for barnabas the
illustrious potato saw there the most unbecoming
sight that he met with in all his travels on
his second visit the frail levite was dead and i
will not pick out a name from the succession 
vicars which might suit the time the poem
because though doncaster was the scene it does
not follow that the vicar was the actor and
whoever he may have been his name can be no
object legitimate curiosity though barnabas's
justly was till it was with so much ingenuity
determined by mr castlewood
when the army which had been raised against
the scots was disbanded charles i dined thereat
the house lady carlingford and a pear
tree which he is said to have planted is now
standing there in mr maw's garden charles
was there again in and attended service in
the church and from a house in the butter market
it was that morris with two companions
attempted to carry off the parliamentary commander
gainsborough at noonday and failing
in the attempt killed him upon the spot
a church library was founded here by the
contributions the clergy and gentry the surrounding
country in a chamber over the
church porch was appropriated for the books
with the archbishop's licence and there was
one curate this town whose love reading
was so great that he not only passed his days in
this library but had a bed fixed there and spent
his nights there also
in all the streets were new paved and
the sign posts taken down and in daniel

concerning the worthies or good men who
were natives doncaster or otherwise
connected with that town
vir bonus est quit 
terence
let good old fuller answer the wellknown
question which is conveyed in the motto to this
chapter and here he says be it remembered
that the same epithet in several places accepts
sundry interpretations he is called a
good man in common discourse who is not dignified
with gentility a good man upon the
exchange who hath a responsible estate a
good man in a camp who is a tall man his
arms a good man in the church who is pious
and devout in his conversation thus whatever
is fixed therein in other relations that person is
a good man in history whose character affords
such matter as may please the palate an ingenuous
reader
two other significations may be added which
fuller has not pretermitted because he could not
include them they being relatively to him posthumous
birth a good man upon state trials orin
certain committees which it might not be discreet
to designate is one who will give his verdict
without any regard to his oath in the first case or
to the evidence in both and in the language 
the pugilists it signifies one who can bear a great
deal beating hal pierce the game chicken
and unrivalled glory the ring pronounced this
eulogium upon mr gully the present honorable
member for pontefract when he was asked for a
candid opinion his professional merits sir
lie was the very best man as ever i had 
among the good men in fuller's acceptation
 the term who have been in any way connected
with doncaster the first in renown as well
as in point time is robin hood many men
ill
talk him who never shot in his bow but many
think him when they drink at his well which
is at skelbroke by the way side about six miles
from doncaster on the york road there is a
small inn near with robin hood for its sign 
this country has produced no other hero whose
popularity has endured so long the duke 
marlborough the duke cumberland and the
marquis granny have flourished upon signposts
and have faded there so have their compeers
prince eugene and prince ferdinand
rodney and nelson are fading and the time is
not far distant when wellington also will have
had his day but while england shall be england
robin hood will be a popular name
near robin hood's well and nearer to doncaster
the hermit ample resided at the
place from which he was so called where living
he was honored and dead was buried and
sainted richard role however for that was
his name was no otherwise sainted than by common
opinion in those parts he died in 
and is the oldest our known poets his
writings both in verse and prose which are 
considerable extent ought to be published at the
expense some national institution
in the next generation john marse who was
born in a neighbouring village that name
flourished in the carmelite convent at doncaster
and obtained great celebrity in his time for
writing against a far greater than himself
john wickliffe
it is believed that sir martin frobisher was
born at doncaster and that his father was mayor
 that place i note this the rather says
fuller because learned mr carpenter in his
geography recounts him among the famous men
 devonshire but why should devonshire
which hath a flock worthies her own take
a lamb from another country this brave seaman
when he left his property to a kinsman who
was very likely to dissipate it said it was gotten
at sea and would never thrive long at land
lord wordsworth having purchased the estate
at wellington four miles from doncaster formerly
the property sir edward stanhope resided
there occasionally in the old mansion during
the latter part his life his account denmark
is a which may always be read with
profit the danish ambassador complained 
it to king william and hinted that if one his
danish majesty's subjects had taken such liberties
with the king england his master would
upon complaint have taken off the author's head
that i cannot do replied william but if
you please i will tell him what you say and he
shall put it into the next edition his 
other remarkable persons who were connected
with doncaster and were contemporaries with
dr dove will be noticed in due time here i
shall only mention two who have distinguished
themselves since his days alas and since i took
my leave a place endeared to me by so many
recollections mr bingley well known for his
popular works upon natural history and mr
henry lister maw the adventurous naval officer
who was the first englishman that ever came
down the great river amazons are both natives
 this town i know not whether the doncaster
maws are hibernian descent but the name
 m'coghlan is in ireland beautified and abbreviated
into maw the m'coglan or head 
the family was called the maw and a district 
king's county was known within the memory 
persons now living by the appellation the
maws county

it was in the mayoralty thomas pheasant
as has already been said and in the year our
lord that daniel dove the younger
having then entered upon his seventeenth year
first entered the town doncaster and was there
delivered by his excellent father to the care 
peter hopkins they loved each other so dearly
that this which was the first day their separation
was to both the unhappiest their lives
the great frost commenced in the winter 
that year and with the many longing lingering
thoughts which daniel cast towards his home a
wish was mingled that he could see the frozen
waterfall in weathercock cave
it was a remarkable era in doncaster also because
the organ was that year erected at the
cost five hundred guineas raised by voluntary
subscription among the parishioners harris and
field were the builders and it is still esteemed
one the best in the kingdom when it was
opened the then curate mr fawkes preached
a sermon for the occasion in which after having
rhetoric in praise sacred music and touched
upon the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery
dulcimer and all kinds instruments he turned
to the organ and apostrophized it thus but
o what o what what shall i call thee by 
thou divine box sounds 
that right old worthy francis quarles 
quaint memory and the more to be remembered
for his quaintness knew how to improve an organ
somewhat better than m r fawkes his poem
upon one is the first in his divine fancies and
vol ii g
whether he would have it ranked among epigrams
meditations or observations perhaps
he could not himself tell the reader may
class it as he pleases
observe this organ mark but how it goes 
tis not the hand alone him that blows
the unseen bellows nor the hand that plays
upon the apparent notedividing keys
that makes these wellcomposed airs appear
before the high tribunal thine ear
they both concur each acts his several part 
the one gives it breath the other lends it art
man is this organ to whose every action
heaven gives a breath a breath without action
without which blast we cannot act at all 
without which breath the universe must fall
to the first nothing it was made seeing
in him we live we move we have our being
thus filled with his diviner breath and basket
with his first power we touch the keys and act 
he blows the bellows as we thrive in sail
our actions prove like music good or ill
the question whether instrumental music may
lawfully be introduced into the worship godin
the churches the new testament has been
considered by cotton rather and answered to
his own satisfaction and that his contemporary
countrymen and their fellow puritans in his historical
remarks upon the discipline practised in
the churches new england the instrumental
music used in the old church israel
he says was an institution god it was the
commandment the lord by the prophets and
the instruments are called god's instruments
and instruments the lord now there is not
one word institution in the new testament for
instrumental music in the worship god
and because the holy god rejects all he does not
command in his worship he now therefore in
effect says to us will not hear the melody 
thy organs but on the other hand the rule
given doth abundantly intimate that no voice is
now heard in the church but what is significant
and edifying by signification which the voice 
instruments is not
worse logic than this and weaker reasoning no
one would wish to meet with in the controversial
writings a writer from whose opinions he
differs most widely the remarks form part 
that extraordinary and highly interesting work
the magnolia cjiristi americana cotton rather
is such an author as fuller would have been
if the old english worthy instead having been
from a child trained up in the way he should
go had been calvinisticated till the milk human
kindness with which his heart was always ready
to overflow had turned sour
though instrumental music he proceeds
to say were admitted and appointed in the
worship god under the old testament yet
we do not find it practised in the synagogue 
the jews but only in the temple it thence
appears to have been a part the ceremonial
pedagogy which is now abolished nor can any
say it was a part moral worship and whereas
the common usage now hath confined instrumental
music to cathedrals it seems therein too
much to judaism which to do is a part the
antichristian apostacy as well as to paganism
if we admit instrumental music in the worship
 god how can we resist the imposition all
the instruments used among the ancient jews 
yea dancing as well as playing and several
other judaic actions 
during the short but active reign the puritans
in england they acted upon this preposterous
opinion and sold the church organs
without being scrupulous concerning the uses to
which they might be applied a writer that
age speaking the prevalence drunkenness
as a national vice says that nothing may be
wanting to the height luxury and impiety 
this abomination they have translated the organs
out the churches to set them up in taverns
chaunting their dithyrambic and bestial bacchanalian
to the tune those instruments which
were wont to assist them in the celebration 
god's praises ad regulate the voices the
worst singers in the world which are the english
in their churches at present
it cannot be supposed that the organs which
were thus disposed were instruments any
great cost or value an old pair organs for
that was the customary mode expression
meaning a set and in like manner a pair 
cards for a pack an old pair this kind belonging
to lambeth church was sold in lotion
for el church organs therefore even if
they had not been at a revolutionary price would
be within the purchase an ordinary vintner
in country parish churches says mr dense
the antiquary even where the district was
small there was often a choir singers for
whom forms desks and books were provided 
and they probably most them had benefactors
who supplied them with a pair organs that
might more properly have been termed a box 
whistles to the best my recollection there
were in the chapels some the colleges in
cambridge very very indifferent instruments
that the chapel belonging to our old house
was removed before i was admitted
the use the organ has occasioned a great
commotion if not a schism among the methodists
 late yet our holy herbert could call church
music the sweetest sweets and describe
himself when listening to it as disengaged from
the body and rising and falling with its
wings 
harris the chief builder the doncaster
organ was a contemporary and rival father
smith famous among organists each built
one for the temple church and father smith's
had most votes in its favor the peculiarity 
the doncaster organ which was harris's masterpiece
is its having in the great organ two trumpets
and a clarion throughout the whole compass 
and these stops are so excellent that a celebrated
musician said every pipe in them was worth its
weight in silver
our doctor dated from that year in his own
recollections as the great era his life it
served also for many the lancastrian as a
date to which they carried back their computations
till the generation which remembered the
erecting the organ was extinct
this was the age church improvement in
doncaster meaning here by church the material
structure just thirty years before the church
had been beautified and the ceiling painted too
probably to the disfigurement works a better
architectural age in the old peal five
bells was replaced with eight new ones new
metal heretofore spoken in the church
floor and church yard which had both been unlevelled
by death's levelling course were levelled
anew and new rails were placed to the altar
two years later the corporation gave the new
clock and it was fixed to strike on the watch
bell that clock which numbered the hours 
daniel dove's life from the age seventeen till
that seventy in the west gallery was
put up and in ten years after the organ a
new pulpit but not in the old style for pulpits
which are among the finest works art in brabant
and flanders had degenerated in england
and in other protestant countries
this probably was owing in our own country
as much to the prevalence puritanism as to
the general depravation taste it was for their
beauty or their splendour that the early quakers
inveighed with such vehemence against pulpits
many which places saith george keith in
his quaking days as we see in england and
many other countries have a great deal superfluity
and vain and superfluous labour and pains

above the ground whereon to stand when one

in the church and passing forward more rapidly
than the regular march this narration
in order to present these ecclesiastical matters
without interruption a set chimes were fixed
in merry be the memory those by whom
this good work was effected the north and
south galleries were rebuilt in and in
 the church was whitewashed a new reading
desk put up the pulpit removed to what was
deemed a more convenient station and mrs
neal gave a velvet embroidered cover and
cushion for it for which her name is enrolled
among the benefactors st george's church
that velvet which when i remember it had
lost the bloom its complexion will hardly have
been preserved till now even by the dyer's renovating
aid and its embroidery has long since
passed through the goldsmith's crucible sic
transit excites a more melancholy feeling in me
when a recollection like this arises in my mind
than even the forlorn hie jacef a neglected
tombstone indeed such is the softening effect 
time upon those who have not been rendered obdurate
and insensible by the world and the
world's law that i do not now call to mind without
some emotion even that pulpit to which i
certainly bore no good will in early life when it
was my fortune to hear from it so many somniferous
discourses and to bear away from it upon
pain displeasure in those whose displeasure tome
was painful so many texts chapter and verse

advantage public sermons hear hear for
martin luther speaketh public sermons do
very little edify children who observe and learn
but little thereby it is more needful that they
be taught and well instructed with diligence in
schools and at home that they be orderly heard

way profited much it is indeed very wearisome
but it is very necessary may i not then confess
that no turn expression however felicitous
no collocation words however emphatic and
beautiful no other sentences whatsoever although
rounded or pointed for effect with the most consummate
skill have ever given me so much delight
as those dear phrases which are employed
in winding up a sermon when it is brought to its
longwishedfor close

ever would be so if these things were ordered as
they might and ought to be hugh latimer

tixall poetry
the first years daniel's abode in doncaster
were distinguished by many events local memorality
the old friar's bridge was taken
down and a new one with one large arch built in
its stead turnpikes were erected on the roads
to saltsbrook and to lancaster and in 
lord semple's regiment highlanders marched
through the town being the first soldiers without
breeches who had ever been seen there since
breeches were in use in the mansion
house was begun next door to peter hopkins's
and by no means to his comfort while the work
was going on nor indeed after it was completed
its effect upon his chimnies having heretofore
been noticed the building was interrupted by
the rebellion an army six thousand english
and hessians was then encamped upon wheaten
hills and a hessian general dying there was
buried in st george's church from whence his
leaden coffin was stolen by the gravedigger
daniel had then compleated his twentysecond
year every summer he paid a month's visit to
his parents and those were happy days not the
less so to all parties because his second home had
become almost as dear to him as his first guy
did not live to see the progress his pupil he
died a few months after the lad had been placed
at doncaster and the delight daniel's first
return was overclouded by this loss it was a
severe one to the elder daniel who lost in the
schoolmaster his only intellectual companion
i have sought in vain for richard guy's tombstone
in ingleton churchyard that there is one
there can hardly i think be doubted for if he
left no relations who regarded him nor perhaps
effects enough his own to defray this last posthumous
and not necessary expence and if thomas
gent york who published the old poem 
flodden field from his transcript after his death
thought he required no other monument daniel
was not likely to omit this last tribute respect
and affection to his friend but the churchyard
which when his mortal remains were deposited
there accorded well with its romantic site on a
little eminence above the roaring torrent and
with the then retired character the village and
with the solemn use to which it was consecrated
is now a thicklypeopled burialground since
their time manufactures have been established in
ingleton and though eventually they proved
unsuccessful and were consequently abandoned
yet they continued long enough in work largely
to encrease the population the churchyard
amid so many tombs the stone which marked
poor guy's restingplace might escape even a
more diligent search than mine nearly a century
has elapsed since it was set up in the
course that time its inscription not having been
retouched must have become illegible to all but
an antiquary's poring and practised eyes and
perhaps to them also unless aided by his tracing
tact and by the conjectural supply connecting
words syllables or letters indeed the stone
itself has probably become half interred as the
earth around it has been disturbed and raised
time corrodes our epitaphs and buries our very
tombstones
returning pensively from my unsuccessful
search in the churchyard to the little inn at ingleton
i found there upon a sampler worked in
 by elizabeth brown aged and framed
as an ornament for the room which i occupied
some lines in as moral a strain verse as any
which i had that day perused among the tombs
and i transcribed them for preservation thinking
it not improbable that they had been originally
composed by richard guy for the use 
his female scholars and handed down for a like
purpose from one generation to another this
may be only a fond imagination and perhaps it
might not have occurred to me at another time 
but many compositions have been ascribed in
modern as well as ancient times and indeed daily
are so to more celebrated persons upon less
likely grounds these are the verses 
jesus permit thy gracious name to stand
as the first effort an infant's hand 
and as her fingers on the sampler move
engage her tender heart to seek thy love 
with thy dear children may she have a part
and write thy name thyself upon her heart

chapter xlviii
another s misgivings concerning his son s destination
peter hopkins's generosity daniel
is sent abroad to graduate in medicine
heaven is the magazine wherein he puts
both good and evil prayer's the key that shuts
and opens this great treasure tis a key
whose wards are faith and hope and charity
wouldst thou present a judgment due to sin 
turn but the key and thou may'st lock it in
or wouldst thou have a blessing fall upon thee 
open the door and it will shower on thee 
charles
the elder daniel saw in the marked improvement
 his son at every yearly visit more and
more cause to be satisfied with himself for having
given him such a destination and to thank
providence that the youth was placed with a
master whose kindness and religious care him
might truly be called fatherly there was but
one consideration which sometimes interfered with
that satisfaction and brought with it a sense 
uneasiness the doves from time immemorial
had belonged to the soil as fixedly as the soil had
belonged to them generation after generation
they had moved in the same contracted sphere
their wants and wishes being circumscribed alike
within their own few hereditary acres pride
under whatever form it may shew itself is the
devil and though family pride may not be its
most odious manifestation even that child bears a
sufficiently ugly likeness its father but family
feeling is a very different thing and may exist as
strongly in humble as in high life naboth was
as much attached to the vineyard the inheritance
 his fathers as ahab could be to the
throne which had been the prize and the reward
or punishment his father omits ambition
this feeling sometimes induced a doubt in
daniel whether affection for his son had not
made him overlook his duty to his forefathers 
whether the fixtures the land are not happier
and less in the way evil than the moveables 
whether he had done right in removing the lad
from that station life in which he was born
in which it had pleased god to place him divorcing
him as it were from his paternal soil and
cutting off the entail that sure independence
that safe contentment which his ancestors had
obtained and preserved for him and transmitted
to his care to be in like manner by him preserved
and handed down the latent poetry which
there was in the old man's heart made him sometimes
feel as if the fields and the brook and the
hearth and the graves reproached him for having
done this but then he took shelter in the reflection
that he had consulted the boy's true welfare
by giving him opportunities storing and
enlarging his mind that he had placed him in
the way intellectual advancement where he
might improve the talents which were committed
to his charge both for his own benefit and for that
 his fellowcreatures certain he was that whether
he had acted wisely or not he had meant
well he was conscious that his determination
had not been made without much and anxious
deliberation nor without much and earnest
prayer hitherto he saw that the blessing which
he prayed for had followed it and he endeavoured
to make his heart rest in thankful and pious hope
that that blessing would be continued wouldst
thou know says quarles the lawfulness the
action which thou desires to undertake let thy
devotion recommend it to divine blessing if it
be lawful thou shalt perceive thy heart encouraged
by thy prayer if unlawful thou shalt find
thy prayer discouraged by thy heart that
action is not warrantable which either blushes to
beg a blessing or having succeeded dares not
present a thanksgiving daniel might safely
put his conduct to this test and to this test in
fact his own healthy and uncorrupted sense 
religion led him though probably he had never
read these golden words quarles the emblems

it was therefore with no ordinary delight that
our good daniel received a letter from his son
asking permission to go to leyden in conformity
with his master's wishes and there prosecute his
studies long enough to graduate as a doctor in
medicine mr hopkins he said would generously
take upon himself the whole expence
having adopted him as his successor and almost
as a son for as such he was treated in all respects
both by him and by his mistress who was
one the best women and indeed it appeared
that mr hopkins had long entertained
this intention by the care which he had taken to
make him keep up and improve the knowledge
 latin which he had acquired under mr guy
the father's consent as might be supposed was
thankfully given and accordingly daniel dove
in the twentythird year his age embarked
from kingston upon hull for rotterdam well
provided by the care and kindness his benevolent
master with letters introduction and 
credit and still better provided with those religious
principles which though they cannot ensure
prosperity in this world ensure to us things 
infinitely greater moment good conduct peace
 mind and the everlasting reward the righteous

chapter xlix
concerning the interest which daniel the
elder took in the dutch war and more
especially in the siege and providential
delivery leyden
glory to thee in thine omnipotence
o lord who art our shield and our defence
and dost dispense
as seemeth hest to thine unerring will
which passeth mortal sense
the lot victory still 
edging sometimes with might the sword unjust 
and bowing to the dust
the rightful cause that so such seeming ill
may thine appointed purposes fulfil 
sometimes as in this late auspicious hour
for which our hymns we raise
making the wicked feel thy present power 
glory to thee and praise
almighty god by whom our strength was given 
glory to thee o lord earth and heaven 
southey
there were two portions history with which
the elder daniel was better acquainted than most
men that edward the third's reign and
that the wars in the netherlands down to the
year upon both subjects he was jtomo
unus libri such a man is proverbially formidable
at his own weapon and the with
which johnson immortalized osborne the bookseller
by knocking him down with it was not a
more formidable folio than either those from
which daniel derived this knowledge
now all the events in the wars the low
countries there was none which had so strongly
affected his imagination as the siege leyden
the patient fortitude the besieged and their
deliverance less by the exertions man though
no human exertions were omitted than by the
special mercy him whom the elements obey
and in whom they had put their trust were in the
strong and pious mind daniel things more
touching interest than the tragedy harlem or
the wonders military science and courage
displayed at the siege antwerp who indeed
could forget the fierce answer the listeners
when they were for the last time summoned to
surrender that the men leyden would never
surrender while they had one arm left to eat and
another to fight with and the not less terrible
reply the burgemeester peter adriaanzoon
wanderers to some the townsmen when they
represented to him the extremity famine to
which they were reduced i have sworn to
defend this city he made answer and by
god's help i mean to keep that oath but if my
death can help ye men here is my body cut it
in pieces and share it among ye as far as it will
go and who without partaking in the hopes
and fears the contest almost as if it were still
at issue can peruse the details that amphibious
battle if such an expression may be allowed
upon the inundated country when in the
extremity their distress and at a time when
the spaniards said that it was as impossible for
the hollanders to save leyden from their power
as it was for them to pluck the stars from heaven
 a great south wind which they might
truly say came from the grace god set in
with such a spring tide that in the course eight
and forty hours the inundation rose half a foot
thus rendering the fields just passable for the flat
bottomed boats which had been provided for that
service a naval battle among the trees where
the besieged though it was fought within two
miles their walls could see nothing because 
the foliage and amid such a labyrinth dykes
ditches rivers and fortifications that when the
besiegers retired from their palisades and sconces
the conquerors were not aware their own success
nor the besieged their deliverance i
in this delivery says the historian and in
every particular the enterprise doubtless all
must be attributed to the mere providence god
neither can man challenge any glory therein for
without a miracle all the endeavours the protestants
had been as wind but god who is
always good would not give way to the cruelties
wherewith the spaniards threatened this town
with all the insolencies whereof they make profession
in the taking towns although they be
by composition without any respect humanity
or honesty and there is not any man but will
confess with me if he be not some atheist or
epicure who maintain that all things come by
chance that this delivery is a work which bevol
ii h
tongs only unto god for if the spaniards had
battered the town but with four cannons only
they had carried it the people being so weakened
with famine as they could not endure any
longer besides a part them were ill affected
and very many cf their best men were dead 
the plague and for another testimony that it
was god only who wrought the town was no
sooner delivered but the wind which was southwest
and had driven the water out the sea
into the country turned to northeast and did
drive it back again into the sea as if the southwest
wind had blown those three days only to
that effect wherefore they might well say that
both the winds and the sea had fought for the
town leyden and as for the resolution 
the states holland to drown the country and
to do that which they and their prince together
with all the commanders captains and soldiers
 the army shewed in this seacourse together
with the constancy and resolution the besieged
to defend themselves notwithstanding so many
miseries which they suffered and so many promises
and threats which were made unto them
all in like sort proceeded from a divine instinct

in the spirit thoughtful feeling that this
passage breathes was the whole history that
tremendous struggle perused by the elder daniel
 and daniel the son was so deeply imbued
with the same feeling that if he had lived till the
time the peninsular war he would have
looked upon the condition to which spain was
reduced as a consequence its former tyranny
and as an awful proof how surely soon or late
the sins the fathers are visited upon the children

oh that all history were regarded in this spirit 
even such as are in faith most strong zeal
most ardent should not says one the best and
wisest theologians much misspent their
time in comparing the degenerate fictions or historical
relations times ancient or modern with
the everlasting truth for though this method
could not add much increase either to their faith
or zeal yet would it doubtless much avail for
working placid and mild affections the very
penmen sacred writ themselves were taught
patience and instructed in the ways god's providence
by their experience such events as the
course time is never barren not always
related by canonical authors nor immediately
testified by the spirit but ofttimes believed upon
a moral certainty or such a resolution circumstances
concurrent into the first cause or disposer
 all affairs as we might make modern accidents
were we otherwise partakers the spirit
or would we mind heavenly matters as much as
earthly

voyage to rotterdam and leyden the author
cannot tarry to describe that city what
happened there to daniel dove
he took great content exceeding delight in that his voyage
as who doth not that shall attempt the like for peregrination
charms our senses with such unspeakable and sweet variety
that some count him unhappy that never travelled a
kind prisoner and pity his case that from his cradle to his
old age he beholds the same still still still the same the
same burton
why did dan remain in ships says deborah
the prophetess in that noble song which if it had
been composed in greek instead hebrew
would have made pindar hide his diminished
head or taught him a loftier strain than even he
has reached in his eagle flights why did
dan remain in ships said the prophetess our
daniel during his rough passage from the humber
to the manse thought that nothing should
make him do so yet when all danger real or
imaginary was over upon that deep
where proteus herds and neptune ores do keep
where all is ploughed yet still the pasture's green
the ways are found and yet no paths are seen 
when all the discomforts and positive sufferings
 the voyage were at an and when the
ship
quitting her fairly the injurious seat
had entered the smooth waters that stately
river and was gliding
into the bosom her quiet quays
he felt that the delight setting foot on shore
after a sea voyage and that too the shore a
foreign country for the first time is one the
few pleasures which exceed any expectation that
can be formed them
he used to speak his landing on a fine autumnal
noon in the wellwooded and wellwatered
city rotterdam and his journey along what
he called the high turnpike canal from thence to
b jonson p ft charles
leyden as some the pleasantness recollections
 his life nothing he said was wanting to his
enjoyment but that there should have been someone
to have partaken it with him in an equal
degree but the feeling that he was alone in a
foreign land sate lightly on him and did not
continue long young as he was with life and
hope before him healthful body and mind
cheerful as the natural consequence that health
corporeal and mental and having always much
to notice and enough to do the one being an
indispensable condition happiness the other a
source pleasure as long as it lasts and where
there is a quick eye and an enquiring mind the
longest residence abroad is hardly long enough
to exhaust it
no day in daniel's life had ever passed in such
constant and pleasurable excitement as that on
which he made his passage from rotterdam to
leyden and took possession the lodgings which
peter hopkins's correspondent had engaged for
him his reception was such as instantly to
make him feel that he was placed with worthy
people the little apprehensions rather than
anxieties which the novelty his situation occasioned
the sight strange faces with which he
was to be domesticated and the sound a strange
language to which harsh and uninviting as it
seemed his ear and speech must learn to accustom
themselves did not disquiet his first night's
rest and having fallen asleep notwithstanding
the new position to which a dutch bolster constrained
him he was not disturbed by the storks
all night
beating the air with their obstreperous beaks
for with ben jonson's leave this may much
more appropriately be said them than the
ravens nor by the watchmen's sappers or clapsticks
which seem to have been invented in emulous
imitation the stork's instrumental performance

but you and i reader can afford to make no

accompany thee to noortwyck and describe to
thee its fishponds its parterres the arabesque
carpet work its box and the espalier walls or

such as they existed when our doctor in
his antedoctorial age was a student at leyden
having been kept up till that time in their old
fashion by the representatives janus dousa
we cannot dear reader tarry to visit the gardens
in that same pleasant village from which the
neighbouring cities are supplied with medicinal
plants where beds ranunculuses afford when
in blossom a spectacle which no exhibition art
could rival in splendour and in beauty and from
whence rose leaves are exported to turkey thereto
have their essential oil extracted for mahometan
luxury
we must not go to see the sluices the rhine
which daniel never saw because in his time the
rhine had no outlet through these downs we
cannot walk upon the shore at katwyck where it
was formerly a piece dutch courtship for the
wooer to take his mistress in his arms carry her
into the sea till he was more than knee deep set
her down upon her feet and then bearing her
out again roll her over and over upon the sand
hills by way drying her we have no time
for visiting that scene the batavia arcadia
no reader i cannot tarry to shew thee the curiosities

we must return to doncaster it would not
be convenient for me to enter minutely even if
leyden's ramp
my materials were sufficient for that purpose into
the course our student's life from the time
when he was entered among the greene this
famous university nor to describe the ceremonies
which were used at his agreeing by his associates
 nor the academical ones with which at the
termination his regular terms his degree in
medicine was conferred i can only tell thee that
during his residence at leyden he learnt with
exemplary diligence whatever he was expected to
learn there and by the industrious use good
opportunities a great deal more
but he fell in love with a burgemeester's
daughter

the arms ley den are two cross keys gules ina

the power those keys to bind and to loose
and moreover to bleed and to blister to administer

and employ the whole artillery the pharmacopoeia
daniel returned to doncaster the
papal keys convey no such general power as the
keys leyden they give authority over the
conscience and the soul now it is not every man
that has a conscience or that chuses to keep one 
and as for souls if it were not an article faith
to believe otherwise one might conclude that the
greater part mankind had none from the utter
disregard them which is manifested in the
whole course their dealings with each other
but bodily diseases are among the afflictions
which flesh is heir to and we are not more surely
bruges consumers nati than we are born to consume
physic also greatly to the benefit that
profession in which daniel dove had now obtained
his commission
but though he was now m d in due form
and entitled to the insignia the professional
wig the muff and the goldheaded cane it was
not mr hopkins's intention that he should assume
his title and commence practice as a physician
this would have been an unpromising
adventure whereas on the other hand the consideration
which a regular education at leyden
then the most flourishing school medicine
would obtain for him in the vicinity was a sure
advantage hopkins could now present him asa
person thoroughly qualified to be his successor 
and if at any future time dove should think
proper to retire from the more laborious parts 
his calling and take up his rank it would be in
his power to do so
but one part my readers are i suspect at
this time a little impatient to know something
about the burgemeester's daughter and i because
 the
allegiance and fast fealty
which i do owe unto all womankind
am bound to satisfy their natural and becoming
curiosity not however in this place for though
love has its bitters i never will mix it up in the
same chapter with physic daniel's passion for
the burgemeester's daughter must be treated 
in a chapter by itself this being a mark respect
due to the subject to her beauty and to the dignity
 mynheer her wei del groot hoogh
achtbaer father
first however i must dispose an objection
there may be readers who though they can
understand why a lady instead telling her love
should
let concealment like a worm in the bud
feed on her damask cheek
spenser
will think it absurd to believe that any man
should fix his affections as daniel did upon the
burgemeester's daughter on a person whom he
had no hopes obtaining and with whom as will
presently appear he never interchanged a word
i cannot help their incredulity but if they will
not believe me they may perhaps believe the
newspapers which about the year related
the following case in point
a short time since a curious circumstance
happened the rector st martin's parish
was sent for to pray by a gentleman the name
 wright who lodged in st james street
publico a few days afterwards mr wright's
solicitor called on the rector to inform him that
mr wright was dead and had made a codicil to
his will wherein he had left him s and
mr abbott the speaker the house commons
s and all his personal property and
estates deerpark and fisheries e to lady
frances bruce bridewell daughter the earl
 aylesbury upon the rector's going to lord
aylesbury's to inform her ladyship the house
steward said she was married to sir henry wilson
 chelsea park but he would go to her
ladyship and inform her the matter lady
frances said she did not know any such personas
mr wright but desired the steward to go to
the rector to get the whole particulars and say
she would wait on him the next day she did so
and found to her great astonishment that the
whole was true she afterwards went to st
james street and saw mr wright in his coffin 
and then she recollected him as having been a
great annoyance to her many years ago at the
opera house where he had a box next to hers 
he never spoke to her but was continually watching
her look wherever she would till at length
she was under the necessity requesting her
friends to procure another box the estates are
from to e ayear lady frances
intends putting all her family into mourning out
 respect
whether such a bequest ought to have been
held good in law and if so whether it ought in
conscience to have been accepted are points upon
which i should probably differ both from the
lord chancellor and the lady legatee

 credere donne vague cornelia
quando celui che strive o chefavella
posse essere sospetto di bugia
per dir qualcosa troppo rara e bella
dunque chi ascot quest victoria mea
e nan la crete frottola o novella
ma cosa overcome ella i ditto

e pure che mi date plena fete
de la dubbiezza altrui poco mi cale

dear ladies i can neither tell you the name 
the burgemeester's daughter nor the burgemeester
himself if i ever heard them they
have escaped my recollection the doctor used
to say his love for her was in two respects like
the smallpox for he took it by inoculation and
having taken it he was secured from ever having
the disease in a more dangerous form
the case was a very singular one had it not
been so it is probable i should never have been
made acquainted with it most men seem to
consider their unsuccessful love when it is over
as a folly which they neither like to speak nor
to remember
daniel dove never was introduced to the
burgemeester's daughter never was in company
with her and as already has been intimated never
spoke to her as for any hope ever by any
possibility obtaining a return his affection a
devout roman catholic might upon much better
grounds hope that saint ursula or any her
eleven thousand virgins would come from her
place in heaven to reward his devotion with a
kiss the gulph between dives and lazarus
was not more insuperable than the distance between
such an english green at leyden and a
burgemeester's daughter
here therefore dear ladies you cannot look
to read 
le speranze gli ajfetti
la datafe le tenerezze i primi
scambievoli sospiri i primi guard
nor will it be possible for me to give you
video di quel volta
dove apprise il suo core
la prima volta a sospirar d'amore
this i cannot do for i never saw her picture
nor heard her features described and most
likely if i had seen her herself in her youth and
beauty the most accurate description that words
could convey might be just as like fair rosamond
helen rachel or eve suffice it to say
that she was confessedly the beauty that city
and those parts
but it was not for the fame her beauty that
daniel fell in love with her so little was thereof
this kind romance in his nature that report
never raised in him the slightest desire seeing
her her beauty was no more than hecuba's to
him till he saw it but it so happened that
having once seen it he saw it frequently at leisure
and always to the best advantage and so
said he i received the disease by inoculation
 metasia
thus it was there was at leyden an english
presbyterian kirk for the use the english students
and any other persons who might chuse to
frequent it daniel felt the want there that
liturgy in the use which he had been trained
up and finding nothing which could attract him
to that place worship except the use his own
language which moreover was not used by the
preacher in any way to his edification he listened
willingly to the advice the good man with
whom he boarded and this was that's soon ashe
had acquired a slight knowledge the dutch
tongue he should as a means improving himself
in it accompany the family to their parish
church now this happened to be the very
church which the burgemeester and his family
attended and if the allotment pews in that
church had been laid out by cupid himself with
the forepurpose catching daniel as in a pitfall
his position there in relation to the burgomaster's
daughter could not have been more exactly
fixed
god forgive me said he for every sunday
while she was worshipping her maker i
used to worship her
but the folly went no farther than this it led
him into no act absurdity for he kept it to
himself j and he even turned it to some advantage
or rather it shaped for itself a useful direction
in this way having frequent and unobserved
opportunity observing her lovely face
the countenance became fixed so perfectly in his
mind that even after the lapse forty years
he was sure he said that if he had possessed a
painter's art he could have produced her likeness
and having her beauty thus impressed upon his
imagination any other appeared to him only asa
foil to it during that part his life when he
was so circumstanced that it would have been an
act imprudence for him to run in love
i smile to think how many my readers when
they are reading this chapter aloud in a domestic
circle will bring up at the expression running
in love like a stagecoachman who driving at
the smooth and steady pace nine miles an hour
on a macadamized road comes upon some accidental
obstruction only just in time to check the
horses
amorous who flies into love and natura who
flutters as if she were about to do the same and
amoretta who dances into it poor creatures
god help them all three and amanda heaven
bless her who will be led to it gently and leisurely
along the path discretion they all make
a sudden stop at the words
chapter liii p i
 the various ways getting in love a chapter
containing some useful observations and
some beautiful poetry
let cavillers know that as the lord john answered the
queen in that italian guazzo an old a grave discreet man is
fittest to discourse lovematters because he hath likely
more experience observed more hath a more staid judgement
can better discern resolve discuss advise give better
cautions and more solid precepts better inform his auditors in
such a subject and by reason his riper years sooner divert

slips the tongue are sometimes found very
inconvenient by those persons who owing to some
unlucky want correspondence between their
wits and their utterance say one thing when they
mean to say another or bolt out something which
the slightest degree forethought would have
kept unsaid but more serious mischief arises
vol ii i
from that misuse words which occurs in all
inaccurate writers many are the men who
merely for want understanding what they say
have blundered into heresies and erroneous assertions
 every hid which they have afterwards
passionately and pertinaciously defended
till they have established themselves in the profession
if not in the belief some pernicious
doctrine or opinion to their own great injury and
that their deluded followers and the commonwealth

there may be an opposite fault for indeed
upon the agathokakological globe there are opposite
qualities always to be found in parallel
degrees north and south the equator
a man may dwell upon words till he becomes
at length a mere precisian in speech he may
think their meaning till he loses sight all
meaning and they appear as dark and mysterious
to him as chaos and outer night death grave 
exclaims goethe's suicide i understand not the
words and so he who looks for its quintessence
might exclaim every word in the dictionary
they who cannot swim should be contented
with wading in the shallows they who can may
take to the deep water no matter how deep so it
be clear but let no one dive in the mud
i said that daniel fell in love with the burgomaster's
daughter and i made use the usual
expression because there it was the most appropriate
 for the thing was accidental he himself
could not have been more surprized if missing
his way in a fog and supposing himself to be in
the breedestraat leyden where there is no
canal he had fallen into the water nor would
he have been more completely over head and ears
at once
a man falls in love just as he falls down stairs
it is an accident perhaps and very probably a
misfortune something which he neither intended
nor foresaw nor apprehended but
when he runs in love it is as when he runs in
debt it is done knowingly and intentionally 
and very often rashly and foolishly even if not
ridiculously miserably and ruinously
marriages that are made up at wateringplaces
are mostly this running sort and there maybe
reason to think that they are even less likely to
lead to i will not say happiness but to a very
humble degree contentment than those which
are a plain business bargain and sale for into
these latter a certain degree prudence enters
on both sides but there is a distinction to be
made here the man who is married for mere
worldly motives without a spark affection on
the woman's part may nevertheless get in every
worldly sense the word a good wife and
while english women continue to be what thank
heaven they are he is likely to do so but when
a woman is married for the sake her fortune
the case is altered and the chances are five hundred
to one that she marries a villain or at best
a scoundrel
falling in love and running in love are both
as every body knows common enough and yet
less so than what i shall call catching love
where the love itself is imprudent that is to say
where there is some just prudential cause or impediment
why the two parties should not be
joined together in holy matrimony there is generally
some degree culpable imprudence in
catching it because the danger is always to be
apprehended and may in most cases be avoided
but sometimes the circumstances may be such as
leave no room for censure even when there may bs
most cause for compassion and under such circumstances
our friend though the remembrance
 the burgemeester's daughter was too vivid in
his imagination for him ever to run in love or at
that time deliberately to walk into it as he afterwards
did under such circumstances i say he
took a severe affection this kind the story is
a melancholy one and i shall relate not it in
this place
the rarest and surely the happiest marriages
are between those who have grown in love take
the description such a love in its rise and progress
ye thousands and tens thousands who
have what is called a taste for poetry take it in
the sweet words one the sweetest and tenderest
 english poets and if ye doubt upon the
strength my opinion whether daniel deserves
such praise ask leigh hunt or the laureate or
wordsworth or charles lamb
ah i remember well and how can i
but evermore remember well when first
our flame began when scarce we knew what was
the flame we felt when as we sat and sighed
and looked upon each other and conceived
not what we ailed yet something we did ail 
and yet were well and yet we were not well
and what was our disease we could not tell
then would we kiss then sigh then look and thus
in that first garden our simpleness
we spent our childhood but when years began
to reap the fruit knowledge ah how then
would she with graver looks with sweet stern brow
check my presumption and my forwardness 
yet still would give me flowers still would me show
what she would have me yet not have me know
take also the passage that presently follows this 
it alludes to a game which has long been obsolete
but some fair reader i doubt not will remember
the lines when she dances next
and when in sport with other company
 nymphs and shepherds we have met abroad
how would she steal a look and watch mine eye
which way it went and when at barleybreak
it came unto my turn to rescue her
with what an earnest swift and nimble pace
would her affection make her feet to run
and further run than to my hand her race
had no stop but my bosom where no 
and when we were to break again how late
and loth her trembling hand would part with mine 
and with how slow a pace would she set forth
to meet the encountering party who contends
to attain her scarce affording him her fingers ends 
hymen's triumph

more concerning love and marriage and marriage
without love
nay cupid pitch thy trammel where thou please
thou canst not fail to catch such fish as these
charles
whether chance or choice have most to do in
the weighty concerns love and matrimony is
as difficult a question as whether chance or skill
have most influence upon a game at backgammon
both enter into the constitution the game 
and choice will always have some little to do with
love though so many other operating motives
may be combined with it that it sometimes bears
a very insignificant part but from marriage it
is too frequently precluded on the one side
unwilling consent and submission to painful
circumstances supplying its place and there is
one sect christians the moravian who where
they hold to the rigour their institute preclude
it on both sides they marry by lot and if
divorces ever take place among them the scandal
has not been divulged to the profaner world
choice however is exercised among all other
christians or where not exercised it is presumed
by a fiction law or divinity call it which you
will the husband even insists upon it in china
where the pig is bought in a poke for when
pigsnie arrives and the purchaser opens the close
sedan chair in which she has been conveyed to
his house if he does not like her looks at first
sight he shuts her up again and sends her back
but when a batchelor who has no particular
attachment makes up his mind to take unto himself
a wife for those reasons to which uncle toby
referred the widow madman as being to be
found in the common prayer how then
to choose is a matter much more difficulty
than one who has never considered it could suppose
it would not be paradoxical to assert that
in the sort choice which such a person makes
i 
chance has a much greater part than either affection
or judgement to set about seeking a wife
is like seeking ones fortune and the probability
 finding a good one in such a quest is less
though poor enough heaven knows in both
cases
the bard has sung god never form'd a soul
without its own peculiar mate to meet
its wandering half when ripe to crown the whole
bright plan bliss most heavenly most couplet j
but thousand evil things there are that hate
to look on happiness these hurt impede
and leagued with time space circumstance and fate
keep kindred heart from heart to pine and pant and bleed
and as the dove to far palmyra flying
from where her native founts antioch beam
weary exhausted longing panting sighing
lights sadly at the desert's bitter stream 
so many a soul o'er life's drear desert faring
love's pure congenial spring unfound unquam d
suffers recoils then thirsty and despairing
 what it would descends and sips the nearest draught

according to the new revelation the saint
simonides every individual human being has had
a fitting mate created the one and only woman
for every individual man and the one and only
man for every individual woman and unless the
persons so made fitted and intended for each
other meet and are joined together in matrimonial
bonds there can be no perfect marriage for
either that harmonious union for which they were
designed being frustrated for both read the
words the chief the new hierarchy himself
father bazard riy a sur la terre pour chaque
homme queene seule femme etpour chaque femme
qiiun seul homme qui soient destines a former
dans le mariage t union harmonique du couple
grace aux lumieres de cette revelation les individus
les plus avances peuvent aussi des 
sentir et former le lien qui doit les unir
dans le mariage
but if sinner simon and his disciples most
assuredly they ought to be untainted were right
in this doctrine happy marriages would be far
more uncommon than they are the man might
with better likelihood finding it look for a
needle in a bottle hay than seek for his other
half in this wide world and the woman's chance
would be so immeasurably less that no intelligible
form figures could express her fraction
 it
the man who gets in love because he has determined
to marry instead marrying because
he is in love goes about to private parties and to
public places in search a wife and there he is
attracted by a woman's appearance and the figure
which she makes in public not by her amiable
deportment her domestic qualities and her good
report watering places might with equal propriety
be called fishing places because they are
frequented by female anglers who are in quest
 such prey the elder for their daughters the
younger for themselves but it is a dangerous
sport for the fair cicatrix is not more likely to
catch a bonito or a dorado than she is to be
caught by a shark

glee nor the young thomas day either a
father and son whose names are married to immortal

sandford and merton and who had a heart which
generally led him right and a head which as generally
led him wrong that thomas day thought
that the best way obtaining a wife to his mind
was to breed one up for himself so he selected
two little orphan girls from a charity school with
the intention marrying in due time the one
whom he should like best course such proper
securities as could alone justify the managers 
the charity in consenting to so uncommon a transaction
were required and given the experiment
succeeded in every thing except its specific object
 for he found at last that love was not a thing
thus to be bespoken on either side and his lucretia
and sabina as he named them grew up to be
good wives for other men i do not know whether
the life thomas day has yet found its
appropriate place in the wonderful magazine orin

but the reader may find it livelily related in

the experiment breeding a wife is not likely
to be repeated none but a most determined
theorist would attempt it and to carry it into
effect would require considerable means fortune

greater disparity years than can be approved
in theory upon any due consideration human

i have more to say dear ladies upon that
which to you is and ought to be the most interesting
 all worldly subjects matrimony and
the various ways by which it is brought about 
but this is not the place for saying it the
doctor is not at this time thinking a wife
his heart can no more be taken so long as it
retains the lively image the burgemeester's
daughter than troytown while the palladium
was safe
imagine him therefore in the year our lord
 and in the twentysixth year his age
returned to doncaster with the burgemeester's
daughter seated like the lady in the lobster
in his inmost breast with physic in his head and
at his fingers ends and with an appetite for
knowledge which had long been feeding voraciously
digesting well and increasing in its
growth by what it fed on imagine him returned
to doncaster and welcomed once more as a son
by the worthy old peter hopkins and his goodwife
in that comfortable habitation which i have
heretofore described and which as was at the
same time stated you may see a faithful representation
in miller's history that good town 
a faithful representation i say what it was in
 the drawing was by frederic nash and
edward shirt made a shift to engrave it the
house had then undergone some alterations since
the days when i frequented it and now 
 all things in this our mortal pilgrimage one
 the most joyful is the returning home after an
absence which has been long enough to make the
heart yearn with hope and not sicken with it
and then to find when you arrive there that all is
well but the most purely painful all painful
things is to visit after a long long interval time
the place which was once our home the most
purely painful because it is unmixed with fear
anxiety disappointment or any other emotion but
what belongs to the sense time and change
then pressing upon us with its whole unalleviated
weight
it was my fortune to leave doncaster early in
life and having passed per various casus and
through as large a proportion good and evil in
my humble sphere as the pious eneas though
not exactly per tot discriminate rerum not to see
it again till after an absence more than forty
years when my way happened to lie through that
town i should never have had heart purposely
to visit it for that would have been seeking sorrow
 but to have made a circuit for the sake 
avoiding the place would have been an act 
weakness and no man who has a proper degree
 selfrespect will do any thing which he
might justly feel ashamed it was evening and
late in autumn when i entered doncaster and
alighted at the old angel inn the old
angel said i to my fellowtraveller you see
that even angels on earth grow old 
my companion knew how deeply i had been
indebted to dr dove and with what affection i
cherished his memory we presently sallied forth
to look at his former habitation totally unknown
as i now am in doncaster where there is
probably not one living soul who remembers
either me or my very name i had determined
to knock at the door at a suitable hour on the
morrow and ask permission to enter the house in
which i had passed so many happy and memorable
hours long ago my age and appearance
i thought might justify this liberty and i intended
also to go into the garden and see if any
 the fruit trees were remaining which my venerable
friend had planted and from which i had
so often plucked and ate
when we came there there was nothing by
which i could have recognized the spot had it
not been for the mansion house that immediately
adjoined it half its site had been levelled
to make room for a street or road which
had been recently opened not a vestige remained
 the garden behind the remaining part 
the house had been rebuilt and when i read
the name r dennis on the door it was
something consolatory to see that the door itself
was not the same which had so often opened to
admit me
upon returning to the spot on the following
morning i perceived that the part which had been
rebuilt is employed as some sort official appendage
to the mansion house and on the
naked sidewall now open to the new street or
road i observed most distinctly where the old
tall chimney had stood and the outline the old
pointed roof these were the only vestiges that
remained they could have no possible interest in
any eyes but mine which were likely never to
behold them again and indeed it was evident
that they would soon be effaced as a deformity
and the naked sidewall smoothed over with
plaster but they will not be effaced from my
memory for they were the last traces that
dwelling which is the keble my retrospective
daydreams the sanctum sanatorium my
dearest recollections and like an apparition from
the dead once seen they were never to be forgotten

chapter lvi
a truce with melancholy gentlemen such as
they were in the year our lord f a
hint to young ladies concerning their great
grandmothers
fashions that are now called new
have been worn by more than you 
elder times have used the same
though these new ones get the name
middleton
well might ben jonson call bellringing the
poetry steeples it is a poetry which in some
heart or other is always sure to move an accordant
key and there is not much the poetry so called
by courtesy because it bears the appearance 
verse which this can be said with equal truth
doncaster since i was one its inhabitants had
been so greatly changed improved i ought
to say for its outward changes had really been
improvements that there was nothing but my
own recollections to carry me back into the past
till the clock st george's struck nine on the
evening our arrival and its chimes began to
measure out the same time in the same tones
which i used to hear as regularly as the hours
came round forty long years ago
enough this my visit to doncaster was
incidentally introduced by the comparison which
i could not chuse but make between such a return
and that ofthe student from leyden
we must now revert to the point from whence i
strayed and go farther back than the forty years
over which the chimes as if with magic had transported
me we must go back to the year 
when gentlemen wore skyblue coats with silver
button holes and huge cuffs extending more than
half way from the middle the hand to the
elbow short breeches just reaching to the silver
garters at the knee and embroidered waistcoats
with long flaps which came almost as low were
i to describe daniel dove in the wig which he
then wore and which observed a modest mean
between the bush the apothecary and the
consequential foretop the physician with its
depending knots fore and aft were i to describe
him in a sober suit brown or snuffcoloured
dittos such as beseemed his profession but with
cuffs the dimensions waistcoatflaps the
length and breeches the brevity before mentioned
 amorous and natura and amoretta
would exclaim that love ought never to be named
in connection with such a figure amabilis
sweet girl in the very bloom innocence and
opening youth would declare she never could
love such a creature and amanda herself would
smile not contemptuously nor at her idea the
man but at the mutability fashion smile if
you will young ladies your great grandmothers
wore large hoops peaked stomachers and 
 their ridinghabits and waistcoats
were trimmed with silver and they had very
gentlemanlike peruke for riding in as well as
gentlemanlike cocked hats yet young ladies
they were as gay and giddy in their time
as you are now they were as attractive and as
lovely they were not less ready than you are to
laugh at the fashions those who had gone
before them they were wooed and won by gentlemen
in short breeches long flapped waistcoats
large cuffs and tie wigs and the wooing and
winning proceeded much in the same manner as
it had done in the generations before them as the
same agreeable part this world's business proceeds
among yourselves and as it will proceed
when you will be as little thought by your
greatgranddaughters as your greatgrandmothers
are at this time by you what care you
for your greatgrandmothers 
the law entails sufficiently proves that our
care for our posterity is carried far sometimes
indeed beyond what is reasonable and just on
the other hand it is certain that the sense relationship
in the ascending line produces in general
little other feeling than that pride in the
haughty and highborn that it should be so
to a certain degree is in the order nature and
for the general good but that in our selfish state
 society this indifference for our ancestors is
greater than the order nature would itself
produce may be concluded from the very different
feeling which prevailed among some the
ancients and still prevails in other parts the
world
he who said that he did not see why he should
be expected to do any thing for posterity when
posterity had done nothing for him might be
deemed to have shown as much worthlessness as
wit in this saying if it were any thing more than
the sportive sally a lighthearted man yet
one who keeps his heart with all diligence
knowing that out it are the issues life
will take heed never lightly to entertain a thought
that seems to make light a duty still less will
he give it utterance we owe much to posterity
nothing less than all that we have received from
our forefathers and for myself i should be unwilling
to believe that nothing is due from us to
our ancestors if i did not acquire this feeling
from the person who is the subject these volumes
it was at least confirmed by him he
used to say that one the gratifications which
he promised himself after death was that becoming
acquainted with all his progenitors in
order degree above degree up to noah and
from him up to our first parents but said
vol ii k
he though i mean to proceed regularly step
by step curiosity will make me in one instance
trespass upon this proper arrangement and i
shall take the earliest opportunity paying my
respects to adam and eve
chapter lvii
an attempt is made to remove the unpleasant
impression produced upon the ladies by the
doctor's tyewig and his suit snuffcoloured

so full shapes is fancy
that it alone is high fantastical
twelfth night
i must not allow the feminine part my readers
to suppose that the doctor when in his prime 
life was not a very likeable person in appearance
as well as in every thing else although he wore
what in the middle the last century was the
costume a respectable country practitioner in
medicine though at leyden he could only look
at a burgemeester's daughter as a cat may look
at a king there was not a mayor or alderman's
daughter in doncaster who would have thought
herself disparaged if he had fixed his eyes upon
her and made her a proffer his hand
yet as in the opinion many dress makes
the man and any thing which departs widely
from the standard dress the fellow i must
endeavour to give those young ladies who are
influenced more than they ought to be and perhaps
more than they are aware by such an
opinion a more favourable notion the doctor's
appearance than they are likely to have if they
bring him before their eyes in the fashion his
times it will not assist this intention on my
part if i request you to look at him as you would
look at a friend who was dressed in such a costume
for a masquerade or a fancy ball for your
friend would expect and wish to be laughed at
having assumed the dress for that benevolent purpose
well then let us take off the aforesaid
sad snuffcolour coat with broad deep cuffs still
the waistcoat with its long flaps and the breeches
that barely reach to the knee will provoke your
merriment we must not proceed farther in
undressing him and if i conceal these under a
loose morning gown green damask the insuperable
perriwig would still remain
let me then present him to your imagination
setting forth on horseback in that sort weather
which no man encounters voluntarily but which
men his profession who practise in the country
are called upon to face at all seasons and all hours
look at him in a great coat the closest texture
that the looms leeds could furnish one 
those dreadnoughts the utility which sets fashion
at defiance you will not observe his bootstockings
coming high above the knees the coat covers
them and if it did not you would be far from
despising them now his tiewig is all but hidden
under a hat the brim which is broad enough to
answer in some degree the use an umbrella
look at him now about to set off on some case 
emergency with haste in his expressive eyes and
a cast thoughtful anxiety over one the most
benignant countenances that nature ever impressed
with the characters good humour and
good sense 
was he then so handsome you say nay
ladies i know not whether you would have
called him so for among the things which were
too wonderful for him yea which he knew not
i suspect that solomon might have included a
woman's notion handsomeness in man
chapter lviii
concerning the portrait dr daniel dove
the sure traveller 
though he alight sometimes still goeth on
herbert
there is no portrait dr daniel dove
and there horrebow the natural historian 
iceland if horrebow had been his biographer
would have ended this chapter
here perchance observe reader i am
speaking now in the words the lord keeper
sir nicholas bacon here perchance a question
would be asked and yet i do marvel to hear a
question made so plain a matter what should
be the cause this if it were asked still the
lord keeper speaketh thus i mean to answer 
that i think no man so blind but seeth it no
man so deaf but heareth it nor no man so ignorant
but understanding it ii y a des demandes
si sottes qiton ne les sqauroit resoudrepar autre
moyen que par la moquerie et les absurdities 
afin qtfune sottise pousse autre
but some reader may ask what have i answered
here or rather what have i brought forward
the great authority the lord keeper sir
nicholas bacon and the archvituperation p grasse
to answer for me do i take it for granted
that the cause wherefore there is no portrait 
dr daniel dove should be thus apparent or
the reason why there being no such portrait
horrebow should simply have said so and having
so said therewith the chapter which he had
commenced upon the subject
o gentle reader you who ask this pertinent
question i entirely agree with you there is
nothing more desirable in composition than perspicuity
 and in perspicuity precision is implied
 the author who has attained it in his style it
may indeed be said omne tulip punctum so far as
relates to style for all other graces those only
grasse
excepted which only genius can impart will necessarily
follow nothing is so desirable and
yet it should seem that nothing is so difficult
he who thinks least about it when he is engaged
in composition will be most likely to attain it for
no man ever attained it by labouring for it
read all the treatises upon composition that ever
were composed and you will find nothing which
conveys so much useful instruction as the account
given by john wesley his own way writing
i never think my style says he but just
set down the words that come first only when
i transcribe any thing for the press then i think
it my duty to see that every phrase be clear pure
and proper conciseness which is now as it were
natural to me brings quantum sufficient strength
if after all i observe any stiff expression i throw
it out neck and shoulders let your words take
their course freely they will then dispose themselves
in their natural order and make your
meaning plain that is mr author supposing
you have a meaning and that it is not an insidious
and for that reason a covert one with all
the headwork that there is in these volumes and
k 
all the heartwork too i have not bitten my nails
over a single sentence which they contain i do
not say that my hand has not sometimes been

no people have pretended to so much precision
in their language as the turks they have not
only verbs active passive transitive and reciprocal
but also verbs cooperative verbs meditative
verbs frequentative verbs negative and
verbs impossible and moreover they have what
are called verbs opinion and verbs knowledge
the latter are used when the speaker
means it to be understood that he speaks his
own sure knowledge and is absolutely certain 
what he asserts the former when he advances it
only as what he thinks likely or believes upon
the testimony others
now in the turkish language the word
whereon both the meaning and the construction
 the sentence depend is placed at the a
sentence which extends not unfrequently to ten
fifteen or twenty lines what therefore they
might gain in accuracy by this nice distinction 
verbs must be more than counterbalanced by the
ambiguity consequent upon longmindedness
and notwithstanding their conscientious moods
they are not more remarkable for veracity than
their neighbours who in ancient times made so
much use the indefinite tenses and were said
to be always liars
we have a sect in our own country who profess
to use a strict and sincere plainness speech they
call their dialect the plain language and yet they
are notorious for making a studied precision in
their words answer all the purposes equivocation

chapter lix
showing what that question was which was
answered before it was asked
chacun a son stile le mien comme vous voyez n'est pas lacomique
m e de seine
in reporting progress upon the subject the
preceding chapter it appears that the question
asked concerning the question that was answered
was not itself answered in that chapter so that
it still remains to be explained what it was that
was so obvious as to require no other answer than
the answer that was there given whether it was
the reason why there is no portrait dr daniel
dove or the reason why horrebow if he had
been the author this would simply have
said that there was none and have said nothing
more about it 
the question which was answered related to
horrebow he would have said nothing more
about the matter because he would have thought
there was nothing more to say or because he
agreed with britain's old rhyming remembrancer
that although
more might be said hereof to make a proof
yet more to say were more than is enough
but if there be readers who admire a style 
such barren brevity i must tell them in the words
 estienne pasquin that je fais grande conscience
d'alambiquer mon esprit en telle espece
ctescrite pour leur complaire do they take me
for a bottleconjurer that i am to compress myself
into a quart winemerchants measure and
be corked down i must have ample room
and verge enough a large canvas such as haydon
requires and as rubens required before
him when i pour out nectar for my guests it
must be into
a bowl
large as my capacious soul
it is true i might have contented myself with
merely saying there is no portrait my venerable
friend and the benevolent reader would have
been satisfied with the information while at the
same time he wished there had been one and perhaps
involuntarily sighed at thinking there was
not but i have duties to perform first to the
memory my most dear philosopher and friend 
secondly to myself thirdly to posterity which
in this matter i cannot conscientiously prefer
either to myself or my friend fourthly to the
benevolent reader who delighteth in this 
and consequently loveth me therefore and whom
therefore i love though notwithstanding here is
love for love between us we know not each other
now and never shall fourthly i say to the benevolent
reader or rather readers utrinque generis
and fifthly to the public for the time being
england expects every man to do his duty 
and england's expectation would not be disappointed
if every englishman were to perform
his as faithfully and fully as i will do mine
mark me reader it is only my duties to
england and to the parties abovementioned
that i speak other duties i am accountable for
elsewhere god forbid that i should ever speak
 them in this strain or ever think them
otherwise than in humility and fear

may use other recreations employing on them
our ears and eyes our hands and feet our other
instruments sense and motion why may we
not as well to them accommodate our organs

those more reasonable since they are performed

gentlemen you have made me break the word

this chapter with the intention showing to the
reader's entire satisfaction why the question which
was not asked ought to be answered and now
another chapter must be appropriated to that
matter many things happen between the cup
and the lip and between the beginning a chapter
and the conclusion thereof
orlando innamorato
chapter lxi
wherein the question is answered which ought
to have been asked
autant tu penna et calamaio
ch io ho tra mano una materia asciutta
mattio frances
wherefore there is no portrait my excellent
friend is a question which ought to be answered
because the solution will exhibit something 
what in the words the old drinking song he
used to call his poor way thinking and
it is a question which may well be asked seeing
that in the circle wherein he moved there were
some persons liberal habits and feelings as well
as liberal fortune who enjoyed his peculiarities
placed the fullest reliance upon his professional
skill appreciated most highly his moral and intellectual
character and were indeed personally
attached to him in no ordinary degree
for another reason also ought this question to
be resolved a reason which whatever the reader
may think has the more weight with me because
it nearly concerns myself there is indeed
says the philosopher pemberton a near relation
between seriousness and wisdom and one is
a most excellent friend to the other a man 
a serious sedate and considerate temper as he
is always in a ready disposition for meditation
the best improvement both knowledge and
manners so he thinks without disturbance enters
not upon another notion till he is master the
first and so makes clean work with it whereas
a man a loose volatile and shattered humour
thinks only by fits and starts now and then in a
morning interval when the serious mood comes
upon him and even then too let but the least
trifle cross his way and his desultorious fancy
presently takes the scent leaves the unfinished
and halfmangled notion and skips away in pursuit
 the new game reader it must be my
care not to come under this condemnation and
therefore i must follow to the the subject
which is before me quare autem nobis dickens
videtur ne tenere secuti auteur et brewster
dicendum ne in hujusmodi rebus duties
quam ratio prcecipiendi posture commoner
mr copley netherhall was particularly desirous
 possessing this somuchbyusnowde
liberated likeness and would have invited an
artist from london if the doctor could have
been prevailed upon to sit for it but to this no
persuasions could induce him he never assigned
a reason for this determination and indeed always
evaded the subject when it was introduced letting
it at the same time plainly be perceived that he
was averse to it and wished not to be so pressed
as to draw from him a direct refusal but once
when the desire had been urged with some seriousness
he replied that he was the last his
race and if he were to be the first who had his
portrait taken well might they who looked at it
exclaim with solomon vanity vanities 
in that thought indeed it was that the root 
his objection lay pauli in domo praeter se
cicero
vol ii l
nemo severest is one the most melancholy
reflections to which paulus jsmilius gave utterance
in that speech his which is recorded by
livy the speedy extinction his family in
his own person was often in the doctor's mind 
and he would sometimes touch upon it when in
his moods autumnal feeling he was conversing
with those persons whom he had received into
his heart hearts unworthy as i was it was
my privilege and happiness to be one them 
and at such times his deepest feelings could not
have been expressed more unreservedly if he had
given them utterance in poetry or in prayer
blest as he had been in all other things to the
extent his wishes it would be unreasonable in
him he said to look upon this as a misfortune 
so to repine would indicate little sense gratitude
to that bountiful providence which had so
eminently favored him little also religious
acquiescence in its will it was not by any sore
calamity nor series afflictions that the extinction
 his family had been brought on the diminution
had been gradual as if to show that their uses upon
earth were done his grandfather had only had
two children his parents but one and that one
was now ultima quorum they had ever been
a family in good repute walking inoffensively
towards all men uprightly with their neighbours
and humbly with their god and perhaps this
extinction was their reward for what solon
said individuals that no one could truly be
called happy till his life had terminated in a
happy death holds equally true families
perhaps too this timely extinction was ordained
in mercy to avert consequences which might else
so probably have arisen from his forsaking the
station in which he was born a lowly but safe
station exposed to fewer dangers trials or temptations
than any other in this age or country
with which he was enabled to compare it the
sentiment with which sanazzaro concludes his
arcadia was often in his mind not as derived
from that famous author but selforiginated

removed him from that station he would not
say unwisely for his father was a wise and goodman
if ever man deserved to be so called and
he could not say unhappily for assuredly he
knew that all the blessings which had earnestly
been prayed for had attended the determination
through that blessing he had obtained the whole
benefit which his father desired for him and had
escaped evils which perhaps had not been fully
apprehended his intellectual part had received
all the improvement which it was capable and

process nor had his faith been shaken but stood

society and solitude to act upon them which had
imbued his heart betimes and impressed upon his
youthful mind a character that no after circumstances
could corrupt they must inevitably
have been exposed to more danger and could not
have been so well armed against it that consideration
reconciled him to being childless god

chapter lxii
in which is related the discovery a certain
portrait at doncaster
call in the barber if the tale be long
he'll cut it short i trust middleton
here i must relate a circumstance which occurred
during the few hours my last and by
me evertoberemembered visit to doncaster
as we were on the way from the old angel inn
to the mansion house adjoining which stood or
to speak more accurately had stood the keble
to which the steps my pilgrimage were bent
we were attracted by a small but picturesque
groupe in a shavingshop exhibited in strong
relief by the light a blazing fire and some
glaring lamps it was late in autumn and on a
saturday evening at which time those persons in
humble life who cannot shave themselves and
whose sense religion leads them to think that
what may be done on the saturday night ought
not to be put off till the sunday morning settle
their weekly account with their beards there
was not story enough in the scene to have supplied
wilkie with a subject for his admirable genius
to work upon but he would certainly have
sketched the groupe if he had seen it as we did
stopping for a minute at civil distance from the
door we observed a picture over the fireplace
and it seemed so remarkable that we asked permission
to go in and look at it more nearly it
was an unfinished portrait evidently no common
person and by no common hand and as
evidently it had been painted many years ago
the head was so nearly finished that nothing
seemed wanting to complete the likeness the
breast and shoulders were faintly sketched in a
sort whitewash which gave them the appearance
 being covered with a cloth upon
asking the master the shop if he could tellus
whose portrait it was marino who seemed
to be a goodnatured fellow and was pleased
at our making the enquiry replied that it had
been in his possession many years before he knew
himself a friend his had made him a present
 it because he said the gentleman looked by
his dress as if he was just ready to be shaved and
had an apron under his chin and therefore his
shop was the properest place for it one day
however the picture attracted the notice a
passing stranger as it had done ours and he recognized
it for a portrait garrick it certainly
was so and any one who knows garrick's face
may satisfy himself this when he happens to be
in doncaster marino's shop is not far from
the old angel and on the same side the
street
my companion told me that when we entered
the shop he had begun to hope it might prove to
be a portrait my old friend he seemed even
to be disappointed that we had not fallen upon
such a discovery supposing that it would have
gratified me beyond measure but upon considering
in my own mind if this would have been
the case two questions presented themselves
the first was whether knowing as i did that the
doctor never sate for his portrait and knowing
also confidentially the reason why he never could
be persuaded to do so or rather the feeling which
possessed him on that subject knowing these
things i say the first question was whether if a
stolen likeness had been discovered i ought to
have rejoiced in the discovery for as i certainly
should have endeavoured to purchase the
picture i should then have had to decide whether
or not it was my duty to destroy it for which
or on the other hand for preserving it so many
strong reasons and so many refined ones might
have been produced pro and con that i could
not have done either one or the other without
distrusting the justice my own determination 
if i preserved it i should continually be selfaccused
for doing wrong if i destroyed it selfreproaches
would pursue me for having done
what was irretrievable so that while i lived i
should never have been out my own court 
conscience and let me tell you reader that
to be impleaded in that court is even worse than
being brought into the court chancery
l 
secondly the more curious question occurred
whether if there had been a portrait dr dove
it would have been like him
that says mr everydayman is as it
might happen
pardon me sir my question does not regard
happening chance has nothing to do with the
matter the thing queried is whether it could
or could not have been
and before i proceed to consider that question
i shall take the counsel which catwg the wise
gave to his pupil taliesin and which by these
presents i recommend to every reader who maybe
disposed to consider himself for the time being
as mine 
think before thou speaks 
first what thou shalt speak 
secondly why thou shouldst speak 
thirdly to whom thou mayest have to
speak 
fourthly about whom or what thou
art to speak 
fifthly what will come from what thou
mayest speak 
sixthly what may be the benefit from
what thou shalt speak 
seventhly who may be listening to what
thou shalt speak
put thy word on thy fingers ends before thou
speaks it and turn it these seven ways before
thou speaks it and there will never come any
harm from what thou shalt say 
catwg the wise delivered this counsel to
taliesin chief bards in giving him his
blessing
chapter lxiii
a discussion concerning the question last
proposed
quest e bene un de piu profound pass
che noi habbiamo ancona oggi testator 
e non e mica da domini bassi
agnolo firenzuola
good and satisfactory likenesses may beyond all
doubt be taken mr everydayman himself
and indeed most persons and were it otherwise
portraitpainting would be a worse profession
than it is though too many an unfortunate
artist has reason bitterly to regret that he possessed
the talents which tempted him to engage
in it there are few faces which even a mediocre
painter cannot produce what is called a
staring likeness and sir thomas lawrence a
handsome one sir thomas is the painter who
pleases every body 
but there are some few faces with which no
artist can succeed so as to please himself if he
has a true feeling for his own art or to content
those persons who are best acquainted with the
living countenance this is the case where the
character predominates over the features and
that character itself is one in which many and
seemingly opposite qualities are compounded
garrick in abel drugget garrick in sir john
brute and garrick in king lear presented three
faces as different as were the parts which he personated
 yet the portraits which have been published
 him in those parts may be identified by
the same marked features which flexible as they
were rendered by his histrionic power still under
all changes retained their strength and their peculiarity
but where the same flexibility exists
and the features are not eo peculiar or prominent
the character is then given by what is fleeting
not by what is fixed and it is more difficult to
hit a likeness this kind than to paint a rainbow
now i cannot but think that the doctor's
countenance was this kind i can call it to
mind as vividly as it appears to me in dreams 
but i could impart no notion it by description
words cannot delineate a single feature his
face such words at least as my knowledge enables
me to use a sculptor if he had measured
it might have given you technically the relative
proportions his face in all its parts a painter
might describe the facial angle and how the eyes
were set and if they were wellslit and how the
lips were formed and whether the chin was in
the just mean between rueful length and spectators
brevity and whether he could have passed
over strasbourg bridge without hearing any observations
made upon his nose my own opinion
is that the sentinel would have had something to
say upon that subject and if he had been a protestant
soldier which if an alsatia he was
likely to be and accustomed to read the bible
he might have been reminded by it the tower
 lebanon looking toward damascus for as
an italian poet says
in prospective
ne nostra un barbican sforacchiato
mattio frances
i might venture also to apply to the doctor's
nose that safe generality by which alcina's is described
in the orlando furioso
quince il maso per mezzo il visa scene
che non trova f india ove amende
but farther than this which amounts to no
more than a doubtful opinion and a faint adumbration
i can say nothing that would assist any
reader to form an idea at once definite and just
 any part the doctor's face i cannot even
positively say what was the colour his eyes i
only know that mirth sparkled in them scorn
flashed from them thought beamed in them benevolence
glistened in them that they were easily
moved to smiles easily to tears no barometer
ever indicated more faithfully the changes the
atmosphere than his countenance corresponded to
the emotions his mind but with a mind which
might truly be said to have been
so various that it seemed to be
not one but all mankind's epitome
thus various not in its principles or passions or
pursuits but in its enquiries and fancies and speculations
and so alert that nothing seemed to
escape its ever watchful and active apprehension
with such a mind the countenance that was its
faithful index was perpetually varying its likeness
therefore at any one moment could but represent
a fraction the character which identified
it and which left upon you an indescribable
and inimitable impression resulting from its totality
though in its totality it never was and
never could be seen
have i made myself understood 
i mean to say that the ideal face any one to
whom we are strongly and tenderly attached
that face which is enshrined in our heart hearts
and which comes to us in dreams long after it
has smouldered in the grave that face is not the
exact mechanical countenance the beloved person
not the countenance that we ever actually
behold but its abstract its idealization or rather
its realization the spirit the countenance its
essence and its life and the finer the character
and the more various its intellectual powers the
more must this true tt'swxov differ from the most
faithful likeness that a painter or a sculptor can
produce
therefore i conclude that if there had been a
portrait dr daniel dove it could not have
been like him for it was as impossible to paint
the character which constituted the identity his
countenance as to paint the flavour an apple
or the fragrance a rose

the reader will mistake me greatly if he supposes
that in showing why it was impossible there
should be a good portrait dr daniel dove i
meant to depreciate the art portrait painting
i have a very high respect for that art and no
person can be more sincerely persuaded its
moral uses the great number portraits in
the annual exhibitions our royal academy is
so far from displeasing me that i have always regarded
it as a symptom wholesome feeling in the
nation an unequivocal proof that the domestic
and social affections are still existing among us
in their proper strength and cherished as they
ought to be and w r hen i have heard at anytime
observations the wouldbes witty kind
upon the vanity those who allow their portraits
thus to be hung up for public view i have generally
perceived that the remark implied a much
greater degree conceit in the speaker as for
allowing the portrait to be exhibited that is no
more than an act justice to the artist who has
no other means making his abilities known so
well and forwarding himself in his profession
if we look round the rooms at somerset house
and observe how large a proportion the portraits
represent children the old and persons in
middle life we shall see that very few indeed are
those which can have been painted or exhibited
for the gratification personal vanity
sir thomas lawrence ministers largely to selfadmiration
 and yet a few years ripen even the
most flattering his portraits into moral pictures

helen in her old age looking at herself in a
mirror is a subject which old sonneteers were
fond borrowing from the greek anthology
young ladies you who have sate to sir thomas
or any artist his school i will tell you
how your portraits may be rendered more useful
monitors to you in your progress through life
than the mirror was to helen and how you may
derive more satisfaction from them when you are
grown old without supposing that you actually
called up a look for the painter's use i maybe
certain that none you during the times 
sitting permitted any feeling ill humour to casta
shade over your countenance and that if you
were not conscious endeavouring to put on
your best looks for the occasion the painter was
desirous catching them and would catch the
best he could the most thoughtless you
need not be told that you cannot retain the charms

 youthful beauty but you may retain the
charm an amiable expression through life 
never allow yourselves to be seen with a worse
than you wore for the painter whenever you
feel illtempered remember that you look ugly 
and be assured that every emotion fretfulness
 illhumour anger irritability impatience
 pride haughtiness envy or malice any
unkind any uncharitable any ungenerous feeling
lessens the likeness to your picture and not only
deforms you while it lasts but leaves its trace
behind for the effect the passions upon the
face is more rapid and more certain than that 
time
his counsel says william the pursuivant
was very behoveful who advised all gentlewomen
often to look on glasses that so if they saw
themselves beautiful they might be stirred upto
make their minds as fair by virtue as their faces
were by nature but if deformed they might
make amends for their outward deformity with
their intern pulchritude and gracious qualities
and those that are proud their beauty should
consider that their own hue is as brittle as the
glass wherein they see it and that they carry on
their shoulders nothing but a skull wrapt in skin
which one day will be loathsome to be looked on
the conclusion this passage accorded not
with the doctor's feelings he thought that
whatever tended to connect frightful and loathsome
associations with the solemn and wholesome
contemplation mortality ought to be avoided
as injudicious and injurious so too with regard
to age if it is dark and unlovely the fault he
used to say is generally our own nature may
indeed make it an object compassion but not
 dislike unless we ourselves render it so it is
not necessity that we grow ugly as well as old
donne says
no spring nor summer's beauty hath such grace
as i have seen in one autumnal face

 time that beauty depends upon the mind
upon the temper young ladies upon yourselves

george wither wrote under the best his
portraits
what i was is passed by 
what i am away doth fly 
what i shall be none do see 
yet in that my beauties be
he commenced also a meditation upon that
portrait in these impressive lines 
when i behold my picture and perceive
how vain it is our portraiture to leave
in lines and shadows which make shews today
 that which will tomorrow fade away
and think what mean resemblances at best
are by mechanic instruments exprest
i thought it better much to leave behind me
some draught in which my living friends might find me
the same i am in that which will remain
till all is ruined and repaired again
in the same poem he says
a picture though with most exactness made
js nothing but the shadow a shade
for even our living bodies though they seem
to others more or more in our esteem
are but the shadow that real beingwhich
doth extend beyond the fleshly seeing
and cannot be discerned until we rise
immortal objects for immortal eyes

more selfish was tolerably successful in deceiving
himself as to his own motives and state mind

melancholy and more awful thoughts than the

which his meditation was composed

forming as it were the idiosyncrasy his moral
constitution contributed in no small degree to
those evervarying lights and shades character

such then as daniel dove was in the twentysixth
year his age we are now to consider him
settled at doncaster and with his way life
chosen for better for worse in all respects except
as my female readers will remember that
he was neither married nor engaged nor likely
to be so
one the things for which he used to thank
god was that the world had not been all before
him where to chuse either as to calling or place
but that both had been well chosen for him to
chuse upon such just motives as can leave no
rational cause for after repentance requires riper
judgement than ought to be expected at the age
when the choice is to be made it is best for us
therefore at a time life when though perhaps
we might chuse well it is impossible that we
could chuse wisely to acquiesce in the determination
 others who have knowledge and experience
to direct them far happier are they who
always know what they are to do than they who
have to determine what they will do
sisognafar quel eke si devefare
e non gia tutti quelle che si vole
thus he was accustomed to think upon this
subject
but was he well placed at doncaster 
it matters not where those men are placed who
as south says have souls so dull and stupid as
to serve for little else but to keep their bodies
pananti
from putrefaction ordinary people whether
their lot be cast in town or country in the metropolis
or in a village will go on in the ordinary
way conforming their habits to those the place
it matters nothing more to those who live less in
the little world about them than in a world 
their own with the whole powers the head
and the heart too if they have one intently
fixed upon some favourite pursuit if they have
a heart i say for it sometimes happens that where
there is an excellent head the heart is nothing
more than a piece hard flesh in this respect
the highest and the meanest intellects are in a
certain sense alike selfsufficient that is they are
so far independent adventitious aid that they
derive little advantage from society and suffer
nothing from the want it but there are others
for whose mental improvement or at least mental
enjoyment collision and sympathy and external excitement
seem almost indispensable just as large
towns are the only places in which firstrate workmen
in any handicraft business can find employment
so men letters and science generally
appear to think that no where but in a metropolis
can they find the opportunities which they desire
 improvement or display these persons
are wise in their generation but they are not
children light
among such persons it may perhaps be thought
that our friend should be classed and it cannot
be doubted that in a more conspicuous field 
action he might have distinguished himself and
obtained a splendid fortune but for distinction
he never entertained the slightest desire and with
the goods fortune which had fallen to his share
he was perfectly contented but was he favourably
situated for his intellectual advancement 
which if such an enquiry had come before him
concerning any other person is what he would have
considered to be the questionisthmus i answer
without the slightest hesitation that he was
in london he might have mounted a physician's
wig have ridden in his carriage have attained
the honours the college and added
f r s to his professional initials he might
if fortune opening her eyes had chosen to favour
desert have become sir daniel dove bart physician
to his majesty but he would then have
been a very different person from the dr dove
 doncaster whose memory will be transmitted
to posterity in these volumes and he would have
been much less worthy being remembered
the course such a life would have left him no
leisure for himself and metropolitan society in
rubbing off the singularities his character
would just in the same degree have taken from
its strength
it is a pretty general opinion that no society
can be so bad as that a small country town 
and certain it is that such towns offer little or no
choice you must take what they have and
make the best it but there are not many
persons to whom circumstances allow much latitude
 choice any where except in those public
places as they are called where the idle and the
dissipated like birds a feather flock together
in any settled place residence men are circumscribed
by station and opportunities and just as
much in the capital as in a provincial town no
one will be disposed to regret this if he observes
where men have most power chusing their
society how little benefit is derived from it orin
other words with how little wisdom it is
used
after all the common varieties human character
will be found distributed in much the same
proportion everywhere and in most places there
will be a sprinkling the uncommon ones
everywhere you may find the selfish and the
sensual the carling and the careful the cunning
and the credulous the worldling and the reckless
but kind hearts are also every where to be found
right intentions sober minds and private virtues
for the sake which let us hope that god
may continue to spare this hitherto highlyfavoured
nation notwithstanding the fearful amount
 our public and manifold offences
the society then doncaster in the middle
 the last century was like that any other
country town which was neither the seat manufactures
nor a bishop's see in either 
which more information a peculiar kind would
have been found more active minds or more
cultivated ones there was enough those eccentricities
for which the english above all other
people are remarkable those aberrations intellect
which just fail to constitute legal insanity
and which according to their degree excite
amusement or compassion nor was the town
without its full share talents these there was
little to foster and encourage but happily there
was nothing to pervert and stimulate them to a
premature and mischievous activity
in one respect it more resembled an episcopal
than a trading city the four kings and their
respective suits red and black were not upon
more frequent service in the precincts a cathedral
than in the good town doncaster a
stranger who had been invited to spend the
evening with a family there to which he had been
introduced was asked by the master the house
to take a card as a matter course upon his
replying that he did not play at cards the company
looked at him with astonishment and his
host exclaimed what sir not play at cards 
the lord help you 
i will not say the lord helped daniel dove
because there would be an air irreverence in
the expression the case being one in which he or
any one might help himself he knew enough
 all the games which were then in vogue to
have played at them if he had so thought good 
and he would have been as willing sometimes incertain
moods mind to have taken his seat at
a cardtable in houses where cardplaying did
not form part the regular business life as
to have listened to a tune on the oldfashioned
spinner or the then newfashioned harpsichord
but that which as an occasional pastime he might
have thought harmless and even wholesome
seemed to him something worse than folly when
it was made a killtime the serious occupation
for which people were brought together the
only one at which some them ever appeared to
give themselves the trouble thinking and
seeing its effects upon the temper and how
nearly this habit was connected with a spirit ot
gambling he thought that cards had not without
reason been called the devil's books
i shall not therefore introduce the reader to a
doncaster cardparty by way shewing him
the society the place the mrs shuffles
mrs cuts and miss dealers the mr tittles and
mrs tattles the humdrum and the prateapaces
m 
the fribbles and the peebles the parts and the
prims the littleness and the longtongues the
heavyheads and the broadbelows are to be
found everywhere
it is quite right says one the guessers
at truth that there should be a heavy duty on
cards not only on moral grounds not only because
they act on a social party like a torpedo
silencing the merry voice and numbing the play
 the features not only to still the hunger 
the public purse which reversing the qualities 
fortunatus's is always empty however much
you may put into it but also because every
pack cards is a malicious libel on courts and
on the world seeing that the trumpery with number
one at the head is the best part them 
and that it gives kings and queens no other companions
than knaves

mr copley ethereal society at his house
drummond burgh gray mason miller
the organist and historian doncaster
herschel
all worldly joys go less
to the one joy doing kindnesses
herbert
there was one house in doncaster in which
cards were never introduced this house was
netherhall the seat mr copley and there
dr dove had the advantage such society as
was at that time very rarely and is still not often
to be enjoyed anywhere
the copley are one the most ancient families
in doncaster robert grosseteste one the
most eminent our english churchmen before
the reformation was a branch from their stock
robert copley who in the middle the last
century represented the family was brought up
at westminster school and while there took
what is very unusual for boys at westminster or
any other school to take lessons in music dr
crofts was his master and made him as has been
said by a very competent judge a very good performer
in thoroughbass on the harpsichord
he attempted painting also but not with equal
success the age painting in this country had
not then arrived
mr copley's income never exceeded twelve
hundred ayear but this which is still a liberal
income was then a large one in the hands a
wise and prudent man netherhall was the resort
 intellectual men in whose company he
delighted and the poor were fed daily from his
table drummond afterwards archbishop 
york was his frequent guest so was mason 
so was mason's friend dr burgh and gray has
sometimes been entertained there one the
strong names the king dahomey means
when interpreted wherever i rub i leave
my scent in a better sense than belongs to
this metaphorical boast the power and the
disposition to be terrible it may be said such
men as gray and mason that wherever they have
resided or have been entertained as abiding
guests an odour their memory remains who
passes by the house at streatham that was once
mrs thrace's without thinking dr johnson 
during many years mr copley entertained
himself and his friends with a weekly concert at
netherhall he himself sir brian cooke and
some his family and dr miller the organist
and afterwards historian doncaster
being performers miller who was himself a
remarkable person had the fortune to introduce
a more remarkable one to these concerts it is an
interesting anecdote in the history that person
 miller and doncaster
about the year as miller was dining at
pontefract with the officers the durham militia
one them knowing his love music told
him they had a young german in their band asa
performer on the hautboy who had only been
a few months in england and yet spoke english
almost as well as a native and who was also an
excellent performer on the violin the officer

added that if miller would come into another
room this german should entertain him with a
solo the invitation was gladly accepted and
miller heard a solo guarding's executed in a
manner that surprized him he afterwards took
an opportunity having some private conversation
with the young musician and asked him
whether he had engaged himself for any long
period to the durham militia the answer
was only from month to month leave
them then said the organist and come and
live with me i am a single man and think we
shall be happy together and doubtless your merit
will soon entitle you to a more eligible situation
the offer was accepted as frankly as it was made 
and the reader may imagine with what satisfaction
dr miller must have remembered this act
 generous feeling when he hears that this young
german was herschel the astronomer
my humble mansion says miller consisted
at that time but two rooms however
poor as i was my cottage contained a small
library well chosen books and it must appear
singular that a foreigner who had been so short
a time in england should understand even the
peculiarities the language so well as to fix
upon swift for his favourite author he took
an early opportunity introducing his new
friend at mr copley's concerts the first violin
was resigned to him and never says the organist
had i heard the concertos corelli
geminiani and alison or the overtures handel
performed more chastely or more according
to the original intention the composers than by
mr herschel i soon lost my companion his
fame was presently spread abroad he had the
offer pupils and was solicited to lead the
public concerts both at wakefield and halifax
a new organ for the parish church halifax
was built about this time and herschel was one
 the seven candidates for the organist's place
they drew lots how they were to perform in
succession herschel drew the third the second
fell to mr afterwards dr wainwright manchester
whose finger was so rapid that old
settler the organbuilder ran about the church
exclaiming te level te level he run over te
keys like one cat he will not give my piphcs
room for to speak during mr wainwright's
performance says miller i was standing
in the middle isle with herschel what
chance have you said i to follow this man 
he replied i don't know i am sure fingers
will not do on which he ascended the organ
loft and produced from the organ so uncommon
a fulness such a volume slow solemn harmony
that i could by no means account for the
effect after this short extempore effusion he
finished with the old hundredthpsalmtune
which he played better than his opponent aye
aye cried old settler wish is very good very
good indeed i nil lus wish man for he gives my
pipes room for to speak having afterwards
asked mr herschel by what means in the beginning
 his performance he produced so uncommon
an effect he replied i told you fingers
would not do and producing two pieces lead
from his waistcoat pocket one these said
he i placed on the lowest key the organ
and the other upon the octave above thus by
accommodating the harmony i produced the
effect four hands instead two

chapter lxvii
a mythological story moralized
 faut mettre les fables en presse pour en tirer quelque sue de
verite'i grasse
it is related the great mythological personage
baly that veeshnoo when he dispossessed him 
his impious power allowed him in mitigation 
his lot to make his choice whether he avould goto
the swerga and take five ignorant persons with
him who were to be his everlasting companions
there or to padalon and have five pundits in his
company baly preferred the good company
with the bad quarters
that that which is called good company has led
many a man to a place which it is not considered
decorous to mention before ears polite is a
common and therefore the more an awful truth
the swerga and padalon are the hindoo heaven
and hell and if the hindoo fable were not obviously
intended to extol the merits their pundits
or learned men as the missionary ward explains
the title it might with much seeming likelihood
bear this moral interpretation that baly retained
the pride knowledge even when convinced by
the deprivation his power that the pride 
power was vanity and in consequence drew upon
himself a further punishment by his choice
for although baly because the righteousness
with which he had used his power was so far
favoured by the divinity whom he had offended
that he was not condemned to undergo any 
those torments which there was as rich an assortment
and as choice a variety in padalon as
ever monkish imagination revelled in devising it
was at the best a dreadful place abode and
so it would appear if turner were to paint a picture
 its diamond city from southey description
i say turner because though the subject
might seem more adapted to martin's cast 
mind turner's colouring would well represent the
fiery streams and the sulphureous atmosphere 
and that colouring being transferred from earthly
landscapes to its proper place his rich genius
would have full scope for its appropriate display
baly no doubt as a state prisoner who was to be
treated with the highest consideration as well as
with the utmost indulgence would have all the
accommodations that yamen could afford him
there he and the pundits might
reason high
 providence foreknowledge will and fate
fix'd fate free will foreknowledge absolute
and find no in wandering mazes lost
they might argue there good and evil
 happiness and final misery
passion and apathy and glory and shame 
and such discourses possibly
with a pleasing sorcery might charm
pain for awhile and anguish and excite
fallacious hope or arm the obscured breast
with stubborn patience as with triple steel
but it would only be for awhile that they could
be thus beguiled by it for it is
vain wisdom all and false philosophy 
it would be only for a while and they were therefor
a time which in prospect must appear all but
endless the pundits would not thank him for
bringing them there baly himself must continually
wish he were breathing the heavenly air
 the swerga in the company ignorant but
happy associates and he would regret his unwise
choice even more bitterly than he remembered
the glorious city wherein he had reigned in his
magnificence
he made a great mistake if he had gone
with the ignorant to heaven he would have seen
them happy there and partaken their happiness
though they might not have been able to derive
any gratification from his wisdom which said
wisdom peradventure he himself when he was
there might have discovered to be but foolishness
it is only in the company the good that real
enjoyment is to be found any other society is
hollow and heartless you may be excited by
the play wit by the collision ambitious
spirits and by the brilliant exhibition selfconfident
power but the satisfaction ends with the
scene far unlike this is the quiet confiding intercourse
 sincere minds and friendly hearts knowing
and loving and esteeming each other and such
intercourse our philosopher enjoyed in doncaster
edward miller the organist was a person very
much after daniel dove's own heart he was a
warmhearted simplehearted righthearted man 
an enthusiast in his profession yet not undervaluing
much less despising other pursuits
the one doctor knew as little music as the
other did medicine but dr dove listened to
miller's performance with great pleasure and
dr miller when he was indisposed took dove's
physic with perfect faith
this musician was brother to william miller
the bookseller well known in the early part 
the present century as a publisher splendid
works to whose flourishing business in albemarle
street the more flourishing john murray succeeded
in the worldly sense the word the
musician was far less fortunate than the bibliopole
a doctorate in his own science being the height
 the honours to which he attained and the place
 organist at doncaster the height the preferment
a higher station was once presented
to his hopes the marquis rockingham applied
in his behalf for the place master his
majesty's band musicians then vacated by the
death dr boyce and the duke manchester
who was at that time lord chamberlain
would have given it him if the king had not particularly
desired him to bestow it on mr stanley
the celebrated blind performer on the organ dr
miller was more gratified by this proof the
marquis's good will towards him than disappointed
at its failure had the application succeeded
he would not have written the history 
doncaster nor would he have borne a part in a
wellintended and judicious attempt at reforming
our church psalmody in which part our church
service reformation is greatly needed this meritorious
attempt was made when george hay
drummond whose father had been archbishop
 york was vicar doncaster having been
presented to that vicarage in on the demise
 mr hatfield
at that time the parish clerk used there as in
all other parish churches to chuse what psalm
should be sung to the praise and glory god
and what portions it and considering himself
as a much more important person in this department
 his office than the organist the only
communication upon the subject which he held
with dr miller was to let him know what tune
he must play and how often he was to repeat it
strange absurdity says miller how could
the organist placed in this degrading situation
properly perform his part the church service 
not knowing the words it was impossible for him
to accommodate his music to the various sentiments
contained in different stanzas consequently
his must be a mere random performance and
frequently producing improper effects this
however is what only a musician would feel but
it happened one sunday that the clerk gave out
some verses which were either ridiculously inapplicable
to the day or bore some accidental and
ludicrous application so that many the congregation
did not refrain from laughter mr drummond
upon this for he was zealously attentive to
all the duties his calling said to miller that
in order to prevent any such occurrence in future
he would make a selection the best verses in
each psalm from the authorized version tate
and brady and arrange them for every sunday
and festival throughout the year provided he
the organist who was perfectly qualified for such
a task would adapt them to proper music to
such a man as miller this was the greatest gratification
that could have been afforded and it
proved also to be the greatest service that was
ever rendered to him in the course his life 
for through mr drummond's interest the king
and the bishop patronized the work and nearly
five thousand copies were subscribed for the list
 subscribers being it is believed longer than
had ever been obtained for any musical publication
in this kingdom
strange to say nothing this kind had been
attempted before for the use psalmody in our
churches was originally no part the service 
but having as it were crept in and been at first
rather suffered than encouraged and afterwards
allowed and permitted only not enjoined no
provision seems ever to have been made for its
proper or even decent performance and when
an arrangement like this mr drummond's had
been prepared and dr miller with sound judgement
had adapted it where that could be done
to the most popular the old and venerable
melodies which had been so long in possession it
may seem more strange that it should not have
been brought into general use this i say might
be thought strange if any instance that supine
and sinful negligence which permits the continuance
 old and acknowledged defects in the
church establishment and church service could
be thought so
mr drummond had probably been led to
think upon this subject by mason's conversation
and by his essays historical and critical on english
church music mason who had a poet's
ear and eye was ambitious becoming both a
musician and a painter according to miller he
succeeded better in his musical than in his pictorial
attempts for he performed decently on the
harpsichord but in painting he never arrived
even at a degree mediocrity and in music it
was not possible to teach him the principles 
composition miller and others having at his own
desire attempted in vain to instruct him nevervol
ii n
tireless such a man however superficial his knowledge
 the art could not but feel and reason justly
upon its use and abuse in our church service 
and he was for restricting the organist much in the
same way that drummond and miller were for restraining
the clerk for after observing that what
is called the voluntary requires an innate inventive
faculty which is certainly not the lot many 
and that the happy few who possess it will not
at all times be able to restrain it within the
bounds which reason and in this case religion
would prescribe he said it was to be wished
therefore that in our established church extempore
playing were as much discountenanced as
extempore praying and that the organist were
as closely obliged in this solo and separate part 
his office to keep to set forms as the officiating
minister or as he himself is when accompanying
the choir in an anthem or a parochial congregation
in a psalm he would have indulged him
however with a considerable quantity these set
forms and have allowed him if he approached in
some degree to rousseau's high character a
prelude to descant on certain single grave
texts which martini geminiani corelli or handel
would abundantly furnish and which may be
found at least equal elegance and propriety in
the largo and adagio movements haydn or
pleyel
whatever miller may have thought this
proposal there was a passage in mason's essay
in favour voluntaries which was in perfect accord
with dr doves notions prompt and as
it were casual strains says the poet which do
not fix the attention the hearer provided they
are the produce an original fancy which scorns
to debase itself by imitating common and trivial
melodies are all others the best adapted to
induce mental serenity we in some sort listen
to such music as we do to the pleasing murmur
 a neighbouring brook the whisper the passing
breeze or the distant warbling the lark
and nightingale and if agreeable natural voices
have the power soothing the contemplative
mind without interrupting its contemplations
simple musical effusions must assuredly have that
power in a superior degree all that is to be
attended to by the organist is to preserve such
pleasing simplicity and this musical measures
will ever have if they are neither strongly accented
nor too regularly rhythmical but when
this is the case they cease to soothe us because
they begin to affect us add to this that an air
replete with short cadences and similar passages
is apt to fix itself too strongly on the memory 
whereas a merely melodious or harmonica movement
glides as it were through the ear awakens
a transient pleasing sensation but leaves behind
it no lasting impression its effect ceases when
its impulse on the auditory nerve ceases an impulse
strong enough to dispel from the mind all
eating care to use our great poet's own expression
but in no sort to rouze or ruffle any its
faculties save those only which attend truly devotional
duty
this passage agreed with some the doctor's
peculiar notions he felt the power devotional
music both in such preparatory strains as
mason has here described and in the more exciting
emotions congregational psalmody and
being thus sensible the religious uses which
may be drawn from music he was the more easily
led to entertain certain speculations concerning
its application in the treatment diseases as will
be related hereafter

eccentric persons why apparently more common
in england than in other countries
harry single
blest are those
whose blood and judgement are so well commingled
that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
to sound what stop she please
hamlet
there is a reason why eccentricity character
seems to be much more frequent in england
than in other countries
here some reflective reader methinks interrupts
me with seems good author 
aye and it is 
have patience good reader and hear me to the
 there is a reason why it seems so and the
reason is because all such eccentricities are recorded
here in newspapers and magazines so
that none them are lost and the most remarkable
are brought forward from time to time in
popular compilations a collection what is
called eccentric biography is to form a portion
 mr murray's family library
but eccentric characters probably are more frequent
among us than among most other nations 
and for this there are two causes the first is to
be found in that spirit independence upon
which the english pride themselves and which
produces a sort drawcansirlike bravery in
men who are eccentrically inclined it becomes
a perverse sort pleasure in them to act preposterously
for the sake showing that they have a
right to do as they please and the courage to exercise
that right let the rest the world think
what it will their conduct
the other reason is that madhouses very insufficiently
supply the place convents and very
ill also it might almost be questioned whether
convents do not well nigh make amends to humanity
for their manifold mischiefs and abominations
by the relief which they afford as asylums
for insanity in so many its forms and gradations
they afford a cure also in many its
stages and precisely upon the same principle on
which the treatment in madhouses is founded 
but oh how differently is that principle applied 
that passive obedience to anothers will which in
the one case is exacted by authority acting through
fear and oftentimes enforced by no scrupulous or
tender means is in the other required as a religious
duty an act virtue a voluntary and accepted
sacrifice a good work which will be carried to
the patient's account in the world to come they
who enter a convent are to have no will their
own there they renounce it solemnly upon their
admission and when this abnegation is sincerely
made the chief mental cause insanity is removed
for assuredly in most cases madness is
more frequently a disease the will than the
intellect when diabolic appeared before the
town manful and made his oration to the
citizens at eargate lord willbewill was one
 the first that was for consenting to his words
and letting him into the town
we have no such asylums in which madness
and fatuity receive every possible alleviation
while they are at the same time subjected to the
continual restraint which their condition requires
they are wanted also for repentant sinners who
when they are awakened to a sense their folly
and their guilt and their danger would fain find
a place religious retirement wherein they might
pass the remainder their days in preparing for
death lord goring the most profligate man 
his age who by his profligacy as much as by his
frequent misconduct rendered irreparable injury
to the cause which he intended to serve retired
to spain after the ruin that cause and there
ended his days as a dominican friar if there
be any record him in the chronicles the
order the account ought to be curious at least
if not edifying but it is rather for his own sake
to be hoped than supposed that he did not hate
and despise the follies and the frauds the fraternity
into which he had entered more heartily
than the pomps and vanities the world which
he had left
on the other hand wherever convents are among
the institutions the land not to speak those
poor creatures who are thrust into them against
their will or with only a mockery freedom in the
choice it must often happen that persons enter
them in some fit disappointment or resentment
or grief and find themselves when the first bitterness
 passion is past imprisoned for life by
their own rash but irremediable act and deed
the woman who when untoward circumstances
have prevented her from marrying the man she
loves marries one for whom she has no affectionis
more likely poor as her chance is to find contentment
and perhaps happiness than if for the
same cause she had thrown herself into a nunnery
yet this latter is the course to which if
she were a roman catholic her thoughts would
perhaps preferably at first have turned and to
which they would probably be directed by her
confessor
men who are weary the ways the world
or disgusted with them have more licence as
well as more resources than women if they do
not enter upon some dangerous path duty or
commence wanderers they may chuse for themselves
an eccentric path in which if their habits
are not such as expose them to insult or if their
means are sufficient to secure them against it they
are not likely to be molested provided they have
no relations whose interest it may be to apply fora
statute lunacy against them

to obtain but discovering with the preacher
that this was vanity and vexation spirit when
it was either too late for him to enter upon domestic
life or his habits had unfitted him for it
he retired to his estate which with the house upon
it he had let to a farmer in that house he occupied
two rooms and there indulged his humour
as he had done in london though it had now
taken a very different direction

the change in bingley's life was as great and
sudden as that which the anatomist melancholy
has here described but it led to no bodily disease
nor to any tangible malady his property was
worth about fourteen hundred a year he kept
no servant and no company and he lived upon
watergruel and celery except at harvest time
when he regaled himself with sparrow pies made
 the young birds just fledged for which he
paid the poor inhabitants who caught them twopence
a head probably he supposed that it was
rendering the neighbourhood a service thus to rid
it what he considered both a nuisance and a
delicacy this was his only luxury and his
only business was to collect about a dozen boys
and girls on sundays and hear them say their
catechism and read a chapter in the new testament
for which they received remuneration in
the intelligible form two pence each but at the
feasts and statutes most sweet guerdon better
than remuneration in the shape sixpence
he stood godfather for several poor people's children
they were baptized by his surname when
they were proper age he used to put them out
as apprentices and in his will he left each them
an hundred guineas to be paid when they reached
the age twentyfive if they were married but
not till they married and if they reached the age
 fifty without marrying the legacy was then
forfeited there were two children for whom he
stood godfather but whose parents did not chuse
that they should be named after him he never
took any notice these children nor did he bequeath
them any thing but to one the others
he left the greater part his property
this man used every week day to lock himself
in the church and pace the aisles for two hours
from ten till twelve o'clock an author who
in his own peculiar and admirable way is one
 the most affecting writers any age or country
has described with characteristic feeling the
different effects produced upon certain minds
by entering an empty or a crowded church in
the latter he says it is chance but some present
human frailty an act inattention on the
part some the auditory or a trait affectation
or worse vainglory on that the preacher
puts us by our best thoughts disharmonizing
the place and the occasion but wouldst thou
know the beauty holiness go alone on some
week day borrowing the keys good master
sexton traverse the cool aisles some country
church think the piety that has kneeled
there the congregations old and young that
have found consolation there the meek pastor

emotions no cross conflicting comparisons drink

effigies that kneel and weep around thee 
harry bingley died in lodgings at rotherham
whither he had removed when he felt himself
ill that he might save expence by being
nearer a physician according to his own directions
his body was brought back from thence to
the village and interred in the churchyard and
he strictly enjoined that no breastplate handles
or any ornaments whatever should be affixed to
his coffin nor any gravestone placed to mark the
spot where his remains were deposited
would or would not this godfathergeneral
have been happier in a convent or a hermitage
than he was in thus following his own humour 
it was dr dove's opinion that upon the whole he
would not that a conventual and still less an
recital way life would have been more rational
but because there would have been a worthier
motive for chusing it and if not a more
reasonable hope at least a firmer persuasion that
it was the sure way to salvation
the last essays elia
that harry bingley's mind had taken a religious
turn appeared by his chusing the church
for his daily place promenade meditation
must have been as much his object as exercise
and a kind which the place invited it appeared
also by the sort sundayschooling
which he gave the children long before sunday
schools whether for good or evil were instituted
or as the phrase is invented by robert
raises eccentric memory patrons and patronesses
 sunday schools be not offended if a
doubt concerning their utility be here implied 
the doctor entertained such a doubt and the
why and the wherefore shall in due time be
fairly stated but bingley certainly came under
the description a humorist rather than a
devotee or religious enthusiast in fact he bore
that character and the doctor's knowledge 
human nature led him to conclude that solitary
humorist are far from being happy you
see them as you see the blind at their happiest
times when they have something to divert their
thoughts but in the humorist's course 
life there is a sort defiance the world and
the world's law indeed any man who departs
widely from its usages avows this and it is as
it ought to be an uneasy and uncomfortable feeling
wherever it is not sustained by a high state
 excitement and that state if it be lasting
becomes madness such persons when left to
themselves and to their own reflections as they
necessarily are for the greater part their time
must often stand not only selfarraigned for folly
but selfcondemned for it

there was another person within his circuit
who had taken umbrage at the world and withdrawn
from it to enjoy or rather solace himself
according to his own humour in retirement not
in solitude for he had a sister who with true
sisterly affection accommodated herself to his inclinations
and partook his taste this gentleman
whose name was jonathan stanford
had taken out a patent for a ploughing machine
and had been deprived unjustly as he deemed
 the profits which he had expected from it by
a lawsuit upon this real disappointment aggravated
by the sense whether well or ill founded 
injustice he retired to his mansion in the village
 purbeck about ten miles south doncaster
and there discarding all thoughts mechanics
which had been his favourite pursuit he devoted
himself to the practice music devoted is not
too strong an expression he had passed the
middle his life before the doctor knew him 
frederick
and it was not till some twenty years later that
miller became acquainted with him
i was introduced says the organist into
a room where was sitting a thin old gentleman
upwards seventy years age playing on the
violin he had a long time lived sequestered
from the world and dedicated not less than eight
hours a day to the practice music his shrunk
shanks were twisted in a peculiar form by the
constant posture in which he sate and so indifferent
was he about the goodness his instrument
that to my astonishment he always played
on a common dutch fiddle the original price 
which could not be more than half a guinea the
strings were bad and the whole instrument dirty
and covered with resin with this humble companion
he used to work hard every morning on
the old solos vivaldi tessarini corelli and
other ancient composers the evening was reserved
for mere amusement in accompanying an
ancient sister who sung most the favourite
songs from handel's old italian operas which
he composed soon after his arrival in england
these operas she had heard on their first representation
in london consequently her performance
was to me an uncommon treat i had an
opportunity comparing the different manner 
singing in the beginning the century to that
which i had been accustomed to hear and indeed
the style was so different that musically
considered it might truly be called a different
language none the present embellishments or
graces in music were used no appoggiatura
no unadorned sustaining or swelling long notes 
they were warbled by a continual tremulous accent
from beginning to and when she arrived
at the period an air the brother's violin
became mute and she raising her eyes to the
top the room and stretching out her throat
executed her extempore cadence in a succession
 notes perfectly original and concluded with a
long shake something like the bleating a
lamb
miller's feelings during this visit were so wholly
professional that in describing this brother and
sister forty years afterwards he appears not to
have been sensible in how affecting a situation
they were placed crabbe would have treated
these characters finely had they fallen in his way
and so chance hare townshend could treat
them who has imitated crabbe with such singular
skill and who has moreover music in his soul
and could give the picture the soft touches which
it requires
i must not omit to say that mr stanford and
his sister were benevolent hospitable sensible
worthy persons thickest thou reader that they
gave no proof good sense in thus passing their
lives look round the circle thine acquaintance
and ask thyself how many those whose
time is at their own disposal dispose it more
wisely that is to say more beneficially to others
or more satisfactorily to themselves the sister
fulfilled her proper duties in her proper place
and the brother in contributing to her comfort
performed his to each other they were as their
circumstances required them to be all in all 
they were kind to their poor neighbours and
they were perfectly inoffensive toward the rest 
the world they who are wise unto salvation
know feelingly when they have done best that
their best works are worth nothing but they who
are conscious that they have lived inoffensively
may have in that consciousness a reasonable
ground comfort
the apostle enjoins us to eschew evil and do
good to do good is not in every one's power 
and many who think they are doing it may be
grievously deceived for lack judgement and
be doing evil the while instead with the best intentions
but with sad consequences to others and
eventual sorrow for themselves but it is in everyone's
power to eschew evil so far as never to do
wilful harm and if we were all careful never
unnecessarily to distress or disquiet those who are
committed to our charge or who must be affected
by our conduct if we made it a point conscience
never to disturb the peace or diminish the
happiness others the mass moral evil by
which we are surrounded would speedily be diminished
and with it no inconsiderable portion 
those physical ones would be removed which
are the natural consequence and righteous punishment
 our misdeeds

evidence he insisted that mr stanford's frame
 mind was harmonious the mental organ was
in perfect repair though the strings the material
instrument jarred and he enjoyed the scientific
delight which handel's composition gave
him abstractedly in its purity and essence
there can now says an american preacher
be no doubt this truth because there have
been so many proofs it that the man who retires
completely from business who is resolved todo
nothing but enjoy himself never attains the

other ingredients no cup is so insipid and at the
same time so unhealthful as the cup pleasure

having in like manner retired from trade used to
employ himself by having one puncheon filled

small country town who some little time after he
had left off business informed his old customers
that he meant to kill a lamb once a week just for

there is no way life to which the generality
 men cannot conform themselves and it seems
as if the more repugnance they may at first have
had to overcome the better at last they like the

be conscious that it is operating in a different

than to save a criminal from punishment it might
be defensible on the ground humanity and 
charitable hope but to plead with the whole

claim with all the devices legal subtlety and
all the technicalities legal craft i know not
how he who considers this to be his duty toward
his client can reconcile it with his duty toward his
neighbour or how he thinks it will appear in the

there are persons indeed who have so far outgrown
their catechism as to believe that their only
duty is to themselves and who in the march

that there is no account to be rendered after
death but they would resent any imputation
upon their honour or their courage as an offence
not to be forgiven and it is difficult therefore to
understand how even such persons can undertake

how they can think that the acceptance

thus and be perfectly unconscious the while that
they are acting a cowardly and rascally part

may be corrupted

are the only creatures whose nature can accommodate
itself to every climate from the burning

nature alone that this power accommodation is

have a sense duty and fidelity and affection
toward their human associates a sense altogether
distinct from fear and selfishness who will
rush upon any danger at their master's bidding
and die brokenhearted beside his body or upon

with robbers against the traveller and to hunt
down human beings and devour them but depravity
sinks deeper than this in man for the dog
when thus deteriorated acts against no law natural

comparing good and evil and chusing between
them but may be trained to either and in either

the question who was the doctor has now
methinks been answered though not fully yet
sufficiently for the present stage our memorials
while he is still a bachelor a single man an imperfect
individual half only the whole being
which by the laws nature and christian
polity it was designed that man should become
the next question therefore that presents itself
for consideration relates to that other and as he
sometimes called it better half which upon the
union the two moieties made him a whole man
who was mrs dove 
the reader has been informed how my friend
in his early manhood when abouttobeadoctor
fell in love upon that part his history i
have related all that he communicated which
was all that could by me be known and probably
all there was to know from that time he never
fell in love again nor did he ever run into it 
but as was formerly intimated he once caught
the affection the history this attachment i
heard from others he had suffered too deeply
ever to speak it himself and having maturely
considered the matter i have determined not to
relate the circumstances suffice it to say that
he might at the same time have caught from the
same person an insidious and mortal disease if
his constitution had been as susceptible the one
contagion as his heart was the other the
tale is too painful to be told there are authors
enough in the world who delight in drawing
tears there will always be young readers enough
who are not unwilling to shed them and perhaps
it may be wholesome for the young and happy
upon whose tears there is no other call
not that the author is to be admired or even
excused who draws too largely upon our lacrymal
glands the pathetic is a string which may be
touched by an unskilful hand and which has
often been played upon by an unfeeling one
for my own part i wish neither to make my
readers laugh or weep it is enough for me if
i may sometimes bring a gleam sunshine upon
thy brow pensoso and a watery one over thy
sight buonallegro a smile upon penserosa's
lips a dimple in amanda's cheek and some quiet
tears sophronia into those mild eyes which have
shed so many scalding ones when my subject

my purpose e'er to entertain
the heart with useless grief but as i may
blend in my calm and meditative strain
consolatory thoughts the balm for real pain
tale paraguay
the maxim that an author who desires to
make us weep must be affected himself by what
he writes is too trite to be repeated in its original
language both authors and actors however can
produce this effect without eliciting a spark 
feeling from their own hearts and what perhaps
may be deemed more remarkable they can with
the same success excite merriment in others without
partaking it in the slightest degree themselves
no man ever made his contemporaries
laugh more heartily than scarron whose bodily
sufferings were such that he wished for himself
tout i azure
ou la mort t ou santa meilleure 
and who describes himself in his epistle to
saracen as
un pauvre
tresmargaret 
au col tors
dont le corps
tout torts
tout bossu
strange
dcharns
est redit
jour et nuit t

vehement
it may be said perhaps that scarron's disposition
was eminently cheerful and that by indulging
in buffoonery he produced in himself a pleasurable
excitement not unlike that which others
seek from strong liquors or from opium and
therefore that his example tends to invalidate the
assertion in support which it was adduced
this is a plausible objection and i am far from
undervaluing the philosophy pantagruelism
and from denying that its effects may and are
likely to be as salutary as any that were ever
produced by the proud doctrines the porch
but i question scarron's right to the appellation
 a pantagruelist his humour had neither the
h eighth nor the depth that philosophy
there is a wellknown anecdote a physician
who being called in to an unknown patient found
him suffering under the deepest depression 
mind without any discoverable disease or other
assignable cause the physician advised him to
seek for cheerful objects and recommended him
especially to go to the theatre and see a famous
actor then in the meridian his powers whose
comic talents were unrivalled alas the comedian
who kept crowded theatres in a roar was this
poor hypochondriac himself
the state mind in which such men play
their part whether as authors or actors was
confessed in a letter written from yarmouth gaol
to the doctor's friend miller by a then wellknown
performer in this line george alexander
stevens he wrote to describe his distress in
prison and to request that miller would endeavour
to make a small collection for him some
night at a concert and he told his sad tale sportively
but breaking off that strain he said 
you may think i can have no sense that while
i am thus wretched i should offer at ridicule 
but sir people constituted like me with a disproportionate
levity spirits are always most
merry when they are most miserable and quicken
like the eyes the consumptive which are always
brightest the nearer a patient approaches to dissolution

it is one thing to jest it is another to be mirthful
sir thomas more jested as he ascended the scaffold
in cases violent death and especially
upon an unjust sentence this is not surprizing
because the sufferer has not been weakened by a
wasting malady and is in a state high mental excitement
and exertion but even when dissolution
comes in the course nature there are instances
 men who have died with a jest upon their lips
garcia sanchez de badajoz when he was at the
point death desired that he might be dressed
in the habit st francis this was accordingly
done and over the franciscan frock they put
on his habit santiago for he was a knight
 that order it was a point devotion with
him to wear the one dress a point honour to
wear the other but looking at himself in this
double attire he said to those who surrounded
his deathbed the lord will say to me presently
my friend garcia sanchez you come very
well wrapt up muy arropado and i shall reply
lord it is no wonder for it was winter when i
set off
the author who relates this anecdote remarks
that o morrer com grape he multo born e com
dramas he multo mao the observation is good
but untranslateable because it plays upon the
word which means grace as well as wit the
anecdote itself is an example the ruling humour
 strong in death perhaps also that
pride or vanity call it which we will which so
often when mind and body have not yielded to
natural decay or been broken down by suffering
clings to the last in those whom it has strongly
possessed don rodrigo caldron whose fall
and exemplary contrition served as a favourite
topic for the poets his day wore a franciscan
habit at his execution as an outward and visible
sign penitence and humiliation as he ascended
the scaffold he lifted the skirts the
habit with such an air that his attendant confessor
thought it necessary to reprove him for suchan
instance illtimed regard to his appearance
don rodrigo excused himself by saying that he
had all his life carried himself gracefully 
the author by whom this is related calls it an
instance illustrious hypocrisy in my judgement
the father confessor who gave occasion for
sos
it deserves a censure far more than the penitent
sufferer the movement beyond all doubt was
purely habitual as much so as the act lifting
his feet to ascend the steps the scaffold but
the undeserved reproof made him feel how curiously
whatever he did was remarked and that
consciousness reminded him that he had a part
to support when his whole thoughts would otherwise
have been far differently directed
a personage in one webster's plays says
i knew a man that was to lose his head
feed with an excellent good appetite
to strengthen this heart scarce half an hour before
and if he did it only was to speak
probably the dramatist alluded to some well
known fact which was at that time recent
occurrence when the desperate and atrocious
traitor thistle wood was on the scaffold his demeanour
was that a man who was resolved boldly
to meet the fate he had deserved in the few
words which were exchanged between him and
his fellow criminals he observed that the grand
question whether or not the soul was immortal
would soon be solved for them no expression
 hope escaped him no breathing repentance 
no spark grace appeared yet it is a fact
which whether it be more consolatory or awful
ought to be known on the night after the sentence
and preceding his execution while he supposed
that the person who was appointed to
watch him in his cell was asleep this miserable
man was seen by that person repeatedly to rise
upon his knees and heard repeatedly calling
upon christ his saviour to have mercy upon
him and to forgive him his sins 
all men and women are verily as shakespear
has said them merely players when we see
them upon the stage the world that is when
they are seen any where except in the freedom
and undressed intimacy private life there
is a wide difference indeed in the performers as
there is at a masquerade between those who assume
a character and those who wear dominos 
some play off the agreeable or the disagreeable
for the sake attracting notice others retire as
it were into themselves but you can judge as
little the one as the other it is even possible
to be acquainted with a man long and familiarly
and as we may suppose intimately and
yet not to know him thoroughly or well there
may be parts his character with which we have
never come in contact recesses which have never
been opened to us springs upon which we have
never touched many there are who can keep
their vices secret would that all bad men had
sense and shame enough to do so or were compelled
to it by the fear public opinion shame

which if not itself an instinctive virtue is
near akin to one makes those who are endowed
with the best and highest feelings conceal them
from all common eyes and for our performance 
religious duties our manifestations piety
we have been warned that what this kind is
done to be seen men will not be rewarded
openly before men and angels at the last
if i knew my venerable friend better than i
ever knew any other man it was because he was
in many respects unlike other men and in few
points more unlike them than in this that he
s
always appeared what he was neither better
nor worse with a discursive intellect and a
fantastic imagination he retained his simplicity 
heart he had kept that heart unspotted from
the world his father's blessing was upon him
and he prized it beyond all that the world could
have bestowed crown says sour
better mind
is as a sunday's garment then put on
when we have nought to do but at our work
we wear a worse for thrift 
it was not so with him his better mind was not
as a garment to be put on and off at pleasure it
was like its plumage to a bird its beauty and
its fragrance to a flower except that it was not
liable to be ruffled nor to fade nor to exhale and
pass away his mind was like a peacock always
in full attire it was only at times indeed to pursue
the similitude that he expanded and displayed
it but its richness and variety never could be
concealed from those who had eyes to see them
his sweetest mind

could leave as soon to be as not be kind
churlish despite ne'er looked from his calm eye

twill be but fair to lean upon their fames
for they are strong supporters but till then
the greatest are but growing gentlemen
ben jonson
who was mrs dove 
a woman the oldest family in this or any
other kingdom for she was beyond all doubt a
legitimate descendant adam her husband
perhaps might have rather said that she was a
daughter eve but he would have said it
with a smile playfulness not scorn
to trace her descent somewhat lower and
bring it nearer to the stock the courteney
the towards the marques the bourbons and
thundertentronks she was a descendant noah
and his eldest son japhet she was allied to
ham however in another way besides this remote
nieceship
as how i pray you sir 
her maiden name was bacon
grave sir be not disconcerted i hope you
have no antipathy to such things or at least
that they do not act upon you as the notes a
bagpipe are said to act upon certain persons
whose unfortunate idiosyncrasy exposes them to
very unpleasant effects from the sound
mr critickin for as there is a diminutive

you before i can be afraid your claws you
must leave off biting your nails
i have something better to say to the reader

vol ii p
the whole in the foreground and home scene as
well as in the pisgah view i will tell him before
the chapter is finished why i do not wear a
cap and bells
to you my lady who may imagine that miss
bacon was not a good family lord merula's
line as you very properly remark being
extinct i beg leave to observe that she was certainly
a cousin your own somewhere within
the tenth and twentieth degrees if not nearer
and this i proceed to prove
every person has two immediate parents four
ancestors in the second degree eight in the third
and so the pedigree ascends doubling at every
step till in the twentieth generation he has no
fewer than one million thirty thousand eight
hundred and ninetysix
great great great

grandfathers and grandmothers therefore my
lady i conceive it to be absolutely certain
that under the plantagenet if not in the time 
the tutors some your ancestors must have
been equally ancestors miss deborah bacon
at the conquest says sir richard phillips
the ancestry every one the english people
was the whole population england while on
the other hand every one having children at that
time was the direct progenitor the whole 
the living race
the reflecting reader sees at once that it must
be so plato ait nemine legem non ex servis
esse oriendum nemine non serum ex regius

and the erudite ire in the premium to his
invaluable glossary says ut aliquot cognitions

hodie inexplicable omnes homines inter se 
sunt
seneca
now then to the gentle reader the reason
why i do not wear a cap and bells is this
there are male caps five kinds which are
worn at present in this kingdom to wit the military
cap the collegiate cap the jockey cap the
travelling cap and the night cap observe
reader i said kinds that is to say in scientific
language genera for the species and varieties
are numerous especially in the former genus
i am noc a soldier and having long been
weaned from alma mater course have left off
my college cap the gentlemen the
hunt would object to my going out with the bells
on it would be likely to frighten their horses 
and were i to attempt it it might involve me in
unpleasant disputes which might possibly lead
to more unpleasant consequences to my travelling
cap the bells would be an inconvenient
appendage nor would they be a whit more comfortable
upon my nightcap besides my wife
might object to them
it follows that if i would wear a cap and bells
i must have a cap made on purpose but this
would be rendering myself singular and all
things a wise man will most avoid any ostentatious
appearance singularity
now i am certainly not singular in playing
the fool without one
and indeed if i possessed such a cap it would
not be proper to wear it in this part my
history
chapter lxxiii
rash marriages an early widowhood affliction
rendered a blessing to the sufferers 
and two orphans left though not destitute
yet friendless
love built a stately house where fortune came
and spinning fancies she was heard to say
that her fine cobwebs did support the frame 
whereas they were supported by the same
but wisdom quickly swept them all away
herbert
mrs dove was the only child a clergyman
who held a small vicarage in the west riding
leonard bacon her father had been left an orphan
in early youth he had some wealthy relations
by whose contributions he was placed at
an endowed grammar school in the country and
having through their influence gained a scholarship
to which his own deserts might have entitled
him they continued to assist him sparingly
enough indeed at the university till he succeeded
to a fellowship leonard was made 
nature's finest clay and nature had tempered it
with the choicest dews heaven
he had a female cousin about three years
younger than himself and in like manner an orphan
equally destitute but far more forlorn
man hath a fleece about him which enables him
to bear the sufferings the storm but woman
when young and lovely and poor is as a shorn
lamb for which the wind has not been tempered
leonard's father and margaret's had been
bosom friends they were subalterns in the
same regiment and being for a long time stationed
at salisbury had become intimate at the
house mr trewbody a gentleman one 
the oldest families in wiltshire mr trewbody
had three daughters melicent the eldest was a
celebrated beauty and the knowledge this had
not tended to improve a detestable temper the
two youngest deborah and margaret were lively
goodnatured thoughtless and attractive they
danced with the two lieutenants played to them
on the spinner sung with them and laughed with
them till this mirthful intercourse became serious
and knowing that it would be impossible to
obtain their father's consent they married the men
 their hearts without it palmer and bacon
were both without fortune and without any other
means subsistence than their commissions for
four years they were as happy as love could
make them at the that time palmer was
seized with an infectious fever deborah was
then far advanced in pregnancy and no solicitations
could induce bacon to keep from his
friend's bedside the disease proved fatal it
communicated to bacon and his wife the former
only survived his friend ten days and he and
margaret were then laid in the same grave
they left an only boy three years old and in
less than a month the widow palmer was delivered
 a daughter
in the first impulse anger at the flight 
his daughters and the degradation his family
for bacon was the son a tradesman and
palmer was nobody knew who mr trewbody
had made his will and left the whole sum which
he had designed for his three daughters to th
eldest whether the situation margaret and
the two orphans might have touched him is perhaps
doubtful for the family were either lighthearted
or hardhearted and his heart was 
the hard sort but he died suddenly a few months
before his sonsinlaw the only son freeman
trewbody esq a wiltshire foxhunter like his
father succeeded to the estate and as he and his
eldest sister hated each other cordially miss reticent
left the manorhouse and established herself
in the close at salisbury where she lived in that
style which a portion enabled her in
those days to support
the circumstance which might appear so
greatly to have aggravated mrs palmer's distress
if such distress be capable aggravation
prevented her perhaps from eventually sinking
under it if the birth her child was no alleviation
 her sorrow it brought with it new
feelings new duties new cause for exertion and
new strength for it she wrote to melicent and
to her brother simply stating her own destitute
situation and that the orphan leonard shep

believed that their pride would not suffer them
either to let her starve or go to the parish for
support and in this she was not disappointed
an answer was returned by miss trewbody informing
her that she had nobody to thank but
herself for her misfortunes but that notwithstanding
the disgrace which she had brought
upon the family she might expect an annual
allowance ten pounds from the writer and a
like sum from her brother upon this she must
retire into some obscure part the country and
pray god to forgive her for the offence she had
committed in marrying beneath her birth and
against her father's consent
mrs palmer had also written to the friends 
lieutenant bacon her own husband had none
who could assist her she expressed her willingness
and her anxiety to have the care her
sister's orphan but represented her forlorn state
they behaved more liberally than her own kin
had done and promised five pounds a year as
long as the boy should require it with this
and her pension she took a cottage in a retired
village grief had acted upon her heart like the
rod moses upon the rock in the desert it had
opened it and the wellspring piety had gushed
forth affliction made her religious and religion
brought with it consolation and comfort and joy
leonard became as dear to her as margaret
the sense duty educed a pleasure from every
privation to which she subjected herself for the
sake economy and in endeavouring to fulfil
her duties in that state life to which it had
pleased god to call her she was happier than
she had ever been in her father's house and not
less so than in her marriage state her happiness
indeed was different in kind but it was higher in
degree for the sake these dear children she
was contented to live and even prayed for life 
while if it had respected herself only death had
become to her rather an object desire than 
dread in this manner she lived seven years
after the loss her husband and was then carried
m
off by an acute disease to the irreparable loss 
the orphans who were thus orphaned indeed

chapter lxxiv
a lady described whose single life was no
blessedness either to herself or others
a veracious epitaph and an appropriate monument

beauty ray lord tis the worst part woman 
a weak poor thing assaulted every hour
by creeping minutes defacing time 
a superficies which each breath care
blasts off and every humorous stream grief
which flows from forth these fountains our eyes
washed away as rain doth winter's snow
goff
miss trewbody behaved with perfect propriety
upon the news her sister's death she closed
her front windows for two days received no
visitors for a week was much indisposed but
resigned to the will providence in reply to
messages condolence put her servants in
i
mourning and sent for margaret that she might
do her duty to her sister's child by breeding her
up under her own eye poor margaret was
transferred from the stone floor her mother's
cottage to the turkey carpet her aunt's parlour
she was too young to comprehend at once
the whole evil the exchange but she learned
to feel and understand it during years bitter
dependence unalleviated by any hope except
that one day seeing leonard the only creature
on earth whom she remembered with affection

seven years elapsed and during all those years
leonard was left to pass his holidays summer
and winter at the grammar school where he had
been placed at mrs palmer's death for although
the master regularly transmitted with his halfyearly
bill the most favourable accounts his
disposition and general conduct as well as his
progress in learning no wish to see the boy had
ever arisen in the hearts his nearest relations 
and no feeling kindness or sense decent humanity
had ever induced either the foxhunter
freeman or melicent his sister to invite him for
midsummer or christmas at length in the
seventh year a letter announced that his schooleducation
had been completed and that he was
elected to a scholarship at college oxford
which scholarship would entitle him to a
fellowship in due course time in the intervening
years some little assistance from his liberal
benefactors would be required and the liberality
 those kind friends would be well bestowed
upon a youth who bade so fair to do honour to
himself and to reflect no disgrace upon his honourable
connections the head the family
promised his part with an ungracious expression
 satisfaction at thinking that thank god there
would soon be an these demands upon
him miss trewbody signified her assent in
the same amiable and religious spirit however
much her sister had disgraced her family she replied
 please god it should never be said that
she refused to do her duty
the whole sum which these wealthy relations
contributed was not very heavy an annual ten
pounds each but they contrived to make their
nephew feel the weight every separate portion

the squire's half came always with a brief note
desiring that the receipt the enclosed sum
might be acknowledged without delay not a
word kindness or courtesy accompanied it 
and miss trewbody never failed to administer
with her remittance a few edifying remarks upon
the folly his mother in marrying beneath herself
and the improper conduct his father in
connecting himself with a woman family
against the consent her relations the consequence
 which was that he had left a child
dependant upon those relations for support
leonard received these pleasant preparations 
charity only at distant intervals when he regularly
expected them with his halfyearly allowance
but margaret meantime was dieted upon
the food bitterness without one circumstance
to relieve the misery her situation
at the time which i am now speaking miss
trewbody was a maiden lady fortyseven in
the highest state preservation the whole business
 her life had been to take care a fine
person and in this she had succeeded admirably
her library consisted two books nelson's
festivals and fasts was one the other was l the
queen's cabinet unlocked and there was not a
cosmetic in the latter which she had not faithfully
prepared thus by means as she believed
 distilled waters various kinds maydew and
buttermilk her skin retained its beautiful texture
still and much its smoothness and she knew
at times how to give it the appearance that
brilliancy which it had lost but that was a
profound secret miss trewbody remembering
the example jezebel always felt conscious that
she was committing a sin when she took the
rougebox in her hand and generally ejaculated
in a low voice the lord forgive me when she
laid it down but looking in the glass at the
same time she indulged a hope that the nature
 the temptation might be considered as an
excuse for the transgression her other great
business was to observe with the utmost precision
all the punctilios her situation in life and the
time which was not devoted to one or other 
these worthy occupations was employed in scolding
her servants and tormenting her niece this
employment for it was so habitual that it deserved
that name agreed excellently with her
constitution she was troubled with no acrid
humours no fits bile no diseases the spleen
no vapours or hysterics the morbid matter was
all collected in her temper and found a regular
vent at her tongue this kept the lungs in
vigorous health nay it even seemed to supply
the place wholesome exercise and to stimulate
the system like a perpetual blister with this
peculiar advantage that instead an inconvenience
it was a pleasure to herself and all the
annoyance was to her dependants
miss trewbody lies buried in the cathedral
at salisbury where a monument was erected to
her memory worthy remembrance itself for its
appropriate inscription and accompaniments
the epitaph recorded her as a woman eminently
pious virtuous and charitable who lived universally
respected and died sincerely lamented by all
who had the happiness knowing her this inscription
was upon a marble shield supported by
two cupids who bent their heads over the edge
with marble tears larger than grey pease and
something the same colour upon their cheeks
these were the only tears which her death occasioned
and the only cupids with whom she had
ever any concern
chapter lxxv
a scene which will put some those readers
i
who have been most impatient with the author
in the best humour with him
there is no argument more antiquity and elegancy than
is the matter love for it seems to be as old as the world
and to bear date from the first time that man and woman
was therefore in this as in the finest metal the freshest wits
have in all ages shewn their best workmanship
robert wilmot
when leonard had resided three years at oxford
one his collegefriends invited him to
pass the long vacation at his father's house which
happened to be within an easy ride salisbury
one morning therefore he rode to that city rung
at miss trewbody's door and having sent in his
name was admitted into the parlour where there
was no one to receive him while miss trewbody
adjusted her headdress at the toilette before
she made her appearance her feelings while
she was thus employed were not the pleasantness
kind toward this unexpected guest and she was
prepared to accost him with a reproof for his extravagance
in undertaking so long a journey and
with some mortifying questions concerning the
business which brought him there but this
amiable intention was put to flight when leonard
as soon as she entered the room informed
her that having accepted an invitation into that
neighbourhood from his friend and fellowcollegian
the son sir lambert bowles he had
taken the earliest opportunity coming to pay
his respects to her and acknowledging his obligations
as bound alike by duty and inclination
the name sir lambert bowles acted upon
miss trewbody like a charm and its mollifying
effect was not a little aided by the tone her
nephew's address and the sight a fine youth
in the first bloom manhood whose appearance
and manners were such that she could not be surprized
at the introduction he had obtained into
one the first families in the county the
scowl therefore which she brought into the room
upon her brow past instantly away and was succeeded
by so gracious an aspect that leonard if
he had not divined the cause might have mistaken
this gleam sunshine for fair weather
a cause which miss trewbody could not possibly
suspect had rendered her nephew's address
thus conciliatory had he expected to see no
other person in that house the visit would have
been performed as an irksome obligation and his
manner would have appeared as cold and formal as
the reception which he anticipated but leonard
had not forgotten the playmate and companion
with whom the happy years his childhood had
been passed young as he was at their separation
his character had taken its stamp during
those peaceful years and the impression which it
then received was indelible hitherto hope had
never been to him so delightful as memory his
thoughts wandered back into the past more frequently
than they took flight into the future and
the favourite form which his imagination called
up was that the sweet child who in winter
partook his bench in the chimney corner and in
summer sate with him in the porch and strung
the fallen blossoms jessamine upon stalks 
grass the snowdrop and the crocus reminded
him their little garden the primrose their
sunny orchardbank and the blue bells and the
cowslip the fields wherein they were allowed
to run wild and gather them in the merry month
 may such as she then was he saw her frequently
in sleep with her blue eyes and rosy
cheeks and flaxen curls and in his day dreams
he sometimes pictured her to himself such as he
supposed she now might be and dressed up the
image with all the magic ideal beauty his
heart therefore was at his lips when he enquired
for his cousin it was not without something like
fear and an apprehension disappointment that
he awaited her appearance and he was secretly
condemning himself for the romantic folly which
he had encouraged when the door opened and a
creature came in less radiant indeed but more
winning than his fancy had created for the loveliness
 earth and reality was about her
margaret said miss trewbody do you
remember your cousin leonard 
before she could answer leonard had taken
her hand tis a long while margaret since we
parted ten years but i have not forgotten the
parting nor the blessed days our childhood
she stood trembling like an aspen leaf and
looked wistfully in his face for a moment then
hung down her head without power to utter a
word in reply but he felt her tears fall fast
upon his hand and felt also that she returned its
pressure
leonard had some difficulty to command himself
so as to bear a part in conversation with his
aunt and keep his eyes and his thoughts from
wandering he accepted however her invitation
to stay and dine with her with dissembled
satisfaction and the pleasure was not a little
heightened when she left the room to give some
necessary orders in consequence margaret still
sate trembling and in silence he took her hand
prest it to his lips and said in a low earnest voice
dear dear margaret she raised her eyes and
fixing them upon him with one those looks the
perfect remembrance which can never be
effaced from the heart to which they have been
addressed replied in a lower but not less earnest
tone dear leonard and from that moment
their lot was sealed for time and for eternity
chapter lxvi
a story concerning cupid which not one reader
in ten thousand has ever heard before j a
defence love which will be very satisfactory
to the ladies
they do lie

and heaven they lie he has a sight can pierce
thro ivory as clear as it were horn

beaumont and fletcher
the stores who called our good affections eupa
thes did not manage those affections as well as
they understood them they kept them under
too severe a discipline and erroneously believed
that the best way to strengthen the heart was by
hardening it the monks carried this error to
its utmost extent falling indeed into the impious
vol ii ft
absurdity that our eupathies are sinful in themselves
the monks have been called the stoics
 christianity but the philosophy the cloister
can no more bear comparison with that 
the porch than stoicism itself with christianity
pure and undefiled van helmont compares even
the franciscans with the stoics panels mutatis
he says videbam capuchin esse stoical
christian he might have found a closer
parallel for them in the cynics both for their filth
and their extravagance and here i will relate
a rabbinical tradition
on a time the chiefs the synagogue being
mighty in prayer obtained the lord that the
evil spirit who had seduced the jews to commit
idolatry and had brought other nations against
them to overthrow their city and destroy the
temple should be delivered into their hands for
punishment when by advice zachariah the
prophet they put him in a leaden vessel and
secured him there with a weight lead upon his
face by this sort peine forte et dure they
laid him so effectually that he has never appeared
since pursuing then their supplications while
the ear heaven was open they entreated that
another evil spirit by whom the people had continually
been led astray might in like manner be
put into their power this prayer also was
granted and the demon with whom poets
lovers and ladies are familiar by his heathen
name cupid was delivered up to them
folk per lui
tut to almonds si fa persia more
e saggio ognun sara
the prophet zachariah warned them not to
be too hasty in putting him to death for fear 
the consequences 
you shall see
a fine confusion in the country mark it 
but the prophet's counsel was as vain as the wise
courtier's in beaumont and fletchers tragedy
who remonstrated against the decree for demolishing
cupid's altars they disregarded his advice 
because they were determined upon destroying
the enemy now that they had him in their power 
and they bound their prisoner fast in chains
while they deliberated by what death he should
metastasio
die these deliberations lasted three days on
the third day it happened that a newlaid egg was
wanted for a sick person and behold no such
thing was to be found throughout the kingdom
 israel for since this evil spirit was in durance
not an egg had been laid and it appeared upon
enquiry that the whole course kind was suspended
the chiefs the synagogue perceived
then that not without reason zachariah had
warned them they saw that if they put their prisoner
to death the world must come to an 
and therefore they contented themselves with
putting out his eyes that he might not see to do
so much mischief and let him go
thus it was that cupid became blind a fact
unknown to the greek and roman poets and to
all the gamesters who have succeeded them
the rabbis are coarse fablers take away
love and not physical nature only but the heart
 the moral world would be palsied 
this is the salt unto humanity
and keeps it sweet
beaumont fletcher

it is with this passion as with the amreeta in
southey's hindoo tale the most original his
poems its effects are beneficial or malignant according
to the subject on which it acts in this
respect love may also be likened to the sun
under whose influence one plant elaborates nutriment
for man and another poison and which
while it draws up pestilence from the marsh and
jungle and sets the simoom in motion over the
desert diffuses light life and happiness over the
healthy and cultivated regions the earth
it acts terribly upon poets poor creatures
nothing in the whole details the ten persecutions

more shocking than what they have suffered from
metastasio
love according to the statements which they
have given their own sufferings they have
endured scorching frying roasting burning
sometimes by a slow fire sometimes by a quick
one and melting and this too from a fire which
while it thus affects the heart and liver raises nota
blister upon the skin resembling in this respect
that penal fire which certain theological
writers describe as being more intense because it
is invisible existing not in form but in essence
and acting therefore upon spirit as material and
visible fire acts upon the body sometimes they
have undergone from the same cause all the horrors
 freezing and petrifaction very frequently the
brain is affected and one peculiar symptom 
the insanity arising from this cause is that the
patients are sensible it and appear to boast

shufflebottom himself was so far gone as this 
amadis de gaule liv 
in a diseased heart it loses its nature and
combining with the morbid affection which it finds
produces a new disease
when it gets into an empty heart it works
there like quicksilver in an apple dumpling while
the astonished cook ignorant the roguery
which has been played her thinks that there is
not death but the devil in the pot
in a full heart which is tantamount to saying
a virtuous one for in every other conscience
keeps a void place for itself and the hollow is
always felt it is sedative sanative and preservative
 a drop the true elixir no mithridate so
effectual against the infection vice
how then did this passion act upon leonard
and margaret in a manner which you will not
find described in any mr thomas moore's
poems and which lord byron is as incapable 
understanding or even believing in another ashe
is feeling it in himself
chapter lxxvii
wore concerning love and the dream life
happy the bonds that hold ye 
sure they be sweeter far than liberty
there is no blessedness but in such bondage 
happy that happy chain such links are heavenly
beaumont and fletcher
i will not describe the subsequent interviews
between leonard and his cousin short and broken
but precious as they were nor that parting one
in which hands were plighted with the sure and
certain knowledge that hearts had been interchanged
remembrance will enable some my
readers to pourtray the scene and then perhaps
a sigh may be heaved for the days that are gone 
hope will picture it to others and with them the
sigh will be for the days that are to come
there was not that indefinite deferment hope
in this case at which the heart sickens leonard
had been bred up in poverty from his childhood 
a parsimonious allowance grudgingly bestowed
had contributed to keep him frugal at college by
calling forth a pardonable if not a commendable
sense pride in aid a worthier principle he
knew that he could rely upon himself for frugality
industry and a cheerful as well as a contented
mind he had seen the miserable state 
bondage in which margaret existed with her aunt
and his resolution was made to deliver her from
that bondage as soon as he could obtain the smallest
benefice on which it was possible for them to
subsist they agreed to live rigorously within
their means however poor and put their trust in
providence they could not be deceived in each
other for they had grown up together and they
knew that they were not deceived in themselves
their love had the freshness youth but prudence
and forethought were not wanting the
resolution which they had taken brought with it
peace mind and no misgiving was felt in either
heart when they prayed for a blessing upon their
purpose in reality it had already brought a
blessing with it and this they felt for love when
it deserves that name produces in us what may be
called a regeneration its own a second birth
dimly but yet in some degree resembling that
which is effected by divine love when its redeeming
work is accomplished in the soul
leonard returned to oxford happier than
all this world's wealth or this world's honours
could have made him he had now a definite
and attainable hope an object in life which gave
to life itself a value for margaret the world no
longer seemed to her like the same earth which
she had till then inhabited hitherto she had
felt herself a forlorn and solitary creature without
a friend and the sweet sounds and pleasant objects
 nature had imparted as little cheerfulness
to her as to the debtor who sees green fields in
sunshine from his prison and hears the lark
singing at liberty her heart was open now to
all the exhilarating and all the softening influences
 birds fields flowers vernal suns and
melodious streams she was subject to the same
daily and hourly exercise meekness patience
and humility but the trial was no longer painful 
with love in her heart and hope and sunshine in
her prospect she found even a pleasure in contrasting
her present condition with that which
was in store for her
in these our days every young lady holds the
pen a ready writer and words flow from it as
fast as it can indent its zigzag lines according
to the reformed system writing which said
system improves handwritings by making them all
alike and all illegible at that time women wrote
better and spelt worse but letter writing was not
one their accomplishments it had not yet
become one the general pleasures and luxuries
 life perhaps the greatest gratification which
the progress civilization has given us there
was then no mail coach to waft a sigh across the
country at the rate eight miles an hour
letters came slowly and with long intervals between
 but when they came the happiness which
they imparted to leonard and margaret lasted
during the interval however long to leonard
it was as an exhilarate and a cordial which rejoiced
and strengthened him he trod the earth with
a lighter and more elated movement on the day
when he received a letter from margaret as if he
felt himself invested with an importance which
he had never possessed till the happiness 
another human being was inseparably associated
with his own 
so proud a thing it was for him to wear
love's golden chain
with which it is best freedom to be bound
happy indeed if there be happiness on earth
as that same sweet poet says is he
who love enjoys and placed hath his mind
where fairest virtues fairest beauties grace
then in himself such store worth doth find
that he deserves to find so good a place
this was leonard's case and when he kissed
the paper which her hand had pressed it was with
a consciousness the strength and sincerity 
his affection which at once rejoiced arid fortified
his heart to margaret his letters were
like summer dew upon the herb that thirsts for
such refreshment whenever they arrived a
headache became the cause or pretext for redrummond

tiring earlier than usual to her chamber that
she might weep and dream over the precious
lines
true gentle love is like the summer dew
which falls around when all is still and hush 
and falls unseen until its bright drops strew
with odours herb and flower and bank and bush 
o love when womanhood is in the flush
and man's a young and an unspotted thing
his firstbreathed word and her halfconscious blush
are fair as light in heaven or flowers in spring

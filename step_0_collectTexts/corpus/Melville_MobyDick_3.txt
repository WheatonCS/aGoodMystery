ship and every sleeper in it all at once
started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts
of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted
forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
the sparkling brine into the air

clear away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he
dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes

the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere
the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward
but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he
swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave
orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in
whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats
we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the
noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the
monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and
then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up

there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by
stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was
granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale
rose again and being now in advance of the smoker's boat and much
nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honour
of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become
aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no
longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and
still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault

yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy
he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad
yeast which he brewed


it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists though
apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about
him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does
so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the
upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cut-water
formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he
thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot-boat


start her start her my men don't hurry yourselves take plenty of
time but start her start her like thunder-claps that's all cried
stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give em
the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boy start
her all but keep cool keep cool cucumbers is the word easy
easy only start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the
buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boys that's all start
her

woo-hoo wa-hee screamed the gay-header in reply raising some
old war-whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat
involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
which the eager indian gave

but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild kee-hee
kee-hee yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat
like a pacing tiger in his cage

ka-la koo-loo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a
mouthful of grenadier's steak and thus with oars and yells the keels
cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still
encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from
his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the
welcome cry was heard stand up tashtego give it to him the
harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the same
moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists
it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two
additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its
increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled
with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and
round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it
blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb's hands from
which the hand-cloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemy's
sharp two-edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving
to wrest it out of your clutch

wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated
by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea-water into it more
turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now
flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego
here changed places stem for stern a staggering business truly in that
rocking commotion


partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be
stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the
running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or
bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most
convenient


from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would
have thought the craft had two keels one cleaving the water the other
the air as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once
a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in
her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little
finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale
into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging
to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of
tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring
down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed
as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened
his flight

haul in haul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round
towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet
the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly
planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the
flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning
out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow and then ranging up for
another fling

the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled
and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing
upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every
face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all
the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the
spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of
the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked
lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and
again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again
sent it into the whale

pull up pull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale
relaxed in his wrath pull up close to and the boat ranged along
the fish's flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned
his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully
churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of
breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the
innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from
his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster
horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable
mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping
astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied
twilight into the clear air of the day

and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view
surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his
spout-hole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush
after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red
wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping
down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst

he's dead mr stubb said daggoo

yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth
stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made



chapter the dart


a word concerning an incident in the last chapter

according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale-boat pushes
off from the ship with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
steersman and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
oar the one known as the harpooneer-oar now it needs a strong nervous
arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called
a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of
twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase
the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost
indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the
rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid
exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's
compass while all the other muscles are strained and half started what
that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this
straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once
the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry stand up and give it
to him he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his
centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little
strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no
wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty
fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many
hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some
of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat no wonder that
some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder
that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the
harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his
body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted

again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant
that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer
likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of
themselves and every one else it is then they change places and
the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper
station in the bows of the boat

now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish
and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows from first to
last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing
whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious
to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss
of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more
than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures
in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the
whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has
caused them

to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of this
world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of
toil



chapter the crotch


out of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in
productive subjects grow the chapters

the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention
it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which
is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow
for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the
harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow
thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it
up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from
the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch
respectively called the first and second irons

but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with
the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one
instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming
drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a
doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the
instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving
the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however
lightning-like in his movements to pitch the second iron into him
nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line
and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be
anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the
most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water
it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned
in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently
practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the
saddest and most fatal casualties

furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharp-edged terror
skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines
or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions
nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
fairly captured and a corpse

consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these
qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be
simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied
with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one
be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are
faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several
most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be
painted



chapter stubb's supper


stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was
a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow
business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men
with our thirty-six arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers
slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the
sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals
good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we
moved for upon the great canal of hang-ho or whatever they call
it in china four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky
freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we
towed heavily forged along as if laden with pig-lead in bulk

darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequod's
main-rigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab
dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing
the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing
it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way
into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning

though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had
evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature
was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed
working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that
moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were
brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand
monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on
the pequod's decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in
the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust
rattling out of the port-holes but by those clanking links the vast
corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the
stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black
hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night
which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the two ship and whale
seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while
the other remains standing


a little item may as well be related here the strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside
is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part
is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side-fins its
flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so
that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to
put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a
small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and
a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by
adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily
made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked
fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with
its broad flukes or lobes


if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known
on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an
unusual but still good-natured excitement such an unwonted bustle was
he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned
to him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping
cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest
stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale
as a flavorish thing to his palate

a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut
me one from his small

here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general
thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray
the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds
of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers
who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale
designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body

about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
at the capstan-head as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb
the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night mingling their mumblings
with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming
round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness the few
sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping
of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers
hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you
heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on
their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the
bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all
but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they
contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the
universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale
may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking
for a screw

though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight sharks
will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks like hungry dogs
round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down
every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant
butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's
live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled the sharks
also with their jewel-hilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away
under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole
affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that
is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and
though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in
case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently
buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down
touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most
socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no
conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm
whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never
seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of
devil-worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil

but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his
own epicurean lips

cook cook where's that old fleece he cried at length widening
his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper
and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing
with his lance cook you cook sail this way cook

the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling
along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something
the matter with his knee-pans which he did not keep well scoured like
his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and
limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy
fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered
along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on
the opposite side of stubb's sideboard when with both hands folded
before him and resting on his two-legged cane he bowed his arched back
still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as
to bring his best ear into play

cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth don't you think this steak is rather overdone you've been
beating this steak too much cook it's too tender don't i always say
that to be good a whale-steak must be tough there are those sharks
now over the side don't you see they prefer it tough and rare what a
shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to em tell em they are
welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must
keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and
deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his
sideboard now then go and preach to em

sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck
to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the
sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand
he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a
mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling
behind overheard all that was said

fellow-critters i'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin ob de lips massa stubb say
dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor you
must stop dat dam racket

cook here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap
on the shoulder cook why damn your eyes you mustn't swear that way
when you're preaching that's no way to convert sinners cook

who dat den preach to him yourself sullenly turning to go

no cook go on go on

well den belubed fellow-critters 

right exclaimed stubb approvingly coax em to it try that and
fleece continued

do you is all sharks and by natur wery woracious yet i zay to you
fellow-critters dat dat woraciousness top dat dam slappin ob de
tail how you tink to hear spose you keep up such a dam slappin and
bitin dare

cook cried stubb collaring him i won't have that swearing talk to
em gentlemanly

once more the sermon proceeded

your woraciousness fellow-critters i don't blame ye so much for dat
is natur and can't be helped but to gobern dat wicked natur dat is de
pint you is sharks sartin but if you gobern de shark in you why den
you be angel for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark well goberned
now look here bred'ren just try wonst to be cibil a helping
yourselbs from dat whale don't be tearin de blubber out your
neighbour's mout i say is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
whale and by gor none on you has de right to dat whale dat whale
belong to some one else i know some o you has berry brig mout brigger
dan oders but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies so dat
de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid but to bit off de blubber
for de small fry ob sharks dat can't get into de scrouge to help
demselves

well done old fleece cried stubb that's christianity go on

no use goin on de dam willains will keep a scougin and slappin each
oder massa stubb dey don't hear one word no use a-preaching to
such dam g'uttons as you call em till dare bellies is full and dare
bellies is bottomless and when dey do get em full dey wont hear you
den for den dey sink in the sea go fast to sleep on de coral and
can't hear noting at all no more for eber and eber

upon my soul i am about of the same opinion so give the benediction
fleece and i'll away to my supper

upon this fleece holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his
shrill voice and cried 

cussed fellow-critters kick up de damndest row as ever you can fill
your dam bellies till dey bust and den die

now cook said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand
just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular
attention

all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the
desired position

well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go
back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you
cook

what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily

silence how old are you cook

bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered

and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook
and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak rapidly bolting another
mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
question where were you born cook

hind de hatchway in ferry-boat goin ober de roanoke

born in a ferry-boat that's queer too but i want to know what
country you were born in cook

didn't i say de roanoke country he cried sharply

no you didn't cook but i'll tell you what i'm coming to cook
you must go home and be born over again you don't know how to cook a
whale-steak yet

bress my soul if i cook noder one he growled angrily turning round
to depart

come back here cook here hand me those tongs now take that bit of
steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be
take it i say holding the tongs towards him take it and taste it

faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro
muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy

cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the
church

passed one once in cape-down said the old man sullenly

and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape-town where
you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his
beloved fellow-creatures have you cook and yet you come here and
tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said stubb where
do you expect to go to cook

go to bed berry soon he mumbled half-turning as he spoke

avast heave to i mean when you die cook it's an awful question now
what's your answer

when dis old brack man dies said the negro slowly changing his whole
air and demeanor he hisself won't go nowhere but some bressed angel
will come and fetch him

fetch him how in a coach and four as they fetched elijah and fetch
him where

up dere said fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and
keeping it there very solemnly

so then you expect to go up into our main-top do you cook when you
are dead but don't you know the higher you climb the colder it gets
main-top eh

didn't say dat t'all said fleece again in the sulks

you said up there didn't you and now look yourself and see where
your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
crawling through the lubber's hole cook but no no cook you don't
get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging it's a
ticklish business but must be done or else it's no go but none of
us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my orders do ye
hear hold your hat in one hand and clap t'other a'top of your heart
when i'm giving my orders cook what that your heart there that's
your gizzard aloft aloft that's it now you have it hold it there
now and pay attention

all dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired
vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at
one and the same time

well then cook you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad
that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that don't
you well for the future when you cook another whale-steak for my
private table here the capstan i'll tell you what to do so as not to
spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal
to it with the other that done dish it d'ye hear and now to-morrow
cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get
the tips of his fins have them put in pickle as for the ends of the
flukes have them soused cook there now ye may go

but fleece had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled

cook give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch
d'ye hear away you sail then halloa stop make a bow before you
go avast heaving again whale-balls for breakfast don't forget

wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale i'm bressed if
he ain't more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man
limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock



chapter the whale as a dish


that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and
like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so
outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of it

it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right
whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large
prices there also that in henry viiith's time a certain cook of the
court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of
whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the
meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well
seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls
the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great
porpoise grant from the crown

the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all
hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but
when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men
like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not
so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare
old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous
doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly
juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who
long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel that
these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among
the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed
they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something
like old amsterdam housewives dough-nuts or oly-cooks when fresh they
have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly
keep his hands off

but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his
exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be
delicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as
the buffalo's which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid
pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that
is like the transparent half-jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try
watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile many
a good supper have i thus made

in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish
the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump
whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings
they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess
in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dish among
some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the
epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get to
have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a
calf's head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon
discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an
intelligent looking calf's head before him is somehow one of the
saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at
him with an et tu brute expression

it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence
that appears to result in some way from the consideration before
mentioned ie that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea
and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man that ever
murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if
he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and
he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meat-market
of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the
long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of
the cannibal's jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will
be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in
his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that
provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized
and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest
on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras

but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is
adding insult to injury is it look at your knife-handle there my
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is
that handle made of what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring
that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did
the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders
formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two
that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel
pens



chapter the shark massacre


when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and
weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general
thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very
soon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the
common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm a'lee and then send
every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that
until that time anchor-watches shall be kept that is two and two for
an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see
that all goes well

but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will
not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a
stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning
in most other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so
largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades
a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to
tickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the
present case with the pequod's sharks though to be sure any man
unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and
those sharks the maggots in it

nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman
came on deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for
immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering
three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
sea these two mariners darting their long whaling-spades kept up an
incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep
into their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy
confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not
always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each
other's disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit
their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by
the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was
this all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
creatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual
life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin
one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg's hand off when he tried
to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw


the whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel
is about the bigness of a man's spread hand and in general shape
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its
sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than
the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when
being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a
stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle


queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly
lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de
god wat made shark must be one dam ingin



chapter cutting in


it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio
professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was
turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would
have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods

in the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous
things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which
no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up
to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head the strongest
point anywhere above a ship's deck the end of the hawser-like rope
winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass
and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to
this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was
attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb
the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the
body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two
side-fins this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole
the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild
chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when
instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in
her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather she
trembles quivers and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky more
and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the
windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last
a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls
upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises
into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the
first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely
as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body
precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the
strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale
rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip
uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf simultaneously
cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb the mates and just as fast as
it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the
time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the
main-top the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment
or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let
down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge
it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong
overboard

one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon
called a boarding-sword and watching his chance he dexterously slices
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this
hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked
so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what
follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to
stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few
sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain
so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip
called a blanket-piece swings clear and is all ready for lowering
the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is
peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly
slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway
right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room into
this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents
and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering
simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing
the blubber-room gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship
straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the
general friction



chapter the blanket


i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of
the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen
afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains
unchanged but it is only an opinion

the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you
know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence
of firm close-grained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and
ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness

now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's
skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point
of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you
cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body but
that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if
reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred
dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely
thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds
of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is
previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but
becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which
i use for marks in my whale-books it is transparent as i said before
and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself
with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is
pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may
say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin
isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the
whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as
the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say
that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender
than the skin of a new-born child but no more of this

assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin
as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or
rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths
and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had
of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere
integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels
to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters
of the stuff of the whale's skin

in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among
the many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely
crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array
something like those in the finest italian line engravings but these
marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved
upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick
observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but
afford the ground for far other delineations these are hieroglyphical
that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present
connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm
whale in particular i was much struck with a plate representing the old
indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on
the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the
mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian
rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which
the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays the
back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the
regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches
altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new
england rocks on the sea-coast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks
of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs i should say
that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this
particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are
probably made by hostile contact with other whales for i have most
remarked them in the large full-grown bulls of the species

a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
the whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long
pieces called blanket-pieces like most sea-terms this one is very
happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho
slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this
cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself
comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would
become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the
north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are
found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it
observed are your cold-blooded lungless fish whose very bellies
are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of
an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire
whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his blood
and he dies how wonderful is it then except after explanation that
this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it
is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed
to his lips for life in those arctic waters where when seamen fall
overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly
frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued
in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by
experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a
borneo negro in summer

it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare
virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after
the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in
this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood
fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peter's and like the
great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own

but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of erections
how few are domed like st peter's of creatures how few vast as the
whale



chapter the funeral


haul in the chains let the carcase go astern

the vast tackles have now done their duty the peeled white body of the
beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue
it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal
slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and
splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious
flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting
poniards in the whale the vast white headless phantom floats further
and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem
square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous
din for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous
sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair
face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass
of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives

there's a most doleful and most mocking funeral the sea-vultures all in
pious mourning the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled
in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if
peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they
most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not
the mightiest whale is free

nor is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost
survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid man-of-war or
blundering discovery-vessel from afar when the distance obscuring the
swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the
whale's unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the
log shoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware and for years
afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly
sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there
when a stick was held there's your law of precedents there's your
utility of traditions there's the story of your obstinate survival of
old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in
the air there's orthodoxy

thus while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror
to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
world

are you a believer in ghosts my friend there are other ghosts than
the cock-lane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in
them



chapter the sphynx


it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the
sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced
whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason

consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck
on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that
very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the
surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a
discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear
in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many
feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so
much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
into the skull do you not marvel then at stubb's boast that he
demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale

when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale
it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full
grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whale's head embraces
nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a
burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as
vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers scales

the pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was
hoisted against the ship's side about half way out of the sea so that
it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there
with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the
enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head and every yard-arm
on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that
blood-dripping head hung to the pequod's waist like the giant
holofernes's from the girdle of judith

when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went
below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow
lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon
the sea

a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone
from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarter-deck he paused to
gaze over the side then slowly getting into the main-chains he
took stubb's long spade still remaining there after the whale's
decapitation and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
mass placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm and so stood
leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head

it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so
intense a calm it seemed the sphynx's in the desert speak thou vast
and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a
beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head
and tell us the secret thing that is in thee of all divers thou hast
dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleams has
moved amid this world's foundations where unrecorded names and navies
rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this
frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there
in that awful water-land there was thy most familiar home thou hast
been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailor's side
where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down thou
saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart
to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when
heaven seemed false to them thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed
by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper
midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on
unharmed while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms o
head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of
abraham and not one syllable is thine

sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head

aye well now that's cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting
himself while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow
that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
man where away

three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to
us

better and better man would now st paul would come along that way
and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest
atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind



chapter the jeroboam's story


hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than
the ship and soon the pequod began to rock

by and by through the glass the stranger's boats and manned mast-heads
proved her a whale-ship but as she was so far to windward and shooting
by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could
not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would
be made

here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of
the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals
being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale
commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at
considerable distances and with no small facility

the pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's setting
her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring
her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod's lee and
lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side-ladder was being
rigged by starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain the
stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that
the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her
captain was fearful of infecting the pequod's company for though
himself and boat's crew remained untainted and though his ship was half
a rifle-shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing
between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the
land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the
pequod

but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboam's
boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew
very fresh with her main-topsail aback though indeed at times by
the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some
way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings
again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a
conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not
without still another interruption of a very different sort

pulling an oar in the jeroboam's boat was a man of a singular
appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities
make up all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled
all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a
long-skirted cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped
him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a
deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes

so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had
exclaimed that's he that's he the long-togged scaramouch the
town-ho's company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time
previous when the pequod spoke the town-ho according to this account
and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in
question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
jeroboam his story was this

he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna
shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
trap-door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he
carried in his vest-pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder
was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim
having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with
that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common-sense
exterior and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the
jeroboam's whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon
the ship's getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a
freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded
the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby
he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
vicar-general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he
declared these things the dark daring play of his sleepless excited
imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united
to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant
crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of
him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship
especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous
captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that
individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient port the
archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials devoting the ship
and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was
carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew
that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel
was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore
forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any
way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that
gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all
this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand
than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole
command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure
the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before
him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal
homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however
wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking
in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself as
his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but
it is time to return to the pequod

i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain
mayhew who stood in the boat's stern come on board

but now gabriel started to his feet

think think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible
plague

gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but
that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings
drowned all speech

hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted
back

think think of thy whale-boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible
tail

i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if
dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession
of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices
of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm
whale's head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing
it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to
warrant

when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story
concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from
gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed
leagued with him

it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking
a whale-ship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby
dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence
gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white
whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity
pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god
incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some year or two
afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads macey the
chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself
being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all
the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in
persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after
much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last
succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to
the main-royal mast-head was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and
hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants
of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his
boat's bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting
his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance
for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its
quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies
of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious
life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his
descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a
chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsman's head but the
mate for ever sank

it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the
sperm-whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any
sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated
oftener the boat's bow is knocked off or the thigh-board in which the
headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but
strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one
when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is
discernible the man being stark dead

the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descried
from the ship raising a piercing shriek the vial the vial gabriel
called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the
whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence
because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
fore-announced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any
one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship

mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to
him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which
ahab answered aye straightway then gabriel once more started
to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with
downward pointed finger think think of the blasphemer dead and down
there beware of the blasphemer's end

ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have
just bethought me of my letter-bag there is a letter for one of thy
officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag

every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships
whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends
upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus
most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after
attaining an age of two or three years or more

soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled
damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence
of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death
himself might well have been the post-boy

can'st not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye it's but
a dim scrawl what's this as he was studying it out starbuck took a
long cutting-spade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to
insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without
its coming any closer to the ship

meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr har yes mr
harry a woman's pinny hand the man's wife i'll wager aye mr
harry macey ship jeroboam why it's macey and he's dead

poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let
me have it

nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that
way

curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to
receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbuck's hands he
caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat
but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat
drifted a little towards the ship's stern so that as if by magic the
letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel's eager hand he clutched it
in an instant seized the boat-knife and impaling the letter on it
sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahab's feet then
gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in
that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod

as after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
affair



chapter the monkey-rope


in the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale there
is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are
wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying
in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done
everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description
of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned
that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back the blubber-hook
was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook
get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend
queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the
monster's back for the special purpose referred to but in very many
cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the
whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the
whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the
immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the
level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the
whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill
beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the
highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes at least
he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to
observe him as will presently be seen

being the savage's bowsman that is the person who pulled the bow-oar
in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to
attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead
whale's back you have seen italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
a long cord just so from the ship's steep side did i hold queequeg
down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery
a monkey-rope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
waist

it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we
proceed further it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
both ends fast to queequeg's broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow
leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were
wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage
and honour demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag
me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us
queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get
rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed

so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that
while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive
that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of
two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that another's
mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster
and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in
providence for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an
injustice and yet still further pondering while i jerked him now
and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam
him still further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine
was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most
cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality
of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by
mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say
that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the
multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequeg's
monkey-rope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came
very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i
would i only had the management of one end of it


the monkey-rope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod
that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement
upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb
in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible
guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder


i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the
whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall from the incessant
rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy
he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creatures swarmed
round it like bees in a beehive

and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were
it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man

nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a
ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them
accordingly besides the monkey-rope with which i now and then jerked
the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed
a peculiarly ferocious shark he was provided with still another
protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego
and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
whale-spades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and
benevolent of them they meant queequeg's best happiness i admit but
in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both
he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water
those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg
than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there
with that great iron hook poor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his
yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods

well well my dear comrade and twin-brother thought i as i drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matters
it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those
sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks
and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad

but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as
with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs
up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over
the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory
glance hands him what some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands
him a cup of tepid ginger and water

ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near
yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then
standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the
astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have
the goodness to tell me mr dough-boy where lies the virtue of ginger
ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough-boy to kindle a fire
in this shivering cannibal ginger what the devil is ginger
sea-coal firewood lucifer matches tinder gunpowder what the
devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg
here

there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this
business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just
come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it
if you please then watching the mate's countenance he added the
steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap
to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an
apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man

i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough

aye aye steward cried stubb we'll teach you to drug a
harpooneer none of your apothecary's medicine here you want to poison
us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
us all and pocket the proceeds do ye

it was not me cried dough-boy it was aunt charity that brought the
ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but
only this ginger-jub so she called it

ginger-jub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye
to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr
starbuck it is the captain's orders grog for the harpooneer on a
whale

enough replied starbuck only don't hit him again but 

oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of
that sort and this fellow's a weazel what were you about saying sir

only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself

when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort
of tea-caddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was
handed to queequeg the second was aunt charity's gift and that was
freely given to the waves



chapter stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk
over him


it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale's
prodigious head hanging to the pequod's side but we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it
for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the
head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold

now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the
leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to
cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near
the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale
had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the
announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if
opportunity offered

nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two
boats stubb's and flask's were detached in pursuit pulling further
and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at
the mast-head but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or
both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in
plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at
first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a
maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from
view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the
ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being
brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side but having plenty
of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they
paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their
might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was
intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line
in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending
strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance
they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when
instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the
keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose
to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its
drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water
while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were
free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering
his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
him so that they performed a complete circuit

meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close
flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for
lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale's body
rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every
new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that
poured from the smitten rock

at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he
turned upon his back a corpse

while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some
conversation ensued between them

i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said
stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
ignoble a leviathan

wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boat's bow
did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale's
head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whale's
on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never
afterwards capsize

why not

i don't know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so
and he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes think
he'll charm the ship to no good at last i don't half like that chap
stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into
a snake's head stubb

sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a
dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look
down there flask pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of
both hands aye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in
disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
stowed away on board ship he's the devil i say the reason why you
don't see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries
it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of
it he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots

he sleeps in his boots don't he he hasn't got any hammock but i've
seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging

no doubt and it's because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye
see in the eye of the rigging

what's the old man have so much to do with him for

striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose

bargain about what

why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and
the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away
his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then he'll
surrender moby dick

pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that

i don't know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked
one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flag-ship once switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he
was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching
his hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old
governor what business is that of yours says the devil getting
mad i want to use him take him says the governor and by the
lord flask if the devil didn't give john the asiatic cholera before
he got through with him i'll eat this whale in one mouthful but look
sharp ain't you all ready there well then pull ahead and let's get
the whale alongside

i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
towards the ship but i can't remember where

three spaniards adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes did
ye read it there flask i guess ye did

no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me
stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was
the same you say is now on board the pequod

am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesn't the devil live
for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see
any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a
latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin don't you suppose he can
crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask

how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb

do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well that's
the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequod's hold and string
along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that
wouldn't begin to be fedallah's age nor all the coopers in creation
couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough

but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you
meant to give fedallah a sea-toss if you got a good chance now if
he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going
to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell me
that

give him a good ducking anyhow

but he'd crawl back

duck him again and keep ducking him

suppose he should take it into his head to duck you though yes and
drown you what then

i should like to see him try it i'd give him such a pair of black eyes
that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin again for
a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and
hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil
flask so you suppose i'm afraid of the devil who's afraid of
him except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put him in
double-darbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping
people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil
kidnapped he'd roast for him there's a governor

do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab

do i suppose it you'll know it before long flask but i am going now
to keep a sharp look-out on him and if i see anything very suspicious
going on i'll just take him by the nape of his neck and say look
here beelzebub you don't do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord
i'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan
and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short
off at the stump do you see and then i rather guess when he finds
himself docked in that queer fashion he'll sneak off without the poor
satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs

and what will you do with the tail stubb

do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get home what else

now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb

mean or not mean here we are at the ship

the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where
fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing
him

didn't i tell you so said flask yes you'll soon see this right
whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's

in good time flask's saying proved true as before the pequod steeply
leaned over towards the sperm whale's head now by the counterpoise of
both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may
well believe so when on one side you hoist in locke's head you go
over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant's and you come
back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep
trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunder-heads overboard
and then you will float light and right

in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the
ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off
whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and
hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is
called the crown-piece but nothing like this in the present case
had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and
the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
overburdening panniers

meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow
while if the parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only to
blend with and lengthen ahab's as the crew toiled on laplandish
speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing
things



chapter the sperm whale's head contrasted view


here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us
join them and lay together our own

of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right
whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales regularly
hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all
the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between
them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this
moment hanging from the pequod's side and as we may freely go from one
to the other by merely stepping across the deck where i should like
to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology
than here

in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these
heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain
mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale's which the right whale's sadly
lacks there is more character in the sperm whale's head as you behold
it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point
of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is
heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit
giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what
the fishermen technically call a grey-headed whale

let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads namely the two
most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of
the head and low down near the angle of either whale's jaw if you
narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would
fancy to be a young colt's eye so out of all proportion is it to the
magnitude of the head

now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more
than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whale's
eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears and you may fancy for
yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects
through your ears you would find that you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight
and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking
straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not
be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from
behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the
same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the
front of a man what indeed but his eyes

moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes
are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of
the whale's eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the
impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore
must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct
picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and
nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world
from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window but with the
whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct
windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whale's
eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be
remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes

a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a
hint so long as a man's eyes are open in the light the act of seeing
is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing
whatever objects are before him nevertheless any one's experience
will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively
and completely to examine any two things however large or however
small at one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side
by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two
objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in
order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to
bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes
in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more
comprehensive combining and subtle than man's that he can at the same
moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one
side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he
can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems
in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this
comparison

it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the
extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer
frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their
divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them

but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an
entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads
for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf
whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so
wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with
respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed
between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has
an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without

is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which
is smaller than a hare's but if his eyes were broad as the lens of
herschel's great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of
cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of
hearing not at all why then do you try to enlarge your mind
subtilize it

let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand cant
over the sperm whale's head that it may lie bottom up then ascending
by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not
that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we
might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but
let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what
a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth from floor to ceiling
lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as
bridal satins

but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box with the hinge at one
end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead
and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such
alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these
spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold
when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there
suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging
straight down at right-angles with his body for all the world like a
ship's jib-boom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of
sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his
jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a
reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock-jaws upon
him

in most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised
artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles
including canes umbrella-stocks and handles to riding-whips

with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an
anchor and when the proper time comes some few days after the other
work queequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists
are set to drawing teeth with a keen cutting-spade queequeg lances
the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being
rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag
stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally forty-two
teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled
after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and
piled away like joists for building houses



chapter the right whale's head contrasted view


crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right whale's
head

as in general shape the noble sperm whale's head may be compared to a
roman war-chariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded
so at a broad view the right whale's head bears a rather inelegant
resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe two hundred years ago an
old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker's last and
in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with
the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her
progeny

but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and
look at these two f-shaped spoutholes you would take the whole head
for an enormous bass-viol and these spiracles the apertures in its
sounding-board then again if you fix your eye upon this strange
crested comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass this green
barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the
southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes
solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak
with a bird's nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live
crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the
technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for
him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very
sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip
what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenter's
measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout
that will yield you some gallons of oil and more

a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped
the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes
caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold
we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should
take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the
road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a
pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridge-pole there while
these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half
vertical scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a
side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown
bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily
mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres
through which the right whale strains the water and in whose
intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through
the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of bone as they
stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves
hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age
as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this
criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical
probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater
age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable

in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous
whiskers inside of the whale's mouth another hogs bristles a
third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language
there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
upper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth


this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or
rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these
tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance


as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers
blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and
other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has
long been on the decline it was in queen anne's time that the bone was
in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those
ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as
you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we
nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a
tent spread over the same bone

but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing
in the right whale's mouth look around you afresh seeing all these
colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think
you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its
thousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
turkey the tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the
mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i
should say it was a six-barreler that is it will yield you about that
amount of oil

ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started
with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely
different heads to sum up then in the right whale's there is no great
well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a
lower jaw like the sperm whale's nor in the sperm whale are there any
of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a
tongue again the right whale has two external spout-holes the sperm
whale only one

look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet lie
together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will
not be very long in following

can you catch the expression of the sperm whale's there it is the same
he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem
now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the
other head's expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident
against the vessel's side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not
this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in
facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm
whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years



chapter the battering-ram


ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whale's head i would have
you as a sensible physiologist simply particularly remark its front
aspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate
it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated
intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged
there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle
this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of
the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be
found in all recorded history

you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale
the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
receives the boom-like lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely
under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth
were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale has
no external nose and that what nose he has his spout hole is on the
top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front
wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm
whale's head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender
prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider
that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of
the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you
get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial
development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad
finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise
the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of
the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy
in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the
body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head
but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so
thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not
handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by
the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though
the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses hoofs i do not
think that any sensation lurks in it

bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the
sailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming
contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold
there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest
and toughest of ox-hide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars by
itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but
supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that
as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them
capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale
as far as i know has no such provision in him considering too
the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out
of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope
considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically
occurred to me i say that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there
may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with
the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and
contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to
which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes

now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable
wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
is by the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest
insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the
specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable
braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant
incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale
stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic
with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow for
unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist
in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to
encounter how small the chances for the provincials then what befell
the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's veil at lais



chapter the great heidelburgh tun


now comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
upon

regarding the sperm whale's head as a solid oblong you may on an
inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower
is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the
expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the
forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two
almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal
wall of a thick tendinous substance


quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both
sides


the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb
of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand
infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
extent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great
heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is
mystically carved in front so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms
innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished
with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun
of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages
namely the highly-prized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid
and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed
in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly
fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to
concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the
first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whale's
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from
unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and
dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business
of securing what you can

i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun
was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane like the
lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whale's
case

it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and since as
has been elsewhere set forth the head embraces one third of the whole
length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for
a good sized whale you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's
side

as in decapitating the whale the operator's instrument is brought close
to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless
untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head also which
is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by
the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side
make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter

thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous and in
this particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the sperm
whale's great heidelburgh tun is tapped



chapter cistern and buckets


nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect
posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm to the
part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carried
with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts
travelling through a single-sheaved block securing this block so that
it hangs down from the yard-arm he swings one end of the rope till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then hand-over-hand down
the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he
lands on the summit of the head there still high elevated above the
rest of the company to whom he vivaciously cries he seems some turkish
muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower a
short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches
for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business
he proceeds very heedfully like a treasure-hunter in some old house
sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time
this cautious search is over a stout iron-bound bucket precisely like
a well-bucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other
end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three
alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian
to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this
pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun
till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the
whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail
of new milk carefully lowered from its height the full-freighted
vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large
tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until
the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to
ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun
until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down

now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a
queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian
was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed
hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the
place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil
one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular
reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden
as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up my god poor
tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well
dropped head-foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with
a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight

man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first
came to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot
into it so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost
before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime
there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before
lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea
as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only
the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
depth to which he had sunk

at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing
the whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles a
sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all
one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with
a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship
reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook
upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be
on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent
motions of the head

come down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand
holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he
would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line
rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the
buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out

in heaven's name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge
there avast how will that help him jamming that iron-bound bucket on
top of his head avast will ye

stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a
rocket

almost in the same instant with a thunder-boom the enormous mass
dropped into the sea like niagara's table-rock into the whirlpool the
suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering
copper and all caught their breath as half swinging now over the
sailors heads and now over the water daggoo through a thick mist of
spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor
buried-alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea
but hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away when a naked figure
with a boarding-sword in his hand was for one swift moment seen
hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my
brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the
side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and
no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now
jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship

ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch
overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust
upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a grave

both both it is both cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and
soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and
with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the
waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was
long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk

now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after
the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made
side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then
dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards
and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first
thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that
was not as it ought to be and might occasion great trouble he had
thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a
somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in
the good old way head foremost as for the great head itself that was
doing as well as could be expected

and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg
the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully
accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently
hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten
midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing
riding and rowing

i know that this queer adventure of the gay-header's will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either
seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore an accident
which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the
indian's considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
sperm whale's well

but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought
the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and
most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at
all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been
nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense
tendinous wall of the well a double welded hammered substance as i
have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which
sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this
substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the
other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank
very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance
for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say yes it
was a running delivery so it was

now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious
perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be
recalled the delicious death of an ohio honey-hunter who seeking honey
in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that
leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed
how many think ye have likewise fallen into plato's honey head and
sweetly perished there



chapter the prairie


to scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this
leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as
yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar
or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the
pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats
of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces
of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the
modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and
his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore
though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these
two semi-sciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things
i achieve what i can

physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature
he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its
entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect
the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire
cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable
to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in
keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose dash the nose
from phidias's marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless
leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so
stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were
hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a
nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical
voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat your noble
conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a
nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon
obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne

in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this
aspect is sublime

in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the
morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a
touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the
elephant's brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is as
that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees
it signifies god done this day by my hand but in most creatures
nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine
land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like
shakespeare's or melancthon's rise so high and descend so low that the
eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all
above them in the forehead's wrinkles you seem to track the antlered
thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the
snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and
mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified
that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the
dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living
nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is
revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper
nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with
riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men
nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way
viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you
plainly perceive that horizontal semi-crescentic depression in the
forehead's middle which in man is lavater's mark of genius

but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written
a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his
doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his
pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale
been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by
their child-magian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile
because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no
tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of
protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure
back to their birth-right the merry may-day gods of old and livingly
enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted
hill then be sure exalted to jove's high seat the great sperm whale
shall lord it

champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is
no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man's and every being's
face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing
fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could
not read the simplest peasant's face in its profounder and more subtle
meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of
the sperm whale's brow i but put that brow before you read it if you
can



chapter the nut


if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his
brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square

in the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as
the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
base but in life as we have elsewhere seen this inclined plane is
angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to
bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater in
another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
depth reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain the brain is at
least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden
away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the
amplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is it
secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine lying in strange
folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more
in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part
of him as the seat of his intelligence

it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in
the creature's living intact state is an entire delusion as for his
true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the
whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common
world

if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from
the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down
to the human magnitude among a plate of men's skulls and you would
involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on
one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would say this
man had no self-esteem and no veneration and by those negations
considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most
exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is

but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain you
deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea
for you if you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine
you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung
necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebrae are absolutely
undeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it
the germans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once
pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with
the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of basso-relievo the
beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a man's
character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel
your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine
never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the
firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world

apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial
cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being
eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as
it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but
for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course
this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance the
spinal cord as the brain and directly communicates with the brain
and what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brain's
cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost
equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be
unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically
for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his
brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
magnitude of his spinal cord

but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the
sperm whale's hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one
of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer
convex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call this
high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale
and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to
know



chapter the pequod meets the virgin


the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick
de deer master of bremen

at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and
germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the pacific

for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects
while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a
boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the
bows instead of the stern

what has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something
wavingly held by the german impossible a lamp-feeder

not that said stubb no no it's a coffee-pot mr starbuck he's
coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman don't you see that big
tin can there alongside of him that's his boiling water oh he's all
right is the yarman

go along with you cried flask it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can
he's out of oil and has come a-begging

however curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
whale-ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing
really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did
indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as flask did declare

as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all
heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately
turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darkness his last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically
called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of
jungfrau or the virgin

his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his
ship's side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mast-heads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that
without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard he slewed
round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders

now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german
boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequod's
keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger
they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind
rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness
they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great
wide parchment upon the sea

full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge
humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted
with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged
to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for
such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck
to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him
because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one
like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was
short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush
and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean
commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried
extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble

who's got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomach-ache i'm
afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach-ache adverse
winds are holding mad christmas in him boys it's the first foul wind
i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before
it must be he's lost his tiller

as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her
way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly
turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends expose the cause of his devious
wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost
that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say

only wait a bit old chap and i'll give ye a sling for that wounded
arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale-line near him

mind he don't sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the
german will have him

with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most
valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were
going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit
for the time at this juncture the pequod's keels had shot by the three
german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had derick's
boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign
rivals the only thing they feared was that from being already so
nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they
could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite
confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding
gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats

the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mocks and dares
me with the very poor-box i filled for him not five minutes ago then
in his old intense whisper give way greyhounds dog to it

i tell ye what it is men cried stubb to his crew it's against
my religion to get mad but i'd like to eat that villainous
yarman pull won't ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do
ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come
why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel who's that been dropping an
anchor overboard we don't budge an inch we're becalmed halloo here's
grass growing in the boat's bottom and by the lord the mast there's
budding this won't do boys look at that yarman the short and long of
it is men will ye spit fire or not

oh see the suds he makes cried flask dancing up and down what
a hump oh do pile on the beef lays like a log oh my lads do
spring slap-jacks and quahogs for supper you know my lads baked
clams and muffins oh do do spring he's a hundred barreller don't
lose him now don't oh don't see that yarman oh won't ye pull for
your duff my lads such a sog such a sogger don't ye love sperm
there goes three thousand dollars men a bank a whole bank the bank
of england oh do do do what's that yarman about now

at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
advancing boats and also his oil-can perhaps with the double view
of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss

the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty
thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils what d'ye say
tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
for the honour of old gayhead what d'ye say

i say pull like god-dam cried the indian

fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequod's
three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed
momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of
the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up
proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry
of there she slides now hurrah for the white-ash breeze down with
the yarman sail over him

but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all
their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not
a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade
of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free
his white-ash and while in consequence derick's boat was nigh to
capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage that was
a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a
mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the german's quarter
an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whale's
immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the
foaming swell that he made

it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was
now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight
and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the
sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i
seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the
air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a
voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear
of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him
he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle
and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his
amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to
appal the stoutest man who so pitied

seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod's
boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick
chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart
ere the last chance would for ever escape

but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three
tigers queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively sprang to their feet
and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and
darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket
irons entered the whale blinding vapours of foam and white-fire the
three boats in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush bumped
the german's aside with such force that both derick and his baffled
harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels

don't be afraid my butter-boxes cried stubb casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by ye'll be picked up presently all
right i saw some sharks astern st bernard's dogs you know relieve
distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a
sunbeam hurrah here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad
cougar this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on
a plain makes the wheel-spokes fly boys when you fasten to him that
way and there's danger of being pitched out too when you strike a
hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to davy
jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale
carries the everlasting mail

but the monster's run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he
tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round
the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them
while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they
caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at
last owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue the
gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three
sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound
for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more
line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have
been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it
is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising
again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril
of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the
best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken
whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the
enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale something less than
 square feet the pressure of the water is immense we all know
what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even
here above-ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale
bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at
least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated
it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships with all their guns
and stores and men on board

as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down
into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths
what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and
placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows
seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan
was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and
to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly said canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons
or his head with fish-spears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot
hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as
straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble
he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength
of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the
mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequod's fish-spears

in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head

stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly
vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by
magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every
oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part
from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce
upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are
scared from it into the sea

haul in haul in cried starbuck again he's rising

the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hand's breadth
could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two
ship's lengths of the hunters

his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals
there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins whereby
when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities
it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels so
that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly
drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is
heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance
below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant
streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant
and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and
bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will
flow whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible
hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously
drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him
they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept
continually playing while the natural spout-hole in his head was only
at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the
air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him
had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was
untouched

as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of
his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly
revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were
beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the
noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whale's eyes
had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see
but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his
blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the
gay bridals and other merry-makings of men and also to illuminate the
solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all
still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely
discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the
flank

a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once

avast cried starbuck there's no need of that

but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than
sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury
blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews
all over with showers of gore capsizing flask's boat and marring the
bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by
loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up
the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most
piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water
is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with half-stifled
melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
ground so the last long dying spout of the whale

soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately
by starbuck's orders lines were secured to it at different points so
that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a
few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when
the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was
strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains for it was plain
that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the
bottom

it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh
on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of
harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales
with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any
kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been
some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a
lance-head of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron
the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and
when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before
america was discovered

what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further
discoveries by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
to the sea owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink
however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the
last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship
would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the
body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was
the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and
cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime
everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the
deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship
groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and
cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation
in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable
fluke-chains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low
had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all
approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to
the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over

hold on hold on won't ye cried stubb to the body don't be in such
a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go
for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run
one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife and cut the big chains

knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter's heavy
hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing
at the largest fluke-chains but a few strokes full of sparks were
given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific
snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank

now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm
whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great
buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and
broken-hearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that
this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it
is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with
noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of
life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant
heroes do sometimes sink

be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this
accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty
right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale
his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this
incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances
where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale
again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this
is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious
magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line-of-battle ship could
hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among
the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they
fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone
down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again

it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
the pequod's mast-heads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering
her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a fin-back
belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its
incredible power of swimming nevertheless the fin-back's spout is so
similar to the sperm whale's that by unskilful fishermen it is often
mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in
valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail
made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to
leeward still in bold hopeful chase

oh many are the fin-backs and many are the dericks my friend



chapter the honour and glory of whaling


there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
method

the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up
to the very spring-head of it so much the more am i impressed with its
great honourableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many
great demi-gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other
have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection
that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a
fraternity

the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and
to the eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those
were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to
succor the distressed and not to fill men's lamp-feeders every one
knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda
the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the sea-coast and as
leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince
of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered
and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely
achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this
leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this
arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast
in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton
of a whale which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to
be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans
took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what
seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this
it was from joppa that jonah set sail

akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of st george and
the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many
old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and
often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a
dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale
in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it
would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but
encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle
with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a
perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly
up to a whale

let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though
the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffin-like shape and though the battle is depicted
on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance
of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists
and considering that as in perseus case st george's whale might have
crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal
ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or sea-horse
bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible
with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to
hold this so-called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in
fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will
fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by
name who being planted before the ark of israel his horse's head and
both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or
fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even
a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we
harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honourable
company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a
whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with
disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
much better entitled to st george's decoration than they

whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long
remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that
antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoicing good
deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether
that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere
appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed
from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i
claim him for one of our clan

but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of
hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly
they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet

nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole
roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal
kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now
to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one
of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine
vishnoo himself for our lord vishnoo who by the first of his ten
earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale
when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate
the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to
vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books
whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before
beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these
vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became
incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths
rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even
as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman

perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo there's a member-roll
for you what club but the whaleman's can head off like that



chapter jonah historically regarded


reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the
preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical
story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greeks
and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times
equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the
dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
traditions one whit the less facts for all that

one old sag-harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the hebrew
story was this he had one of those quaint old-fashioned bibles
embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented
jonah's whale with two spouts in his head a peculiarity only true
with respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the
varieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this
saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small
but to this bishop jebb's anticipative answer is ready it is not
necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the
whale's belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and
this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the
right whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables and
comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have
ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right
whale is toothless

another reason which sag-harbor he went by that name urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in
reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices but
this objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist
supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
dead whale even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned
their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has
been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was
thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape
to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure-head
and i would add possibly called the whale as some craft are
nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there
been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned
in the book of jonah merely meant a life-preserver an inflated bag
of wind which the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a
watery doom poor sag-harbor therefore seems worsted all round but
he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i
remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean
sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days
journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three
days journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast
how is that

but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the
way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through
the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the
persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete
circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris
waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to
swim in besides this idea of jonah's weathering the cape of good hope
at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great
headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make
modern history a liar

but all these foolish arguments of old sag-harbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing
that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and
abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a
portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah's going to nineveh
via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of
the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly
enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and
some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harris's voyages
speaks of a turkish mosque built in honour of jonah in which mosque was
a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil



chapter pitchpoling


to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are
anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it
to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are
hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to
make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing
his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau
disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling
under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the
unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from
the craft's bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some
particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event

towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight
as of cleopatra's barges from actium

nevertheless the boats pursued and stubb's was foremost by great
exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the
stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal
flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the
planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became
imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but
to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and
furious what then remained

of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced
none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small
sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it
is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand
fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme
headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve
feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon
and also of a lighter material pine it is furnished with a small rope
called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to
the hand after darting

but before going further it is important to mention here that though
the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it
is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful
on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a
general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any
pitchpoling comes into play

look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and
equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel
in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead
handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its
length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers up
the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his
grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before
his waistband's middle he levels it at the whale when covering
him with it he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand thereby
elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his
palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler
balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless
impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of
sparkling water he now spouts red blood

that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis july's immortal
fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old
orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then
tashtego lad i'd have ye hold a canakin to the jet and we'd drink
round it yea verily hearts alive we'd brew choice punch in the
spread of his spout-hole there and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
living stuff

again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated
the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the tow-line is
slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and
mutely watches the monster die



chapter the fountain


that for six thousand years and no one knows how many millions of ages
before the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea
and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so
many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back
thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
whale watching these sprinklings and spoutings that all this should
be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter
minutes past one o'clock pm of this sixteenth day of december ad
 it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings
are after all really water or nothing but vapour this is surely a
noteworthy thing

let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items
contingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is
combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod
might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface
but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular
lungs like a human being's the whale can only live by inhaling the
disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for
his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree
breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm
whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and
what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he
breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head

if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function
indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the
blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i
shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words
assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then
live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the
case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full
hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or
so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has
no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine
he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of
vermicelli-like vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are
completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more
a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in
him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus
supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs
the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the
supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more
cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of
that leviathan in having his spoutings out as the fishermen phrase
it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the
sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform
with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and
jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he
rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to
a minute now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that
he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular
allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he
finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that
in different individuals these rates are different but in any one
they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his
spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere
descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the
whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for
not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing
a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o
hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee

in man breathing is incessantly going on one breath only serving
for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to
attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the
sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time

it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole if
it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then
i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell
seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all
answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole and being so clogged
with two elements it could not be expected to have the power of
smelling but owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be water or
whether it be vapour no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on
this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper
olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no
cologne-water in the sea

furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
canal and as that long canal like the grand erie canal is furnished
with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of
air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice
unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles
he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say
seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to
this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener

now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it
is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along
horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little
to one side this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this
gas-pipe is also a water-pipe in other words whether the spout of the
sperm whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that
exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and
discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly
communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this
is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because
the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he
accidentally takes in water but the sperm whale's food is far beneath
the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would besides if
you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find
that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods
of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration

but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out
you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not
tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to
settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the
knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in
it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely

the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it
when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading
all around him and if at such times you should think that you really
perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are
not merely condensed from its vapour or how do you know that they
are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head for
even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm with
his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert even then
the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under
a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
rain

nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering
into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to
this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into
slight contact with the outer vapoury shreds of the jet which will
often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of
the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer
contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view
or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm
wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to
evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt
it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you
the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let
this deadly spout alone

still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my
hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides
other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations
touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale
i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed
fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other
whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am
convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as
plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes
up a certain semi-visible steam while in the act of thinking deep
thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the
curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there
a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my
head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought
after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon
this seems an additional argument for the above supposition

and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild
head overhung by a canopy of vapour engendered by his incommunicable
contemplations and that vapour as you will sometimes see it glorified
by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts
for d'ye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate
vapour and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a
heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny
but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts
of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this
combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who
regards them both with equal eye



chapter the tail


other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i
celebrate a tail

reckoning the largest sized sperm whale's tail to begin at that point of
the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises
upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet the
compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms
or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness
at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways
recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in
no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in
the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the
full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across

the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut
into it and you find that three distinct strata compose it upper
middle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are
long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running
crosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as
anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman
walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
great strength of the masonry

but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough
the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins
and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and
largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent
measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point
could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it

nor does this its amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful
flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through
a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most
appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony
but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful
strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons that
all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its
charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god
the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever
they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled
hermaphroditical italian pictures in which his idea has been most
successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all
brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine
one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form
the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings

such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether
wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it
be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no
fairy's arm can transcend it

five great motions are peculiar to it first when used as a fin for
progression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping
fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes

first being horizontal in its position the leviathan's tail acts in
a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never
wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the
whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scroll-wise coiled
forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this
which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when
furiously swimming his side-fins only serve to steer by

second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his
conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in
striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the
blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed
air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply
irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only
salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the
opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale
boat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed
plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most
serious result these submerged side blows are so often received in the
fishery that they are accounted mere child's play some one strips off
a frock and the hole is stopped

third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
elephant's trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface
of the sea and if he feel but a sailor's whisker woe to that sailor
whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch
had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of
darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flower-market and with
low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their
zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not
possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet
another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk
and extracted the dart

fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
of his dignity and kitten-like he plays on the ocean as if it were a
hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of
his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the
thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great
gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour
from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was
the smoke from the touch-hole

fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely
out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into
the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they
downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breach somewhere
else to be described this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the
grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth
his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in
gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in
the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the
archangels standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east
all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with
peaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment
of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of
the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african
elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout
of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of
antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silence

the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the
elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two
opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
to leviathan so compared with leviathan's tail his trunk is but the
stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as
the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash
of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have
one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews
into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls


though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to
the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious
similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant
will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it
jet it forth in a stream


the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability
to express it at times there are gestures in it which though they
would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an
extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures
that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free-mason
signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods
intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other
motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and
unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may
then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know
not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more
how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back
parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i
cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about
his face i say again he has no face



chapter the grand armada


the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending south-eastward from
the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point of all asia
in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a
vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia
and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded
oriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the
straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chiefly vessels
bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas

those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green
promontory known to seamen as java head they not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and
considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels
and gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental
sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such
treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the
appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the all-grasping
western world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied
with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these
orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from
the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries
past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra
and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while
they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce
their claim to more solid tribute

time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among
the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the
point of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
have received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these
corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present
day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in
those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged

with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and
thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and
there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and
gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there
by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the
known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending
upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled
in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the
sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most
reasonably be presumed to be haunting it

but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does his crew
drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now
the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs
no sustenance but what's in himself so ahab mark this too in the
whaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be
transferred to foreign wharves the world-wandering whale-ship carries
no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a
whole lake's contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with
utilities not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge she
carries years water in her clear old prime nantucket water which
when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to
drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from
the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may
have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score
of ports the whale-ship in all that interval may not have sighted
one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had
come they would only answer well boys here's the ark

now as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of
java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of
the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more
and more upon java head the look-outs were repeatedly hailed and
admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the
land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils
the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was
descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of
singular magnificence saluted us

but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which
of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales
instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in
former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes
embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if
numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual
assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into
such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the
best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months
together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly
saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands

broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and
forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon
a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
noon-day air unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the right
whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft
drooping boughs of a willow the single forward-slanting spout of the
sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually
rising and falling away to leeward

seen from the pequod's deck then as she would rise on a high hill of
the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up into the
air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed
like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried
of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height

as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains
accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain
even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and
swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre

crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers
handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their
yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that
chased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy
into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby
dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped
white-elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with
stun-sail piled on stun-sail we sailed along driving these leviathans
before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly
directing attention to something in our wake

corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear
it seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and falling something
like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and
go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling
his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole
crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the
sails malays sir and after us

as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should
fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in hot
pursuit to make up for their over-cautious delay but when the swift
pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very
kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to
her own chosen pursuit mere riding-whips and rowels to her that they
were as with glass under arm ahab to-and-fro paced the deck in his
forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the
bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed
his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in
which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that
gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that
same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end
and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and
inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their
curses when all these conceits had passed through his brain ahab's
brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some
stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm
thing from its place

but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and
when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the
pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra
side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining
upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained
upon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at
length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them
and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but
no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm
whale become notified of the three keels that were after them though
as yet a mile in their rear than they rallied again and forming
in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like
flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity

stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the white-ash and
after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase
when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive
it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns
in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now
broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in the
indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation
in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly
swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they
plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was still more
strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed
as it were helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the
sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over
the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly have evinced
such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic
of almost all herding creatures though banding together in tens of
thousands the lion-maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a
solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded
together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit they will at the
slightest alarm of fire rush helter-skelter for the outlets crowding
trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best
therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales
before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
infinitely outdone by the madness of men

though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in
those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one
lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes time
queequeg's harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight
for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the
whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and
indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present
one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift
monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid
adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb

as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we
thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by
the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest and striving to steer
through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushed

but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away
from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the
time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our
way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time
to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted
duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the
shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one
to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface
and for an instant threatened to swamp us hard down with your tail
there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed
calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity

all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented
by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood
of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each
other's grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then
attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line
being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly
among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales
are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm
whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must
kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing
them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it
is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition our boat
was furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully
darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the
enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like
malefactors with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the
act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one
of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it
away dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from
under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we
stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for
the time

it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons were
it not that as we advanced into the herd our whale's way greatly
diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the
circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so that
when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways
vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we
glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if
from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here
the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard
but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth
satin-like surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture
thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were now
in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every
commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of
the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight
or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of
horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic
circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones and so have
gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing
whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no
possible chance of escape was at present afforded us we must watch for
a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only
admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake
we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women
and children of this routed host

now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by
the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square
miles at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time might be
deceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this
circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely
locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the
herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way
innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller
whales now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
lake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still
becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household
dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and
touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched
their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the
time refrained from darting it

but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still
stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended
in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to
become mothers the lake as i have hinted was to a considerable depth
exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly
and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different
lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still
spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence even so did the
young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if
we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new-born sight floating on their
sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little
infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might
have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in
girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet
recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the
maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final
spring the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar's bow the delicate
side-fins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the
plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign
parts

line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him
fast who line him who struck two whale one big one little

what ails ye man cried starbuck

look-e here said queequeg pointing down

as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows
the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame
leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not
seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with
the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that
the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets of the seas
seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan
amours in the deep


the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike
most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation
which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a
time though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and
jacob a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously
situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves
extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a
nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance the mother's pouring milk
and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods the milk is very sweet
and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries
when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum


and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled
in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of
my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and
while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and
deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy

meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of
room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight
of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or
maiming his gigantic tail-tendon it is done by darting a short-handled
cutting-spade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again
a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not
effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along
with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of
the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone
mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay
wherever he went

but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle
enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to
inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the
intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that
by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had
become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed he had also run
away with the cutting-spade in him and while the free end of the rope
attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the
harpoon-line round his tail the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning
through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and
tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own
comrades

this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted
by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to
heave and swell the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished
in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was
departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the
tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river hudson breaks up in
spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre
as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck
and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern

oars oars he intensely whispered seizing the helm gripe your
oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him off
you queequeg the whale there prick him hit him stand up stand
up and stay so spring men pull men never mind their backs scrape
them scrape away

the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a
narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor
we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly
and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many
similar hair-breadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had
just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales
all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply
purchased by the loss of queequeg's hat who while standing in the bows
to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by
the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close
by

riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having
clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but
the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales
might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had
killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which
are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand
are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to
mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should
the boats of any other ship draw near

the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
saying in the fishery the more whales the less fish of all the
drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for
the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other
craft than the pequod



chapter schools and schoolmasters


the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm
whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
vast aggregations

now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must
have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are
occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each
such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those
composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young
vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated

in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces
his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about
over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces
and endearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and
his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest
leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not
more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male they are
comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen
yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the
whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint

it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely
search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower
of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from
spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all
unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and
down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental
waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other
excessive temperature of the year

when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange
suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming
that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies
with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away
high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be
permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the
bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed
for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the
most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales
who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with
their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving
for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not
a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters furrowed
heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and
dislocated mouths

but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harem's lord then is it very diverting to watch
that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario
like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines
granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give
chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish
of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the
sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must
take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for
like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord
whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so
being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the
world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour
of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends
her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated
turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our
ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life
forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old
soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his
prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors

now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so
is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably
satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad
inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title
schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed
upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first
thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of
vidocq and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that
famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of
those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils

the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm
whales almost universally a lone whale as a solitary leviathan is
called proves an ancient one like venerable moss-bearded daniel boone
he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to
wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though
she keeps so many moody secrets

the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously
mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while
those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or
forty-barrel-bulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious
of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter
excepting those wondrous grey-headed grizzled whales sometimes met
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout

the forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools like
a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness
tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no
prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though
and when about three-fourths grown break up and separately go about in
quest of settlements that is harems

another point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a
forty-barrel-bull poor devil all his comrades quit him but strike
a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as
themselves to fall a prey



chapter fast-fish and loose-fish


the allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge

it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company
a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed
and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised
many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for
example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale
the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and
drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a
calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus
the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between
the fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal
undisputed law applicable to all cases

perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
enactment was that of holland it was decreed by the states-general in
ad but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and
lawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpasses justinian's pandects and the by-laws of
the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people's
business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen anne's farthing
or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they

i a fast-fish belongs to the party fast to it

ii a loose-fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it

but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
expound it

first what is a fast-fish alive or dead a fish is technically fast
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all
controllable by the occupant or occupants a mast an oar a nine-inch
cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same
likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other
recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it plainly
evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their
intention so to do

these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks the
coke-upon-littleton of the fist true among the more upright and
honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases
where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but
others are by no means so scrupulous

some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
in england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had
succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of
their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat
itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up
with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it
before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were
remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs
teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done
he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained
attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the
plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line
harpoons and boat

mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was
the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on
to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con
case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wife's
viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in
the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to
recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he
then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the
great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet
abandon her he did so that she became a loose-fish and therefore
when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her the lady then became that
subsequent gentleman's property along with whatever harpoon might have
been found sticking in her

now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale
and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other

these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very
learned judge in set terms decided to wit that as for the boat he
awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it
to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale
harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because
it was a loose-fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons
and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish
acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards
took the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took
the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs

a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might
possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the
matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in
the above cited case these two laws touching fast-fish and loose-fish
i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human
jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture
the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two
props to stand on

is it not a saying in every one's mouth possession is half of the law
that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often
possession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of
russian serfs and republican slaves but fast-fish whereof possession is
the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last
mite but a fast-fish what is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion
with a door-plate for a waif what is that but a fast-fish what is the
ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor woebegone
the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone's family from starvation
what is that ruinous discount but a fast-fish what is the archbishop of
savesoul's income of l seized from the scant bread and cheese
of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers all sure of heaven
without any of savesoul's help what is that globular l but a
fast-fish what are the duke of dunder's hereditary towns and hamlets
but fast-fish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor
ireland but a fast-fish what to that apostolic lancer brother
jonathan is texas but a fast-fish and concerning all these is not
possession the whole of the law

but if the doctrine of fast-fish be pretty generally applicable
the kindred doctrine of loose-fish is still more widely so that is
internationally and universally applicable

what was america in but a loose-fish in which columbus struck the
spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress
what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india
to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all
loose-fish

what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but
loose-fish what all men's minds and opinions but loose-fish what is
the principle of religious belief in them but a loose-fish what to
the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but
loose-fish what is the great globe itself but a loose-fish and what
are you reader but a loose-fish and a fast-fish too



chapter heads or tails


de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam
bracton l c 


latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the
context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that land the king as honourary grand harpooneer must have the head
and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which
in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate
remainder now as this law under a modified form is to this day in
force in england and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
touching the general law of fast and loose-fish it is here treated of
in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts
the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially
reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in
curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in
force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within
the last two years

it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one
of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the
jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden
holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal
emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment
his by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so
because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
them

now when these poor sun-burnt mariners bare-footed and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat
fish high and dry promising themselves a good l from the precious
oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good
ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares up
steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with
a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whale's head
he says hands off this fish my masters is a fast-fish i seize it
as the lord warden's upon this the poor mariners in their respectful
consternation so truly english knowing not what to say fall to
vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing
from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter
or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy
of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for
his ideas made bold to speak

please sir who is the lord warden

the duke

but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish

it is his

we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is
all that to go to the duke's benefit we getting nothing at all for our
pains but our blisters

it is his

is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
getting a livelihood

it is his

i thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
this whale

it is his

won't the duke be content with a quarter or a half

it is his

in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of
wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular
lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman
of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to
take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to
which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published
that he had already done so and received the money and would be
obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend
gentleman would decline meddling with other people's business is
this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three
kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars

it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs
inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with
that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives
us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs to
the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the
soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
matters

but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason
for that ye lawyers

in his treatise on queen-gold or queen-pinmoney an old king's bench
author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queen's
that ye queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this
was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or
right whale was largely used in ladies bodices but this same bone
is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for
a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be
presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here

there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers the whale
and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and
nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue
i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by
inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
way as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there
seems a reason in all things even in law



chapter the pequod meets the rose-bud


in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan
insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browne ve


it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we
were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury mid-day sea that the many
noses on the pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the
three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was
smelt in the sea

i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are
some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they
would keel up before long

presently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in the distance
lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours from
his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled and
hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside
must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that
has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse
it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must
exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are
incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded
by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it
yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that
the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and
by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose

coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman
had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more
of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of
those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort
of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the
proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn
up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted
whales in general

the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed
he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales

there's a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the
ship's bows there's a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes
of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering
their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they
will get won't be enough to dip the captain's wick into aye we all
know these things but look ye here's a crappo that is content with our
leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with
scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor
devil i say pass round a hat some one and let's make him a present
of a little oil for dear charity's sake for what oil he'll get from
that drugged whale there wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail no not
in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why i'll agree to get
more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than
he'll get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it
may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris
i wonder now if our old man has thought of that it's worth trying yes
i'm for it and so saying he started for the quarter-deck

by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether
or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of
escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb
now called his boat's crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing
across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french
taste the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper
spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a
symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head boards in
large gilt letters he read bouton de rose rose-button or rose-bud
and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship

though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet
the word rose and the bulbous figure-head put together sufficiently
explained the whole to him

a wooden rose-bud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will
do very well but how like all creation it smells

now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to
the blasted whale and so talk over it

arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he
bawled bouton-de-rose ahoy are there any of you bouton-de-roses that
speak english

yes rejoined a guernsey-man from the bulwarks who turned out to be
the chief-mate

well then my bouton-de-rose-bud have you seen the white whale

what whale

the white whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye seen him

never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whale no

very good then good bye now and i'll call again in a minute

then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning
over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands
into a trumpet and shouted no sir no upon which ahab retired and
stubb returned to the frenchman

he now perceived that the guernsey-man who had just got into the
chains and was using a cutting-spade had slung his nose in a sort of
bag

what's the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it

i wish it was broken or that i didn't have any nose at all answered
the guernsey-man who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
much but what are you holding yours for

oh nothing it's a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day ain't it
air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye
bouton-de-rose

what in the devil's name do you want here roared the guernseyman
flying into a sudden passion

oh keep cool cool yes that's the word why don't you pack those
whales in ice while you're working at em but joking aside though do
you know rose-bud that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such whales as for that dried up one there he hasn't a gill in his
whole carcase

i know that well enough but d'ye see the captain here won't believe
it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but
come aboard and mayhap he'll believe you if he won't me and so i'll
get out of this dirty scrape

anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb
and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented
itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the
heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow
and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their
noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms
now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the
mast-head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the
plague dipped oakum in coal-tar and at intervals held it to their
nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke so that it
constantly filled their olfactories

stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
the captain's round-house abaft and looking in that direction saw a
fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within
this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating
against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captain's
round-house cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could
not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times

marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the
guernsey-man had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate
expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus
who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle
sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey-man
had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore
held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and
confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all
dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan
of theirs the guernsey-man under cover of an interpreter's office was
to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as
for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in
him during the interview

by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a
small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain with
large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest
with watch-seals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely
introduced by the guernsey-man who at once ostentatiously put on the
aspect of interpreting between them

what shall i say to him first said he

why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you
may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me
though i don't pretend to be a judge

he says monsieur said the guernsey-man in french turning to his
captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain
and chief-mate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a
blasted whale they had brought alongside

upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more

what now said the guernsey-man to stubb

why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him
carefully i'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a
whale-ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me he's a
baboon

he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is
far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us
as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish

instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his
crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles and at once cast loose
the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship

what now said the guernsey-man when the captain had returned to
them

why let me see yes you may as well tell him now that that in
fact tell him i've diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody
else

he says monsieur that he's very happy to have been of any service to
us

hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his
cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux

he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter

thank him heartily but tell him it's against my principles to drink
with the man i've diddled in fact tell him i must go

he says monsieur that his principles won't admit of his drinking but
that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had
best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for
it's so calm they won't drift

by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed
the guernsey-man to this effect that having a long tow-line in his
boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter
whale of the two from the ship's side while the frenchman's boats
then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed
away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most
unusually long tow-line

presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale
hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the
pequod slid in between him and stubb's whale whereupon stubb quickly
pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of
his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
cunning seizing his sharp boat-spade he commenced an excavation in the
body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was
digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck
against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and
pottery buried in fat english loam his boat's crew were all in high
excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as
gold-hunters

and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and
screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning
to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when
suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint
stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without
being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with
another without at all blending with it for a time

i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in
the subterranean regions a purse a purse

dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls
of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old
cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with
your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good
friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist
some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the
sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for
impatient ahab's loud command to stubb to desist and come on board
else the ship would bid them good bye



chapter ambergris


now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as
an article of commerce that in a certain nantucket-born captain
coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that
subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day
the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem
to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for
grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though
at times found on the sea-coast is also dug up in some far inland
soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides
amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for
mouth-pieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft
waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in
perfumery in pastiles precious candles hair-powders and pomatum
the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same
purpose that frankincense is carried to st peter's in rome some wine
merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it

who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick
whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and
by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such
a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four
boat loads of brandreth's pills and then running out of harm's way as
laborers do in blasting rocks

i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain
hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be sailors
trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing
more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner

now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that
saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption
how that we are sown in dishonour but raised in glory and likewise
call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh
the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
ill-savor cologne-water in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the
worst

i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot
owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen
and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be
considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of
the frenchman's two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout
a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they
hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma
originate

i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because
those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as
the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in
small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry
it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas
and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding
any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold
and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a
savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an
old city grave-yard for the foundations of a lying-in-hospital

i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former
times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which
latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great
work on smells a text-book on that subject as its name imports smeer
fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a
place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without
being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection of
furnaces fat-kettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full
operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is
quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four
years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not
perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the
state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that
living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by
no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the
people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company by
the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant
when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance
of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the
open air i say that the motion of a sperm whale's flukes above water
dispenses a perfume as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a
warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance
considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with
jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian
town to do honour to alexander the great



chapter the castaway


it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most
significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod's crew an
event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own

now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some
few hands are reserved called ship-keepers whose province it is to work
the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing
these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats
crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous
wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper it
was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick-name pip by
abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember
his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy-jolly

in outer aspect pip and dough-boy made a match like a black pony and a
white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in
one eccentric span but while hapless dough-boy was by nature dull and
torpid in his intellects pip though over tender-hearted was at bottom
very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to
his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with
finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the year's calendar
should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five fourth of julys and
new year's days nor smile so while i write that this little black was
brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous
ebony panelled in king's cabinets but pip loved life and all life's
peaceable securities so that the panic-striking business in which he
had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his
brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily
subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by
strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the
natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut
he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green and at
melodious even-tide with his gay ha-ha had turned the round horizon
into one star-belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day
suspended against a blue-veined neck the pure-watered diamond drop
will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you
the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy
ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural
gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then
the evil-blazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies
looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to
the story

it came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubb's after-oarsman
chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed
and temporarily pip was put into his place

the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness
but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and
therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing
him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
to the utmost for he might often find it needful

now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as
the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which
happened in this instance to be right under poor pip's seat the
involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in
hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale
line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as
to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that
instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly
straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks
of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken
several turns around his chest and neck

tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he
hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat-knife from its sheath
he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb
exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pip's blue choked face
plainly looked do for god's sake all passed in a flash in less than
half a minute this entire thing happened

damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was
saved

so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed
by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these
irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain business-like
but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done
unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never
jump from a boat pip except but all the rest was indefinite as the
soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your
true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap from
the boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he
should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving
him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped
all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat
pip or by the lord i won't pick you up if you jump mind that we
can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for
thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and
don't jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that
though man loved his fellow yet man is a money-making animal which
propensity too often interferes with his benevolence

but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was
under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time
he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to
run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried traveller's trunk
alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous
blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away
all round to the horizon like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the
extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pip's ebon head showed
like a head of cloves no boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly
astern stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was
winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between
pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his
crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though
the loftiest and the brightest

now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore but the awful
lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the
middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how
when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they
hug their ship and only coast along her sides

but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he
did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake
and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very
quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards
oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested
by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not
unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so
called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
military navies and armies

but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly
spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and
stubb's boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish that pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him
miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but
from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at
least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though
rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of
the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes
and the miser-merman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the
joyous heartless ever-juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous
god-omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters
heaved the colossal orbs he saw god's foot upon the treadle of the
loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so man's
insanity is heaven's sense and wandering from all mortal reason man
comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and
frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his
god

for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that
fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what
like abandonment befell myself



chapter a squeeze of the hand


that whale of stubb's so dearly purchased was duly brought to
the pequod's side where all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of
the heidelburgh tun or case

while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed
in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and
when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated
ere going to the try-works of which anon

it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several
others i sat down before a large constantine's bath of it i found
it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the
liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid
a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was
such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a
softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it for
only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to
serpentine and spiralise

as i sat there at my ease cross-legged on the deck after the bitter
exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under
indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among
those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within
the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their
opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that
uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring
violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky
meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible
sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit
the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying
the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from
all ill-will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever

squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm
till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a
strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly
squeezing my co-laborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the
gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving
feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually
squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as
much as to say oh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish
any social acerbities or know the slightest ill-humor or envy come
let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into
each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
sperm of kindness

would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by
many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases
man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable
felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in
the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the
country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case
eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of
angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti

now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things
akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
try-works

first comes white-horse so called which is obtained from the tapering
part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it
is tough with congealed tendons a wad of muscle but still contains
some oil after being severed from the whale the white-horse is first
cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like
blocks of berkshire marble

plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
whale's flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and
often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is
a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name
imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason
it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole
behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive
a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted
supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison
season and that particular venison season contemporary with an
unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne

there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in
the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling
adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation
original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance
it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the
tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting
i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case
coalescing

gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but
sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the
dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland
or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior
souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan

nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's vocabulary
but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whaleman's nipper is
a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of
leviathan's tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is
about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the
oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless
blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities

but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once
to descend into the blubber-room and have a long talk with its inmates
this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
blanket-pieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper
time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of
terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull
lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally
go in pairs a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man the whaling-pike is
similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name the gaff is
something like a boat-hook with his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a
sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship
pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spade-man stands on the sheet
itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces this
spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademan's feet are shoeless
the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from
him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his
assistants would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among
veteran blubber-room men



chapter the cassock


had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this
post-mortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the
windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small
curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen
there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous
cistern in the whale's huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so
surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone longer than
a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet-black
as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or
rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in
the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which
king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it
for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the th
chapter of the first book of kings

look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted
by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it
and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle
deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an
african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt inside
out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to
double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging
to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it
towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for arm-holes
at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer
now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling
immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately
protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office

that office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted
endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into
which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orator's
desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent
on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a
pope were this mincer


bible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates
to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as
thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of
boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably
increased besides perhaps improving it in quality



chapter the try-works


besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished
by her try-works she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship
it is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her
planks

the try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most
roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength
fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the
foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is cased
with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened
hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots two in
number and each of several barrels capacity when not in use they are
kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone
and sand till they shine within like silver punch-bowls during the
night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing them one
man in each pot side by side many confidential communications
are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound
mathematical meditation it was in the left hand try-pot of the pequod
with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first
indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies
gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from
any point in precisely the same time

removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works the bare
masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of
the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted
with heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented
from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir
extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel
inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct
from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment

it was about nine o'clock at night that the pequod's try-works were
first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee
the business

all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the
works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his
shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that
in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a
time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of quick
ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the
crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains
considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feed the flames
like a plethoric burning martyr or a self-consuming misanthrope once
ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body
would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to
inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in
it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such
as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left
wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit

by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the
carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean
darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce
flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and
illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek
fire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad
sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and
folded them in conflagrations

the hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth
in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the
pagan harpooneers always the whale-ship's stokers with huge pronged
poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or
stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out
of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen
heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil
which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth
of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the
windlass this served for a sea-sofa here lounged the watch when not
otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their
eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all
begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting
barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in
the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other
their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth
as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the
flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers
wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the
wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and
yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness
of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in
her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing
pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning
a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the
material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul

so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently
guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea wrapped for that interval
in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the
ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shapes before
me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred
visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable
drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm

but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable
thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was
horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw-bone tiller smote
my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails
just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i
was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically
stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see
no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i
had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it
nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by
flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift
rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as
rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of
death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with
the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way
inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief
sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting the ship's stern with
my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just
in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very
probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this
unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being
brought by the lee

look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy
hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first
hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its
redness makes all things look ghastly to-morrow in the natural sun
the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking
flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the
glorious golden glad sun the only true lamp all others but liars

nevertheless the sun hides not virginia's dismal swamp nor rome's
accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of
deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the ocean
which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this
earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
in him that mortal man cannot be true not true or undeveloped with
books the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the
truest of all books is solomon's and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold
of unchristian solomon's wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and
jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of
operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all
of sick men and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by rabelais as
passing wise and therefore jolly not that man is fitted to sit
down on tomb-stones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrous solomon

but even solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way
of understanding shall remain ie even while living in the
congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it
invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom
that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill
eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges
and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces
and even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the
mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still
higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar



chapter the lamp


had you descended from the pequod's try-works to the pequod's
forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single
moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay
in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a
score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes

in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in
darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he
seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth

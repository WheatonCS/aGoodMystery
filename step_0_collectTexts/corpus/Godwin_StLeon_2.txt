called me to her and entreated me not to expose myself to
unnecessary danger in compliance with her remonstrances
i promised though unwillingly not to go out into the
court or upon the lawn but to content myself with examining
the state every part the house when i came
to the staircase and the hall i found that the alarm had communicated
to almost every person in the family who presently
assembled round me we parole the house but
found every thing in the situation in which it had been
left and nowhere any appearance violence i opened
several the windows but all was darkness and silence
having thus far satisfied myself i listened with a degree
 amusement to the conjectures and sage remarks several
 the servants a rank society who may usually be found
to derive a degree enjoyment from incidents this sort
 travels st leon
which for the moment strikingly tend to level all artificial
distinctions and confer on every one the liberty uttering
his reflections without apprehension or constraint i did not
however feel myself entirely easy the circumstance which
had just occurred combined with the forebodings which
had lately impressed me had filled me with undefinable
terror and alarm hector would willingly have gone over
the grounds contiguous to the house to see if he could discover
any thing that related to or could explain the incident 
but i had promised marguerite that i would search no
further and the temper my mind would not suffer me
to expose another to a danger which i abstained from encountering
in my own person it was more than an hour
before the conclave in which we were assembled broke up
and every one retired fatigued with attention and prepared
to fall into the soundest sleep my dreams were uneasy
and disturbed my mind was in a tumult imaginary
calamities and i passed the greater part the night in a
state singular anxiety
in the morning i was scarcely sunk into a refreshing
slumber before i was suddenly roused from sleep by a
repetition shrieks astonishment and distress i put
on my clothes as quickly as i could and hastened towards
the spot from which the sounds appeared to proceed the
first object i beheld was the little boy ten years old
whom charon had a short time before dragged out the
river stretched along upon the lifeless body this faithful
and generous animal the musket the report which
had alarmed us the night before had no doubt been aimed
against charon and the greater part its contents appeared
to be lodged in his body as no further sound had succeeded
the firing he had probably been killed on the spot
he was at a small distance from the house near a private
footpath where he had been found in the morning by the
lad whose life he had recently preserved the poor boy
had not at first understood what had happened to his benefactor
but only thought him asleep and prompted by
affection for the generous creature had quietly sat down by
him till he should awake he had not sat long however
before he discerned about him the marks blood he
travels op st leon 
put his hand to the wound the animal stirred not he
passed to his head he saw his eyes fiery and starting and
his lips distorted he endeavoured to awake him as one
would awake a human being to whom some mischief had
happened which he was not aware all his efforts were
fruitless he found his body motionless and his joints
stiff in death the apprehension what had occurred
then suddenly flashed on his mind he burst out into
shrieks astonishment and anguish hector was the first
person who caught the sound and hastened to the spot i
immediately followed the poor negro who in the innocence
 his heart was uninitiated in the proud distinctions
by which civilised man is taught to place so vast a barrier
between the human nature and the brute was struck speechless
with sorrow and amazement he recognised the dead
being before him for his fellowcreature he recollected
in him his friend his companion his intimate acquaintance
between whom and himself there had for some time passed
an uninterrupted reciprocation acts kindness and
assistance
a morose and fastidious reader perhaps will ask me why
i lay so great a stress upon so petty and insignificant an
incident as the death a dog it might have been little
to other persons it was not little to us let the reader
recollect his ingenuity in procuring aid for his dying master
his gratitude to the person by whom that aid was afforded
and his unconquerable antipathy to his master's murderer
these are not common traits there are many men whose
premature fate has been the most unrelentingly avenged
that in moral and useful qualities could not have stood the
comparison with my generous charon it surely was no
common cause for regret that a creature who had distinguished
himself by a conduct so peculiarly admirable should
have encountered so premature and unmerited a fate his
conduct the reader may in some degree comprehend and
appreciate j but i should in vain attempt to delineate those
admirable qualities in this faithful domestic which do not
fall within the province narrative and which to have
justly appreciated you must have been personally and familiarly
acquainted with him beside ours was a family
t
 travels st leon
 love as we were affectionately attached to each other
so we never admitted a servant under our roof who did not
prove himself by his conduct utterly unworthy to whom
we did not extend a share that friendship and affection
which seemed to be the right every one that dwelt in our
family feeling does not stay to calculate with weights
and a balance the importance and magnitude every
object that excites it it flows impetuously from the heart
without consulting the cooler responses the understanding

there was another circumstance which rendered the
catastrophe this generous animal great moment to us
it was a clear proof that there was somewhere a strong
animosity at work against his master it was impossible
he could himself have provoked his fate never was a
creature more gentle and inoffensive though his bulk
was great and his strength uncommon the energies he
possessed were always employed in acts justice and beneficence
never in acts aggression but if a hatred were
at work so busy and fierce as to prompt an action like this
how were we to estimate it what was its source and
whither did it tend these were very interesting and
serious considerations we however dwelt for some time
longer in the centre general antipathy and abhorrence
without being able in the smallest degree to explain to ourselves
what we saw as we knew not in what we had
offended we were unable to atone for our fault or even to
guard ourselves against the repetition it nor were we
by any means prepared to comprehend the extent our
danger happily marguerite whose health was now in a
rapid decline was least exposed to the observation this
new mischief though she felt enough it to confirm her
in the sentiment that she had nothing fortunate and happy
to look forward to in the small remainder her existence
there was indeed one idea perpetually present to her
which rendered the impression ordinary occurrences

it was no long time after the death charon that hector
came home one evening in a state the most violent
anxiety and trepidation he burst upon me in my study
where i was sitting alone buried in one those deep
reveries which especially since the legacy the stranger
had been among the most frequent habits my mind
his perturbation was such as to render it impossible for
him to impose on himself the smallest degree caution
and restraint the noise he made in entering the apartment
startled me i looked up and perceived his features
swelled his face bruised and his garments disfigured with
blood
for heaven's sake hector exclaimed i what is
the matter 
he answered not he advanced towards the upper 
 the room he took down a pistol one those which i
always kept loaded in my apartment he came towards me
he fell upon his knees he tendered the pistol to my acceptance

 hector cried i what am i to understand what
is the meaning this 
kill me dear master for christ's sake i entreat
you to kill me 
i took the pistol from his hand it pointed towards
the floor
and will you not kill me in a mournful accent
exclaimed he
what have you done that deserves that i should kill
you 
t 
 travels st leon
fc kill me only kill me pray kill me he spread
out his hands towards me with a gesture intreaty
 hector what means this agitation what has happened
 you terrify me beyond expression
f e must i speak replied he must i be the accuser
 my guilty self he burst into an agony tears
f would were dead would i had been torn into a
thousand pieces before this had happened indeed sir
i am innocent i thought no harm indeed it is not
my fault 
what have you done whence come these bruises
and this wound 
it is all my fault it is all my doing nobody
else why will you not kill me 
hector i cannot bear this uncertainty recollect
yourself be pacified and tell your story 
will you forgive me 
forgive you what what have you done to deserve
my anger 
no no i do not wish to be forgiven i only wish
you to abhor to detest to curse and to kill me 
 this is beyond all patience
i never loved any body but you and my mistress and
my dear young ladies i never did any body else the
least atom mischief and now my folly will be the ruin
 you all 
pardon me sir i will torment you no longer i
will get the better myself and tell you all that has happened

he then informed me though with many breaks and
passionate interruptions what he had just discovered
my evil repute as a necromancer the many strange and
terrible stories that were circulated me the antipathy
universally entertained against me the active ferociousness
with which this antipathy was accompanied and the
consequences that he feared would result he ascribed
the whole to his own imprudence and to the particulars
which the superior cunning the donzella in spite his
invincible refusal to acquaint her with a single circumstance
had wrung from him hector had collected several
travels st leon 
 these particulars accidentally from a neighbouring rustic
and had been vehement in my defence while they were
eager in debate others had joined them but hector had
found them all opponents not one a supporter irritated
with the contest and the opprobrious language heaped
upon himself and his master hector had been provoked to
strike the most insolent the disputants immediately
several had fallen upon him at once and it was owing to
the uncommon strength and dexterity he possessed that
he had escaped alive out their hands beside innumerable
blows with fist foot and stick he had received
two or three stabs in different parts the body from the
knives with which the italian is too much accustomed to
assail his adversary it was easy to see that the gallant
and generous defence hector had considerably augmented
the danger my situation they dismissed him with a
thousand execrations against both him and myself and
vows that they would sign ah se their vengeance by setting
fire to my house having related his story hector concluded
with again earnestly conjuring me to kill him that
so he might expiate the imprudence and folly by which he
had made himself the author my calamity
the excessiveness the poor fellow's distress excited
me to employ every effort to pacify his mind hector
said i you have been very imprudent but i foresee no
such consequences as your terrified imagination has led
you to forebode the idle threats clowns in the midst
 their brawls are entitled to little regard i am not so
weak and infirm soul as to be moved from my tranquillity
by their senseless prate i entertain no doubt 
your fidelity and affection i am not angry with you
the fault you have been guilty arose from no defect 
vigilance or attachment you did what you could and
where you failed it was only in that to which your powers
were not commensurate you have done well and wisely
now in acquainting me with particulars and the whole
extent the danger doubt not but i will employ such
precautions and be so awake to my situation as to forestal
the possibility mischief
thus i endeavoured to assuage honest hector's per
t 
 travels st leon
duration but with no adequate effect he hung his head
in sorrow and refused to be comforted shame and terror
assailed him together and he knew not how to support
their united pressure he intreated me not to lull myself
in fancied security and fall blindfold on my ruin he entreated
me not to forgive him my clemency and forbearance
served only to make him regard with greater
horror the crime which he had been guilty if however
i refused to punish him and by penance or death to lighten
the remorse that hung upon his heart he would at least
devote himself in opposition to the evil he had created
and die rather than it should touch a hair our heads
this idea he seemed to view with some complacency but
the pleasure it gave was a glimmering and momentary
light he could not remain in any place for an instant 
he wrung his hands with anguish and exhibited every
feature the deepest despair i examined his bruises and
wounds the latter which though attended with a copious
effusion blood did not appear to be dangerous i warned
him to be guilty no further indiscretion to betray nothing
 what had happened to any one my family and
to engage in no further controversies and broils in my
vindication
though i endeavoured to make light what i heard
in compassion to the distress my servant yet when i
came to reconsider the subject in solitude it by no means
appeared to me in a light and trivial point view one
part hector's story had related to the death charon
who i now found had owed his fate to the superstition
 my uncultivated neighbours i had always entertained
a formidable idea the character an italian populace
whom i regarded as more suspicious sanguinary and
violent than any other race men in the world i deplored
my fate that exposed me to their rage i deplored
my folly that had admitted any confidant into my
individual pursuits though my confidence had been so
limited and its receiver so trustworthy that i could not
have imagined any evil would have resulted i determined
that i would not expose myself to the risk such
sinister consequences as in my opinion might in my pretravels
 st leon 
sent situation easily overtake me i grieved for the tender
health and the doubtful state mind my beloved
marguerite which alone opposed themselves to the adoption
 an immediate change scene in the state her
health i had been grievously disappointed i had looked
for amendment i found decay the decay however was
gradual almost imperceptible from time to time i had
even flattered myself that the progress was in an opposite
direction but the delusion was soon banished another
difficulty arose in addition to the rest marguerite appeared
pregnant a circumstance that now first presented
itself after a cessation ten years
the morning after the accident and disclosure hector
i went to pisa determined to consult with the marchese
filosanto elder brother the unfortunate andrea who
was probably more accurately acquainted with the italian
character than myself and understood the shades that
character as they were modified in the particular territory
in which i resided the marchese was a man universally
admired for subtlety reasoning vigorousness comprehension
and refinement taste in the structure his
mind he was scarcely an italian he had resided several
years in england and was the intimate friend henry
howard earl surrey who some time after fell a victim
to the jealous tyranny his native sovereign king henry
the eighth the marchese was frank generous and disinterested
and possessed more fully the affections every one
within the circle his friendship than any other man i ever
knew he was a sanguine temper always contemplating
the world on its brightest side and from the generosity
 his own heart incapable crediting a distant danger
or discerning the storm in the embryo cloud where it
was silently engendering
in the conference we held i was influenced too implicitly
by my consciousness his integrity and the gigantic
powers his mind and did not sufficiently advert to
those peculiarities in his temper which i have now described
the external facts with which the narrative hector had
furnished me i fully detailed to him as to my particular
pursuits i contented myself with stating that i indulged
t 
 travels st leon
freely in the study chemistry and was those persons
ordinarily accounted visionaries who amused themselves
with the expectation finding rhe philosopher's stone
having heard my story to an the marchese ridiculed
my apprehensions he saw nothing in the facts that
alarmed me but a cowardly superstition whose utmost flight
reached no higher than the shooting a dog and a squabble
between a boisterous rustic and a servant too acutely sensitive
for the reputation his master he assured me
that the days such superstition as i contemplated were
long since past and that his countrymen less deserved the
imputation than any others as living at the very centre
and source catholic imposition they saw deeper into the
mystery and were not exposed to the advantage which distance
possesses for augmenting our reverence he expatiated
with great eloquence on the vice a suspicious
temper a spirit alarm and continual apprehension
like the jealousy lovers he said made the meat it fed
on it brooded over plots that had no existence but in the
wanderings a disturbed imagination it was continually
interrupting the quiet its owner and the tranquillity 
society and for the sake avoiding imaginary evils
often plunged into such as were real he advised me to
go home and be contented he recommended to me to
clear up the clouds my mind and cultivate a light
heart a cheerful temper and a generous confidence in the
honest sympathies mankind in fine he bade me continue
my pursuits avoid eclat and trust in his sagacity
that no ill consequences would ensue
the remonstrances the marchese filosanto led me to
suspect that i had been idly credulous i had too easily
participated the feelings and apprehensions a poor uninstructed
negro and had suffered the secret griefs that
brooded in my heart to discolour my perceptions and
aggravate the features circumstances in themselves trifling
or indifferent i began to be half ashamed the
gloominess my conceptions i could not alas follow
the advice the marchese as to the cheerfulness my
heart but i could exert myself to prevent my present
melancholy from disfiguring to me every thing i saw the
travels op st leon 
influence exercised over my conceptions by persons eminent
intellect has always been great not that the judgment
i formed the powers my own mind was peculiarly
humble but i reasoned thus perhaps the person i
consult is as well informed in the subject under consideration
as i am in that case his decision is as fully entitled
to attention as my own and thus without cowardly selfcontempt
on my part the general balance the argument
was materially altered perhaps without being on the
whole my superior he may be more competent to this particular
question in either case my idea its merits became
perceptibly modified i never listened to the sentiments
 a man talents when they differed from my own
unless where he was evidently visionary and irrational
without being shaken as to the credit due to my own view
 the subject
such then was the effect produced on me by the marchese's
expostulation i shook off my apprehensions and
laughed at my fears i was ashamed the want gallantry
that had possessed me when i meditated flight
from so trivial a menace i concluded that dangers particularly
such as arise from the irrational passions a capricious
multitude were increased when symptoms apprehension
discovered themselves and abated when received
with neglect or repelled with a magnanimous serenity
chapter xxvii
meanwhile the unrelenting agostino was fixed in his
purpose and incessant in his machinations he believed
that the destructive mine was now sufficiently prepared
and that he might proceed in all surety to the ultimate
explosion he apprehended that he had advanced too far
to retract that the death charon and the assault upon
hector were calculated sufficiently to announce what was
to follow and that it would be injudicious and idle to grant
me much respite for reflection the passions his associates
were wrought up to a frenzy horror and needed
travels st leon
only a bold and artful director to urge them to any point 
fury and destruction
implicitly as i had confided in the decision the
marchese i had speedily reason to know that it was the
dictate too sanguine and presumptuous a spirit on
my return from his palace and on several subsequent
occasions i found the manners the populace altered
respecting me they no longer viewed me with a sort 
reverential awe or fled my approach they insulted me
with their eyes they muttered curses upon me in a voice
sufficiently audible to be understood they broke forth in
gestures abhorrence and derision they regarded me
with looks ferocious hatred and when i had passed them
their murmurs gradually swelled into shouts triumphant
contumely these symptoms however were progressive j
each day became more odious and intolerable than the last
they who have never been placed in a situation like mine
will never be able to do justice to my grievance they
will perhaps say that the calamity i now endured was a
trifling one and that a weak mind only can be elevated by
the acclamations and huzzahs the multitude or depressed
by their hisses and scorn i did not and i could not feel
it so there is no pleasure more congenial to the human
heart than the approbation and affection our fellows i
call heaven to witness that i could mount the scaffold surrounded
with an innumerable multitude to applaud my fortitude
and to feel as it were on their own neck the blow that
ended me and count it a festival but i cannot bear to be
surrounded with tokens abhorrence and scorn i cannot
bear to look round me through an extended circle and see the
impatience despite in every face man was not born to
live alone he is linked to his brethren by a thousand ties 
and when those ties are broken he ceases from all genuine
existence their complacence is a food more invigorating
than ambrosia their aversion is a torment worse than that
 the damned while i write i seem again to hear resounding
in my ears the hooting and clamours these
infatuated peasants when heard indeed they went to
my heart and sat there colder than the aspic's venom they
rose to my throat with a sensation bitterer than wormwood
travels st leon 
they unstrung all my muscles and nerves i could not stay 
i could not fly i wished myself buried deep in the centre
 the earth i felt something worse more revolting more
opposite to all the prejudices and propensities the soul
than annihilation i have known in various situations and
conditions human life what it was to be distressed to be
dejected to be miserable but never in any other situation
have i felt a misery so concentrated so gnawing and insufferable

i began however like the critics i am figuring to myself
to despise the pusillanimity my submission and to believe
that if i would only make a stand and turn round
upon my enemy i should subdue him this resolution i
could with difficulty have taken in the moment attack 
it was formed in an interval retrospect and reflection
having formed it the contempt i should have felt for myself
would have been too exquisite if i had failed to put it
in execution i was not long at a loss for an opportunity
in one my walks i found myself pursued by a numerous
populace with a peculiar degree inveteracy i yielded
for some time till i came to a place that appeared convenient
for the purpose haranguing them it was a
bench placed upon a rising ground and sheltered behind
by a thicket which had been erected for the purpose 
commanding a neighbouring prospect i stopped i
stepped upon the bench i waved my hand towards the
multitude they perceived my purpose with some degree
 confusion and surprise they drew nearer do not
listen to him do not hear a word he has to say cried
some them oh hear him hear him exclaimed
others i obtained an audience
what is the cause said i all this hatred and
persecution 
because you are a wizard a necromancer a dealer in
the black art because you are in league with hell and
have sold yourself to the devil i answered twenty voices
at once
ft hear me replied i and i will convince you my
innocence but hear me in silence and do not interrupt
me
travels st leon
te for myself i have no belief in the existence such
an art
this remark produced a general groan
why should i have sold myself to the foe mankind
what could he give me that should compensate me for
consigning myself over to him for ever hereafter the
power exhibiting strange and extraordinary tricks
what a pitiful recompence but if i had bought this
power at so dear a price should i hide it should i not
take every opportunity exciting your reverence and astonishment
who has seen me perform any wonderful
feat i live quietly among you and give no cause offence
to any i live retired in the midst my family i
foi no party or connections i do not intrude into any
 your affairs political or private i do not even enter
into conferences with any you unless induced by the
apparent occasion doing some good and benevolent
action
f quit then this ungenerous persecution do not turn
the fury your resentment upon a harmless stranger 
you are italians the most polished and ingenious people
on the face the earth the most glorious monuments 
art in building in statuary and in painting are to be
found in the midst you ancient italy governed the
world by her arms modern italy governs the world through
the medium that pure and sublime religion which
providence has graciously made her the repository do
not stain the glory this character show yourselves
worthy the honour with which your name is heard in
every corner the habitable world 
while i was yet speaking a large clot mud reached
me and struck me on the face and the upper part my
breast i calmly endeavoured to free myself from its effects
with my handkerchief and looking round me demanded
in the sacred spirit conscious innocence how
have i deserved this treatment 
thus far i had been heard with a doubtful sentiment
 murmur and approbation and i began to feel that i was
rather gaining ground upon my audience but this new
insult seemed to turn the tide popular impression in an
instant
travels op st leon 
villain renegade accursed god i heard from
every side did not you bewitch my cow did not you
enchant my child have not you killed my daughter 
down with him exterminate him do not suffer him to
live
i continued my efforts to be heard it was a critical
moment a last experiment upon the power firmness and
innocence to control the madness infuriated superstition
it was in vain i was deafened with the noise that assailed
me it was no longer shouts and clamours disapprobation
it was the roaring tigers and the shriek 
cannibals sticks stones and every kind missile weapon
that offered itself fell in showers around me it seemed a
sort miracle that i escaped instant destruction i eluded
their pursuit after some time time i ventured to return to
my own house i had in the interval terrified myself with
the idea that having missed my person they might have
hurried thither and executed some terrible vengeance on
my helpless family i found them however in safety the
mob had for this time contented itself to disperse without
further mischief
as soon as it was dark i hastened to pisa and related
what had just occurred to my friend the marchese he
was surprised but he still adhered to his opinion he
had never supposed he told me that a noisy and clamorous
mob was a proper subject upon which to make experiment
 the energy truth and he laughed at my attempt to
reason them out their superstition but they meant
nothing by all that had passed it was the mere foam and
fury a moment poured out with vehemence and then
dissipated in air a certain set politicians had for their
particular ends represented a mob as a terrific and formidable
engine alas they were rather to be pitied than condemned
there was no malice in their hearts they
were in reality a mere material machine led on without
reflection and when they had committed a momentary
ravage astonished themselves the most at the injury they
had perpetrated they were as light and variable as a
feather driven with every breath and nothing could argue
greater obliquity intellect than to suppose because they
 travels st leon
were in a certain temper and sentiment today that they
would be found in a similar temper and sentiment tomorrow
the marchese however wished he said to relieve me from
the apprehension this imaginary danger and therefore offered
me the whole suite his servants for the defence my
house he added that among his friends and retainers in
the city pisa he did not doubt in an hour's time to be able
to raise a troop four hundred men and whatever power
 that sort he possessed he assured me was wholly at my
service i was not convinced by the marchese's arguments
but i declined his offer i could not bear to think that
blood should be spilled and the lives these poor ignorant
wretches sacrificed for the preservation a thing so worthless
in my eyes as the local property i possessed i therefore
told the marchese that i might perhaps wait yet a day
or two longer before i formed my resolution but that the
instant i saw one fresh symptom the hostility the villagers
i was determined to take my family with me and
remove far beyond the reach both their terrors and their
hatred
i staid two hours with the marchese and then set out to
my own house the way i took was by a private road
open only to the neighbouring gentry but which my
servant carried the key it led along the higher ground
and commanded a view the common highway considerably
before i reached my own habitation i was struck
with the appearance persons passing in considerable
numbers and in a tumultuous manner along the public
road some them were armed with clubs and others
with torches their inarch however led not towards my
house but in an opposite direction i mended my pace
terrified with a sort vague apprehension what might
have happened though i did not disguise to myself that
what i saw was not precisely that which i might have expected
to see if they had been returned from demolishing
my property and burning my house
when i arrived i found indeed that no mischief had
been actually committed but that i was indebted for the
preservation my house and perhaps for the lives my
wife and children to the sagacity and presence mind 
travels st leon 
bernardin the servant my early years my residence
had been the object against which the march the populace
had been directed bernardin perceiving their intentions
had with great difficulty prevailed upon hector to
keep out sight nothing could be more adverse to the
feelings and inclination my faithful negro but bernardin
having convinced him that his appearance would
only exasperate the rage the assailants and that perhaps
every thing importance to his master's service and happiness
depended at present upon his concealment hector
yielded to his representations this accomplished bernardin
next assembled the gardener and one or two labourers
in my employment who happened to be at hand and
having furnished them with firearms stationed them at
different windows in the front the house with these
preparations when the mob arrived he resolutely told them
that he would fire on the first person that attempted to break
in they were staggered furious as they appeared the
moment before this threat held them in awe they paraded
two or three times round the house clattering their
arms and pouring out vehement execrations and then
withdrew solemnly promising that they would return the
following night and level the house with the ground
i no longer yielded the smallest degree credit to the
unsuspicious and confiding philosophy the marchese
filosanto i sent off my wife and children before daybreak
for lucca determined to take shipping at the first
convenient port and pass over into spain i was little
solicitous for reasons with which the reader is already acquainted
about my property and moveables i had no motive
to induce me to fetter and clog my retreat at this hour
 peril and terror with a single article rarity and price
my furniture indeed was not splendid but it was handsome
and valuable and the indifference with which i resigned
the whole to the mercy chance was a matter some
surprise to the persons around me my servants offered
to defend my possessions at the peril their lives but i
peremptorily forbade it i would not even consent to
their taking away certain articles by way appropriating
them to their personal use i believed that if i admitted
travels st leona
single act that sort i should find it no easy matter to
set limits to their avidity and as i had determined to
take none my present servants with me the negro and
bernardin excepted i feared that the apparent possession 
a single article that had been mine might hereafter mark
its proprietor a victim to the senseless rage blindfold
superstition i could easily make up to these honest and
faithful dependants the injury they might sustain from the
seeming severity this order i determined to shut up
my house with all its present contents as joshua the
captain the jews drew a line separation round the
profane possessions achan and to leave the villagers if
so it seemed good to them to make the whole a burntoffering
to propitiate the wrath their avenging divinity
the directions i issued being unhesitating and peremptory
met with a ready submission from all my other domestics
hector only the mild and complying hector 
whom obedience had hitherto appeared to constitute the
very soul met my commands with a resolute refusal the
present distressed appearance my fortunes seemed to
have worked the poor fellow's mind to a paroxysm insanity
he considered himself as the sole author my
calamity ile reviled himself in the bitterest terms 
compunction and abhorrence the language which the
agony his soul forced from his lips was such as could
not fail to impress upon my other servants a conviction 
the justice the imputations that were now brought against
us this however was little importance i must at all
events have been contented to leave behind me in my present
neighbourhoods name loaded with the execrations 
religious fanaticism hector imprecated upon himself a
thousand curses if so long as he continued to live the populace
should lay hands upon a straw my property he
would not move so much as an inch from the defence my
house he would either by preserving it expiate in some
degree the mischief in which he had involved me or fall and
be crushed to death in the midst its ruins arguments
and expostulations were useless here his mind was worked
up to too high a tone to be susceptible the patience necessary
for hearing or understanding any reasoning that was
travels st leon 
addressed to him authority itself was no avail for
the first and the last time he threw off the character a
servant and appeared obstinate selfwilled and ungovernable
it was only by direct violence that he could be forced
from the spot i gave him in charge with the most strict
orders not to suffer him to escape from their custody to two
 his fellows
this business being despatched i went at the invitation
 the marchese to a small cottage he possessed at no great
distance from my own house its situation was so private
and retired that few persons knew or could perceive that
there was any building on the spot here therefore i could
remain in the most perfect safety i felt myself unaccountably
impelled to stay and witness the catastrophe the
tragedy i should not have been satisfied to continue in
uncertainty as to what it would prove after all that had
passed like the marchese i should have been apt to accuse
myself cowardice and a mind soured and degenerate if
the mob had not put their threats in execution the marchese
himself was well pleased with my determination in
this respect he was not yet convinced that i had not
painted to myself a danger which had no adequate counterpart
in the world realities
i had not long to wait the night had no sooner spread
an evencoloured and almost impervious veil over the
world than the marchese as if moved by a secret impulse
to witness what he yet refused to believe came to me at the
cottage he had scarcely arrived when he heard the confused
murmurs and turbulence the populace for we
were near enough to distinguish almost every thing as
they did not meet with the defence the preceding evening
the work they had undertaken was presently despatched
we saw the flames ascend we recognised the
shouts infernal joy with which they witnessed the catastrophe
when the marchese beheld what till seen he
would never admit to be possible he burst out into a sort 
transport misanthropy he exclaimed that no innocence
and no merit could defend a man from the unrelenting antipathy
 his fellows he saw that there was a principle
in the human mind destined to be eternally at war with 

travels st leon
provement and science no sooner did a man devote himself
to the pursuit discoveries which if ascertained
would prove the highest benefit to his species than his
whole species became armed against him the midnight
oil was held to be the signal infernal machinations the
paleness study and the furrows thought were adjudged
to be the tokens diabolical alliance he saw in the
transactions that night a pledge the eternal triumph
 ignorance over wisdom above all he regretted that
his countrymen his dear italians should for ever blot their
honour and their character by such savage outrages
though myself the principal sufferer i was obliged to perform
the part the comforter and consoler and endeavour
to calm the transport agony that seized upon the susceptible
filosanto he was astonished shocked and beside
himself i viewed the whole with the gloomy firmness 
a desperate resolution
the worst event this detested evening remains yet
unrecorded even now i tremble while i attempt to
commit the story to my harmless paper so far as related
to the mere destruction my property i looked on with a
philosophical indifference i had no reason and i disdained
to regret the loss that which i had it in my
power to repair in a moment i thought i had taken care
that no human life should be risqued upon this critical
occasion but i was mistaken i learned the next morning
with anguish inexpressible that hector the negro 
the prison constance was no more he had eluded
the vigilance his keepers no sooner was he at liberty
then he hastened unknown to every one to die as he had
declared he would in the defence my house the mob
had burst into the house they seized him alive they
dragged him out in the midst them they insulted over
him as the special favourite the infernal king they
inflicted on him every species mockery and torture 
they killed him joint by joint and limb by limb the
pen drops from my lifeless hand
what right had i to make this man the victim my
idle and unhallowed pursuits what has the art and
multiplication gold in it that should compensate the
travels op st leon 
destruction so ingenuous so simplehearted so noble a
creature if i had myself fallen into the hands the
populace it had been well i was a criminal worthy 
every retribution they could inflict upon me some men
perhaps will ask why i lamented so bitterly over so uncultivated
and uninformed an individual as this negro
there was however something so truly tragical in the fate
to which this creature in his generosity and remorse devoted
himself that i believe for the moment i felt a
sharper pang in it than in the strange and extraordinary
loss my only son or perhaps in the premature death 
my beloved marguerite
chapter xxviii
before the dawn the succeeding morning i turned my
face towards lucca i beheld the last cloud mingling
smoke and flame ascend from the ashes my villa the
blaze sunk its materials were nearly consumed and it
yielded an uncertain and fitful light only when i withdrew
from being any longer the melancholy and heartwounded
spectator the ruin i took an everlasting leave the
marchese i had been introduced to him under a friendly
aspect as the man who had had courage to perform the
last offices humanity to his unfortunate brother and
he had conceived a warm affection for me the painful
nature the catastrophe he had witnessed melted his heart
and he earnestly pressed me to draw upon him for any
supplies i wanted or rather to receive from him a sum
equivalent to the damage the superstition his countrymen
had inflicted on me this i positively refused but
i found it impossible to silence his importunity till i
submitted to the duplicity promising that if i found
myself reduced to any necessity i would not fail to apply
to him it was in the very moment our separation
that intelligence was brought me the fate hector
the reader may imagine with how heavy a heart i set out
on my journey
it 
travels st leon
lucca is about seventeen miles from the city pisa 
from the place where i had spent the greater part this
memorable night it was twenty the marchese made me
promise to take a serpentine and circuitous route the more
completely to elude the possibility future danger an
adventure occurred to me in this passage with the relation
 which i will not interrupt my narrative which prevented
me from arriving at lucca till the noon the
following day suffice it to say that it was such a
nature that impatient as i was under my present extraordinary
circumstances to rejoin my family i should have
held myself destitute every atom humanity if i had
not submitted to this short delay
short as it was i found when i reached lucca that
my evil genius had been busy to accumulate for me new
misfortunes marguerite and her daughters were wholly
unknown in this place and the intelligence the pisan
riot having reached lucca in the course the day it was
related to my wife as to a hearer unconcerned with all its
horrid circumstances and the calamitous fate our generous
hector by the hostess the inn the rapidity events
during the last part our residence in the pisan territory
was such as to have obliged me to say little the effect
they produced upon marguerite but the reader can
scarcely be so inadvertent and unreflecting as not easily to
imagine to himself that she felt them in the highest degree
painful and overwhelming this last blow was too much
marguerite had been some months pregnant she was
immediately seized with the pains labour and delivered
 a dead child the first intelligence communicated tome
upon my arrival was that my wife was dying
lucca however did not witness the period her existence
after having continued for several days upon the
very extremity as it were between life and death she
grew perceptibly better and in a week more though in a
very feeble state it became apparent that her case was nota
rapid one we agreed to proceed upon our spanish
voyage it appeared not improbable that the seaair might
be found beneficial and the experiment was warmly recommended
by her physicians they were not however
travels op st leon 
aware the whole extent her disorder during the
voyage her crisis returned with such malignant symptoms
as scarcely to permit us the hope she would reach the land
alive we debarked at barcelona on the th april 
we had no sooner taken up our abode inthis city than
fully aware the state her disease she assembled her
daughters and poured forth to them without restraint that
flood affection that ardent spirit love by which she
was distinguished and elevated above every creature that
lived her mind was clear her intellectual powers were
complete and entire the enthusiasm with which she
now expressed herself was not that inconsiderate nature
which should tend to make them feel with greater acuteness
the loss they were about to sustain it was bright
unclouded and serene it was the eloquence as a disembodied
spirit freed from the perturbation and alloy 
human passions she reminded them that they were sisters
and exhorted each to fulfil the duties a sister and
a mother to the other two if wise and good they would
be happy in each other and their little association would bea
school preparing them for the more genuine and venerable
duties for which nature had destined them her views
 all human things were altered by her present situation on
the brink the grave our reserves and misunderstandings
had wrung her heart but she forgave me things
which had lately appeared the highest magnitude and
moment faded in the distance and mingled with the vulgar
crowd human concerns which was now retiring from
her view she must again return she said to life before she
could again feel the passions and the interests this petty
scene for the sake her daughters she had lately desired
to live she was now reconciled and content to die
she had formed the chain and link connection between
me and my girls perhaps it was better that we should
burst our fetters and be free on the fourth day after
our arrival at barcelona marguerite expired
there is nothing in the vast variety objects which
this wretched world presents to our view so dreadful and
distressing as the sight one we have loved but who isnow
no more i saw these eyes beheld the lifeless corse
u 
 travels st leon
 marguerite great god heaven what is man 
and what are we made within that petty frame resided
for years all that we worship for there resided all
that we know and can conceive excellence that heart
is now still within the whole extent that frame there
exists no thought no feeling no virtue it remains no
longer but to mock my sense and scoff at my sorrow to
rend my bosom with a woe complicated matchless and
inexpressible the cheek is pale and livid the eyes are
sunk and circled with blackness corruption and ruin
have already seized their prey and turned it into horror
draw for heaven's sake draw the pall over those lifeless
features bury bury them deep in the bowels the
earth let not my imagination follow them into the
chambers the grave and dwell amidst pestilential damps
and all the series destruction let me recollect all that
marguerite was as she lived her numerous accomplishments
her unparalleled virtues ay in all the magnitude
and wealth their detail for that is a divine and
celestial madness but let me not recollect her as i saw heron
the bier lest i become raving and blaspheme i
i have no power to talk the situation in which i was
now placed and the reader must therefore explain it for
himself if he can i never loved but once i never
loved but marguerite all other affection is stillness and
ice compared with this this is the great crisis my
history the gap between life and death the gulf that cut
me oft for ever from every thing that deserves the name 
human such was the legacy the stranger my son an
exile myself publicly arraigned as a murderer the unmerited
and tragical death hector the premature and
selfderiving loss the better half my soul who
would have believed that this envied gift would in less
than two years have thus dreadfully changed the face 
my affairs and destroyed every thing that composed the
happiness my life 
after some delay in this wretched and illomened town 
barcelona such it has ever since appeared to my thoughts
we proceeded to madrid the reader will give me credit
when i tell him that however eager i had lately felt to
travels st leon 
exhibit my magnificence and my wealth i had no such
eagerness now i speak no more the character marguerite
j i attempt not to compose her panegyric the
story her life is the best record her virtues her defects
if defects she had drew their pedigree from rectitude
 sentiment and perception from the most generous sensibility
from a heart pervaded and leavened with tenderness
a simple stone in the western aisle the great
church at barcelona records her personal and her family
name with this single addition the preserver her
family in poverty and ruin the victim her disconsolate
and repentant husband's unhallowed
wealth
but dismissing for ever and henceforth consigning to
inviolate silence her excellencies could i avoid feeling
that i could never again form a similar or indeed any
real union so long as i existed being now indeed more
than forty years age having spent near twenty that
forty in a most enviable wedlock and being blessed with a
sufficiently numerous offspring it may be thought perhaps
i might be contented but without discussing the propriety
 such a maxim as it relates to the species in
general it must be recollected in my case that my youth
was to be recommenced by a perpetual series renewals
i never gave credit to that axiom a sickly sensibility
that it is a sacrilege in him who has been engaged in one
cordial and happy union ever to turn his thoughts to
another much more reasonable than this is the indian
doctrine that the survivor ought to leap into the flames
and perish upon the funeral pyre the deceased while
we live it is one our most imperious duties to seek
our happiness he that dedicates his days to an endless
sorrow is the worst and most degraded suicides it is
an important question in the economy human life up to
what age we should allow ourselves to contract engagements
to a wife and a probable offspring but separately
from this consideration i should hold that in many cases
he who entered into a second marriage by that action
yielded a pure and honourable homage to the manes the
first but from genuine marriage i was henceforth for
u 
travels st leon
ever debarred an immortal can form no true and real
attachment to the insect an hour
mourning a depressing and speechless regret was yet
the inmate our house grief does not commonly lay a
strong and invincible hold us in the morning our
days and though the temper julia was perhaps at her
age the most tender and susceptible i ever knew even she
who was now in her seventeenth year reaped the benefit
 that elasticity which in early life is the portion 
humanity nothing material occurred to us in the first
three months our residence in madrid it was impossible
for any one to be surrounded with a more lovely
and blooming family than i was
yet from happiness i was immeasurably distant exclusively
 my recent and in every sense irreparable loss
my mind was full dark and gloomy forebodings i
feared not for myself but i had an unconquerable alarm
and apprehension for my children my youngest was but
ten years age the eldest was not seventeen sweet
tender blossoms that the cruelty and hardness mankind
might so easily blight and that required a concurrence 
favourable circumstances to ripen into all they were capable
 becoming when i recollected what had happened in
the course the last two years i could not flatter myself
that our misfortunes were at an or that i had not to
speak moderately many fierce trials yet to encounter i
seemed like the farfamed tree java to be destined to
shelter only to destroy and to prove a deadly poison to
whatever sought its refuge under my protecting branches
in this melancholy frame mind the last words my
adored marguerite passed and repassed ten thousand times
through my recollection she had formed the chain and
link connection between me and my girls perhaps it
was better that we should burst our fetters and be free
whatever she had said was sacred to the present temper
 my imagination her last behest i would have died to
execute the idea contained in the sentence i have just
repeated was ambiguous and obscure rather hinted than
expressed but was it worthy the less attention because
its author with her usual gentleness and sweetness
travels st leon 
had modestly suggested an advice instead which she was
well entitled to have done prescribing a will i determined
to part with my children that i might no longer
be to them a source corroding misery and affliction i
believed that the cloud that now oppressed me was transitory
i seemed pursued for the present by a malignant
genius but a man endowed as i was with unbounded
wealth and immortal vigour cannot easily be reduced to
despair when the tide my prosperity should unfold
its rich and ample current i might easily communicate 
its bounty to my daughters if i parted with them now
i did not lose them as i had perhaps lost their brother forever
i could turn to a particular point and say there
lies my soul i could cast my eye upon a projection
 the globe and put my finger upon their residence
wherever i wandered whether i were plunged in a dungeon
or mounted a throne my heart like the mariner's
needle would tremble towards that point as its cynosure
i had still something to love something to pant for something
to dream about and be happy
having ruminated insatiably upon the last expressions
 marguerite having formed my commentary and fixed
my predilection i recollected a person then a young
woman upon my paternal estate for whom my wife had
conceived a remarkable friendship she was the daughter
 a peasant her birth had been low and her education
confined but she had taste she had discretion she had
integrity i think i may add she had genius as marguerite
had discovered her merits and distinguished her
from her equals she had been great use to this extraordinary
rustic in unfolding her mind and guiding her
propensities this was not so much a matter deliberate
and meditated purpose in la dame du seigneur it rose
out the circumstances their situation they were
almost an age and marguerite frequently invited her
to be the associate her studies and amusements mariana
that was her name did not perhaps resemble my wife
considerably in her features but her stature was the same
her complexion and the colour her hair the similarity
in carriage and gesture mariana having never had an
 travels st leon
opportunity contemplating the accomplishments she
admired in any one but madame de st leon was still
more striking there were points indeed in which no
human creature could compare with marguerite the expressive
and flexible tone her voice and those cadences
which sprung from and communicated to every susceptible
hearer the divinest sensibility one the unhappy consequences
 our exile from the bordelois was the misfortunes
 mariana her father had fallen to decay to
relieve his distress she had contracted a marriage not 
sentiment and predilection but with a man who had promised
her that her father should never come to want this
marriage had been unhappy the husband was a prodigal
and a profligate a period seven years however delivered
her from her egyptian bondage she had but
lately become a widow and the prudence and integrity 
her conduct had rendered this alliance which to many
women would have proved a rock destruction an additional
source honour and respect mariana at the
death her husband had no children she had buried her
father she was consequently entirely alone
it was this woman i fixed upon as the protector my
daughters i was better pleased with the meanness her
extraction than i should have been with one the highborn
descendants the houses st leon or damville
had it been my fortune to have had in the female line any
near relations on either side my daughters were no longer
children they were singularly prudent considerate and
unimpeachable in their conduct and propensities they
wanted a protector in the eye the world it was desirable
for them that they should have an adviser but i should
have been grieved and mortified to give them a dictator
i wrote to mariana chabot communicating my project
and requesting her to give us the meeting at st vizier on
the frontiers france she was delighted with the office
i tendered to her acceptance and readily consented to everything
i required i conducted my daughters to the place
 rendezvous without imparting to them the design by
which i was actuated i believed that they would their
own motion conceive a partiality for the friend their
travels st leon 
mother i was not deceived in my prognostic the meeting
was an interesting one the eyes mariana overflowed
at meeting after so long an interval the husband and progeny
 the dearest and most revered friend she had ever
known the mourning we wore reminded her how lately
her incomparable patroness had been committed to the
grave my girls were struck with the resemblance 
mariana to their mother accident had prevented us from
cultivating almost any intimate connections out our own
family from the period our exile my girls had therefore
never met with a person who approached in any degree so
near their mother in accomplishments in skill in turn 
thinking and opinion mariana came up to my warmest
hopes as a protector and companion for my children her
unhappy marriage by concentrating her thoughts and expectations
in herself had perhaps rendered her more exemplary
in carriage and more elevated in sentiment than she
would ever have been without it
at st vizier i passed myself for monsieur palmer the
guardian the orphan heiresses st leon it fortunately
happened that my paternal estate was at this time
upon sale i determined to become the purchaser and to
settle my girls in the scene their nativity i procured
an agent and despatched him with an ample commission
for that purpose having adjusted this point i resolved to
make a tour with my daughters through languedoc dauphine
and the provinces usually known by the denomination
 the south france i wished to familiarise them to
the society madame chabot and to assist them in discerning
her merits under a variety points view i
asked them whether they would not be delighted to obtain
her as a companion who might assist and conduct them in
such points as only a woman understanding and experience
is competent to they every one them listened
to the idea with pleasure
at length i received the information that the purchase 
st leon was completed and i proceeded to the critical disclosure
that my daughters were on the point being
separated from their father they listened to the communication
with astonishment and terror they had entered
 travels op st leon
successively into the feelings their deceased mother and
i am well persuaded felt a less ardent attachment to my
person than they had done at the cottage the lake 
constance but culpable and criminal as i had been i
was not destitute every virtue and they could not extinguish
in themselves the respect they had so long entertained
for me habit has a resistless empire over the
human mind and when we reflect with how much reluctance
we consent to the removal a tree or a hedge to
the sight which we have been accustomed it will not be
wondered at that my daughters could not calmly think so
complete a separation from their father the impression
 their mother's death was yet green and to lose me was
to become orphans a second time but i had fully meditated
my plan and was peremptory that i might
withhold from them no advantage it was in my power to
confer i gave them bernardin for their superintending
bailiff and steward their property our parting was not
less painful and melancholy than its occasion was extraordinary
and its mode uncommon it took place at the
town montauban
i saw my dear children set forward on their journey and
i knew not that i should ever behold them more i was
determined never again to see them to their injury and i
could not take to myself the consolation on such a day
in such a month or even after such a lapse years i will
again have the joy to embrace them in a little while
they were out sight and i was alone the reader will
perhaps agree with me that no man had more exquisitely
enjoyed the dearest ties society than i had and that
perhaps few men were ever better formed to enjoy them
this complete and dreadful separation this stroke that
seemed to cut me off abruptly from every thing most
valuable that the earth contains was not the result any
 the ordinary necessities human life still less was it
the dictate alienation or indifference no it was the
pure effect love a love so strong complete and uncontrollable
as inflexibly to refuse every thing that could be
injurious to its objects i own i could not thus have
parted with marguerite her idea was mingled with the
travels st leon 
vital springs my existence and scarcely any power less
resistless than death could have made me consent to pass
an entire day without her society but then it is to be
considered that my daughters were in the morning life 
their hopes were untarnished their prospects not obscured
by a single cloud and that the crime would probably have
been greater obstinately to have made them the partners 
my misfortunes and disgrace there are persons who will
regard this passage in my history as culpable and the testimony
 a cold and unsusceptible heart i contemplate
it even at this distance time as the noblest and most
virtuous effort my life and a thousand circumstances
have occurred since to induce me to congratulate myself
that i had the courage to achieve my purpose
chapter xxix
nineteen years had now elapsed from the day that had
witnessed my union with marguerite de damville in all
that time had never been alone alone in a certain sense
indeed i had stood at paris in the period that had led to
my exile and at soleure in that which immediately succeeded
it in each case i was solitary and my solitude
was unhappy but my unhappiness was then in a certain
sense spontaneous my solitude was a luxury in which i
felt myself impelled to indulge he that has experienced
both will readily acknowledge the extreme difference between
the misery we embrace and the misery from which
we shrink with abhorrence and loathing i relinquished
in the former instances my dearest connections my proper
post and situation but i felt that i could return to the
one and resume the other at pleasure i repeat it therefore
then i had not been alone and now i was alone the
same motive which in this instance made me cut myself off
from my daughters that i might not be the cause their
misery forbad me to be the parent a future offspring
upon whom i might entail similar misfortune tell me
 travels st leon
then was i not alone i recollected the words the
stranger wrung from him by the excess his misery at the
summerhouse the lake alone alone friendless
friendless i began to penetrate the enigma his
history
i fixed my daughters with an ample revenue in the
chateau st leon i repurchased for them all my
paternal property i waited some time at montauban to
hear the event my project and their final settlement
i learned with pleasure that they found their situation
peaceful easy and reputable i enjoined them that they
should speak and think me as dead i led them to suppose
when i left montauban that i should set out upon
an extensive tour that i should traverse the indus and the
ganges and penetrate into the furthest extremities the
east how uncommon how pitiable a fate i became
prematurely dead to my country and my race because i
was destined never to die the first sensation i derived
from their prosperity as i have already said was pleasure 
my second was that which the devil might have felt when
he entered paradise for the seduction our first parents
i contemplated with some degree malignant envy a happiness
 which it was little probable i should ever partake
let me not be censured for this let any man put himself
in my situation and say whether the pleasure he feels at
contemplating the separated happiness those he loves be
not a mingled sensation with heavy heart i sought again
the road madrid
though my spirits underwent an extreme depression i
determined not to desert myself or the advantages i had
purchased at so inestimable a price i exerted myself to
shake off my lethargy and rouse the faculties my soul
i refused to give way to omens evil portent and resolved
to see what might yet be made my endowments there
is no misfortune that has not in it some slight mixture 
good my being now alone and detached from every relative
tie left me at liberty to pursue my projects with a
bolder enterprise the mistake which i accused myself
in the former instance was the entering too precipitately
into the exercise the gifts the stranger before i had
travels op st leon 
properly measured my strength and investigated the use
and application my tools i had suffered sufficiently
from the past uncertainty and irresoluteness my march
i determined as far as human precaution could secure its
ends to encounter no more misfortunes to subject myself to
no further miscarriages but to take care that henceforth the
tide my pursuits should move smoothly onward i dedicated
the six months immediately succeeding my separation
from my daughters to the joint contemplation morals
and natural philosophy i was resolved to ascertain the
simplest mode manufacturing wealth the wisest methods
for lulling the suspicions and controlling the passions 
mankind and the true science the use riches alas 
i had in the sequel frequent occasions to confess that
though i had fortuitously entered into possession the
leading secrets natural magic i was a mere tyro in the
science man at least in the degree in which the exercise
 these secrets required the possession it
nothing material occurred to interrupt the occupations 
the winter my apathy intellectual activity palsy 
the heart went evenly forward i made no acquaintance
 i was a mere spectator the busy scenes that passed
around me i was resolved not to entangle myself with
rashly formed connections and it will commonly be found
that he whose contemplations are principally employed upon
some secret and guarded hoard reflection has little propensity
to communicate upon idle and indifferent matters
a slight incident indeed disturbed me for a few days
during this interval but it passed away and for the present
i thought it no more during the festival christmas
it happened that i felt an inclination to be the spectator
 a celebrated bullfight that was exhibited before the emperor
and his court for the most part i was studious 
privacy i therefore felt the less scruple in indulging this
unusual caprice at the commencement the spectacle
i was attentive only to the exhibition i was delighted
with the form and beauty the animals with the freedom
and grandeur their motion with the terrible energy 
their assault and repulse it was not long however before
my eye was transiently caught by an individual who sat in
 travels op st leona
gallery at no great distance and who seemed to view me
attentively his figure bespoke some degree refinement
but his eye was fiery malicious and savage presently
however i turned again towards the area and thought 
him no more some time after by mere accident i looked
towards the same gallery and observed this man still in an
attitude to examine me it seemed as if he had not removed
his eyes from me during the whole interval this
was repeated three or four times without knowing why
i became anxious and uneasy i had a confused feeling
that i had seen the man before but whether in france
switzerland or italy i could not tell i experienced that
sort disagreeable sensation from looking at his face which
arises in the mind from an association the object present
with some mischief or suffering that was contemporary
with its being perceived in a preceding instance i am now
persuaded that this man was one the multitude to whom
i had addressed myself from the bench on the hill a short
time before my flight from pisa and that he was among
the most eager to interrupt and molest me but he was
apparently a spaniard by birth and i could not at this
time developed the mystery that hung about his features
finding that i could neither rid myself his curious and
watchful observation nor the disturbance it gave me i
withdrew from the gallery where i had hitherto been sitting
and removed to another gallery on the opposite side the
area about half an hour after looking accidentally round
i saw this very man at my elbow i then accosted him
with the enquiry do you know me sir to which he
immediately returned with a pure castilian accent no
senor he then began to be more reserved in his attention
to me without however entirely withdrawing it
as soon as the entertainment was over i went away and
saw no more my spaniard i began to tax myself with
pusillanimity in suffering so insignificant an incident to
disturb me a few days after however i suddenly lighted
upon him in the street he was talking to three or four
 his countrymen and in the progress his discourse
frequently pointed to me i could now perceive something
particularly hostile and ferocious in his countenance the
travels st leon 
first impulse i felt was that i would no longer suffer the
unquietness and anxiety the sight him produced in me
but would go up to him and force him to an explanation
i believed however that in the temper he indicated this
could not be done without involving myself in a quarrel
and i thought it wiser to endeavour to conquer in silence
an unreasonable sensation i therefore passed on he immediately
broke from his company and attempted to follow
me this i determined not to endure i laid my hand
on my sword with a peremptory look and waved to him to
desist his countenance then assumed an air diabolical
malignity he shook his head furiously and turned down
another street a strange sort animosity this between
two persons utter strangers to each other and which had
as yet not deigned to express itself by a word but such
is the world we hate we know not why we are ready
to cut each other's throats because we do not like the turn
 a feature or the adjustment a swordknot prejudice
party difference countries difference religions and a
thousand wild chimeras fanaticism or superstition are
continually arming us against a man whose virtues and
qualities we are ignorant and into whose benevolent or evil
intentions we disdain to enquire
i saw this spaniard but once more it was as i was on
the point entering the house a part which i occupied
i was particularly mortified at this circumstance it was
plain the man entertained for whatever reason a determined
animosity against me and i was grieved to furnish
him with that advantage for injuring me which consisted
in being acquainted with the place my residence i
would have turned away and gone down the street but i
had too fully marked my design entering the house
before i reconnoitered my enemy the displeasure i felt
was so unaccountably great that it was with difficulty my
courage got the better it and i determined not to change
the place my abode in a short time however as i have
already said i thought this incident no more that it
should have disturbed and unhinged me in the degree that
it had done even for a moment was a thing i could not
account for had the calamities in which the legacy 
x
 travels op st leon
the stranger involved me converted me in so short a time
from a knight and a soldier into a character that morbid
timidity as to tremble at every shadow or is there in
some human countenances a fascination a sort mysterious
sympathy and presentiment that makes us cower and quail
whenever we meet their eyebeams 
several weeks now passed away and i had nearly forgotten
all the circumstances this seemingly foolish story
when in a little excursion i chanced to make from madrid
to a place about twelve miles distant i was overtaken upon
the road by a cavalier respectable appearance who presently
took occasion to enter into conversation with me he
explained to me several the objects that presented themselves
on either side told the names the different nobility
and grandees who occupied the villas we saw and sometimes
entered into the particulars their history i at first gave
little encouragement to this communicative traveller but
there was something so polite in his manner and intelligent
in his discourse that i could not prevail upon myself to
treat him with rudeness or disrespect after having talked
for some time upon indifferent topics he led to the general
state literature in europe few subjects could appear
less dangerous than this as there were few upon which i
felt myself better qualified to converse by degrees i threw
off some my original reserve and i found my companion
well informed and ingenious lively in his manner and
pertinent in his remarks
by this time the unknown having discovered that i had
only come from madrid for a day's relaxation invited himself
to dine with me at my inn i departed from my
established system conduct on this occasion and admitted
his overture after dinner he gave me some account 
himself and his family and seemed to expect from me a
similar explicitness i was less pleased with him in this
particular than i had been with his frank and undesigning
conversation on the road strictly speaking however the
expectation implied was only a breach politeness i had
no reason to suppose that he foresaw it to be particularly
offensive to me observing my backwardness he immediately
changed the subject presently he remarked that
travels st leon 
by my physiognomy and accent he perceived i was a
frenchman and asked me if i had known cornelius
agrippa who died about twelve years before at grenoble i
answered in the negative the unknown then entered
into a warm eulogium the talents agrippa inveighed
against the illiberal treatment he had experienced in consequence
 his supposed proficiency in magic and spoke
with great asperity the priests and inquisitors who had
been his persecutors i became attentive watchful and
suspicious he went on to expatiate upon the praises 
the art magic which nothing he said but the jealousy 
churchmen had brought into disrepute affirmed that it
had been treated with respect and counted illustrious by
the ancients in the instance pythagoras apologies
thanes and others and expressed a great desire to become
a student the art himself this kind discourse made
me repent that i had been drawn in so far as to sit down
with this unknown and admit him as my companion 
the day during the whole time he was the principal
speaker sometimes he paused with a seeming desire to
hear my sentiments but i had now formed my resolution
and gave him no encouragement presently after i called
for my horse i should have observed that his servant
who followed him engaged in conversation with mine at
the same time that the dialogue began between their masters
seeing me about to depart the unknown motioned as if to
accompany me upon this i became serious
cc senor caballero said i i have now had the pleasure
 your company to dinner i am going home and
have the honour to bid you farewell it is neither my disposition
nor the habit the grave and dignified nation
among whom i at present reside to form permanent acquaintances
upon casual rencounters you will not therefore
think i violate the hospitality for which i am indebted
to them if i intimate to you my desire to return alone
all this i said with the grave and formal tone becoming
a spaniard and the unknown had nothing to reply it was
evident however that my dryness chagrined him and he
even muttered words resentment between his teeth i
could observe now a degree hostility and fury in his
x 
 travels op st leon
countenance which remarkably contrasted with the pliancy
and obligingness his preceding demeanour i took no
notice however these circumstances and rode away i
have since had sufficient reasons to convince me that these
two persons whose story but for that explanation may appear
to the reader exceedingly frivolous were the one an
informer and the other a spy the holy inquisition the
man who had seen me at pisa had his imagination terrified
and his superstition set in arms by all that he had heard 
me in that place and thought he could not perform a more
meritorious work than by giving intelligence to the fathers
what sort person had taken refuge in the metropolis
 this most catholic kingdom it was with this view he
had watched me and at length by an accident he deemed
peculiarly fortunate lodged me in my proper habitation
having given in his denunciation my travelling companion
was next fastened on me by the contrivance and zeal the
fathers inquisitors he was a familiar the holy office
and it is well known that persons the fairest prospects
and most polite education in spain are led by their religious
impressions to place a pride in performing menial and even
perfidious offices in the service the inquisition the
kind dishonour i put upon him in parting though a
nature he could not openly resent i fear conspired with his
zeal for god's and the church's honour to induce him to
relate a story concerning me more modelled by the bitterness
 his personal feelings than distinguished by a regard
to truth
such was the snare woven and drawing close round me
on all sides for my destruction i was made uneasy by
the rencounter the traveller but by no means aware 
the whole extent the mischief that impended over me
when i came to retrace point by point the discourse he
had held i could not conceive that the turn it had taken
originated in accident i perceived with no little grief 
heart and concern that i was known it was however
necessary that i should reflect maturely upon the conduct
to be pursued by me i ought not gratuitously to expose
myself to danger but then on the other hand it is a
point general wisdom and was particularly incumbent in
travels st leon q
my extraordinary circumstances not to suffer vigilance to
degenerate into restless anxiety it would be easy for me
if i were not strictly on my guard continually to find food
for suspicion and to surround myself with imaginary plots
and dangers this was a vice that i was willing enough
to pity in others but there was no character that i more
cordially disdained for myself there was none more
pointedly in opposition to that gallant generous confiding
spirit which had distinguished those military heroes my
native soil who had been the exclusive object my earliest
admiration and whom in my present dejected and deserted
situation i still desired to resemble when i came
to reflect i easily perceived that this vice was particularly
allied to a life solitude and that he who is cut off from
the genuine and happy connections husband father and
friend is all men most liable in their absence to conjure
up for himself the unnatural intercourse and reciprocations
 hostility it was thus that i artificially reconciled myself
to my situation and obstinately closed my eyes upon
those equivocal demonstrations danger which from time
to time were presented to my view
chapter xxx
such was the state my mind when it happened one
gloomy evening in the latter march that my valet
announced to me three gentlemen who were come to visit
me it was strange i had no visitors i indulged no
relaxation but that the street and public places do
you know who they are said i i accidentally looked
up and saw paleness and terror written in his countenance
he had not however time to reply before they burst into
the room they were alguazils the inquisition they
told me their errand was to conduct me to the holy office
i submitted and accompanied them it was already
dark they put me into a litter with the curtains drawn
and then arranged themselves in silence one on each side
x 
 travels st leon
while one brought up the rear i was taken by surprise 
nothing could be further from my expectation than such an
event as we passed along i ruminated with myself on
the line conduct it was incumbent on me to pursue to
make an immediate experiment the fidelity my guides
was a doubtful attempt if for want time and the opportunity
 a tranquil hearing i miscarried with them the
trial would be converted into evidence against me if i
succeeded i had then to escape out spain in the centre
 which i now was from the hostility a tribunal which
was said to surpass all the tribunals on the face the earth
in activity and vigilance i knew nothing that the
fathers the inquisition could have against me i had
lived in the most entire seclusion and i could defy
any one to report a single action mine since i had entered
spain to my prejudice i had been wholly occupied
with melancholy reflections on the past and solitary inventions
and devices which i purposed to bring forward for the
future i determined not to live for ever the slave fear
i believed that the best method for defeating a danger in
many cases was undauntedly to encounter it and i did
not imagine that i could have a more favourable opportunity
for that purpose than the present i had heard much
indeed the terrors the inquisition but a generous and
liberal spirit lends no very attentive ear to horrors the trite
and vulgar rumour which only has reached him i disdained
to be blown down with a breath i believed that
the inquisition itself would not venture to proceed criminally
against a man against whom nothing criminal had
been alleged in every event i believed it would never be
too late to have recourse to my peculiar prerogatives
upon entering the prison the inquisition i was first
conducted to a solitary cell it is not my intention to treat
 those particulars the holy office which are already
to be found in innumerable publications i have no pleasure
in reviving the images this sojourn horrors i
know it is unreasonable to despise a man for the miseries
and wretchedness he has endured but i know that such is
the human heart and i will not expose myself to be scoffed
at and trampled upon for my misfortunes i found myself
travels op st leon 
under the necessity while in the inquisition submitting
to that most profligate all impositions an oath secrecy
as to what had seen and what i had suffered and whatever
may be the strict morality such an obligation i will
not ambitiously thrust myself forward in violation it i
will restrict the story i have to relate to the peculiarities
that characterised my case and enter as little as possible
into the general policy this frontier intrenchment 
the christian faith
when i was brought up to be interrogated i was assailed
with innumerable questions the obvious purport 
which was as much as possible to extort from me evidence
 every kind that might be injurious to my cause the
object the inquisition is to defend our holy mother the
church from whatever might defile her sanctity and whiteness
every thing that calls into question the truth her
doctrines that pollutes and turns from their original purpose
any her ordinances or that implies commerce and league
with the invisible enemy saints it is its peculiar province
to investigate the fathers are therefore particularly cautious
that they may not by confining their questions too
much to a single object preclude themselves from the chance
 discovering danger under all the forms it may assume
it is presumed that he who is a corrupt member the
church christ in one point is unsound and unfaithful in
others
the inquisitor who examined me first demanded
whether i were informed for what cause i was brought
before that tribunal whether i did not find myself able
to conjecture the nature my offence whether i did not
know the sort crimes for which men were detained in
that prison he then desired me to recollect myself and
consider whether i were not conscious offence against
the holy catholic church whether i had never asserted
or maintained any doctrine contrary to what mother
church asserts and maintains whether i had never to
my knowledge defiled any the ordinances god or
applied things sacred to unholy and profane purposes
whether i had never invocation the devil whether i
had never held any commerce or entered into any league
x 
 travels op st leon
with the enemy saints whether i had never performed
or sought to perform preternatural and miraculous acts by
unholy means whether i had never vexed or sought to
vex those against whom i had enmity by secret and forbidden
arts whether i had never resided in countries the
inhabitants which were heretics and whether i had never
listened to their discourses and arguments whether when
i inhabited such countries i had never assisted at the celebration
 divine ordinances performed by heretics or in a
form which holy church disapproves or condemns 
finding that he could gain nothing upon me by these
general interrogatories the inquisitor next descended to
particulars he enquired concerning the incidents my
pisan story which having first assured myself from the
train his questions that some representation that unfortunate
affair had reached his ear i willingly related to
the same extent that i had previously done to the marchese
filosanto
he then proceeded to a great number questions the
source which is to be traced to the commonly received
notions respecting sorcerers and necromancers they were
so artfully contrived and so large in their scope that it was
not easy to guess whether they related to any particular accusation
alleged against me or were formed entirely on
general principles yet some them were so minute so
connected and arranged so perfectly in series that i could
not but believe they were an echo the calumnies invented
against me at pisa which however as i had never collected
any regular and detailed account i could not accurately
trace the influence on the present occasion
the inquisitor demanded me whether i had never
seen or held conversation with any supernatural being or
the spirit a man departed whether i had never practised
diabolical arts to raise the dead whether i had
never had a familiar in the form some insect domestic
animal or reptile he was particularly subtle and copious
in his questions respecting the history my unfortunate
dog endeavouring to surprise me in some slip or contradiction
in what i affirmed on the subject he asked whether
i had never assumed a form different from my real one
either a different age and appearance or a different species
travels st leon
 animal whether i had never hy the agency 
my demon inflicted sickness convulsionfits or death 
whether i had never caused the mortality cattle
whether i had not the power being in two places at
once whether i had never been seen riding through the
air whether i had never been wounded in my absence
by a blow aimed at my astral spirit or apparition whether
i had never possessed books conjuration or the art magic 
whether it had never happened to me that an indifferent
person indiscreetly perusing a spell or incantation in my
possession had been maimed or killed by the spirits he had
unfeignedly evoked 
a further object particularly pursued in my interrogatory
was the detection my property and the questions constructed
for this purpose were uncommonly artful and
multiplied the inquisitor told me that the holy office
was by the nature its institution the guardian and administrator
 every person that fell under its animadversion
shut up he said as i must be during the pendency
 my cause and separated from the rest mankind i
was wholly incapable superintending my worldly affairs
which unless they were properly looked into might in the
interval be materially injured i ought therefore implicitly
and without reserve to refer myself in this point to the
care the fathers if my innocence were established ashe
hoped and earnestly prayed to the mother god and
the saints jesus might ultimately happen i should find
the holy office a faithful and qualified steward if on the
contrary i should be proved a heretic and an alien to the
most high i ought then to rejoice in the beneficent interference
 the fathers who by dedicating my wealth to
consecrated purposes would mitigate in the eye the just
judge heaven and earth the duration or fierceness my
punishments in a future world the inquisitor had apparently
heard various reports my riches and was inexpressibly
chagrined that he should be found so unskilful
a member his profession as not to be able to extort from
me a full confession on that head after having employed
every artifice menace and terror after having endeavoured
to soothe and cajole me by blandishments and persuasion
and finding all his expedients fruitless he poured
 travels st leon
upon me the full storm his indignation he said it
was apparent that i was dealing disingenuously and fraudulently
with the delegated guardians religion j it was
impossible that the expenditure i was well known more or
less to have incurred could be supported without considerable
funds and my evident duplicity and concealment in
this point must be regarded as a full confirmation every
crime my accusers had alleged against me
in the course my examinations the inquisitor who
questioned me gave himself the trouble entering into a
full vindication the tribunal which he was a member
he said that every thing that was valuable to mankind
not only in a future state but also in the present depended
upon preserving in full vigour and strength the sacred institutions
 the christian faith and that those who were
endowed with powers sufficient for that purpose would be
in the highest degree inexcusable in the sight god if
they did not vigilantly and inflexibly maintain the exertion
 those powers it was an egregious mistake selfwilled
and opinionated men to suppose that the maintenance 
our holy religion was sufficiently provided for by the clearness
 its evidence it was no less dangerous to pretend
that the stability and duration the church christ
might be confided to the providence god providence
acts by human means and it was presumptuous for those
who neglected the means to trust that they should nevertheless
see the adequately secured why had providence
thought proper to generate an alliance between church
and state and to place the powers and authority human
society in the hands the adherents the christian faith 
magistrates and governments were thus made the vicars 
heaven and great would be their condemnation if they
neglected the trust reposed in them the great adversary
 mankind was incessantly watchful for the destruction 
souls and while he spread abroad his delusions it was
folly to imagine that evidence alone was powerful enough
to counteract them what judges were the great mass 
mankind the integrity and validity evidence the jest
 the scorner was ever at hand to turn into ridicule the most
sacred mysteries the opposers our holy faith were in
travels st leon 
indefatigable in their industry and as anxious in their exertions
to deprive their fellowmen every comfort and hope
as if infidelity which was the curse the human species
were the greatest blessing that could be conferred on
them the devil was a hard taskmaster and granted no
vacation night or day to those who enlisted themselves in
the support his cause it might answer well enough
the purpose the vainglorious theorist to suppose that
man was a rational animal but they who had regarded
human society with an observing eye knew that it was
otherwise delusion would ever be too hard for evidence
and the grossest falsehoods prove victorious over the most
sacred truths if what was illiberally and maliciously styled
persecution were not brought in aid the cause religion
the passions mankind were on the side falsehood
man unrestrained by law was a wild ferocious and most
pernicious beast and were it not for the wholesome curb
 authority would speedily throw off all ties and limitations
human and divine nothing could more clearly
prove that the heretical followers luther and calvin
who had lately sprung up for the plague mankind
whatever they might pretend were in reality the determined
enemies all revelation than their continual demand
that the cause should be tried by discussion and
that every man should be defended in the exercise his
private judgment they could not but know every
man not totally robbed all power discernment must
know that if this demand were once granted it would
prove a blow at the root every sentiment religion
the inquisition therefore was the most salutary institution
that had ever been devised and the future welfare 
mankind wholly depended upon the maintenance its
powers and its maxims by a moderate and judicious
exhibition terror it superseded the necessity innumerable
punishments the inquisition was not capricious
and uncertain in its policy it acted under the direction 
immutable laws it held a tender but a firm rein upon the
extravagances and madness mankind nothing was
more notorious than that a regular and systematical proceeding
was both more effectual and more generous than
 travels op st leon
one that was fickle he defied the whole history the
world to produce an example so merciful a tribunal
the great its policy was the reclaiming sinners
and the multiplication penitents who after a gentle
and salutary discipline were again by holy church received
into her bosom and even when they delivered the finally
impenitent to the flames it was to the flames a purifying
fire which by destroying the flesh redeemed or diminished
the punishments a future world he knew that an outcry
had been artfully raised against the proceedings the
holy office but it was easy to see that its enemies under
the pretence compassion for its victims concealed an
inveterate animosity against property religion and civil
society the anabaptists had thrown off the mask and
discovered their true designs and the rest were only more
plausible and specious in proportion as they were more
timid the present was the most important crisis that
ever occurred in the history the world there was a
spirit at work that aimed at dissolving all the bonds 
civil society and converting mankind into beasts and
savages who had not heard the levellers millenarians
and fifthmonarchymen who under the specious guise 
disinterestedness and an universal love mankind had
nothing in view but the most sacrilegious and unprincipled
depredations it was true that the preachers these
doctrines were utterly contemptible both for numbers and
talent but it would be found a shortsighted policy to
overlook these desperate assailants on account the poorness
and meanness their qualifications for his own
part he did not hesitate to say that human society would
owe its preservation if it were preserved to the merciful
yet vigorous proceedings the court inquisition the
misrepresentations that were invidiously made the present
firm and vigilant system policy would be heard fora
day and then universally abandoned posterity he was
well assured would do full justice to the sagacity and
soundness the conduct this calumniated and much
injured institution
the reader will forgive me if the panegyric thus elaborately
pronounced by the inquisitor who examined me
travels op st leon 
upon the court which he was a member had not all the
weight with my mind at the moment i heard it which he
will probably ascribe to it in the calmness the closet
it is so difficult to be impartial in our own cause the
candid mind will no doubt make a large allowance for the
unhappy situation in which i now stood and the bitter and
galling thoughts that preyed upon my memory but if i
am chargeable with temporary injustice in the judgment i
then passed on the arguments the inquisitor i flatter
myself that i have been able after the interval that has
elapsed to give a true and adequate statement them
beside these reasonings on the necessity a wholesome
restraint on the privileges speaking and writing the
father in another my examinations condescended to
delineate to me the mysteries the world spirits he
reminded me that in the first grand rebellion upon record
that the fallen angels which he considered the present
defection under luther and calvin as in some measure a
counterpart a third the host heaven had been thrust
out the celestial mansions these accursed spirits had
since been permitted to pursue their machinations on
the face our earth the devil like a roaring lion
goeth about seeking whom he may devour the oracles
 the heathens the temptations job and our saviour
and the demoniac sacred writ were examples the
extensive power which heaven had thought fit to allow
him men a sceptical and feeble understanding had
been tempted to doubt whether this was consistent with
the wisdom and goodness god but though it was in
vain for us to pretend to fathom the depth the divine
mysteries there were certain reasons that were sufficiently
obvious to every ingenuous mind there were persons in
all ages the world who like the sadducees in the time
 our blessed saviour were inclined to affirm that there
was no resurrection neither angel nor spirit and god
permitted the lying wonders infernal agents the more
completely to confound the unbelief his enemies he
who witnessed the wonderful operations witchcraft or
saw the ghost a man departed could not doubt the
interference invisible agents in the concerns our
 travels st leon
nether world and if there were devils and apparitions it
would be to the last degree unreasonable to deny the existence
 god or the miracles christ these were to
be received as the grounds the divine permission 
sorcerers necromancers and witches but the rules 
the divine conduct were not to constitute the rules ours
he might permit the agency invisible malice because
he saw things upon an unlimited scale his judgments were
infallible and he could say to beelzebub himself thus
far shalt thou go and no further those to whose care
was intrusted the welfare mankind here or hereafter
were bound as far as possible to oppose themselves to the
empire satan his power was given him only for a
time and if not strictly restrained god and the powers
ordained god it would overrun every thing and plunge
all this beautiful scene creation in its original chaos
there was an endless and eternal war between god and
the devil and the governors the church were heaven's
fieldofficers and pioneers for carrying it on all the
crimes he added to which the depravity human nature
had given birth the most astonishing and the most horrible
was that diabolical commerce that human
creatures should be so far infatuated as to enter into
league with the declared enemy souls and for the possession
 a shortlived and precarious power to sign away
their spirits to eternal damnation was so extraordinary as
to have been wholly unworthy credit were it not supported
by evidence as strong and irresistible as that the
miracles jesus christ himself the persons who thus
voluntarily made themselves accursed before god deserved
to be regarded with alienation and horror by the whole
human race every man that saw them was bound by
his baptismal engagements to destroy them and whoever
administered to them the smallest portion food drink
or comfort thereby rendered himself a party to their guilt
the inquisition especially had declared against this race 
men eternal war and considered their crime as more complicated
audacious and pestilential than any other branch
 heresy having for his own part no doubt that i was
one these noxious and enormous reprobates he exhorted
travels op st leon 
me to make a voluntary confession my evil deeds and
by submitting readily to the tortures and punishments 
this world endeavour to free myself if it were yet possible
from those the world to come
these discourses the inquisitor were variously interspersed
through the three examinations to which i was
subjected a short time after i became an inhabitant the
holy house on my part i endeavoured to the best my
power to repel the imputations cast upon me to establish
my innocence and to confound the severity my oppressors
i told the inquisitor whatever might be the force 
his arguments respecting heresy and dealings with the devil
they were nothing to me i was no lutheran no anabaptist
no necromancer no underminer the faith others orally
 the prince the infernal regions i proudly and
earnestly demanded to be confronted with my accusers i
asked my examiner in his turn what sort justice that
was which pretended to proceed capitally against its prisoners
upon secret and unavowed accusations he endeavoured
to stop me he told me that i was not brought
there to arraign the methods and practices their court 
that it did not become a prisoner put upon his defence to
insult his judges that this contumacy could not be regarded
but as an aggravation my guilt and that i was bound
strictly and simply to answer the interrogatories that were
proposed to me the rebuke the inquisitor was unavailing
my spirit was wrought to too high a pitch to be thus
restrained i was too firmly resolved to give the utmost
force mind and truth to the topics my just defence
it is the practice the inquisition for the prisoner to sit
during his examination i started upon my feet
the mode your proceeding cried i is the mockery
 a trial from your fatal bar no man can go forth acquitted
how is a story to be refuted when hardly and
with difficulty you suffer your prisoner to collect the slightest
fragments it if i would detect a calumny is it not requisite
that i should be acquainted with its history and
know its authors and propagators then i may perhaps be
able to confound their forgeries to show the groundlessness
 their allegations to expose the baseness their purposes
 travels st leon
and the profligacy their characters i am informed 
nothing yet i am bid first to be my own accuser and then
to answer the accusations others it is only by following
a falsehood through all its doubling that it can be effectually
destroyed you bid me unravel a web and will not
suffer me to touch it with one my fingers the defence
 the purest innocence is often difficult sometimes impossible
against the artfulness a malicious tale or the
fortuitous concurrence unfavourable appearances but
you strip innocence those consecrated weapons by which
only it can be defended give to an accusation the particulars
with which what really happens must always be
attended give to it the circumstances place and time
lay aside the ambiguity and generalities in which you shelter
yourselves and then perhaps then only it can be victoriously
repelled you ask me a thousand various and artfully
constructed questions what sort a man do you imagine
me to be i am not a fool that i should be inveigled i
am not a boy that i should be menaced into confessions
cease your base and unprincipled arts i will furnish no
materials against myself if you know any thing against me
avow it propose it and i will answer think not to patch
up a miserable accusation out the words which inadvertence
or weariness may cause me to utter shame on
your institution may infamy overtake the system your
proceedings that religion which is supported by such
means is viler than atheism that civilisation which has
its basis in despotism is more worthless and hateful than
the state savages running wild in their woods
do you not perceive that the language i am now holding
to you is the exclusive privilege conscious innocence
the indignation i express is no artificial rage studiously
contrived to overbear accusation you have it as it flows
spontaneously to my tongue warm from the promptings 
an honest heart if i could have consulted a friend it is
probable he would have dissuaded me from my present
demeanour as impolitic if i were governed by the dictates
 an ordinary prudence i should have displayed less
ardour less resentment but i am willing to try whether
shame cannot yet be lighted up even in the cheek an
inquisitor
travels st leon
the father who examined me having in vain endeavoured
to check the current my invective changed his manner
and assumed a tone diametrically the reverse mine he
professed that he felt much compassion and interest for my
misfortune and should deem himself happy if he could bethe
instrument my deliverance the language i had
uttered was highly indecorous and such as seemed in itself
to call for a rigorous penance but he should not think
himself worthy the name a man if he did not make suitable
allowance for the bitter and extravagant sentiments
that would occasionally find their way into the mind one
in my unfortunate situation so circumstanced men would
often mistake their friends for their enemies i regarded
the inquisition as my enemy it was in reality my firm and
disinterested friend zealously watchful for my body my
my soul and my estate other courts had other maxims
 proceeding because their motives action were different
and it was but just that they should furnish their prisoners
with a defence against their frailty but the breast an
inquisitor was accessible to no sentiment but that love
a burning love god love the church love the
prisoner who might be wrongfully accused love the
penitent whom he reconciled to our common mother the
church love even the incorrigible heretic whose body he
burned for the good his soul the inquisitor did not
discover to the prisoner the evidence adduced against him 
that was between god and the inquisitor's conscience but
the suppression which was thus practised rendered him
doubly scrupulous and sceptical as to the evidence he received
 he sifted it with a severity that the prisoner would
in vain endeavour to imitate and the rules evidence in
that court were so guarded punctilious and minute as to
render any mistake in its proceedings altogether impossible
for a man to be once a prisoner the court inquisition
by a salutary prejudice which prevailed through the catholic
world rendered him for ever infamous this was another
cause the extreme wariness and caution with which that
court was accustomed to proceed they first listened to
the accuser who was obliged to give in his information on
oath they then instituted a secret enquiry against the
y
 travels st leon
party accused and till they had collected abundant ground
for their proceeding they did not venture to touch a hair 
his head they elaborately classed all the different degrees
 evidence into half proof full proof proof less than half
and proof less than full when these things were duly considered
it would appear certain that no court that had at anytime
existed on earth had ever been so tender in its proceedings
so pure in its incitements and so every way superior
to the attacks calumny and malice as the court 
inquisition
with respect to myself in particular he said they had
not apprehended me and put me upon my defence without
previously assembling a large body miscellaneous and
circumstantial evidence the evidence they had drawn
from myself was negative only but it was strong the obscurity
that hung about my person who i was and whence
i came and the obscurity that hung about my fortune a
great visible expenditure in spain or in italy and no visible
means these were not the signatures and tokens innocence
they tended strongly to confirm the accusation
under which i laboured yet so tender was the inquisition
in its proceeding and so chary its reputation that upon
these accumulated proofs and presumptions they were not
prepared to pronounce against me they would hear me
again and again they would give me time to recollect
myself and for this purpose they would order for me a
coarse and scanty fare and a solitary cell i might depend
upon it my contumacy should be overcome the fundamental
principle their proceedings was borrowed from
that humane and compassionate maxim the old roman
law de vita hominis nulla cunctatio est long and i
should accordingly find them free from all precipitation and
impatience and ready to indulge me with a residence however
long in their prisons till my case had been sifted to
the bottom
travels st leon
chapter xxxi
the indulgence thus ostentatiously proclaimed by the fatherinquisitor
was not exactly to my taste finding that all
the energy mind i could apply to my defence was vain
i determined to have recourse to a different mode proceeding
i received three admonitions as they call them
the substance which i have already recited in the course
 the first ten days my confinement and i then for
some time heard the inquisitor no more i understood
that it was frequently the practice after three admonitions
not to bring up the prisoner for further hearing
during a whole year and it appeared sufficiently probable
from the last words addressed to me by my judge
that this policy was intended to be employed in my
case without further delay therefore i resolved to recur
to the expedient in the use which my power was
unbounded and by a brilliant offer at once to subdue the
scruples and secure the fidelity the person or persons
upon whom my safe custody might be found to depend
all that was necessary was to convince the party to whom
i should propose the assisting me the reality my
powers and then to put carte blanche into his hands or
rather to ascertain at once the extent his hopes and demands
and by a spirited and peremptory conduct to yield
them all in the period which immediately previous to
my present imprisonment i had devoted to the meditation
 my future plans and the review my past i had severely
accused myself half measures and had determined to
abjure all hesitation and irresoluteness for the time to come
it is not indeed to be wondered at that possessing a power
so utterly remote from common ideas and conceptions and
which speaking from experience i do not hesitate to affirm
no mere effort imagination is adequate to represent i
should have acted below the prerogatives and demands 
my situation this mistake i would make no more i
would overwhelm opposition by the splendour my proceedings
and confound scruples by the dignity and princely
y 
 travels st leon
magnificence my appearance unshackled as i was with
connections and risking no one's happiness but my own i
proposed to compel the human species to view me from an
awful distance and to oblige every one that approached me
to feel his inferiority it would be to the last degree disgraceful
and contemptible in me being raised so far above
my peers in my privileges if i were to fall below the ordinary
standard a gallant man in the decision and firmness
 my system conduct decision and firmness were the
principles to be exercised by me now dignity and magnificence
must await their turn hereafter
it was not long before i embraced an opportunity 
speaking to the man who waited on me with my daily
allotment provisions and i designed as shortly as possible
to proceed to that species argument in which i
principally confided to engage him in my cause but he
did not suffer me to utter a sentence before with a very
expressive gesture he interrupted me i had remarked
already the silence which seemed for ever to pervade this
dismal abode but i had not ascribed importance enough to
this circumstance to suppose that it could materially interfere
with the project i had formed i now perceived the
countenance my attendant to be overspread with terror
and alarm he put his hand upon my mouth and by his
attitude seemed earnestly to insist upon my conforming to
the rules the prison i was not however to be thus
diverted from my purpose i seized his hands and began
again to pursue the discourse i had meditated this proceeding
on my part induced him to break the silence he
had hitherto preserved he told me that if i did not instantly
set him at liberty he would alarm the prison i
loosed his hands i then by every gesture i could devise
endeavoured to prevail on him to approach me to suffer me
to confer with him in the lowest whisper and assured
him that he should have no reason to repent his compliance
i might as well have addressed myself to the walls that
inclosed me he would not stay an instant he would
yield in nothing he burst from me abruptly and closing
the door my cell left me in solitude and darkness
travels st leon 
in the evening the day this attempt the keeper 
the prison entered my apartment when he appeared i
began to flatter myself that in this man i should find a
better subject for my purpose than in the poor turnkey who
had given me so unfavourable a prognostic my success
i lost no time in saying to him that i had something important
to communicate but he peremptorily commanded
me to be silent and listen to what he was about to say tome
he told me that i had already been complained
against for speech and i was now repeating my offence
he advised me to ponder well the consequences what i
was doing the orders the inquisition were rigorous
and inflexible the cells were not so substantially separated
but that a voice might be heard from one to the other
yet it had happened more than once that a husband and
wife a father and child had for years been lodged next to
each other without the smallest suspicion on either part 
the proximity their situation he was astonished at the
pertinacity my behaviour there was no government on
the face the earth he would venture to say that had subjects
more obedient more dutiful and exemplary than the
holy inquisition not a murmur was ever heard not a
discontent ever expressed all was humbleness thankfulness
and gratitude he recommended to me to conform
myself to my situation and let him hear no further complaints
 me he had no sooner finished his harangue
than he left me as abruptly as his servant had done it is
not possible to impart any adequate image the inflexibility
 his features or the stern composure his demeanour

i now saw my situation in a different point view
bribery was no use where all intercourse was denied
great god into what position was i got in the midst
 a great and populous city at this time perhaps the metropolis
 the world i heard occasionally from beyond the
limits my prison the hum busy throngs or the shouts
 a tumultuous populace yet i was myself in the deepest
solitude like the wretched mariners i have somewhere
read shipwrecked upon a desert shore i might remain
encaged till i lost all recollection european language

and all acquaintance with the sound my own voice a
jailor from time to time entered my apartment but to me
he was simply a moving and breathing statue his features
never moulded into the expression a meaning nor his
mouth opened for the utterance a sound from the first
i had been struck with the extreme and deathlike silence
that characterised the place my confinement but my
mind was occupied with other thoughts and i had not
adverted to the cause the phenomenon i had then felt
little inclination to the converse a jailor my natural disposition
was somewhat singular for a frenchman and inclined
to taciturnity i had resolved to make a fair and
ample trial the power a just defence where my innocence
was so complete and i was entirely disengaged
from those unfavourable appearances which had constituted
my misfortune at constance and i even rejoiced that a
silence which i regarded as casual and individual delivered
me from all fear impertinence in my attendant with
how different a temper do we contemplate an incident
which we persuade ourselves continues to operate only
because we want inclination to remove it and an incident
which is violently imposed and to which with the utmost
exertion our strength we cannot succeed to impart the
slightest shock the external object is the same its picture
in the intellectual sensorium how unlike what a profound
and inconceivable refinement in the art tyranny is this
silence the jailor might well tell me that beneath his
roofs there was neither complaint nor murmur that the
very soul its inhabitants was subdued and that they
suffered the most unheard oppressions without astonishment
or indignation this is the peculiar prerogative 
despotism it produces many symptoms the same general
appearance as those which are derived from liberty and
justice there are no remonstrances there is no impatience
or violence there is a calm a fatal and accursed
tranquillity that pervades the whole the spectator enters
and for a time misinterprets every object he sees he perceives
human bodies standing or moving around him and
it is with the utmost surprise if he has leisure and opportunity
to observe a little further that he finds at last the
travels st leon 
things he sees to be the mere shades men cold inert
glaring bodies which the heavenborn soul has long since
deserted wonderful i hesitate not to affirm is the genuine
and direct power such a situation as that in which
i was now placed upon the human imagination what
was it then to me to whom speech was not merely one 
those things misnamed indulgences misnamed luxuries
upon which the desirableness and the health human existence
depend but who had looked to it as the only and
the assured means my rescue from this scene horrors 
i intreat the reader to pardon me when i confess that the
operation the discovery i made was so overwhelming
and apparently desperate that it was some weeks i might
say months before my mind recovered its wonted bias and
activity
it was towards the close the period i have named
that a new incident concurring with that familiarity which
serves in some measure to disarm every mischief its
sting restored and reawakened my mind i had vegetated
now for some time if the metaphor can with propriety be
applied to existence in a noxious and imprisoned air by
which all vegetation would have been undermined and
which the vital principle in man is scarcely competent to
surmount and in all this period had encountered nothing
from without nor received any intimation that could in the
slightest degree interrupt the progressive destruction and
waste the soul one day at the customary hour my
being attended by my warder i was surprised to see him
bring with him a visiter to my cell the unknown was a
man with grey hairs and a silver beard though once tall
he now stooped considerably and supported himself with a
staff his dress was simple and neat and his whole appearance
prepossessing a sweet serenity was diffused over his
countenance yet there were occasionally a fire and a contemplative
grasp thought expressed in his eyes which
sufficiently proved to me that his serenity was not the result
 vacancy all this i discerned by the faint and uncertain
light a small lamp which the warder had brought with
him and placed upon my table the introduction was
performed in silence and the warder left us alone the
y 
 travels st leon
unknown beckoned me to be seated for the first emotion
 surprise at the entrance a stranger had caused me to
start on my feet and opening a folding stool he had received
from my attendant he placed himself beside me
he then addressed me in a low voice and told me that
the humanity the fathers the inquisition had given
him permission to visit me and that if i would be so
obliging in conformity to the regulations the prison as
to lower my voice to the standard his we were at liberty
to confer together he hoped the conference would be some
relief to my solitude if not lead to my complete liberation
he then unfolded to me his story he told me that he
like myself had been committed to the prisons the inquisition
upon an accusation sorcery having advanced
thus far he stopped he talked miscellaneously and digressively
 wizards and their familiars possessions and demons
 charms spells talismans and incantations even 
the elixir vita and the philosopher's stone sometimes in
the progress this discourse i could perceive him observing
me with the utmost narrowness as if he would dive into
my soul and again particularly when he caught a glance
 suspicion in my eye with infinite address changing his
attitude and tone and assuming a surprising air ingenuousness
and gaiety in a word he was a consummate
actor it was evident whether his designs were hostile or
friendly that his purpose was to make himself master 
my secret i asked him whether the accusation sorcery
which had been preferred against him were well founded
or a calumny he evaded that question and was only
influenced by it to talk more copiously and fluently on other
topics with the apparent design making me forget the
enquiry i had made he avoided anticipation lest he should
miscalculate and take wrong ground in my affair and
though superficially he seemed communicative i found that
he scarcely told me respecting himself any one thing definite
and clear he celebrated the clemency the fathers the
inquisition he said they seemed to regard themselves as
the adoptive parents those they held in their custody
and were anxious solely for the restoration souls in
their exterior they were austere and had unfortunately contravels
 st leon 
traced a forbidding manner but he had soon found upon
a closer inspection their character that the only way to
deal successfully with them was to repose in them a perfect
confidence this panegyric was not resorted to till he had
exhausted the various topics by which he had hoped himself
to extort my secret from me i asked him whether
the effect his reposing confidence had been an abjuration
 sorcery and reconciliation to the church but this question
experienced the fate every other that i addressed to
him he only told me generally that he had every reason
to be satisfied with and to speak well the treatment he
had experienced in the house the inquisition he possessed
or rather as i believed affected a character 
thoughtless garrulity and loquacity well adapted to cover
the strange deviations and abrupt transitions that marked
his discourse it was certainly singularly contrasted with
that close and penetrating air which from time to time i
remarked in him
the reader may deem it surprising and unaccountable 
but certain it is i took uncommon delight in this man's
company i pressed him earnestly to repeat his visits and
would scarcely suffer him to depart till he had promised
to come to me again the next day or the day after yet i
looked on him as my mortal enemy and had no doubt that
he was one the infamous wretches employed by the
policy the inquisition and well known beneath those
hated roofs by the appellation moscas various reasons
may be assigned for my conduct in this particular let it
first be remembered that i was alone and for months had
not heard the sound my own voice no incident marked
my days j no object arrested my attention a dull heavy
pestilential souldepressing monotony formed the history
 my life if in this situation i had been visited by a
mouse or a rat i should indefatigably have sought to get
within reach it i should have put it to my bosom and have
felt with exultation the beat an animal pulse the warmth
 animal life pressing responsively on my heart with
what eager appetite i should have mixed in scenes calamity
and cruelty intolerable to any other eye glad for
myself that even upon such terms i could escape the frosts
travels op st leon
bound winter the soul how i should have rejoiced
like king richard england to see four grim and deathdealing
assassins enter my cell like him to struggle and
wrestle and contend with my murderers though as in his
case wounds and a fatal should be the result thus
feeling then it is little wonderful that i should have hailed
with pleasure the visit the musca
but this was not all while i conferred with or rather
listened to my visiter that pride and self complacency
which i suspect to be the main or at least the indispensable
ingredient all our pleasures revived in my heart i believed
that he was set upon me by these insatiable bloodsuckers
 the inquisition that he might ensnare me with
his questions and treacherously inveigle me to the faggot
and the stake i felt a last lambent intimation pride
within me when my heart whispered me this man shall
not attain his ends i secretly defied his arts and amused
myself with baffling his most cunning devices i had now
some one with whom to measure myself the comparison
i own for a descendant the counts st leon was a
humble one but it is not permitted a prisoner in the jails
 the inquisition to be fastidious in his pleasures this
man i played with at my ease and laughed at his stratagems
i therefore felt that i was his superior and which
was a sensation i had not lately been accustomed to that i
was somebody these feelings recommended to me his
visits
but what was much more material i looked further
and proposed an ultimate to this occurrence let it
be recollected what was my unhappiness when i found
myself if i may be allowed the expression suddenly deprived
 speech and then it will easily be understood how
sincerely i rejoiced to have this faculty restored to me
speech as i have already said i had regarded as the only
and assured means my deliverance from this scene 
horrors i therefore doubted not that from this miserable
tool my oppressors i would obtain my enlargement i
stood firmly on my guard i permitted him to run out
the whole length his own project without interruption
by this delay i should better understand his character and
travels op st leon 
finally seize it with a more decisive grasp thus purposing
i allowed three or four visits to pass before i opened to the
musca my own proposal i designed unexpectedly to turn
the tables upon him to surprise and finish with him at
once i knew not that all this precaution was necessary
but i played for too deep a stake not to be anxious to omit
nothing which hereafter in retrospect i might reproach
myself that i had omitted
the time was at length come at which i judged it convenient
to execute what i had planned in my mind i
began with an attempt to mortify and humble my guest in
his own eyes that he might lose the pride to make the
smallest resistance to my proposal
 do you think my good sir cried i that i have not
perfectly understood your intentions all this while you have
pretended to be my friend and to come to me for my good
i know that every secret i reposed in your fidelity every
word that i might unguardedly have dropped every look
and gesture that could have been interpreted to my disadvantage
would have been instantly reported to the fathers
 the inquisition why what a poor and miserable fool
must you have imagined me to be how came you into
my cell had you a secret key by which you found your
way hither unknown could you ever have come into my
apartment if you had not been employed you fawn
upon me and are the tame and passive agent my merciless
destroyers shame on such base and perfidious proceedings
 is this religion that you should flatter and
cajole and lie to a man purely that you may have the gratification
at last burning him alive if you or your
masters can make out any thing to my disadvantage let
them make it out in the way fair and open trial by the
production direct evidence and calling on me for my
defence they style themselves the champions christendom
and ornaments our holy faith they pretend to
an extraordinary degree sanctity and would have all men
bow down in mute reverence and astonishment at their
godliness and yet they have recourse to means so base
that the most profligate and abandoned tyrant upon
record would have disdained to employ them but base
travels op st leon
as are the judges and assessors the court in whose prison
i stand even they scorn the meanness the perfidious task
in which you have engaged
the vehemence i put into the suppressed and undertone
with which i delivered these reproaches seemed to produce
no emotion in my guest he dropped his staff upon his
shoulder he meekly folded his arms upon his bosom and
answered that he had long since learned to bear every
contumely for the cause god and the redeemer they
were heavendirected chastisements which his manifold sins
and iniquities had amply deserved
hypocrite replied i would you make me believe
that a conscientious motive can prompt such conduct as
yours can mould your features into a treacherous expression
 kindness and fill your mouth with lies and deceptions
innumerable 
no proceedings rejoined he with an unaltered air
are base that god and his church prescribe i take up
the cross with cheerfulness and glory in my shame the
more ignominious in the eyes an unregenerate world is
my conduct the more entire and implicit does it prove my
obedience to be
my heart swelled within me as he talked i could lend
no attention to such despicable cant and was ashamed to
see the most profligate conduct assuming to itself the pretensions
to an extraordinary degree sanctity and disinterestedness

come come said i dissembler i know that nothing
could buy a man to so loathsome an office but money
you are some galleyslave some wretch who by your complicated
crimes have forfeited your life to the community
and are now permitted to earn a miserable existence by
lying in wait for the unfortunate and engaging in arts at
which humanity shudders i take you upon your own
terms you are the man i want assist me to escape go
with me to some safer and less cruel country i will reward
you to the extent your wishes give me your
hand an estate six thousand pistoles per annum without
further condition waits your acceptance i invoke all
the powers sacred to truth and punishers deceit to
travels st leon s
witness that i have ability to make good the whole what
i promise
while i spoke i could perceive an extraordinary revolution
taking place in my guest the meekness and tranquillity
 his countenance subsided his eye became
animated and alive i hailed the auspicious omen i urged
my proposal with all the impetuosity i could exert and all
the arguments i could devise at length i paused i
looked again at the countenance the musca was less
pleased than before the expression did not seem to be
that assent and congratulation it was rather horror
and alarm
st ago and all the saints and angels heaven protect
me exclaimed he what do i hear a full
confession guilt and artthou then the confederate 
the prince the powers darkness if we were not herein
the holy house inquisition i should die at this moment
with fear that the roof would fall and crush us together
i should expect hell to swallow me alive for being found in
thy unhallowed society he trembled with every expression
 the sincerest terror and aversion
 thy money perish with thee thou second elias
like him full all subtlety and mischief child the
devil enemy all righteousness blasted be thy offers 
have i for this devoted myself to the service god assiduously
sought out the basest and vilest offices that
service and loaded myself with ignominy here that i might
obtain a crown glory hereafter and am i now to be assaulted
with the worst satan's temptations even so
lord if such be thy will oh poor miserable deluded
victim the archdeceiver mankind what has the devil
done for thee he has persuaded thee that thou art rich 
and thou wan test every joy and every necessary life
he has promised to be thy friend and he brings thee to
the faggot and flames in this world as an earnest thy
eternal damnation hereafter
my visiter had no sooner thus poured out the tumult and
agitation his soul than he left me abruptly and i saw
him no more
such was the event my attempt to bribe the officers 
travels st leon
the inquisition in my first experiment i could not even obtain
a hearing in what followed my proposals were rejected
with all the transports religious abhorrence what i
offered indeed however dazzling in the statement had not
in fact the nature a temptation he to whom i addressed
it gave no credit to my assertions he thought that i was
the mere drivelling dupe him he called the archdeceiver
 mankind or that my money when possessed would soon
change its figure and from seeming pieces solid coin be
converted into pieces horn or shells even if he had
not apprehended such a metamorphosis he would yet have
regarded every doubloon he received as the price his
continual adversity here and damnation hereafter i gained
nothing favourable for my situation by the trial i had made
but i added a new chapter to my knowledge human
nature i found that to be a knave it was not necessary
to be an infidel i corrected the too hasty conclusion which
i had adopted with the rest my contemporaries that he
whose conduct was infamous must inevitably be destitute
 religious impressions and belief and i became satisfied
that a man while he practised every vice that can disgrace
human nature might imagine he was doing god service
enough the interior the prison the inquisition
i remained a tenant this wretched mansion twelve years
though the wretch who had been placed upon me as a spy
was from my proposal to him satisfied my guilt his
superiors were not so they found nothing in what he
reported definitive as to the nature my unlawful practices
and they could extort from me no further confession
they therefore adhered to their favourite maxim to avoid
the precipitate mistakes other tribunals and to allow
their prisoner ful time to develop his guilt or as they pretended
to establish his innocence perhaps too the temper
 the prince who now filled the spanish throne contributed
to my safety they could not content themselves
with a less punishment for so obstinate and incorrigible a
heretic than that the flames but during the reign 
the emperor charles this species punishment for heresy
was rarely inflicted and only one or two contumacious at
intervals were delivered over to the executioner at a time
travels op st leon 
the institution whose victim i had become looked for a
richer and more abundant harvest from the wellknown
piety and zeal his successor
i pass over the rest the years my tedious imprisonment
they had in them a sad and deathlike uniformity
what surprising or agreeable adventures can be
expected from a man closed up within the four walls a
dungeon yet it is not altogether the uniformity this
period that determines me not to dwell upon and expand it
twelve years cannot pass in the life man without many
memorable incidents and occurrences he that should be
buried alive in the deepest cavern the earth if he were
not an idiot or incapable the task narration and could
subsist twelve years in that situation could tell things
that occurred to him that might fill the busy man the
world with thoughts and speculation almost to bursting i
might unfold the secrets my prisonhouse but that i
will not i refuse the consequences that story both to
my readers and myself i have no inclination to drive the
most delicate or susceptible my readers mad with horrors
i could convince such if such there are who suppose my
faculties were altogether benumbed or dead that it was not
so i did indeed pass days perhaps weeks in a condition
 that sort but at other times my mind was roused and
became busy restless impatient and inventive there was
no mode escape that i did not ruminate upon or attempt 
not to mention that though my body was restrained my
mind occasionally soared to the furthest regions the empyrean
or plunged into the deepest the recesses in which
nature conceals her operations all systems philosophising
became familiar to me i revolved every different
fable that has been constructed respecting the invisible
powers that superintend the events the boundless universe
and i fearlessly traced out and developed the boldest conjectures
and assertions demonism or atheism as the
humour the moment led me i derived misery or consolation

chapter xxxii
philip the second king spain succeeded to the throne
 that monarchy about the close the year but
his affairs in england and the netherlands long withheld
him from visiting his beloved country and he did not reach
its shores after a seven years absence till the twentyninth
 august it may be thought that a public event
 this sort could be little interesting to me a forgotten
prisoner immured in the dungeons the inquisition
the fact was otherwise the king was desirous distinguishing
his arrival on his native soil by some splendid
exhibition or memorable event that should at once express
his piety to god and conduce to the felicity his people 
and he could think nothing that so signally united
these characters as an auto de fe the lutheran heresy
which in the course forty years had spread its poison so
widely in the different countries europe had not failed
to scatter a few its noxious seeds even in this the
purest and most catholic all its divisions but philip
had early proclaimed his hostility against this innovation 
and prostrating himself before the image his saviour
had earnestly besought the divine majesty that he might
never suffer himself to be or to be called the lord those
in any corner the globe who should deny him the
lord previously to his arrival in spain directions had
been given and arrangements made respecting the pious
and solemn exhibition he demanded formerly those who
by the fathers the inquisition had been delivered over to
the secular arm had been executed in the different places
where their crimes had been committed or their trials been
held but now it was proposed that all those throughout
the kingdom who were found properly qualified to satisfy
by their deaths the sublime taste the royal saint should
be divided into two troops and sent the one to seville
long the capital an illustrious monarchy and the other
to valladolid which had the honour to be the birthplace
 the present sovereign the troop destined to feed the
travels st leon 
flames at seville was composed fifty persons many 
them distinguished for their rank their talents or their
virtues the troop to he escorted to valladolid which
i was a member amounted only to thirty but to compensate
this deficiency philip himself had signified his gracious
intention to be present together with the heir apparent and
his whole court at that exhibition the spanish nation
rejoicing in the approach a monarch who was born
among them whose manners and temper happily accorded
with theirs and whom they believed about to fix his perpetual
residence in their land expected him with all the
longings the most ardent attachment we the unhappy
victims pious and inquisitorial tyranny also expected him
our hearts did not pant with a less beating quickness 
though ourjanxiety arose from emotions a different nature
valladolid is distant from the metropolis eightyfour
miles we had already been some weeks prepared for this
journey and piously directed to hold ourselves in readiness
to take our part in the solemn national sacrifice we
waited however to receive a previous notice the day on
which the monarch would enter the place his birth
since so great was his royal zeal for the cause religion
and civil society that he would not consent to be absent
from any part the spectacle and accordingly it was not
allowed us to enter the scene our final destination till
the king spain and the indies should be already on the
spot and prepared to receive us the auto da fe performed
at seville had the precedence ours it took place
on the twentyfourth september and we were indulged
with an accurate account it and were present at a public
reading the record the act in the chapel our prison
previously to our removal from the metropolis
i will not enter into a minute detail the scene this
reading though the recollection will never be effaced from
my memory the persons present who were destined to
suffer capital punishment eight were women four 
them were taken from a single family being a grandmother
a mother and two daughters the noble house alcala
they had all been beautiful person and a graceful
figure the youngest the daughters was in the nineteenth
travels st leon
year her age their crime together with that the
majority their fellowsufferers was obstinate and impenitent
lutheranism the seats the women were separated
from the rest and fronted with a close lattice the
men were twentytwo in number and their appearance was
truly impressive their persons were neglected and their
figures emaciated j their eyes were sunk and ghastly and
their complexions a sallow and deathlike white most
 them were crippled by their long confinement and the
severities they had endured and were supported to their
seats upon an elevated scaffolding with benches raised one
above another by two apparatus one on each side the
condemned heretic god mercy and benevolence is it
possible that this scene should be regarded as thy triumph
and the execution destined to follow as a sacrifice acceptable
in thy sight if these papers mine are ever produced
to light may it not happen that they shall first be
read by a distant posterity who will refuse to believe that
their fathers were ever mad enough to subject each other to
so horrible a treatment merely because they were unable
to adopt each other's opinions oh no human affairs
like the waves the ocean are merely in a state ebb
and flow there is nothing new under the sun two
centuries perhaps after philip the second shall be gathered
to his ancestors he died in men shall learn over
again to persecute each other for conscience sake other
anabaptists or levellers shall furnish pretexts for new persecutions
 other inquisitors shall arise in the most enlightened
tracts europe and professors from their chair
sheltering their intolerance under the great names aristotle
and cicero shall instruct their scholars that a heterodox
doctrine is the worst crimes and that the philanthropy
and purity heart in which it is maintained only
render its defenders the more worthy to be extirpated
what were the ideas and reflections my fellows seated
on the benches above below and on either side me i
am unable to affirm my own could not fail to be pungent
and distressing i understood continually more and more
 the mysterious and unuttered history the stranger
who died in the summerhouse the lake constance 
travels st leon 
i found that i was only acting over again what he had
experienced before me his legacies had served to involve
me in the bitterest and most unheard miseries but were
wholly destitute ability to rescue from the evils themselves
created unbounded wealth i found to have no
power to bribe the dastard slaves religious bigotry and
the elixir immortality though it could cure disease and
put to flight the approaches age was impotent to repel
the fervour devouring flames i might have been happy
i was happy when the stranger found me i might
have lived to a virtuous and venerable old age and have
died in the arms my posterity the stranger had given
me wealth and i was now poorer than the peasant who
wanders amidst polar snows the stranger had given me
immortality and in a few days i was to expire in excruciating
tortures lie found me tranquil contented in the
midst simple yet inestimable pleasures he breathed into
me the restless sentiment ambition and it was that sentiment
which at length had placed me on high in the chapel
 the prison the catholic inquisition
our progress to valladolid was slow and solemn and
occupied a space no less than four days on the evening
 the fourth day we approached that city the king
and his court came out to meet us he saluted the inquisitor
general with all the demonstrations the deepest
submission and humility and then having yielded him
the place honour turned round his horse and accompanied
us to valladolid the cavalcade that attended the
king broke into two files and received us in the midst 
them the whole city seemed to empty itself on this memorable
occasion and the multitudes that crowded along
the road and were scattered in the neighbouring fields
were innumerable the day was now closed and the procession
went forward amidst the light a thousand torches
we the condemned the inquisition had been conducted
from the metropolis upon tumbrils but as we arrived at
the gates valladolid we were commanded for the greater
humiliation to alight and proceed on foot to the place 
our confinement as many as could not walk without assistance
being supported by the attendants we were
z 
 travels st leon
neither chained nor bound the practice the inquisition
being to deliver the condemned upon such occasions into
the hands two sureties each who placed their charge in
the middle between them and men the most respectable
characters were accustomed from religious motives to sue
for this melancholy office
dejected and despairing i entered the streets the city
no object present to the eyes my mind but that my
approaching execution the crowd was vast the confusion
inexpressible as we passed by the a narrow
lane the horse one the guards who rode exactly in a
line with me plunged and reared in a violent manner and
at length threw his rider upon the pavement others 
the horseguards attempted to catch the bridle the enraged
animal they rushed against each other several
 the crowd were thrown down and trampled under the
horses feet the shrieks these and the loud cries and
exclamations the bystanders mingled in confused and
discordant chorus no sound no object could be distinguished
from the excess the tumult a sudden thought
darted into my mind where all an instant before had been
relaxation and despair two or three the horses pushed
ffward in a particular direction a moment after they
resiled with equal violence and left a wide but transitory
gap my project was no sooner conceived than executed
weak as i had just now felt myself a supernatural tide 
strength seemed to come over me i sprung away with all
imaginable impetuosity and rushed down the lane i have
just mentioned every one amidst the confusion was attentive
to his personal safety and several minutes elapsed
before i was missed
chapter xxxiii
in the lane every thing was silent and the darkness was
extreme man woman and child were gone out to view
the procession for some time i could scarcely distinguish
a single object the doors and windows were all closed i
now chanced to come to an open door within i saw no
travels st leon 
one but an old man who was busy over some metallic work
at a chafingdish fire i had no room for choice i
expected every moment to hear the myrmidons the inquisition
at my heels i rushed in i impetuously closed
the door and bolted it j i then seized the old man by the
collar his shirt with a determined grasp and swore vehemently
that i would annihilate him that instant if he
did not consent to afford me assistance though for sometime
i had perhaps been feebler than he the terror that
now drove me on rendered me comparatively a giant he
intreated me to permit him to breathe and promised to do
whatever i should desire i looked round the apartment
and saw a rapier hanging against the wall which i instantly
proceeded to make myself master while i was
doing this my involuntary host who was extremely terrified
at my procedure nimbly attempted to slip by me and
rush into the street with difficulty i caught hold his
arm and pulling him back put the point my rapier to
his breast solemnly assuring him that no consideration on
earth should save him from my fury if he attempted to
escape a second time he immediately dropped on his
knees and with the most piteous accents intreated me to
spare his life i told him that i was no robber that id
not intend him the slightest harm and that if he would
implicitly yield to my direction he might assure himself
he never should have reason to repent his compliance by
this declaration the terrors the old man were somewhat
appeased i took the opportunity this calm to go to the
street door which i instantly locked and put the key in
my bosom
nothing but the most fortunate concurrence circumstances
could have thus forwarded my escape the rearing
 the horse the lifeguardsman was purely accidental
the concourse and press the crowd from all sides could
alone have rendered this circumstance any magnitude
the gap which was made by the pushing forwards and resiling
 the horses continued barely long enough for me to
spring through and closed again in an instant it is astonishing
that the thought escape should have thus suddenly
darted into my mind which but a moment before
z 
 travels st leon
was in a state dejection equally incompatible with activity
and with hope that in the lane down which i rushed
i should have met no human creature and that the first
open door i saw should lead to the residence a decrepid
old man who appeared to be its single inhabitant were
occurrences equally extraordinary yet seem to have been
both indispensable to my safety one point more concurred
with this fortunate train and assisted to still the
palpitations my beating heart i perceived by certain
indications in the countenance my host that he was by
parentage a jew i presently concluded that he was what
in spain they denominate a new christian for that otherwise
he would not have been allowed to reside at large in a
spanish city but upon that supposition i did not believe
that christianity was very deeply mingled up in him with
the vital principle the converts the inquisition are not
conspicuous for their sincerity now then for the first
time i thought in the course twelve years had opportunity
to communicate with a man whose soul was not
enslaved to the bloodthirsty superstition this devoted
country all i had seen during the period my confinement
were hyenas tigers and crocodiles they were not men
i had no sooner soothed my host into a temper to listen
to my story than i told him with all imaginable frankness
whence i came and to what i had been destined the
mention sorcery however and preternatural practices i
suppressed for i suspected that persons all religions
entertained an equal horror against these i suffered him
to imagine that the allegation against me had been the crime
 heresy all sects the christian superstition might be supposed
equally obnoxious or acceptable to a jew i emphatically
appealed to the persecutions which had been so long
directed against the religion his ancestors and observed
how disgraceful it would be in him to assist the operation
 a principle the effects which his fathers had so deeply
deplored and so perfectly abhorred i assured him that i
would bring him into no danger and that all i asked was
the protection a few hours i would leave him in the
course the following day and he should hear me no
more i reminded him that the danger he had to fear
was in betraying not in protecting me the inquisition
travels st leox 
looked upon every new christian with an eye the severest
jealousy and the mere fact if known that i had taken
refuge in his house would infallibly subject him to the
purgation a temporary imprisonment in their dungeons
it would be in vain for him to affirm that he had no choice
in what had occurred he was without a witness to confirm
his relation and the assertions a man born jewish
parents never obtained credit in the court the inquisition
i added with solemn asseverations that the moment i set
foot beyond the territory spain i would remit to him
the sum six hundred pistoles as an acknowledgment for
his kindness
during the whole my discourse i watched his countenance
with the utmost minuteness it gradually relaxed
from the terror which had at first appeared in it to expressions
 compassion and complacence i saw nothing
that ought to alarm me when it was his turn to speak
he earnestly assured me that he took a warm interest in
my story and would cheerfully perform every thing i required
he was happy that my favourable stars had led
me to his habitation and would rejoice to the latest hour
 his existence if they rendered him instrumental in preserving
the life a human being from so deplorable a
catastrophe while i talked to him i easily perceived that
the arguments i used which produced the most sensible
effect upon his features were those the dangers arising
to him from betraying me and the reward six hundred
pistoles which i promised him in the event my success
his motives however were blended together in his mind and
he had no sooner formed a determination grounded perhaps
upon the meanest considerations than he became eloquent
in a panegyric his own benevolence by which he was
not i believe more anxious to impose upon me than to
put the change upon himself i considered all that he said
his gestures and the very tones his voice with eager
anxiety the terror the inquisition penetrated to the
marrow in my bones and the fate awarded against me by
that court became inexpressibly more horrible to my thoughts
now that i saw the probability escaping it every thing
that i observed in the jew was apparently fair plausible
z 
hi travels st leon
and encouraging but nothing had power to quell the agitations
 my apprehensive soul
we were still engaged in discussing the topics have
mentioned when i was suddenly alarmed by the noise 
some one stirring in the inner apartment i had looked
into this room and had perceived nothing but the bed upon
which the old man nightly reposed himself i sprung up
however at the sound and perceiving that the door had a
bolt on the outside i eagerly fastened it i then turned
to mordecai such previously to his conversion had been
the name my host wretch said i did not you
assure me that there was no one but yourself in the house 
tf oh cried mordecai it is my child it is my child 
she went into the inner apartment and has fallen asleep on
the bed beware i answered die slightest falsehood
more shall instantly be expiated in your blood tf i
call abraham to witness rejoined the once more terrified
jew it is my child only my child tell me
cried i with severity accent how old is this child 
only five years said mordecai my dear leah died
when her babe was no more than a year old and though
we had several children this single one has survived her
speak to your child let me hear her voice he spoke
to her and she answered father want to come out
i was satisfied it was the voice a little girl turned to
the jew take care said i how you deceive me
now is there no other person in that room he imprecated
a curse on himself if there were i opened the
door with caution and the little girl came forward as
soon as i saw her i seized her with a rapid motion and
retired hack to a chair man said i you have trifled
with me too rashly you have not considered what am
escaped from and what i have to fear from this moment
this child shall be the pledge my safety i will not part
with her an instant as long as i remain in your house and
with this rapier in my hand i will pierce her to the heart
the moment i am led to imagine that i am no longer in
safety the jew trembled at my resolution the emotions
 a father worked in his features and glistened in his eye
at least let me kiss her said he be it so re
travels st leon 
plied i one embrace and then till the dawn the
coming day she remains with me i released my hold 
the child rushed to her father and he caught her in his
arms my dear leah cried mordecai now a sainted
spirit in the bosom our father abraham i call god to
witness between us that if all my caution and vigilance
can prevent it not a hair this child shall be injured 
stranger you little know by how strong a motive you have
now engaged me to your cause we poor jews hunted
on the face the earth the abhorrence and execration 
mankind have nothing but family affections to support us
under our multiplied disgraces and family affections are
entwined with our existence the fondest and bestloved
part ourselves the god abraham bless you my
child now sir speak what is it you require me 
i told the jew that i must have a suit clothes conformable
to the appearance a spanish cavalier and certain
medical ingredients that i named to him together with
his chafingdish coals to prepare them and that done
i would then impose on him no further trouble having
received his instructions he immediately set out to procure
what i demanded he took with him the key the
house and as soon as he was gone i retired with the
child into the inner apartment and fastened the door at
first i applied myself to tranquillise the child who had
been somewhat alarmed at what she had heard and seen 
this was no very difficult task she presently left me to
amuse herself with some playthings that lay scattered in a
corner the apartment my heart was now comparatively
at ease i saw the powerful hold i had on the fidelity 
the jew and firmly persuaded myself that i had no treachery
to fear on his part thus circumstanced the exertion
and activity with which i had lately been imbued left
me and i insensibly sunk into a sort slumber
the night was now far advanced and i was still reclined
insensible upon mordecai's bed when suddenly a jargon 
various sounds seemed from all sides to assail me my
mind was confused i heard something but seemed wholly
unconscious what i was and where i wanted to escape
from the disturbance but it continued and even increased
travels st leon
at length i was forced to command my attention and the
first thing i perceived was a beating at the door the
chamber the little girl was come to the bedside and endeavouring
to shake me sir sir she cried in an eager
accent my father wants to come in and i cannot slip the
bolt the door by slow degrees i began to comprehend
my situation and to recollect what had happened immediately
before i felt greatly alarmed i feared by the disturbance
that mordecai had not returned alone i essayed
to speak my organs refused their office i endeavoured
to move my limbs felt palsied and absolutely lifeless i
experienced a sinking and sickness heart that seemed to
be the immediate precursor death by listening occasionally
to the discourse which the father and the daughter
began to hold with each other i became satisfied that mordecai
was without a companion i endeavoured to make
the little girl understand that i was incapable rising from
the bed and having at length succeeded she communicated
the information to her father with considerable
trouble he loosened the door at its hinges and entered the
room i found myself in the extremest degree feeble and
languid the jew however assiduously administered to me
 cordials he had in his possession and by degrees i felt
myself considerably restored
now for the first time i was at leisure to attend to the
state my strength and my health my confinement in the
inquisition and the treatment i had experienced had
before rendered me feeble and almost helpless but these
appeared to be circumstances scarcely worthy attention
in the situation in which i was then placed the impulse
i felt in the midst the confusion in the grand street 
valladolid produced in me an energy and power exertion
which nothing but the actual experience the fact could
have persuaded me was possible this energy once begun
appeared to have the faculty prolonging itself and i did
not relapse into imbecility till the occasion seemed to be
exhausted which called for my exertion i examined myself
by a mirror with which mordecai furnished me i
found my hair as white as snow and my face ploughed with
a thousand furrows was now fiftyfour an age which
travels st leon 
with moderate exercise and a vigorous constitution often
appears like the prime human existence but whoever
had looked upon me in my present condition would not
have hesitated to affirm that i had reached the eightieth
year my age i examined with dispassionate remark the
state my intellect i was persuaded that it had subsided
into childishness my mind had been as much cribbed and
immured as my body i was the mere shadow a man
 no more power and worth than that which a magic lantern
produces upon a wall these are thy works superstition
 this the genuine and proper operation what is
called christianity let the reader judge what i had
passed through and known within those cursed walls by the
effects i have already refused i continue to refuse to tell
what i suffered and how those effects were produced
enough compassion enough complaint i will confine
myself as far as i am able to simple history
being recovered as far as the cordials and attention 
mordecai were capable recovering me i desired for the
remainder the night to be alone except that i was still
resolved to retain the little jewess as the pledge my
safety i was greatly obliged to my host for the punctuality
he had already displayed he had found considerable difficulty
in procuring the articles which i stood in need
owing partly to the lateness the hour and partly to the
presence the king and the general hurry and confusion
which had been produced by the solemn entry the inquisition
his efforts too to recover me from the languor and
lethargy into which i had sunk had a character generosity
 and perhaps i ought now to have trusted him without
a hostage but my heart was too earnestly bent upon
accomplishing its present object to afford harbour to the
punctilios delicacy the same earnestness caused me to
insist upon mordecai's repairing the injury which the
hinges the door had sustained and i was careful to
satisfy myself that every thing was restored to a state 
perfect security
i was now once again alone the little girl who had
been unusually disturbed and roused at an unseasonable
hour sunk into a profound sleep i heard the noise which
 travels st leon
mordecai made in undressing himself and composing his
limbs upon a mattrass which he had dragged for the present
occasion into the front room and spread before the
hearth i soon found by the hardness his breathing that
he also was asleep i unfolded the papers he had brought
me they consisted various medical ingredients i had
directed him to procure there were also two or three vials
containing syrups and essences i had near me a pair 
scales with which to weigh my ingredients a vessel 
water the chafingdish my host in which the fire was
nearly extinguished and a small taper with some charcoal
to delight the fire in case necessity while i was occupied
in surveying these articles and arranging my materials
a sort torpor came suddenly over me so as to allow meno
time for resistance i sunk upon the bed i remained
thus for about half an hour seemingly without the power 
collecting my thoughts at length i started felt alarmed
and applied my utmost force mind to rouse my exertions
while i drove or attempted to drive my animal spirits
from limb to limb and from part to part as if to enquire
into the general condition my frame i became convinced
that i was dying let not the reader be surprised at this 
twelve years imprisonment in a narrow and unwholesome
cell may well account for so sudden a catastrophe strange
and paradoxical as it may seem i believe it will be found in
the experiment that the calm and security which succeed to
great internal injuries are more dangerous than the pangs
and hardships that went before i was now thoroughly
alarmed i applied myself with all vigilance and expedition
to the compounding my materials the fire was gone
out the taper was glimmering in the socket to swallow
the julep when i had prepared it seemed to be the last
effort which my organs and muscles were capable it
was the elixir immortality exactly made up according to
the prescription the stranger
whether from the potency the medicine or the
effect imagination i felt revived the moment i had
swallowed it i placed myself deliberately in mordecai's
bed and drew over me the bedclothes i fell
asleep almost instantly i believe my first sleep was
travels st leon 
perfectly sound and insensible but in no long time i was
visited with the pleasantness dreams imaginable nothing
was distinct nothing was attended with the consciousness
 my former identity but every thing was gay cheerful
invigorating and delicious i wandered amidst verdant
lawns and flowerenamelled gardens i was saluted with
the singing a thousand birds and the murmuring a
thousand fountains kids fawns and lambs frisked and
gamboled before me at a distance through an opening
in the trees i discerned nymphs and their swains dancing
a variety antic measures i advanced towards them 
they approached towards me fifes oboes recorders and
instruments a hundred names commenced a cheerful
and melodious concert myself and the dancers now were
met they placed me in the midst them they began a
choral song the motion their limbs conformed to their
numbers i was the theme the general chaunt they
ascribed to me the beauty apollo the strength 
hercules the invention mercury and the youth 
bacchus
my sleep was not long in a few hours i awakened
with difficulty i recognised the objects about me and
recollected where i had been it seemed to me that my
heart had never beat so vigorously nor my spirits flowed
so gay i was all elasticity and life i could scarcely hold
myself quiet i felt impelled to bound and leap like a kid
upon the mountains i perceived that my little jewess
was still asleep she had been unusually fatigued the night
before i know not whether mordecai's hour rising
were come if it were he was careful not to disturb
his guest i put on the garments he had prepared 
i gazed upon the mirror he had left in my apartment
i can recollect no sensation in the course my life so
unexpected and surprising as what i felt at that moment
the evening before i had seen my hair white and
my face ploughed with furrows i looked fourscore what
i beheld now was totally different yet altogether familiar 
it was myself myself as i had appeared on the day my
marriage with marguerite de damville the eyes the
mouth the hair the complexion every circumstance point
by point the same i leaped a gulf thirtytwo years i
 travels st leon
waked from a dream troublesome and distressful beyond
all description but it vanished like the shades night
upon the burst a glorious morning in july and left nota
trace behind i knew not how to take away my eyes
ffdm the mirror before me
i soon began to consider that if it were astonishing tome
that through all the regions my countenance i
could discover no trace what i had been the night before
it would be still more astonishing to my host this sort
 sensation i had not the smallest ambition to produce one
 the advantages the metamorphosis i had sustained
consisted in its tendency in the eyes alt that saw me to
cut off every species connection between my present and
my former self it fortunately happened that the room in
which i slept being constructed upon the model many
others in spain had a stair at the further with a trapdoor
in the ceiling for the purpose enabling the inhabitant
to ascend on the roof in the cool the day the
roofs were flat and so constructed that there was little difficulty
in passing along them from house to house from one
 the street to the other i availed myself the
opportunity and took leave the residence my kind
host in a way perfectly unceremonious determined however
speedily to transmit to him the reward i had promised it
may easily be believed that mordecai was not less rejoiced
at the absence a guest whom the vigilance the inquisition
rendered an uncommonly dangerous one than i was
to quit his habitation i closed the trap after me and
clambered from roof to roof to a considerable distance at
length i encountered the occasion an open window and
fortunately descended unseen by any human being into
the street having with difficulty succeeded on this occasion
 public solemnity in engaging an apartment in one
 the hotels valladolid i sent into it as soon as i was
able a chest containing every necessary apparel and
particularly a suit clothes i then changed my dress
and threw the clothes which mordecai had provided into
the chest i had purchased as long as they continued
safely locked up and the key in my possession no faculty
possessed by any human creature could detect my identity
and expose me afresh to my former jailors the only
travels st leon 
peril under which i had before laboured was from mordecai
who if he had seen me in the garments he had procured
might have recognised them and though a peril
from this source came barely within the limits possibility
it was easily avoided and i therefore chose to avoid it
i passed the whole this day in a species enjoyment
which as it has no parallel in the ordinary transactions 
mankind so are there no terms in the received languages 
the world that are adequate to the description it it has
often been a subject melancholy and complaint among
mortals that while the whole vegetable system contains in
it a principle perpetual renewal man alone the ornament
and lord the universe man knows no return to
youth when the sun declines in the west the flowers
droop and fold up their frail and delicate leaves but soon
the eyelids the morn are again opened and again they
rejoice in his invigorating beams upon the approach 
winter the beech the ash and the monarchoak scatter
their withered foliage over the plains but spring reappears
and nakedness is no longer their reproach and they clothe
themselves anew in their leafy honours with what a
melancholy sensation does the old man survey his decaying
limbs to me he cries there is no second morning and
no returning spring my head pressed down with years
shall never again erect itself in conscious manhood these
hoary locks shah no more be adorned with the auburn 
glossy youth my weatherbeaten trunk shall at no time
clothe itself with a smoother rind a recruited marrow
shall never fill these bones nor a more vigorous sap circulate
through my unstrung limbs i recollect what i was
in the prime manhood with vain regrets the memory
answers no other than to torment and upbraid me
the useless wish the old man the object his hopeless
sigh was mine common and everyday blessings have
little value in the eye their possessor the young man
squanders the endowments youth and knows not to prize
them if the young man had once been old if the old man
could again be young then and then only they would
justly estimate their wealth the springy limb the bounding
frame the vigour that sets fatigue at defiance and
 travels st leon
revels in pleasures exhausted would then by the near
and conscious comparison feebleness and lassitude the
drooping limb the aching head and the frame decayed in
all its senses be well understood such was my situation
yesterday i was fourscore today i was twenty yesterday
i was a prisoner crippled in every articulation today
i was a citizen the world capable all its delights
tomorrow i was destined to have been dragged to the
stake with ignominy and to suffer intolerable anguish amidst
the shouts and huzzahs an unfeeling populace tomorrow
i was at liberty to employ as i pleased to choose the theatre
upon which it should be spent and the gratifications that
should be crowded into it what was most material my
mind was grown young with my body weary eternal
struggle i had lately resigned the contest and sunk under
the illfortune that relentlessly pursued me now i felt
within me a superfluity vigour i panted for something
to contend with and something to conquer my senses unfolded
themselves to all the curiosity remark my thoughts
seemed capable industry unwearied and investigation the
most constant and invincible ambition revived in my
bosom j i longed for new engagements and new relations 
i desired to perform something that i might myself regard
with complacence and that i might see the world start at
and applaud
i determined for reasons that i shall presently have occasion
to unfold that my first visit should be to my daughters
at my paternal estate st leon i proposed to spend
two or three days in preparations for this journey by
mere accident by a most censurable heedlessness i became
in some degree a spectator the auto da fe in which i
was destined to have been a victim unawares i had become
entangled in the crowd and could with difficulty
escape or even prevent my being carried nearer the centre
 the scene i saw the galleries and accommodations that
had been erected for the spectators i saw the windows and
roofs the houses crowded with beholders the shrieks
 the sufferers i could not hear they were drowned in the
infernal exultations the multitude but what was worst
 all i discerned some the condemned fixed as they
travels op st leon 
were upon small boards near the top stakes about four
yards high and therefore greatly above the heads the
assembly while the flames abundantly fed with faggots and
dry fuel climbed aloft and seemed eager to embrace their
victims as i have already said there were thirty these
deathdevoted frames and if my eye did not count them
all my fancy well supplied what sense was unable to discover
the impression i felt at that moment was horrible
beyond all conception i exerted my newfound strength
and pushed out the press with irresistible vigour if at
that instant i could have felt exultation even in the consciousness
 my own safety i should regard myself as the
most execrable monsters
chapter xxxiv
the first employment in which i purposed to engage my
newfound liberty and youth was a visit to my daughters
i now carried a disguise perpetually about with me that
would render my journey incapable proving injurious to
them my daughters were all that remained if indeed they
still remained my once idolised family for twelve
years i had continued totally ignorant their fortune and
even their existence part the plan i had adopted
for their advantage necessarily precluded me from all correspondence
or communication with them or any one near
them that might satisfy and tranquillise the anxieties a
father if it had been otherwise deprived as i had been
 the common benefits light and air and cast out from
the society mankind i could have obtained no intelligence
 their welfare in visiting i determined not to
make myself known to them yet notwithstanding the
greatness this disadvantage i felt that one the most
exquisite gratifications the earth could afford me was to
behold my children what a multitude adventures and
incidents might they not have encountered in the space 
twelve years imagination and affection dwell impatiently
on the interval nor can any thing quiet the conjectures 
a a
 travels st leon
him that loves short the most complete information
what a difference must twelve years have produced in the
very persons and figures creatures so young with what
mingled and exquisite emotions does the father contemplate
his daughter whom he left a child grown up into a woman
he sees her with astonishment and rapture displaying
maturer beauties discovering in her countenance new traces
 knowledge and sentiment and in her gesture and manners
a character finished matronly and sedate the very
circumstance that i should visit them unknown and converse
intimately with them without being discovered while
it cut me off from many pure and ingenuous pleasures
added in some respects a new relish to the indulgence for
it gave it a character singular and perhaps unprecedented
in the history mankind i anticipated with eager transport
the hour at which i should revisit the place my
birth wander amidst the shades where my careless infancy
had strayed recognise objects made sacred to my heart by
associations with my venerable mother and my adorable
wife now illumined with the presence my children
and steal a joy unsuspected and unknown to which the
very secrecy with which it was ravished would give a
tenfold gust
i embraced the nearest route by pampeluna and the
pyrenees to the banks the garonne one particular
pleasure that i reaped during this tour which the climate
and scenery might alone have rendered delightful consisted
in the youthful sensation with which every thing i saw
was enjoyed every one who can call to mind the amusements
 his childhood will be conscious that during that
period all his senses were in a tone adapted to convey the
most exquisite gratification this is not merely as is
vulgarly supposed the result the novelty and freshness
with which at that time every thing strikes us the extremities
 the nerves are in a state the most delicate
susceptibility upon which no touch however slight and
evanescent is lost and which makes us upon every occasion
favourable to enjoyment gasp and tremble with the
pleasure we imbibe we feel it thrilling through every
pulse and communicating its tone to every part our attravels
 st leon 
mention is engrossed by a single object or if we are
sensible to accompanying incidents it spreads over them
an animating sunshine and totally varies their appearance
and hue age on the contrary imperceptibly brings
along with it callosity and sluggishness sensation out
gratifications are coldly relished and our desires feebly
awakened such is the difference in our perception 
delicious fruits fragrant smells smooth and glossy
surfaces the vividness colour and the heavenly
sweetness sound if this be a just account i leave the
reader to imagine how i enjoyed my tour from valladolid
to the beautiful and romantic retirement st leon
there was however one sentiment with which i was at
this time impressed that i shall find it difficult to make
the reader understand in the extent in which i felt it and
that formed a powerful drawback upon the pleasures i have
just described a short time ago i had been old now i
was young i had quaffed the elixir immortality
the revolution this had produced in my sentiments was
not less memorable than that which it had effected in my
corporeal lineaments and my mental elasticity it is so
different a thing to conceive a proposition theoretically
and to experience it in practice the case is parallel to
that the expectation which an ordinary christian entertains
 eternal bliss it is an article in his creed he
repeats it every night when he lies down and every morning
when he rises he would be both offended and surprised
if you told him he was riot persuaded it and
yet how faint and indistinct a picture it produces in his
intellectual retina the affairs the world strike him
with all the force vision to them he cannot make himself
a stranger and a pilgrim he cannot transfer all his
affections to the mere creature his imagination engendered
in solitude and nurtured by enthusiasm heaven
how different must have been the feelings the celebrated
apostle who had been taken up into the third heaven and
had beheld the new jerusalem with all its jaspers its chrysalis
its emeralds and its sapphires 
my situation was similar to this i had long known as
far as reflection could assure me it that i possessed the
a a 
 travels st leon
elixir immortality but never till now had i felt the
julep tingling in my veins and known the effects it in
every joint and articulation my frame i before believed
i now felt that i was immortal the consequence this
intimate persuasion was not without its portion melancholy
i still bore the figure and lineaments a human
creature but i knew that i was not what i seemed there
was a greater distance between me and the best constructed
and most consummate the human species than there is
between him and an ant or a musket crushed by the first
accidental tread or consumed by the first spark wafted by
the wind i can no longer cheat my fancy i know that
i am alone the creature does not exist with whom i have
any common language or any genuine sympathies society
is a bitter and galling mockery to my heart it only shows
in more glaring colours my desolate condition the nearer
i attempt to draw any the nominal ties our nature
the more they start and shrink from my grasp from this
moment i could not shake off the terrible impression my
hmelines no not for an hour often does this impression
induce me to regard my immortality with loathing indescribable
 often do i wish to shelter myself from it in the
sweet oblivion the grave from this hour i had no
passions no interests no affections my heart has never
expanded with one natural emotion i have never delivered
myself up to the repose one genuine amusement if at
any time i have had a glimpse pleasure it has irritated
only to deceive it has increased the appetite while it displayed
in stronger colours my impotence to gratify it
what is worse every added year has still subtracted something
from the little poignancy and relish which the bowl
 human life continued to retain i have the power 
assuming a youthful and glossy appearance whenever i think
proper but this is only a bitter mockery the furrows
ploughed in my heart in so much my adventures as
remains for me to describe i feel that i shall be obliged to
employ the established terms human description i cannot
interrupt the history my sensations by a recital 
those pangs by which they have been every moment interrupted
the terms i must use may delude the reader into
travels st leon 
an imagination that i still participate enjoyment and 
hope be it so they may cheat the reader they cannot
cheat myself 
previously to my arrival in the vicinity the garonne
i equipped myself in the habit an armenian and assumed
the character a merchant travelling from country
to country for the sale his commodities
it was in the close a wintry day in the bleak and
cheerless month december that i first viewed from a
distance the turrets st leon i procured myself accommodations
for the night in the adjoining village being
now after so long an absence within reach the residence
 these lovely treasures i sought without any direct consciousness
 the sentiment to delay our interview when
i entered the little auberge sheltered under a small plantation
 olives i dreaded to hear the repetition my family
name i longed most fervently to be informed the welfare
 my daughters yet i could have died sooner than
utter a single question on the subject i found that that
ardent love which had urged me with rapid steps from valladolid
to st leon gradually as the distance grew little
changed from an impetuous vehemence to hear and to
see them to fearful awestruck motionless anxiety their
light and airy figures as i last saw them at montauban in
 danced before the eyes my imagination what
casualties what calamities might not have overtaken them
since i was afraid almost to breathe lest i should dissolve
the unreal scene that played around me how did i know
that i did not indulge this cheerful imagination for the last
time again and again in the course the evening i felt
as if i could have wasted ages in this auberge and the
neighbouring fields still believing that my daughters inhabited
yonder towers still hovering round their fancied
residence but never daring to utter their name lest it should
be found the prelude to some fatal intelligence how rich
and refined a repast in some cases is uncertainty it had the
power to impart to these precious pledges a share that immortality
 which i was the destined monopolist
why had i not the courage never to overpass the limit
at which i was now arrived and wherever i afterwards
aa 
 travels st leon
wandered on the various surface the globe still to be
able to repeat to myself the complacent whisper i have
visited my daughters in their separated abode and my visit
was productive none but agreeable sensations my
passions were too much afloat to suffer me really to rest in
this patient contemplative gratification before the morning's
dawn i walked forth and turned my eyes towards
the castle i loitered from bank to bank and from point
to point daylight slowly broke in upon me but all was
silent and quiet in my paternal chateau the family is
not yet stirring said i to myself i turned my steps to
the spot where the ashes my mother were mingled with
their parent earth the time that had intervened since
her decease the various fortunes and impressions i had
experienced had somewhat obliterated the vividness her
picture in my memory and deadened the tremblingness 
sensation with which i once thought her yet enough
was left to make it an interesting moment to me when i
kneeled at her tomb why oh why as it had been with
my great forefathers was it not a moment exultation tome
when i thus feelingly saluted the shade a parent 
he that exults in such an hour must feel that he has
illustrated his birth and honoured his progenitors i had
done nothing this i was an exile on the face the
earth had acquired no trophies and accumulated no fame
i had none to honour none even to know me i had no
family i had no friend these bitter recollections started
up in array before me and cut me to the heart the spirit
 my mother frowned upon her son and i returned along
the path by which i came disgraced and disconsolate
i am now said i in a fit temper to learn intelligence
 my daughters if they have been unhappy to
hear it will not make me more forlorn if they have been
fortunate that knowledge and that alone may revive my
courage i hastened towards the avenue i looked into
the thickets and winding paths as i passed they communicated
to me mingled pictures my own boyish days
and the amusements the present inhabitants
i told the nature my pretended traffic to the servants
 the house and proposed an exhibition my commodus
 st leon 
ties i was admitted as i desired to the apartment 
their mistresses i saw two young ladies who appeared
to be respectively about twentyeight and twentyfour years
 age and whom without much difficulty i recognised for
my daughters louisa and marguerite their situation and
their ages identified them and when afterwards i came to
peruse their features attentively i could easily discover
traits the amiable young woman and the playful child
they had been when last we parted i found them employed
upon a piece embroidery a comely and respectable
looking young woman a servant was sewing in another
part the room every thing about the ladies
bespoke the ease their circumstances and the propriety
 their sentiments both had on an elegant morninghabit
both had an air sedateness and sobriety that to
my apprehension told that they had not lived unchastened
by misfortune
they each slightly looked up as i was ushered into the
apartment they saluted me with a graceful and condescending
bend the head such as we are accustomed to
use to an inferior whom we are willing to put at his ease
what were my sensations a father disguised and unknown
in the presence his children i attempted to stand as
is usual for a tradesman when he waits on his customers
at their own house i attempted to speak my tongue
refused its office my legs tottered as if sustaining an unusual
weight louisa observed me and desired me to be
seated i had no power choice i accepted her civility
no sooner was i seated than in spite myself a flood 
tears gushed from my eyes she was astonished she
begged to know if i were indisposed she requested me to
make use every assistance the house could afford now
found my speech i apologised for my behaviour said i
had felt suddenly ill but that the tears i shed would prove
the most effectual relief to me my appearance it may be
proper to mention was not that a vulgar pedlar it was
tall graceful and ingenuous with a certain air refinement
and politeness my armenian dress though formed
 unjustly materials was such as to display my person to
considerable advantage both the young ladies showed
a a 
 travels st leon
themselves interested in the symptoms my distress
after a few minutes internal struggle i rose made an excuse
for the abruptness my departure and requested
permission to repeat my visit in the afternoon when i
should have something not unimportant to communicate to
them
i had seen two my daughters had been satisfied
that they still existed i had witnessed their exterior health
and beauty as i withdrew i laid my hand upon my heart
and congratulated myself thus far said i it is well 
i felt relieved from part the weight that lay there with
my right hand i struck upon my forehead but oh where
cried i ff is my other daughter the thought came over
me with the force a demonstration she is dead a
servant was attending me to the door i requested to speak
to the housekeeper i was introduced to mariana chabot
she was struck with my appearance as i believe my daughters
had been as if my features were those some person
with whom she was intimately acquainted she would
probably have mistaken me for my own son but that i
looked considerably too young i intreated her to pardon
my curiosity but i assured her i had a particular reason to
interest myself in the family monsieur st leon and i
therefore requested that she would have the goodness to
inform me their affairs as far as she could with propriety
communicate them to a person who was not so
happy as to be in the catalogue their acquaintance i
told her that i had just seen two her ladies but that i
had understood there had been three and i particularly desired
some information as to the young lady who had not
made her appearance in the parlour my presentiment was
true the impression that smote me when i left the parlour
was her funeral knell my beloved julia was dead 
she had been dead four years if it had not been for the
agitation my mind when i visited the tomb my
venerable parent i should have discovered her monument
near that her grandmother that would have been too
overwhelming a mode learning the painful intelligence 
i was glad at least to have escaped that 
in this and some subsequent conversations i held with
travels st leon sel
this respectable matron i learned a variety particulars
respecting my daughters madame chabot expressed herself
sorry that she had nothing pleasing to communicate
her young ladies had been pursued by a train misfortunes
though heaven knew they had merited every happiness
a few years after they had been settled at st leon
julia had been addressed by a lover in every sense worthy
 her he was rich noble a gallant spirit a cultivated
understanding and a truly kind and affectionate
heart their attachment had been long and tried habit
and experience each other's virtues had caused it to take
a deep root the father the young man had destined
him to marry the daughter a duke and peer the
kingdom but finding his affections unalterably fixed he
had at length yielded and sanctioned their mutual passion
with his consent every thing was now prepared for the
nuptials a day was fixed and the appointed time was fast
approaching just at this juncture the father changed his
mind and became more obstinate and inexorable than ever
a report had begun to be circulated that monsieur st leon
the father the young ladies was still alive madame
chabot expressed her fear that this report had originated in
some indiscretion bernardin who however had always
proved himself a most zealous and faithful servant and who
had since paid the debt nature be that as it might
the father the lover julia was found no longer accessible
to expostulation or entreaty he was an avaricious
disposition and he regarded the fortune the young lady
which would otherwise have been considerable as entirely
alienated and annihilated by this flaw in the title but
what was more material it by no means accorded with his
ideas nobility and honour that the fatherinlaw his
only son should be a fugitive and a wanderer with whose
residence no one was acquainted and whom no one
could tell whether he were living or dead the manner
in which the ladies had entered into the repossession 
their paternal estate when minutely investigated was
thought to have something in it an ambiguous and unpleasant
nature it was well known that monsieur st leon
had left the country in consequence his having ruined
travels st leon
himself by the vice gaming surely said some it is
a little mysterious how his children came after an interval
 nine years to be able to repurchase all he ever possessed
in short the more the old vicomte was reasoned with the
more furious he grew at length he made use the
power which the government france vests in the father
 a family and shut up his son in one the royal prisons
this was a fatal blow both to the chevalier and his
mistress disappointed in the object his warmest affections
maltreated and disgraced by the severity a father
his health sensibly declined nothing however could shake
the inflexibility the vicomte he would release his son
upon no other terms than a renunciation his love terms
which the sense dignity and honour in the young gentleman
equally with his passion forbade him to accept to
all representations the necessity granting liberty to
his son if he would not make himself answerable for his
death the vicomte sternly replied that he preferred his
dying to the idea his connecting himself with a family
 dishonour it was not till a few weeks before he expired
that the father had consented to his release from
prison and had removed him to one his castles in a
remote province but the malady the chevalier was
found incurable the vital principles the system were
fatally deranged the lover died and the consequences
 this unhappy affair had put a premature close to the
existence the unfortunate julia madame chabot added
that the circumstance this story having become a subject
 public animadversion it had had a most unfavourable
effect on the prospects the surviving sisters they bore
their situation with dignity but they could not but feel
the unhappy coincidence which cut them off from the
happiest condition human life an honourable and well
assorted settlement in marriage
while madame chabot related to me the tragical history
 julia i felt convulsed with passion and more than once
burst into an agony tears fatal legacy atrocious secrets
 medicine and chemistry every day opened to my astonished
and terrified sight a wider prospect their wasteful
effects a common degree penetration might have
travels st leon s
shown me that secrets this character cut off their possessor
from the dearest ties human existence and render
him a solitary cold selfcentered individual his heart no
longer able to pour itself into the bosom a mistress or a
friend his bosom no longer qualified to receive upon equal
terms the overflowing a kindred heart but no mere
exercise imagination nothing short the actual experience
through which i had passed could have adequately
represented the mischiefs a thousand various
names that issued from this pandora's box this extract 
a universal panacea i regarded myself as the murderer 
these two lovers than whom i concluded from my personal
observation the one and all that i heard the
other two purer and more affectionate beings more singularly
qualified to form each other's happiness had never
existed i felt as truly haunted with the ghosts those i
had murdered as nero or caligula might have been my
wife my son my faithful negro and now in addition to
these the tender julia and her unalterable admirer i possessed
the gift immortal life but i looked on myself asa
monster that did not deserve to exist
it is with difficulty that i shall be able to make the
reader understand how much more severe the impression
 this last catastrophe was made to me by the place and
time in which i received the intelligence we are creatures
 sensation our worst calamities derive as much their
pungency from the accessories by which they are accompanied
as they do from their intrinsic evil if i had heard
this story at any other period i am persuaded its effects
would not have been half so painful the idea my
daughters was faded in my sensorium and whatever related
to them though really felt and felt like a father
would have been felt with a less overpowering interest
but now i had journeyed from valladolid to the garonne
to behold them i had surveyed the castle they inhabited
i had viewed the garden which they arranged
with their hands i had entered the parlour which they
adorned with their presence all this controlled the operation
 absence and distance i felt at this moment
as if i had been accustomed to see them every day and to
 travels st leon
regard them as inseparable from my existence i experienced
as it were the united effect familiarity and
novelty i felt the melancholy fate julia with all the
keenness an inmate and all the surprise a long absent
traveller the very metamorphosis i had undergone gave
new poignancy to my distress madame chabot tortured
me deliberately and at leisure without the slightest consciousness
 what she was doing she believed she was
pouring a tale persons unknown into the ears a native
 the other hemisphere at the moment that she was calling
up in arms the strongest and most excruciating feelings 
a father for his child i on the other hand had the most
violent struggle with myself while i endeavoured to suppress
the appearances an emotion which to the person
who witnessed them must have been for ever unaccountable
as it was and in spite all my efforts madame chabot
betrayed no little amazement at the agitation with which i
listened to a story in which as she apprehended i could
have no personal interest
what i heard from madame chabot suggested to me a
conduct which i resolved to adopt under the present circumstances
in my next interview i told louisa that i
would now account to her for emotions which at the time
they occurred must have appeared somewhat extraordinary
i owned that i had been acquainted with her father i said
that i had first met with him in a journey in which i was
then engaged through the province mesopotamia that
i had received from him though a stranger a singular
obligation that a sincere friendship between us had been
the result this event that he died about two years since
that i had attended him in his last moments that he had
charged me with his dying recommendations and requests 
and that my present journey into france had principally
been instigated by a desire to visit his children i then
delivered into her hands various letters and papers which i
had counterfeited chiefly with the intention supplying my
daughters with legal evidence the decease their father
louisa listened to what i related with those marks affection
and sorrow which are inseparable from the habits
 a well constituted mind the emotion she discovered
travels st leon 
led me farther than i first intended i was urged by an
irresistible impulse to practise beyond what the occasion
demanded upon the feelings her virtuous mind i know
not whether this is to be considered as a vain refinement
and a criminal curiosity but i think every generous
spirit will excuse me when it is recollected that this covert
and imperfect proceeding was all that was left me to soothe
the impatient cravings a father's heart from time to
time i reminded her particulars that it was scarcely possible
any one but her father should know i conjured up
past scenes i made all the revolutions her youth pass
successively in review before her i touched all the pulses
 her soul sometimes she was fixed in mute astonishment
at the exactness my information and was ready todo
me homage as some aerial genius who condescended to
clothe himself in this earthly figure at other times astonishment
was swallowed up in feeling her soul dissolved in tenderness
and she appeared ready fl to faint into my arms it is
scarcely possible to depict the pleasurable sensations i drew
from these intercourse i know not whether they were
entirely innocent but this i know that in me they produced
a sentiment innocence and a sentiment paradise
i felt sometimes as if i could have wasted ages in this sort
 gratification
as the executor their father my daughters received
me with every mark respect but after having already
protracted my visit to them for the space many days i
felt that i should be guilty something alike hostile to
their decorum and reputation if i did not speedily bring it
to a termination i was a person unknown and almost
without a name nor could it be proper for a young woman
to continue to receive the visits a person her own age
and a different sex upon the intimate and confidential
footing upon which my visits were paid except in the case
 him whom she intends to make her husband to considerations
 this sort i was obliged to sacrifice the gratifications
in which i had lately been indulging my principal
concern at st leon from the time in which madame
chabot had communicated to me the real nature my
daughter's situation was to r pt nave those disadvantages in
 travels op st leon
which my destiny and my errors had involved them it
would therefore have been the extreme inconsistency in
me while i was healing one mischief to prepare for them
another it is not indeed probable that i should long have
been contented for myself with this anomalous and neutral
situation in which i more resembled a piece furniture
endowed with the faculty noting the sensations those
around me than the member any human society it
was high time as i thought even in this point view
that i should put an to the inglorious scene should appear
in some real character and engage in some real undertaking

influenced by these considerations i now quitted the residence
 my daughters i had satisfied the longing curiosity
 a father had seen their situation had witnessed
their beauty their accomplishments and their virtues if
i had been afflicted at hearing the premature fate my
eldest daughter if i had been agonised by the reflection
that i might justly regard myself as her murderer who was
so fitted to suffer this anguish as myself the outcast my
species what right had i to expect to be happy in my own
person or prosperous in any my relations the guilty
cause all this mischief it was but suitable that it should
be brought home to my own bosom that it should tear and
distract my own brain add to this i was not without a
hope that my journey would not be found useless to the
survivors by furnishing to them the proper documents to
certify the death their father i flattered myself that i
had cut them off more effectually than before from all connection
with my unpropitious destiny and had placed them
nearly upon a footing with the other noble and unmarried
heiresses their native country i have nothing further
to relate in regard to these two amiable and excellent sisters
from the time that i quitted st leon upon this occasion
to the time in which i am now writing the opportunity 
making further enquiries respecting them has not occurred
to me if ever it does occur i have only this one wish to
entertain which if granted will i am sure satisfy my
fondest hopes may i find they have been as happy as
they so well deserve to be 
travels st leon

the parting between me and my daughters was not an
affecting one on my part whose bosom was fraught
with a thousand tender feelings to which i could give no
language and which those whom they principally concerned
had not the slightest suspicion it could not be affecting
nor did louisa and her younger sister look with
an indifferent eye upon the bearer the last sentiments 
their father the witness his death the executor his
will there was something in the features my countenance
a peculiar sort conformation a family resemblance
to themselves which it is probable they did not advert to
but which i am persuaded wrought within them to the full
extent the mysterious sympathies our nature i pretended
to have been the familiar confident their father i
told them things at which they started and almost blushed
to think that any one beyond the circuit their dearest
relations should have been privy in the hour our separation
they shed many tears and embraced me with a
warmth that might have well become sisters to a brother
yet shall i confess my weakness a weakness in which i
do not apprehend myself to be singular it happens to
few men to witness the manner in which the story their
own deaths is received if it did i believe we all us
have enough vanity and personal feeling however sincere
a grief might show itself in the demeanour survivors to
find it falling short our appetites and demand this i
know i was myself a party to this unreasonableness my
daughters received the intelligence my death with a decorum
and sensibility which in the eyes every impartial
spectator would have reflected honour on their characters
a sensibility beyond what could have been imagined in
daughters who now had not seen their father for twelve
years yet it was an unpleasing reflection to me thus to
have occasion to gauge their love and to say this is the
exact measure their affection i remained in this part 
the world long enough to see my children consoled and
myself forgotten selfimportance man upon how slight
a basis do thy gigantic erections repose 
 travels op st leon
chapter xxxv
from st leon i proceeded to the kingdom hungary
to complete this journey i must pass through near twenty
degrees longitude but that was a trivial consideration 
what i most desired was to gain a new situation and enter
upon an untried scene i had determined in my next experiment
upon the endowments the stranger to make no
halfformed efforts and to suffer no mischiefs that drew
their source from my own irresolution i determined as
i have said to forestall all opposition by my firmness and
to silence all objectors by the display a more than princely
magnificence i thought it therefore eligible to remove to
a scene where no encounter with any one i had ever known
might abash me and no relation any adventure i had ever
met should follow me the change my figure it is true
would render an encounter this sort little moment to
my liberty or my reputation but i was a new man and
i was desirous to engross and to feel the benefits that attend
upon novelty
there was another motive however secretly working at
my heart a grander and more exalted cast that made
me prefer hungary to all the countries the earth hungary
had been now for upwards a century the great
frontier the christian world the theatre upon which
the followers mahomet contended against the followers 
jesus for destruction and for empire my mind had from
time to time brooded over this picture in the solitude and
forlornness my dungeon i ruminated on all the calamities
 hungary from the battle warn in to the
battle mohacz in in both which this generous
nation had unsuccessfully achieved prodigies valour and
even by their defeats had protracted the date their own
independence and cooperated for the defence the population
and arts europe against a barbarous and blooddelighting
foe my thoughts dwelt with rapturous admiration
upon the exploits the heroic huniades and his
greater son in the course my manycoloured experience
travels st leon 
i had seen something war and was not totally unacquainted
with its neverfailing consequences meditating as
i had done in the dungeons the inquisition if ever i recovered
my personal liberty and my freedom action a
journey into hungary my imagination had grown familiar
with captured towns and smoking villages with the gallant
soldier stretched lifeless on the plain and the defenceless
mother and her offspring brutally insulted and massacred 
with fields laid waste and a people lifting up their hands
for bread determined as i was to open at once all the
stores my wealth i thought i could not find a nobler
scene for its display i resolved to pour the entire stream
 my riches like a mighty river to fertilise these wasted
plains and revive their fainting inhabitants thus proceeding
should i not have a right to expect to find myself
guarded by the faithful love a people who would be indebted
to my beneficence for every breath they drew
this was the proper scene in which for the possessor the
philosopher's stone to take up his abode he who could
feel his ambition satisfied in a more straitened field would
by so doing prove himself unworthy the mighty blessing

nothing occurred to me in my journey importance
enough to obtain a place in this history when i arrived
i found the condition the inhabitants even more wretched
than the lawlessness my imagination had represented it
in the battle mohacz the last the line their native
sovereigns together with the flower his nobility had
fallen a victim to the merciless plague war what survived
 eminent persons in the state assembled soon after in
national diet and elected as they had been accustomed todo
one the most illustrious among themselves to preside
over the councils and to conduct the battles their country
but the princes the house austria ever on the
watch for the aggrandisement their family seized the
opportunity their disastrous situation to enslave the
hungarians to their sceptre charles the fifth caused his
brother ferdinand whose consort was only sister to the
deceased monarch to advance his claim to the vacant throne
and to enter the country with an imperial army the 
travels st leon
time and elected sovereign found himself in the weakened
condition his realm unable to resist the austrian arms
and was finally driven to the desperate expedient calling
in the turk to his assistance from this time for now
upwards thirty years the kingdom had been a prey to
two foreign invaders alternately taking and retaking her
most considerable towns and distributing with the strictest
impartiality the miseries war to her devoted inhabitants
solyman the magnificent the present ottoman emperor in
no long time threw off the mask and like his rival ferdinand
professed to fight only for the enlargement his
own dominions while the claims the liberties the constitution
and the prosperity hungary were alike trodden
under foot in the protracted and sanguinary struggle
at the period at which i entered this unfortunate realm
the turk was in possession buda grand temeswar and
many the most considerable cities and ferdinand who
had now succeeded charles in the imperial dignity had
been obliged to withdraw the seat the national government
from the first these towns the ancient metropolis
to the comparatively insignificant city presburg the
war between the two parties had more than once been interrupted
 not indeed by the more stable accommodations a
treaty peace but by a truce variously concluded for the
terms six or eight years short as was the period
assigned to the suspension arms it was never suffered to
reach its natural termination but after the interval one
or two summers hostilities did not fail to break out again
with aggravated symptoms resentment and animosity
the warfare that was now carried on had more in it passion
than vigour it was little moment to the interest 
either the princes under whose banners it was conducted 
but it was not on that account the less but rather the more
vexatious and distressing to the hungarian people it
obeyed no rule it operated in every direction no place
no province no town neither the church nor the palace
neither the cottage nor the castle could assure safety to
those who sought its protection a flying party which was
today in the west would almost the next day make its
appearance in the eastern extremity the kingdom arts
travels op st leon 
were neglected civilisation was destroyed the stern and
haughty baron free from restraint would sally from his
castle sometimes in pursuit plunder sometimes private
resentment and revenge the starving peasantry gladly
enlisted in the band a ferocious partisan for bread the
gangs robbers which the vigilant policy better times
had almost annihilated rose again in importance and
swelled into regiments and while they assumed at pleasure
the denomination adherents to ferdinand or to solyman
perpetrated every species excess with impunity
when a reflecting spectator surveys a country in a condition
like this he is tempted to wonder that the inhabitants still
retain the courage to bestow on their fields any sort cultivation
and that the licensed or the unlicensed robber still
finds something over which to extend the fangs his
rapacity
i had not long passed the gates vienna before i began
to observe the symptoms that which i had come
from the pyrenees and the garonne to visit the farther
 advanced the more melancholy was the scene i beheld
the country in some places entirely deserted villages laid
in ashes cities reduced to the dimensions and insignificance
 villages fields fertilised or made rank with the
manure human blood the roads broken up the erections
 human ingenuity almost obliterated mills thrown
down rivers choked up and rendered stagnant a few
solitary plots cultivation scattered amidst the mighty
waste the inhabitants i saw appeared terrified sickly
dejected and despairing there was scarcely one who earlier
or later had not lost a father or a brother whose wife had
not been made the victim brutal lust or who had not
seen his children butchered before his face persons 
the more opulent classes could not travel the country in
safety without being armed and associated in companies
and caravans i was myself obliged to obtain the protection
 parties soldiers who from time to time happened
to be marching in the route i pursued the savage neglect
into which every thing was declining produced in
repeated instances a contagious air and pestilential diseases 
while dearth and famine unrelentingly haunted the steps
bb 
 travels st leon
 those whom the sword and the pestilence had spared
such is war such are the evils nations willingly plunge
into or are compelled to endure to pamper the senseless
luxury or pride a ferdinand and a solyman 
i proceeded as i had originally determined to do to
buda the metropolis the kingdom it was in the hands
 the turk it was little importance to me whether
the monarch the soil were a mahometan or a christian 
my mind was engrossed by considerations a very different
magnitude i came to relieve and assist to the utmost
 my power the inhabitants the country in the extremity
 their distress
i had not proceeded thus far without bestowing a certain
strictness reflection on the subject i easily saw that
if i would confer a substantial benefit on this unfortunate
nation i had scarcely any other means for the purpose
than that reviving among them a spirit industry i
was aware that in the strictness the term money was
not wealth that it could be neither eaten nor drunk that
it would not itself either clothe the naked or shelter the
houseless and that it was unable but by a circuitous
operation to increase the quantity provisions or commodities
that the country afforded it was my business
therefore not to proceed idly in the distribution gold
but to meditate seriously my plan operations
i fixed myself in a spacious and beautiful mansion in
the capital this in the present distressed and depopulated
condition hungary it was not difficult to procure
the house i selected had for centuries been the principal
residence the illustrious family ragotski but the
present representative that family after having seen his
sons one after another killed in the battles his country
and his estates ruined by military depredation had found
himself compelled to fly in his old age and had taken refuge
with a distant branch the same house in the great
duchy lithuania it was not necessary for me to
proceed to any great extent in the first instance in the manufacture
 my wealth i had every facility for adding
to my store from time to time as circumstances should
demand
travels st leon 
i determined to open my operations with the article 
building there was sufficient need it one half 
the houses through most the districts lower or
western hungary in particular were ruined and untenantable
i did not begin with erecting palaces i felt that
the firstjfclaimants in the present emergency were the peasant
and the cultivator i was more desirous that the
rustic than the prince should be well lodged and accommodated
provided with the means rest after fatigue
and secured against the invasion ungenial seasons
my reasons for beginning with building were these it
was my purpose to stimulate and revive the industry the
nation i was desirous doing this with the least practicable
violence upon the inclinations and freedom the inhabitants
had i required those to whom i addressed
myself that they should fertilise the earth the seeds with
which it should be impregnated might be wanting i should
have a nice balance to adjust between what was necessary
for immediate subsistence and what might be applied as
the basis future a point better left to its spontaneous
level i might be impeded and controlled by a thousand
circumstances and at every step but the materials 
building are to be found in every country no seasons can
impair no malignity man can annihilate them whereever
there are quarries there is stone wherever there is
clay there are the means manufacturing bricks i was
anxious to leave the rest the great process human
accommodation to its course while i employed labourers
and paid them their wages there would be in the mildest
and most salutary mode a continual influx money into
the market the increase the precious metals would
give new alacrity to the operations traffic the buyers
would come forward with double confidence the venders
would be eager to meet the activity and spirit the demand
ardour and hope would revisit the human mind 
and the industry i created and the accommodations one
kind at least to which i gave birth would inoculate the
other departments the community with a similar industry
i came into hungary in the spring ' the
bb 
 travels st leon
season was favourable to seeding and cultivation i seemed
to enter on my undertaking with the happiest auspices
some time however must necessarily elapse between the
period impregnating the soil and that the future harvest
though i laid it down therefore as a law to myself
to commit the least practicable violence upon the genuine
action human society in pursuit the means subsistence
i thought proper in a certain degree to engage in
the importation corn from poland silesia and other
neighbouring countries this seemed an eligible measure
if it were only that i might show others the way and excite
them by my example i procured agents i extended
my concerns in various directions over the navigable rivers 
i formed magazines it would have been contrary to the
genius my undertaking either to make a gratuitous distribution
 what i purchased or to sell it at such low
prices as to drive other speculators whose spirit enterprise
might happily cooperate with mine out the market
however indifferent i might feel to the receipt 
pecuniary compensation it was necessary that in the concerns
 barter and trade i should assume the exterior 
a merchant
nor did i wholly confine my exertions within the occupations
 an architect and a corndealer these or
rather the former the two i regarded as my true and
genuine province but i did not so far enslave myself to
my own maxims as to negative in all instances the direct
demands want i was not anxious to convert a nation
or an army men into my personal adherents and retainers
 i was rather desirous to avoid this as a dangerous
source obloquy i did not therefore always decline by
pretended loans to assist other men to employ labourers as
well as myself to act upon their own designs and prosecute
their own fortune the cries the poor man the widow
and the orphan were sometimes too importunate and too
well justified by their unquestionable necessities to allow
me to withhold from them my alms in a few instances
i conveyed my supplies anonymously to persons whose
dignity birth or whose proud independence would have
been too grievously wounded if they had known their betravels
 st leon 
benefactor i was cautious and apprehensive as to the direct
dispensing money but not entirely bent against it i
regarded it as a precarious but in some cases a necessary
interference
the impulse which by these various measures i was
fortunate enough to generate seemed to have the effect sofar
at least as the sphere my activity extended to revive
the almost expiring life the country dejection and
hopeless indolence when i commenced my operations were
written in every face the miserable inhabitants crawled
along the roads or the street their hands idly relaxed by
their side and their slow and painful steps scarcely supporting
their lifeless trunk when my plan became known
and i had already in a few instances reduced my maxims
into practice it was as if the mellow and spiritstirring
blast a trumpet had wakened their sleeping souls their
eyes lightened with intelligence the tear anguish was
wiped from their faded cheeks j the smile hope slowly
expelled and faintly succeeded to the bitter expression 
despair busy and active thoughts gave new motion to
their limbs and quickness to their steps j the labourer was
seen hastening from place to place the sound the hammer
the saw and the various tools the workman was
to be heard from every side
the conduct i pursued necessarily fixed upon me a considerable
portion public attention i was a foreigner
destitute connections and having no previous acquaintance
with any individual in the country i was in appearance
a mere boy a young man in all the flower and
bloom adolescence and who must be supposed to have
just entered into possession his patrimony these things
tended to increase the public wonder and to render the
mystery my proceedings more perplexing and obscure
in the age genial warmth and melting softness i did
not appear accessible to those passions which haunt the
days and too often undermine the virtues youth youth
is the season benevolence j but benevolence is rarely as
seemed to be my case the only fruit that youth is found
to produce there was a maturity and a justness adaptation
in my plans not less foreign from what those who
bb 
travels op st leon
surrounded me would have expected me to display the
apparent disinterestedness and modesty my proceedings
were not lost upon the spectators the consequence all
this was that the sieur de chatillon such was the name i
at this time assumed was regarded as a phenomenon which
could not be too much admired or too loudly extolled
wherever i appeared the people followed me with their
gratitude and blessings ballads were written in my praise 
the very children were taught with their infant tongues to
lisp the virtues the saviour hungary my doors
were besieged my steps were watched i could move nowhere
without public observation i was importuned with
petitions without yet if any petitioner showed himself
presumptuous and intrusive the whole multitude 
bystanders was ready to repress his indiscretion and teach
him the respect that was due to their generous benefactor
who never refused any thing but what it would be improper
and injurious to grant
such was the treatment i experienced in buda and the
neighbouring districts whether i looked within or without
i was equally presented with incitements to selfapprobation
i sent forth labour accompanied with her best
and loveliest companions plenty and health congratulation
and contentment to scatter blessings through the land i
felt that i was prompted to this conduct by none the
motives vulgar ambition i desired neither lordships
nor estates neither elevation rank nor extension prerogative
sufficient to myself if i effected the happiness
 the people and they confessed me their benefactor my
every passion would then be gratified the utmost boundary
 my personal wishes proceeded no farther than this
that i might be honoured and loved what i desired i
obtained the youth i had procured to myself through the
medium the opus magnum was like what we are told
 the youth job when i went out through the
gate the city the young men saw me and hid themselves
and the aged arose and stood up the nobles refrained from
talking and the princes laid their hands upon their mouths
when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when
the eye saw me it gave witness to my actions
travels op st leon 
here it may be thought i had ascended to that sphere
which it was fit the possessor the philosopher's stone
should fill and reaped the rewards to which a man thus
endowed ought to be forward to entitle himself nor will
i affirm that i was insensible to the gratifications my
present situation though i sought to escape from the
applause that pursued me yet there is something in the
nature the human mind that makes it impossible for us
to hear it without complacence it was not however a
boisterous and obtrusive acclamation that satisfied me a
certain inwrought modesty nature made me listen to
noisy commendations with a sentiment shame they
seemed to be more than any thing i had done could deserve
 or they seemed to be in a tone from which the
delicacy a virtuous mind shrinks back displeased they
were so obstreperous as to take from me the power 
hearing the sweeter verdict my own conscience no
it was the unbidden tear that glistened in the eye my
beneficiaries the tongue that faltered beneath the essays
 gratitude the overwhelmed heart that had no power to
express itself the hand the parent that was stretched
out to his children and dumbly said these these shall
thank you it was these things that i felt within as the
balsam my life and the ambrosia heaven
chapter xxxvi
yet thus surrounded and regaled with this animated
praise i was not content i wanted a friend i was alone
amidst the innumerable multitudes those i had blessed
i knew no cordiality i could repose no confidence i
could find no equal i was like a god who dispenses his
bounties profusely through twenty climates but who at the
same time sits separate elevated and alone in the highest
heaven the reader may if he pleases despise me for the
confession but i felt that i was not formed for the happiness
 a god
i was not however long sufficiently at leisure thus to
travels st leon
refine upon the deficiencies my situation i had engaged
in a task extreme delicacy in which the smallest failure
would draw along with it the most serious consequences
mine was not an undertaking that had for its object to
supply those around me with luxuries or to augment the
stock their cheerful relaxations and amusements the
very existence my beneficiaries depended on its success
i had put myself in a considerable degree with whatever
diffidence and caution in the room the course nature
and had taken the administration the common benefits
 human society into my hands the populace are ever
ready to construe this delegation in the strictest sense
unqualified to trace the wheels and combinations the
great machine if prosperity is their lot they willingly ascribe
it to their protectors and governors and if they
are unfortunate it is against them that the storm their
resentment is directed the moment they are thus irritated
their impatience is too great to admit correctives
and remedies in the fury their disappointment they
disturb every thing and render that irreparable and fatal
which was at first only doubtful and unpromising
my proceedings as i have already said bore in the commencement
the most benignant face and seemed a revival
 this despairing and unfortunate nation little less than
miraculous the regular labours in which the inhabitants
became engaged restored a healthful tone to their minds 
the payments they duly received seemed to discharge them
from all anxious solicitude and as by my own efforts and
the enterprises others the market was supplied with provisions
they had no difficulty in exchanging these payments
for the necessaries life the supply the market at
first was easy the universal dejection that preceded though
it had not prevented all exertions for that purpose had
rendered those exertions too feeble for extensive success
the strenuous efforts that were now made were productive
 a copious supply but they rendered each importation
more difficult than the importation before the demand
continued the same the relief was every day more diminutive
and precarious the harvest was however advancing
with the happiest auspices and though some time must
travels st leon 
yet be consumed in expectation it was probable frugality
and fortitude might enable the inhabitants to hold out till
the season plenty should arrive
but fortitude is not the virtue a populace the
higher had been their hopes and the more unexpected their
deliverance with so much the more blank and melancholy
a countenance they beheld this unexpected delay and retrogression
not understanding the powers by which i acted
they blindly ascribed to me the faculty doing whatever i
pleased as long as every thing went on prosperously
they were grateful the moment a reverse occurred they
were inclined to murmur they made no allowance for the
limited capacities a human creature they imputed
whatever was unpleasing to indifference or ill will the
price commodities after having for a while become
moderate now rapidly rose again this was partly the consequence
 the increased quantity the precious metals
by means which any assignable sum bore a less proportion
to the provisions the market than it had done
before bread was at a very high price and it occasionally
happened to buyers who did not come early enough
that there was no bread to be purchased the doors the
houses where it was sold were besieged the industrious
poor appeared before them with the first faint dawn the
morning's light here they consumed hours painful
expectation in grievous addition to the hours their customary
fatigue the whole was a scene anguish and
calamity the passions those who composed it mingled
with the distress and rendered it too heavy to be borne
anticipating famine they felt the mischiefs it before
it arrived never was the demand so urgent it seemed as
if the capacity men's appetites was enlarged and the
cravings hunger became more insatiable in proportion to
the smallness the supply to people thus circumstanced
it would have been vain to recommend frugality and moderation
they devoured the food with their eyes while
it was yet beyond the reach their hands and the lesson
you read them would have sounded in their ears as if you
had bid them die today to escape the danger dying tomorrow

travels st leon
the crowds which the necessity purchasing bread
brought together at certain hours when assembled naturally
entered into the discussion their present discontents
they were not satisfied with the discourse and jostling 
the morning the habits produced by these noisy assemblies
had a secret charm with them and drew them together at
seasons less urgent demand they parole the streets 
they were loud in the expressions their dissatisfaction
with the inconsequence incident to the lower orders 
mankind they threatened to destroy the mills the markets
the places sale the means and materials by which their
wants were to be supplied
in the midst these scenes tumult and confusion it
is not to be imagined that i escaped uncensured far
otherwise in proportion to the gratitude and adoration
with which they had lately regarded me were their detestation
and abhorrence now my interference was spoken
 with contempt and execration for what purpose had
i a foreigner come into their country and intruded myself
into their affairs why had i impiously taken them out
 the hands their heavenly father whose care was so
constant and whose relief so certain it was on my part a
despicable vanity and presumption which the justice 
providence could not fail to avenge and they must now
suffer the punishment my blasphemy but they did not
stop here there was no horrible calumny which they did
not invent or give credit to against me they imputed tome
the basest personal motives for what i had done under
the hypocritical pretence they cried being their benefactor
and saviour i was using them only for my private ends
i had become a purchaser and vender corn for the single
purpose increasing my fortune the present scarcity
they were well assured was artificial and my own contriving
i had magazines in different stations on the borders
which when the price was risen to the standard my
avarice and when half the people had fallen victims to my
inhumanity i purposed to dispose to an immense profit
such were the aspersions to which my character became
generally exposed by the populace who now experienced
the unsatisfied cravings hunger and in whom my protravels
 st leon 
meetings had excited hope only to he followed hy a more
cruel disappointment they were greedily credited many
who knew their falsehood were yet zealous to propagate
them short as had been my residence in hungary i had
made many enemies it is to he feared that no man can
be assiduous and indefatigable in the service others
without incurring that consequence i employed a great
number workmen every one whom for whatever reason
i refused to employ every one who being unqualified for
the service i required looked with an envious eye on the
better fortune his neighbour was well disposed to be my
enemy persons no contemptible account in the community
had been excited by expectations profit to
engage in the importation corn these persons viewed
my efforts in the same department with a suspicious eye
and regarded a man who however cautious in his proceedings
was not regulated by the same motive as a most pernicious
rival my sudden elevation and importance in the
country were viewed with not more astonishment than
aversion by those whose importance i obscured they could
not hear with patience an upstart a boy a stranger
one universally unknown elbowing out the influence 
all that was most illustrious and venerable in the community
and robbing them daily their adherents and
retainers all these persons left no effort untried to defame
my character
the impulse once given the turbulent disposition the
populace became every day more formidable it is much
easier to disseminate a temper this sort than to quell it 
my opulent foes might take alarm at its excesses and desire
to undo what they had done but it was beyond their
power every day i feared lest from threats and invectives
the populace should proceed to violence every night
i thought i had reason to congratulate myself that the day
had passed without waste and spoil committed by them on
the means their subsistence or was not marked with the
destruction their champion and benefactor in some
places a sort petty sedition broke out among the labourers
i employed in the morning they refused to work why
should a man work they muttered when after all he may
travels st leon
starve with the wages his labour in his possession at
night they became impatient and furious and demanded
from my superintendents and storehousemen the food
which in the morning they had refused to earn and were
therefore now unable to purchase i had already had some
experience in the nature popular tumults had now no
marchese filosanto at hand to persuade me their inefficacy
 and if i had i should no longer have lent an ear
to his serene and unsuspicious generosity i felt the reality
 the danger i saw the storm as it blackened in my horizon
and was deeply convinced what it would be if it burst
upon my head
it may be imagined with what feelings i viewed my
whole design on the point to be subverted by the unruliness
 those for whose benefit it had been planned it is true
i had now no darling relations to be involved in my fate
no incomparable wife no daughters illustrious in innocence
and beauty yet my feelings were scarcely less pungent
than they had been at the period my catastrophe at pisa
i had blamed myself in review that in my experiments at
constance at dresden at pisa and at madrid i had not
commenced upon a sufficiently ample scale but had suffered
myself to be frustrated by the ingloriousness my precautions
that had not been my error in the present
instance yet my success now promised to be scarcely more
flattering than upon former occasions i had looked for
happiness as the result the benevolence and philanthropy
i was exerting i found only anxiety and a well grounded
fear even for my personal safety let no man build on the
expected gratitude those he spends his strength to serve 
let him be beneficent if he will but let him not depend
for his happiness on the conviction his rectitude and
virtue that is to be impressed on the minds others 
there is a principle in the human breast that easily induces
them to regard every thing that can be done for them
as no more than their due and speedily discharges them
from the oppressive consciousness obligation there is
a levity in the generality men that entails on them a
continual oblivion past benefits and makes one recent
disappointment more importance in their eyes than an
travels st leon 
i
eternity kindnesses and condescension i shall have
other instances ingratitude to display in what yet remains
to be related my story
my nights were restless my thoughts were in arms
what was it that it became me to do in the present emergency
 sometimes in the bitterness my heart hating
myself hating the endowments the stranger hating a
race beings who denied all credit to the most unheardof
exertions for their advantage i determined to withdraw
unobserved from my attendants and clients and bid adieu
to hungary for ever but whither was i to fly what
was i to do next what experiment could i make the
purposes to which to apply the philosopher's stone that i
had not already made these questions to none which
i could give a satisfactory answer checked the career my
passion and gave pause to my thoughts
whatever i did i was determined to do nothing rashly
nor to quit a great experiment without its having been fully
tried it was no light concern no trivial child'splay in
which i had embarked i had taken the welfare perhaps
the existence a great and heroic nation under my protection
in this glorious vocation it did not become me to
be lightly discouraged what if those i served and saved
did not show themselves sufficiently sensible to the exertions
i made for them i ought to purify my bosom on an
occasion like this from base and ignoble motives and to
deem myself sufficiently recompensed by my conscious virtue
what if the service in which i had engaged now
appeared to be a service hazard and peril is there
any great undertaking that can be separated from this condition
 if hastily from cowardice from pique or from
any other motive i deserted the business on which i had
entered what was to become my mistaken indeed butin
that case most unfortunate clients the greater was
the crisis to which they were exposed the more were unremitted
vigilance and uncommon powers necessary to guide
them amidst its rocks and its quicksands i saw thousands
 men who for several weeks had fed as it were from the
stores my bounty by a propensity inseparable from the
human heart i became attached to the work my media
travels op st leon
nations and the labour my thoughts all their fickleness
their injustice even the atrocious calumnies they admitted
and propagated against me could not wean my
attachment from beings a great portion whom but for
my interference would i believed long ere this have expired
 hunger
in the peculiar and urgent circumstances in which i
found myself no expedient was so obvious as that calling
in the interference the government under which i lived
jt was necessary that the resources national subsistence
should be defended from the wanton spoil those who
when they were annihilated must inevitably perish it
was necessary that the benefactor hungary who i flattered
myself was still able to watch effectively for her
advantage should be protected from her misguided resentment
the alternative was singularly painful to my feelings
the pride with which my unparalleled endowments inspired
me was deeply wounded when i was compelled to confess
that i was not alone equal to the task i had undertaken
and that i must submit to call in a foreign auxiliary i
augured little favourable from the interference government
which if i implored i could scarcely expect to
guide which was not likely to submit to my principle 
rendering its interference the mildest and smallest that the
nature the case would admit but puffed up with presumption
and intoxicated with authority would probably
leave no concern the public welfare uninvited least
 all could i anticipate much good from a turkish government
but what could i do i could discover no
other expedient influenced by the views i have recited
i had hitherto kept myself as far from the observation 
the political directors the state as i could but my
cautiousness and reserve were now at an with my
eyes open i exposed myself to all the evils that might attend
on my proceeding
i determined to apply to the bashaw the province
previously to my taking this step i had the precaution to
enquire his character he was the genuine offspring the
turkish system government his name was muzaffer
bey he was originally a circassian slave then a janistravels
 st leon 
say and rising by insensible gradation had at length been
appointed bashaw buda which as being the immediate
frontier between austria and the porte was at this time
the most arduous situation in the gift the sultan he
was esteemed a good soldier he had been early distinguished
by his dexterity in military exercises he had since
seen much service j and in every situation in which he was
placed had earned commendation and honour he was
abstemious and hardy for himself he neither pampered
his appetites nor shrunk from severity and he had as little
indulgence for those under his command as for his own person
yet he was indebted for his present eminence more to
the arts the courtier than to his merits in the field his
chief care had ever been to recommend himself to those
above him and to obtain the good will his equals for
the opinion his inferiors he gave himself little concern
with considerable ability he laboured under no check from
either principle or ingenuous pride and therefore was
extremely successful in his attacks on the inclination 
those he sought the habits his mind had modified the
lines his countenance and the tones his voice except
to his dependants and the poor he almost always spoke with
a smile upon his face and his enunciation was silvertongued
oily copious and insinuating if he ever adopted
a different manner the variation was only in the means
not the and when he seemed to travel by an opposite
road the goal at which he aimed was the same he never
consulted any oracle but that his apparent interest if he
had any insolence in his nature he regarded his slaves and
those under his military command as affording a sufficient
sphere for its exercise he had no affections to disturb him
from his bent he had no passions but the selfcomplacency
 superior cunning and the sordid love pelf
this account the man with whom i had to deal was
far from encouraging but i had no alternative i sent to
signify my desire to confer with him or to speak more
accurately to ask in the eastern manner when it would be
agreeable to him to receive a present which i requested
his acceptance he appointed the morning the following
clay i prepared a gift such as might tend to conciliate his
c c
 travels st leon
favour without marking in the donor the possession 
immoderate wealth it consisted silks and muslins with
a small piece plate exquisite workmanship my
present was borne by two my servants we were
ushered to the bashaw in his private apartment there were
two or three persons in attendance upon him they examined
my present together and without condescending
to express much approbation i could nevertheless discern
that the bashaw was pleased with it this ceremony concluded
muzaffer ordered what i had brought to be taken
into a different apartment and every other person withdrawing
we were left alone
while the bashaw was examining my gift i took the
opportunity considering his person he appeared to be
about sixty years age his complexion dark and muddy
his features coarse and distorted his mustachios remarkably
large his person though bony and muscular considerably
below the middle size and his figure ungainly and
ungraceful i felt surprised that such a man should ever
have been an excellent soldier or have risen from a low
rank to one the first situations the empire to look
at him he seemed better formed for the vice a comedy
than the ruler a nation he raised his eyes towards me
askance as he sat leaning on his elbow and said
you cal yourself 
the sieur de chatillon
 and your age 
 is two and twenty
te i am glad you are come to me i intended to have
sent for you and you have saved me the trouble
i made many apologies for my intrusion but added
that i had a petition to prefer and hoped he would favour
me with a hearing
not at all not at all do not call it an intrusion it
is necessary i should be acquainted with you he proceeded

you have undertaken to confer great benefits on the
subjects the grand signior my master to rescue them
from famine young rich a stranger unknown to my
master unknown to his subjects i understand that you
travels op st leon 
have spared no labour or expense to bring about their welfare
this is really a very extraordinary case your merit
is unprecedented i do not feel myself competent to reward
it
i answered that i laid no claim to uncommon merit 
that every temper had its particular gratifications and that
i found as real a luxury in the proceedings he had remarked
as other men did in the excesses the table or
the promiscuous enjoyments the harem
it is out my power continued he to remunerate
you as you deserve i must send you to constantinople
i perceived that this was the first essay his artifice
i informed him which i have no doubt he knew well enough
before that i had no desire to go to constantinople i
wished to remain where i was and to finish what i had
begun
what you have not done then suddenly and with
an abrupt voice exclaimed the bashaw by mahomet a
man a reasonable appetite in your place might be satisfied
have not you filled the streets with riots and the
country with rebellion do not the populace assemble in
crowds insulting every one they meet and talking nothing
but fire and devastation the bowstring and the
diameter be so good my dear sir as to inform me what
further you may have in view 
reverend bashaw cried i with submission yet with
firmness i have none these things in view but a
moment ago you did justice to my intentions they are
those beneficence and beneficence only
i know nothing about that i have nothing to do
with honest men's blunders i look to the effects they produce

these effects most mighty sir are temporary they
are the clouds that will often obscure for an instant the
brightest sunshine condescend to lend me your generous
assistance and all will be well
do not tell me clouds and sunshine this is to
my thinking not an april shower but an earthquake and
a hurricane if we are all to be swallowed up or whirled
into the air it is no consolation to me that the day after
c c 
 travels st leon
we are gone every thing shall be as fair and serene as
paradise itself
remember sir that when i came into hungary i
found its inhabitants in the most desperate condition miserable
wasted and starving have i not already suspended
this evil for months 
yes i do remember you are one those busybodies
who never see an evil without imagining they are
the persons to correct it intruding into every thing and
subverting every thing the superintendence the public
welfare is a mystery to which none are competent but those
whom mahomet has raised to the situation statesmen
your interference is blasphemy against the spirit our
religion and deserves to be encountered with the most
exemplary punishment
 good god then is it in this country a crime to feed
the hungry to clothe the naked and shelter the houseless

sieur de chatillon retorted the bashaw you appear
to be unacquainted with the maxims turkish policy the
wisest and most beneficent in the world if none the
disturbances had happened at which i have so much reason
to be alarmed still in relieving the people in the manner
you have done you have incurred the guilt high treason
against the sultan know sir that through the whole
extent his dominions there is but one proprietor
and that is our illustrious monarch you say that you
wish to be the benefactor his subjects and the judge 
your own proceedings such sentiments are direct rebellion
against the glorious constitution ottoman the sovereign
 constantinople will have no benefactor in the
countries he presides over but himself like the invisible
ruler the universe he acts by second causes he allows
his ministers to be the instruments his beneficence but
all must be ascribed to him must flow from his will and
be placed under his control you who have formed a plan
 public benefit without consulting him and have presumed
like a luminary the world to move in an orbit
 your own have in strictness construction forfeited your
life to his justice and i consult rather the clemency his
travels op st leon 
nature than the maxims his policy if i suffer you to go
from this palace with your head upon your shoulders
without permitting myself to be too much moved by the
imperious language addressed to me i complained to the
bashaw the rigorous and arbitrary character what he
stated to be the maxims the turkish government i
solemnly protested that i had no private or personal object
in view the effect my operations would be to give
new strength and energy to his master's dominions by
diffusing happiness among his subjects by reviving industry
and scattering plenty prosperity and ease all disaffection
would be rooted out and the people who are never
minute in scanning the cause their enjoyments would
bless the sceptre under which they were made to participate
such manifold benefits if the policy the divan led them
in any degree to interfere they ought rather to crown my
measures with their applause than wantonly to throw obstacles
in the way what i purposed i asked however
no reward i demanded no favour for myself all i desired
was that the sultan would assist me in securing to his people
those benefits the dissemination which i had so
auspiciously begun
the bashaw without taking any direct notice this
expostulation answered that i was not aware the maxims
 his government to which inconsideration my seeming
generosity and rectitude he was willing to give the mildest
interpretation it is however continued he to the
last degree idle in you to imagine that you can be permitted
to go on unobserved and that the sultan and his representatives
are to take no account your proceeding the great
instrument for ruling mankind is by their passions and
their opinions the man from whom they believe they
have the most to fear and the most to hope will always be
their master whatever be your secret or your professed
designs you go on from day to day making yourself partisans
and enlisting the subjects the sultan among your
personal retainers what security has he for your submission
and loyalty how shall he know that when you
h ave acquired the advantages a powerful leader you will
n ot go over to the enemy or in the present distracted conc
c 
travels st leon
edition the province even have the audacity to set up for
yourself if therefore by an unexampled clemency 
construction i decline to reduce you into the passive machine
 my master's will it is at least incumbent on me
that i should take account your powers and possess myself
 the schedule your property by this means only
can i watch your progress and take care that you do not
suddenly become too powerful for a subject are you prepared
to satisfy me on this head 
on this question i hesitated for a moment i had not
exactly anticipated the enquiry at length i requested the
delay a few days and then i promised that all his demands
should be satisfied the bashaw resumed 
sieur de chatillon i remark your hesitation and i
draw from it no favourable augury these indirect and
involuntary indications are more worthy my attention
than all the studied and elaborate information you shall
think proper to give me sir you are a man darkness
and every thing that relates to you is enveloped in mystery
you come hither with no apparent motive you have no
connections blood in hungary you have no acquaintance
with any eminent person the hungarian nation i
have had my spies on you though i have not hitherto
thought proper to summon you to my presence you have
purchased no property in the province i cannot learn that
you have any correspondences or resources from abroad i
have been at the pains to procure an account your expenditure
during the three months you have resided among
us much that expenditure has been obscure clandestine
and indirect but i believe you will find my estimate
which you are at liberty to inspect and remark upon tolerably
correct your disbursements for three months
exceed the amount two years income the richest subject
that even the credulous monarchs christendom suffer
within their dominions what am i to think this how
can i be sufficiently vigilant respecting a man whose expenditure
is immense and whose wealth can neither be
traced to its source nor ascertained in its amount 
i was not slow in conjecturing the result which the
bashaw proposed to himself from our present conference i
travels st leon 
was confirmed in my conjecture by the circumstance his
choosing that the discussion between us should be apart
from all witnesses he regarded me as a boy and had
therefore practised upon me all those arts which might
most effectually excite in me fear and alarm he found
however that under the external indications youth and
inexperience i possessed the wariness that added years most
powerfully inculcate and the selfpossession a mind thoroughly
awake to its situation and its resources thrust
have been to the minister before whom i stood a
memorable phenomenon but curiosity is not a turkish
passion and the single object the bashaw in the present
instance was to make the mysteriousness my circumstances
a pretext for extorting money i submitted with
as little seeming reluctance as possible to the necessity 
the case i requested the good offices muzaffer to protect
my benefactions and begged permission to make him
the compliment a handsome sum money by way 
convincing him that i was worthy his friendship
this business was easily adjusted between us i found
him perfectly skilled in the duties a public office and
by no means under the dominion visionary scruples he
told me he was now convinced that i was a well meaning
man and a good subject he said that nothing could tend
more effectually to demonstrate my innocence than my
showing that i understood the duties and concerns a
minister state and that for his own part he was never
so happy as when he was thus able to reconcile his private
interests with the good and faithful service his master
there was nothing that demanded a more unremitted vigilance
or a more skilful management than such a situation
as his and it would be most unreasonable either in the
sovereign that appointed him or the subjects over whom he
was placed to expect him to be indifferent to the emoluments
and perquisites his function he complimented
me warmly upon the disinterestedness and liberality my
exertions he thought himself particularly fortunate in
having so publicspirited an individual within the circuit
 his jurisdiction in fine he hoped he should be honoured
with my personal acquaintance and assured me that
c c 
 travels st leon
nothing could make him more happy than the frequent repetition
 my visits
we now perfectly understood one another and it was
apparent that i had to do with a man who for what he
deemed an adequate consideration would willingly lend me
the authority and countenance his office and suffer me
to guide him in any the functions i might conceive necessary
for the execution my projects guards were
agreed to be placed upon the magazines where corn was
still contained and from place to place on the banks 
the rivers where the depredations a misguided populace
were most to be apprehended finding the bashaw so
perfectly willing to comply with my requisitions i further
obtained from him the direction several squadrons 
cavalry for the protection the crops which from the consequences
 my interference now began on all sides to
variegate the scene this was a most important service
when the corn was first committed to the earth it was out
 the reach military devastation but as time glided
silently on the case became materially altered the enemy
might from forecast desire to reap the harvest what he
had not sown or from malice to destroy that without which
the turk would perhaps be unable to retain his newly acquired
territory this had in reality been the principal
cause before my arrival in hungary the very general
neglect into which agriculture had fallen muzaffer than
whom no person could now be more polite and condescending
allowed me to determine the number and nature the
troops i required and added that though he could not
openly put them under my direction the slightest intimation
i might think proper to convey to him should at anytime
decide their march and regulate their quarters
chapter xxxvii
in my conference with the bashaw i may seem to have
secured more than j one point material importance 
travels op st leon 
yet it was difficult for any man to be in a state less consolatory
or more full danger and menace than i was at
this moment by my vigilance and the power which thus
i had acquired i prevented indeed the inhabitants from
wantonly destroying the means their own subsistence 
but the more i was their benefactor the more i appeared
to become odious to their thoughts my negotiation with
the bashaw whatever other benefit might accrue from it
did not tend to increase the resources the country i was
obliged to witness many scenes wretchedness he that
would assist mankind in their adversity must harden his
heart to be the spectator the distress that he can and that
he cannot relieve but whatever i beheld this sort the
majority the bystanders obstinately persisted to ascribe
to my deliberate malignity the military aid i found myself
necessitated to introduce by no means tended to disarm
the prejudices my clients in one or two instances but
no more slight tumults arose and a few the rioters fella
prey to their own wickedness and folly these misfortunes
were cast as reproach upon me arid i was pursued
with clamours and curses i found it requisite to obtain a
guard for my person i was abhorred by those for whom
all my vigilance was exerted and insulted by the mouths
that i supplied with the necessaries existence
nor was this my only source alarm and uneasiness in
my present situation i was by no means a dupe to the
ostentatious civility the bashaw i perfectly understood
his insinuation when he invited the frequent repetition 
my visits i knew that however dearly i purchased his
friendship and patronage i should still have to purchase
them again and again his extortions upon me admitted
 no limits except from his own modesty or the estimate
he might form my invisible resources bribery itself
afforded me no complete security and now that i had become
an object curiosity and remark he had sufficiently
shown me i was at the mercy his caprice or that his
master for my liberty and even for my life
yet could i have resolved to quit hungary and seek
the protection some more regular government what benefit
should i derive from a removal mystery was the great
travels op st leon
and unconquerable bane my situation and from the poisonous
influence mystery the most regular system 
government was not competent to protect me it would be
idle to imagine that in any country on earth a stranger
would be permitted to launch into such expenses as those
in which i was engaged without becoming an object 
suspicion and being made liable to continual interruption
in his measures yet unless allowed to use the resources
i possessed what advantage was it to be the depository
 wealth without a bound was it to be wished for a
man under my circumstances to have a family or to be
without a family when i had one i found the legacy 
the stranger robbing me every comfort that sort with
the most calamitous aggravations when i was stripped
 wife and children though no man could prize those benefits
more dearly than i prized them i took to myself the
consolation that at least now i should risk no one's happiness
but my own and that for a person exercising my
endowments it was perhaps requisite to be free from every
shackle and incumbrance i found however the topic from
which i had consoled myself in reality the source a new
misfortune i had the wealth a nobleman but i was
deprived his adventitious attributes i had no illustrious
ancestry to boast i had neither lineage nor parent i had
neither wife nor children in whom mutually to reflect and
see reflected the devotedness and generosity my station
i had not even the ordinary advantage which is within the
reach almost every man connections and acquaintance
friends handed down to me as a branch my patrimonial
inheritance friends whose value experience enabled
me to ascertain and friends with whom long habits familiarity
had given birth to reciprocal endearment the
bashaw had imputed to me the design forming a party
alas these which are the great materials for cementing
party attachments were totally denied me i had no bonds
 alliance but those which money afforded the coarsest the
meanest the least flattering and the most brittle those
ligatures that afford the semblance uniting man with
man
travels st leon sq
chapter xxxviii
aware the difficulties which unavoidably sprung out 
the nature my situation i resolved immediately to endeavour
to supply them to the best my power i conceived
that there was no consideration so urgent upon meat
the present moment as that i should without loss 
time create to myself connections that might balance and
keep at bay the sallies arbitrary rule and that i should
weave with my own hand the cords friendship
i had no sooner formed this project than an individual
suggested himself to my reflections whom i judged to be
by a singular concurrence circumstances happily fitted
to be the subject my experiment and admirably qualified
to afford me protection in the most unfavourable events
the name this man was bethlem gabor he had been
some time before brought to me by one his friends and
he was a man whom for a thousand reasons it was impossible
to see and converse with without receiving the most
indelible impression he was the lineal representative 
one the most illustrious houses in hungary his vocation
like that the majority the hungarian nobility
had been arms but in the midst a fraternity all 
whom were warlike he stood conspicuous and alone his
courage though cool and deliberate almost mounted to a
degree desperate rashness and the fertility his invention
and the variety his stratagems did not fall short
 his courage the celerity his measures was equally
distinguished distance was no bar to him and he had
no sooner conceived a project however arduous than it was
executed he had formed under his own eye a band 
men like himself impetuous yet deliberate swift in execution
silent in march invincible to hardship contemners
 fatigue difficulties hunger and thirst when
introduced to me he was upwards fifty years age
he was more than six feet in stature and yet he was built
as if it had been a colossus destined to sustain the weight
 the starry heavens his voice was like thunder and he
 travels st leon
never uttered a word but it seemed to shake his manly chest
his head and chin were clothed with a thick and shaggy hair
in colour a dead black he had suffered considerable mutilation
in the services through which he had passed 
one his hands three fingers were gone the sight his
right eye was extinguished and the cheek half shot away
while the same explosion had burned his complexion into a
colour that was universally dun or black his nose was
scarred and his lips were thick and large bethlem gabor
though universally respected for the honour and magnanimity
 a soldier was not less remarkable for habits 
reserve and taciturnity but these habits misfortune had
caused to become more deeply ingrafted in his nature
during one his military excursions a party marauders
had in his absence surprised his castle burned it to the
ground and savagely murdered his wife and children
and every living creature within the walls the same
stroke that rendered him childless made him also a beggar
he had been regarded for his proceedings as an adherent
to the turkish standard but he had always tenaciously
maintained the most complete independence the adversity
that had now fallen upon him was too great he
would not become a pensioner the sultan despair had
taken fast possession his heart he disbanded the body
 men he had formed and wandered a solitary outcast
upon the face his country for some time he seemed to
have a savage complacence in conceiving that the evil he
had suffered was past all remedy and in spurning at those
palliations and disguises with which vulgar souls are
accustomed to assuage their woe yet the energy his
nature would not suffer him to rest he wandered an outcast
 but every day engendered some new thought or passion
 and it appeared probable that he would not yet quit
the stage existence till he had left behind him the remembrances
 a terrible and desolating revenge
it may seem strange that such a man as i have described
should be the indivi dual i selected out the whole
hungarian nation to make my friend it may seem that
his qualities were better adapted to repel than attract my
choice would not appear strange if the reader could have
travels st leon 
conversed with him as i did he was hideous to the sight
and he never addressed himself to speak that i did not
feel my very heart shudder within me seldom did he
allow himself to open his thoughts but when he did
great god what supernatural eloquence seemed to inspire
and enshroud him not that upon such occasions he was
copious and ciceronian but that every muscle and every
limb seemed to live and to quiver with the thoughts he
expressed the hearer could not refuse to venerate as
well as fear him i never pitied him bethlem gabor's
was a soul that soared to a sightless distance above the
sphere pity i can scarcely say i sympathised with him 
but when i listened to his complaints rather let me say
his invectives i was astonished overwhelmed and motionless
the secret the effects he thus produced lay
in his own way feeling the incidents he described look
at him when he sat alone wrapped in meditation you
would say that is a man iron though adversity pour
her fiercest darts upon him he is invulnerable he is 
too colossal a structure to be accessible to human feelings
and human affections listen to his narrative or rather
to the bursts passion which with him supplied the place
and performed the functions narrative you would soon
confess your mistake while he spoke he ceased to be a
man and became something more amazing when he alluded
to what he had endured you did not compassionate
him for you felt that he was a creature another nature 
but you confessed that never man seemed to have suffered
so much or to savour with such bitterness the cup woe
he did not love his wife or his children as any other man
would do he probably never dandled or fondled them his
love was speechless and disdaining the common modes 
exhibition it might sometimes be mistaken for indifference
but it brooded over and clung round his heart and when
it was disturbed when the strong ties domestic charity
were by the merciless hand war snapped asunder you
then saw its voluminous folds spread and convulsed before
you gigantic and immeasurable he cursed their murderers
 he cursed mankind he rose up in fierce defiance
 eternal providence and your blood curdled within you
s travels st leon
as he spoke such was bethlem gabor i could not help
admiring him his greatness excited my wonder and my
reverence and while his manners awed and overwhelmed
me i felt an inexplicable attachment to his person still increasing
in my bosom
on his part my kindness and partiality appeared scarcely
less pleasing to bethlem gabor than his character and
discourse were fascinating to me he had found himself
without a confident or a friend his wife and his children
in a certain degree understood him and though he had
an atmosphere repulsion beyond which no mortal ever
penetrated they came to the edge that and rested there 
they trembled involuntarily at his aspect but at the same
time they adored and they loved him the rest the
world viewed him from a more fearful distance respected
him but dared not even in fancy be familiar with him
when therefore he lost his family he lost his all he
roamed the earth in solitude and all men made room for
him as he passed i was the first who since the fatal
event that had made him childless and a beggar had
courted his society and invited his communications i
had dared to take the lion by the paw and seat myself
next him in his den there was a similarity in our fortunes
that secretly endeared him to me we had each by
the malice a hostile destiny though in a very different
manner been deprived our families we were each 
us alone fated each to be hereafter for ever alone we
blended ourselves the one with the other as perfectly as we
could often over our gloomy bowl we mingled groans
and sweetened our draught as we drank it with maledictions
in the school bethlem gabor i became acquainted
with the delights melancholy a melancholy
not that contracted but that swelled the soul a melancholy
that looked down upon the world with indignation
and that relieved its secret load with curses and execrations
we frequently continued whole nights in the participation
 these bitter joys and were surprised still at our serious
board by the light the morrow's sun
i have now i believe fully accounted for our intimacy
and displayed the ligatures that secretly bound us to each
travels st leon 
other it is scarcely necessary to add that ray understanding
confirmed what my heart impelled bethlem
gabor appeared to me the fittest man in the world upon
whom to fix for my friend we were qualified mutually
to benefit each other my kindness my unremitted attentions
the earnestness with which i listened to and
soothed his griefs mitigated their agony i proposed
when i could once more reconcile and incite him to activity
to repair his castle and restore his fortune on
the other hand he was all the persons i could have
pitched upon the ablest to protect me by his birth he
ranked among the first men his country by his ability
at least as a partisan soldier a character at that time highly
esteemed he rose above them all
for some time i regarded bethlem gabor as entirely
my friend and i consulted him in every thing in which
compatibly with the legacy the stranger the summerhouse
i could consult him i told him the suspicions 
the bashaw and the precariousness my safety i demanded
his advice as to the best method securing it
ought i to regard it as a more effectual or as a cheaper
expedient to attempt to purchase the countenance the
sultan instead condescending to bribe his minister 
ought i to set up for myself and by rendering myself the
independent prince one the hungarian provinces
defy the turk or at least endeavour to negotiate with him
from a more respectable and commanding situation i
said more than enough under these heads as it afterwards
appeared to awaken strange imaginations in a mind so
much penetration as that bethlem gabor in fine i
demanded him whether in case any great and formidable
danger falling on me he would to the utmost his
power afford me protection when the question was first
started he swore to me with his customary impressiveness
and energy that he would
while i was thus employed in consulting him and
opening to him as far as was practicable my prospects and
fears did not less succeed in dissipating or suspending
tie despair his melancholy it was benefit to him
in this respect that by opening to him my affairs i from
 travels st leon
time to time called off his attention from his personal misfortunes
i proposed to him the rebuilding his castle and
i at length obtained his permission to send off a corps 
workmen for that purpose beside the castle in which his
wife and children had been murdered and which the
marauders had nearly destroyed he had one considerably
stronger though void all recommendation from cheerfulness
or beauty in the more northerly part the kingdom
this we visited together i restored the condition
 his fields with considerable difficulty i replaced the
cattle he had lost by purchases in poland and i revived
his dilapidated revenues at first he felt an invincible
repugnance to the receiving any advantage from the bounty
 another but by continual remonstrances i was able to persuade
him that he owed me nothing and that what i did
was no more than was required from me by a regard for
my own safety
if ever on the face the earth there lived a misanthrope
bethlem gabor was the man never for a moment did he
forget or forgive the sanguinary catastrophe his family 
and for his own misfortunes he seemed to have vowed vengeance
against the whole human race he almost hated
the very face man and when expressions cheerfulness
peace and contentment discovered themselves in his
presence i could see by the hideous working his features
that his spirit experienced intolerable agonies to him
such expressions were tones horribly discordant all was
uproar and havoc within his own bosom and the gaiety 
other men inspired him with sentiments invincible antipathy
he never saw a festive board without an inclination
to overturn it or a father encircled with a smiling family
without feeling his soul thrill with suggestions murder
something i know not what withheld his hand it might
be some remaining atom humanity it might be for
his whole character was contemplative and close it might
be that he regarded that as a pitiful and impotent revenge
which should cause him the next hour to be locked up as a
madman or put to death as criminal horrible as was his
personal aspect and wild and savage as was his mind yet
as i have already said i felt myself attached to him i
travels op st leon 
knew that all the unsocial propensities that animated him
were the offspring love were the sentiments a lioness
bereaved her young and i found an undescribable and
exhaustless pleasure in examining the sublime desolation 
a mighty soul
bethlem gabor had at first regarded me with some degree
 partiality kindness in almost all cases begets kindness 
he could not see how much i interested myself about and
how much i courted him without feeling for me a sentiment
different from that he confessed for other men i saw
however after some time with inexpressible grief that his
regard for me instead increasing suffered perceptible
diminution our propensities were opposed to each other
he rejoiced in disorder and desolation as in his congenial
element my present pursuit was the restoration public
order and prosperity he repeatedly expostulated with me
on this i had sometimes in our conversations in the bitterness
 my recollections exclaimed on myself as the
most unfortunate and most persecuted men though
without entering into an explanation my sufferings he
reminded me these exclamations he reproached me asa
contemptible and pusillanimous wretch that i did not
like him resolve amply and memorably to revenge my own
sufferings upon my species at large in his estimate the
poorest and most servile all maxims was that the
author the christian religion to repay injury with favour
and curses with benediction
i perceived with grief that the kindness towards me that
had been excited in bethlem gabor's mind rather declined
than augmented but i was very far from being aware 
the degree in which as i afterwards found this sentiment
had relapsed into its opposite it seems i inflicted on him
a daily torture by my daily efforts for the dissemination 
happiness these he had not been at first completely
aware his mind had been too much absorbed in its own
feelings to attend very distinctly to any thing i did unless
it were done in his presence but in proportion as i
soothed his sorrows and made him my confidant the film
was removed and all that he saw had the peculiar misfortune
to excite at once his contempt and his rage the
d d
 travels st leon
finishing stroke that i gave to the animosity which unknown
to me was now brooding and engendering in his
breast consisted in my bestowing an important benefit
upon one against whom he had entertained a long and
eternal feud
chapter xxxix
while bethlem gabor became every day more confirmed
in his antipathy against me i reposed in him an unsuspecting
confidence a confidence more extensive than
i had since the singular and fatal acquisition i had made
reposed in any other man frequently for a considerable
time together he resided under my roof frequently we
went forth together in those excursions which either my
projects or his views rendered it necessary for us to make
in his character a nobleman great consideration in
his native country he was now rising like a phoenix from
its ashes his castles were repairing his property was
restored the list his retainers daily became more numerous
 he revived and carefully recruited the martial
band which in the first exacerbations his despair he
had dismissed from his service my purse and all that i
had were his he never made a demand upon me that i
did not instantly supply i reaped a particular pleasure
from the largeness and frequency his requisitions there
was nothing for which i was more anxious than to bind
him to me in indissoluble ties gratitude and affection
little alas did i understand the compound tenderness
and ferocity decisiveness and inscrutability with
which i was now concerned my friend such i esteemed
him had been absent some time i expected his return
to my residence at buda and anxious to pay him every
mark attention and respect i set out to meet him it
was scarcely safe during the existing hostilities between
the austrians and the turks to travel any where without
a guard i had the precaution in the present instance to
take with me an attendance twenty men
travels st leon
it was after having partaken a slight and early dinner
that i set out on my excursion the season was remarkably
fine and the air genial and balsamic i scarcely ever
commenced any tour with more agreeable sensations the
harvest was already ripe and as i passed along i saw
reapers from time to time entering upon the first essay 
their interesting occupation i felt that i had at length
surmounted one those difficulties with which i had been
so strongly assailed and to which i had refused to yield
if i were not free from apprehensions from the arbitrary
nature the government under which i lived i believed
however that i had nothing further to dread from the
misconstruction and animosity the nation i preserved
my anxiety as to whether i should be able to substantiate
the benefit i had sought to confer was at an and i
had little doubt that with the plenteous crops which were
on the point being gathered my popularity would return
and the gratitude my clients become more ardent
than ever it was a delicious enjoyment that i now experienced
 the pleasures that the eye unavoidably takes in
from the spectacle a luxuriant autumn became blended
in my mind with the ideas famine put to flight my own
rectitude vindicated and the benevolent purposes realised
the prosecution which had cost me so profound a heartache

we at length passed the lines the soldiers planted for
the defence the soil against the depredations the
enemy i had calculated that i should meet my guest a
few leagues from buda i was deceived in my estimate
the day however his arrival was fixed i could not be
mistaken in his route i resolved not to turn back without
meeting him the road i took led upon the borders 
that part hungary which owned the austrian yoke 
the shades night were fast gathering round us and we
heard at a distance the alarmguns and the drums the
enemy i was not however a novice in the appearances 
a country the seat military excursions and war and if
my mind were not wholly free from perturbation and
uncertainty i at least resolved not to be turned aside from
my purpose we travelled two hours longer still no
d d 
 travels st leox
notice the approach bethlem gabor at length a
question was started whether we were still in the right
road and i thought it advisable to hold a sort council
 war to deliberate respecting our further proceedings
having assembled my attendants for that purpose i was
now first struck with the apprehensions and timidity which
they unanimously betrayed they had been drawn out
rather for show and to keep accidental stragglers in awe
than with the expectation actual service i became sensible
that nothing was to be hoped from their resistance in
the event an action and the utmost i could aim at was
in the mean time to hold them together by the sentiment
 a common danger
it was resolved to return i began to be apprehensive
that bethlem gabor had been prevented by some unexpected
occurrence from observing his appointment scarcely had
we faced about before we heard a body cavalry approaching
us i called to my party to halt i soon discerned
from symptoms not difficult to be remarked by a
careful observer that the party at hand was composed 
austrohungarians we had every thing to fear from
them i held myself bound under these circumstances first
to make experiment the fleetness our horses i
however charged my people to keep together and not to
suffer the enemy by means our inadvertence and folly
to make an easy prize us one after another in a short
time i found that our pursuers sensibly gained ground upon
us i was mounted upon an excellent beast and could
easily have rode away from my troop while they would
have been placed as a sort intercepting object between
me and the enemy but i had too much a military
spirit not instantly to reject so inglorious an expedient i
called a second time to my attendants to halt i judged
that the party our antagonists was less numerous than
ours i was convinced that our common safety depended
upon our concerted resistance filled with the gallantry
that my situation inspired i did not perceive till it was too
late that my present call to halt was attended to by few 
even those few rather hung back divided between apprehension
and shame i was the foremost and before i was
travels op st leon 
aware i found myself through the means the darkness
enveloped by the enemy from my appearance they
judged that i was the master and the rest my attendants 
they contented themselves therefore with the prize they had
made and did not give themselves the trouble to pursue
the fugitives they eagerly enquired me who i was 
and comparing my answers with various circumstances
which rumour had brought to their ear they easily concluded
that i was the rich stranger buda the character
they had heard me did not produce in these freebooters
any sentiments forbearance or demonstrations respect
the only point about which persons their habits were
concerned was how they should make the greatest advantage
 what the fortune war had thrown in their
way
while they were consulting and various expedients were
started by one and another for this purpose a second alarm
was given and one the party being despatched to reconnoitre
presently returned with intelligence that the persons
approaching were horsemen the enemy and that they
amounted as he guessed to forty in number upon this
information the party whose prisoner i was agreed to return
with all expedition by the way they had come and
commanded me upon pain death to proceed in their
company this menace had not the effect to deprive me 
courage or presence mind and i easily conceived that
the readiest way to deliver myself from my embarrassment
would be to join at the first opportunity the band turcohungarians
whose approach had occasioned our sudden
retreat the darkness the night was favourable to my
purpose and taking advantage a sudden winding in
the road i slackened all at once the pace my horse without
being observed by my companions who as the enemy
approached had now their thoughts almost wholly intent
upon the safety their retreat they passed me and i
no sooner perceived that to be the case than covered from
their observation by the intervening inclosure i turned my
horse and gradually as my distance from my keepers increased
urged him to a fuller speed it was not long
before i came up with the band which had produced our
d d 
 travels st leon
alarm and hailing them with the acclamation long live
the mighty sultan was without difficulty admitted into
their troop i instantly understood to my great joy that
this was the party bethlem gabor that i had come out
to meet
he received me with much cordiality and seemed greatly
rejoiced that fortune had made him the instrument my
rescue he proposed however that having met on the
road i should now instead proceeding to buda return
with him to his northern castle from which our distance
was scarcely greater than from the metropolis the proposal
was such as i had not expected nor could i well
comprehend the purpose with which it was made but the
habitual demeanour bethlem gabor neither accorded
with his minutely assigning a reason for what he did nor
was calculated to encourage enquiry in another i saw no
material objection and therefore felt little scruple in yielding
to his desires our brief consultation on this point
passed at some little distance from the rest the troop
when the morning broke the first thing that excited
my attention was the appearance his followers they
were full forty in number well mounted a large and
athletic figure with sunburnt faces immense whiskers and
a ferocious countenance i thought i had never seen so
tremendous a band to me they were every one them
strangers all the persons that surrounded me the only
one whom i had the slightest knowledge was bethlem
gabor himself i know not why it was but i no sooner
beheld my situation than i was struck with alarm i saw
myself completely in the power a man who three months
before was ignorant even my existence i had not a
single attendant my own not an individual with me over
whom i had personal authority or command i had no
reason to distrust my host towards me his demeanour had
ever been frank confidential and manly i had every
imaginable claim upon his generosity and his gratitude
but our senses are often the masters our mind and reason
vainly opposes itself to the liveliness their impressions
every time that i lifted my eyes and saw myself
hemmed in by these barbarians my heart seemed involun
travels op st leon
tartly to fail me bethlem gabor too appeared to neglect
me he had never shown himself so little obliging and attentive
as at this moment and aided by the rest the
scene i thought i had never beheld him so deformed or so
tremendous i was more than half inclined to wish myself
again a prisoner with the austrian s
when we arrived at the castle we were all us fatigued
and hungry we had roamed during the whole night a
repast was prepared we sat down to partake it excuse
me said bethlem gabor in a low voice as he passed
me that i this night offer you the fare a soldier tomorrow
you shall be accommodated in a different manner
the words were innocent the proceeding natural but
there was a mysterious gloom at least as i thought in the
tone in which he spoke that electrified me the hall in
which we supped was spacious and lofty the naked walls
and rafters were imbrowned with age though it was
daybreak as we entered the windows were still darkened
and the apartment was illuminated only by the partial
glare lamps depending from the roof as i sat at table
with the troop my host i appeared to myself as if inclosed
in a cavern banditti though excellent partisans
skilful in execution and perfect in their discipline they were
unpolished in their manners and brutal in their conversation
i had been inured from infancy to all the refinement
that the age in which i lived had any where to boast and
amidst the various evils i had suffered that being associated
with the vulgar and the base had never presented
itself while they uttered now a loathsome jest and now
a sanguinary ejaculation i became ashamed my species
and the pride manhood perished within me they however
paid little attention either to my feelings or my person
and accustomed as i had been whether with friends or
enemies to be regarded as some importance i found
myself unaccountably and suddenly dwindled into a cipher
i felt it like a release from the state a galleyslave when
bethlem gabor proposed that we should break up our meeting
and retire to rest
d d

chapter xl
a succession gloomy thoughts revolved in my mind for
some time after i was left to myself i was however overcome
with fatigue and after an interval harassing
meditations insensibly fell asleep i was awakened after
some hours repose by the presence bethlem gabor
standing by the side my couch he invited me to rise
and when i had attired myself started the plan our
visiting together the various apartments the castle a
small part which only had been seen by me when i was
last at this place among other things he told me there
was a subterranean most wonderful extent interspersed
with a variety cells and lurking places which no man
had to his knowledge ever ascertained the number
the same dreary complexion thought followed me
today which had been first produced in me upon my reception
into the troop bethlem gabor the preceding
night my sensations were the most depressing and
discomfiting nature i felt as if i were the slave some
dark mysterious tyrant and dragged along supinely wherever
he motioned me to go i tasked myself seriously i reasoned
with myself i felt that it was no idle and everyday
part that i was called to sustain and i resolved that
i would not be ruined by my own inactivity and cowardice
yet when i examined the question dispassionately i could
not find that i had any occasion for courage and i confessed
that it was not less censurable to discover a useless
spirit mistrust and defiance than to desert one's preservation
where resistance was demanded what reason
had i to suspect a man between whom and myself there
had prevailed so much mutual confidence none none
i replied but the causeless and superstitious misgivings 
my own mind even if had ground to distrust him
what remedy had i against his ill faith placed as i was in
the midst his own domains and surrounded by men devoted
to his service to discover apprehension under such
circumstances was to excite animosity these reasonings
travels st leon 
particularly occurred to my mind as i stood waiting for
the torch which he had himself gone to procure that he
might attend me to the subterranean caverns i had as
yet seen no one since we broke up from our nightly repast
but my host we will breakfast said he when we
return from viewing these curiosities
we crept along a succession dark and gloomy vaults
almost in silence bethlem gabor though he led me on
and discharged the office a guide seemed to have small
inclination to assume that an interpreter this was
sufficiently in unison with his ordinary character to have
little claim to excite surprise yet the reader will not on
reflection greatly wonder that my present situation was far
from agreeable i was alone in passages which to judge
from any discoverable token you would scarcely imagine
had for ages been trod by a human creature the voice
was lost amidst the damps these immense caverns nor
was it possible by any exertion to call the hand man to
your aid my guide was an individual whom calamity
had prompted to quarrel with the world strong feelings
indeed capacious thought but rugged ferocious brutal
and inaccessible to prayer i had chosen him for my protector
and ally i had never intended to put myself in his
power there was a mystery in his carriage a something
not to be explained a shell that no human forces could
penetrate that was mortal to confidence and might quail
the stoutest
i thought there would be no to our pilgrimage at
length we came to a strong door crossbarred and secured
with a frame iron bethlem gabor unlocked it we
had no sooner entered that it impetuously closed behind
us what is that said i startled at the loudness 
the report come on cried my host it is only the
wind whistling through the caverns the springbolt is
shot but i have the key in my hand at the opposite
 the apartment was another door with an ascent 
five steps leading to it bethlem gabor unlocked that
also and then faced about with the torch in his hand i
was close behind him stay where you are said he
with a furious accent and thrust me violently from him
 travels st leon
the violence was unexpected i staggered from the top 
the steps to the bottom this door closed with as loud a
report as the other bethlem gabor disappeared i was
left in darkness
for an instant i doubted whether the situation in which
i thus found myself were the result design or accident
the shutting the door might be ascribed to the latter 
the action however and the words my host did not admit
 that interpretation i stood motionless astonished
and almost incapable reflection what an incredible
reverse was thus the creature a moment yesterday i
possessed unbounded treasures and the hearts the whole
turco hungarian nation yesterday as i rode forth on
this fatal excursion i beheld the food a mighty people
mature for consumption the growth my exertions and
it will not be thought surprising that my heart leaped within
me at the sight who would not have envied the unparalleled
eminence at which i had arrived my triumphs
were attended with no melancholy exceptions to damp their
joy they were the children no intrigue they were
manly frank ingenuous and honourable my laurels were
stained with no drop blood were tarnished with no tears
 the widow and the orphan how much more noble to
rescue mankind from famine and death than to violate the
honest pride their nature with the exhibition victories
and trophies 
yet truly considered there was nothing abrupt in the
reverse under which i was now suffering the whole was
a chain every link which was indissolubly connected from
one to the other my attempt to rescue a people from
the horrors famine necessarily exposed me to unfavourable
accidents and misconstruction it inevitably led to
my application to the government for its aid it could not
fail to excite the alarms and jealousies government as to
the tendency my proceedings by exhibiting me as the
possessor immense wealth with very limited means for
the protection that wealth it marked me a prey to a rapacious
viceroy or his more despotic master when i became
sensible the precarious situation in which i stood towards
the powers the state could i have fallen upon a more
travels st leon 
natural expedient than the endeavour to cover myself with
the shield friendship and gratitude in the person one
 its nobles but this expedient would almost infallibly
lead to the placing myself sooner or later in the power 
the man whose friendship i sought i had done so and
this was the termination my views and my projects 
i now well understood the purpose that inattention
and neglect with which bethlem gabor had treated me the
preceding evening the uneasiness resulting from which i
had blamed in myself at the time as the dictate weakness
and unworthy suspicion yesterday i had been placed
under the safeguard a nation every man in buda and
its environs was familiar with my person every man would
have been ready almost to sacrifice his life to procure my
safety now i was far from the scene my philanthropical
exertions no one in the troop bethlem gabor knew who
i was he had appeared to treat me the preceding evening
with indifference and contempt if they saw me no more
no curiosity would by that circumstance be excited in their
minds my clients on the other hand in the vicinity the
metropolis however great an interest they might take in
my fortune had no clue that could lead them to the knowledge
 it they must suppose me a prisoner with the
austrians or that i had been killed in resisting to become
their prisoner i was cut off from all assistance and discovery
and left as much in the power my treacherous
ally as if i had been alone with him oppressed with the
utmost disparity personal force in the remotest island 
the pacific ocean
such were the reflections that early suggested themselves
to my mind in the solitude and darkness in which i was thus
unexpectedly involved meanwhile one tedious hour succeeded
to another and i remained unintended on and unnoticed
i could form no conjecture as to the object 
bethlem gabor in the atrocious perfidy he had committed
could he have any resentment against me and did he
meditate revenge he had received from me nothing but
benefits did he employ restraint on my person as the
means extortion i could not conceive that he could
have any clue leading him to the discovery my grand
 travels st leon
secret and short this my bounties had been so exuberant
as i imagined left him nothing to wish in this wilderness
 conjecture i however fixed upon extortion as a
motive less incredible than revenge i impatiently waited
till the appearance my tyrant should free me from some
part my present uncertainty
he did not appear in the mean time i was in a condition
feeble and exhausted the exercise yesterday the
hourlybaffled expectation meeting him whom i had
called my friend the alternation being first taken prisoner
and afterwards rescued had extremely fatigued me
we had travelled during the whole night yet the unaccountable
dejection mind under which i laboured on our
arrival at bethlem gabor's castle had prevented me from
taking almost any share in the coarse repast that had then
been set before us the entrance my host in the morning
had rendered my slumbers short as i followed him to my
dungeon unconscious whither i went my limbs ached and
my heart ached still more i was ill prepared for a fast
 thirtysix hours which the brutality my jailor inflicted
upon me after having long expected him in vain i gave
myself up to despair what a termination life for him
who possessed the philosopher's stone 
i cannot do justice to the sensations that now took possession
 my mind it was not the deadly calm despair
for i still expected every moment when bethlem gabor
would appear i believed than he would and i believed
that he would not leave me to perish i listened with eager
attention to every sound and my soul floated on the howling
winds in vain nothing came it there was no
alteration in the sound or only those vicissitudes to which
the howling the wind is unavoidably subject i then
turned away in anguish i cursed i stamped with my
feet i smote my forehead with my closed hand i tore
my hair anon another sound arrested my attention it
was a different howling it seemed to be like a human
voice my fancy created to me the tread a human foot
i listened with more intentness soul than ever it was
again in vain 
no no he will not come he will never come why
travels st leon 
should i agitate myself to no purpose let me lie down
and die i reasoned with myself why should i wish
to live i am nothing to any human being i am alone in
the boundless universe i have no tie to existence st
leon has no wife st leon has no child he has neither
connection nor friend in the world even in this wretched
vision the philosopher's stone have i not tried it enough 
have i any hopes from it is it not time that i should
throw away that and existence together my meditations
were ineffectual i suppose it is the case with all men thus
violently thrust out life in the full possession their
faculties i know it was the case with me the more
peremptory was my summoner the more obstinately i clung
to the worthless toy
at length i laid myself down on the floor and if i occasionally
listened i no longer ran to the walls and the
doors to catch the uncertain sounds the gnawing i now
felt within were intolerable they were at one period so
severe that can compare them to nothing but the sensation
 having swallowed a glowing ember afterwards
the weakness nature would no longer feed this excruciating
pain and it subsided into a starting and convulsive
throb the pain was diversified with intervals a deathlike
and insupportable sickness but no i will not attempt
to describe the horrors hunger sublimed by despair where
the torture the mind gives new pungency and uproar to
the corporeal anguish the image as it now presents itself
to my recollection is too dreadful
at last i sunk into a state insensibility and the agony
i had suffered seemed drawn to its final close the busy
turmoil the feverish dream human existence was at an
 i shut my eyes and i believed i should open them
no more
chapter xli
how long i endured this suspension the vital faculties i
cannot tell the next impression on my sensorium subsequent
to those i have described was a sort external
 travels st leon
twitching and violence that seemed to persecute me it was
an importunity from which i felt desirous to escape i
longed to be undisturbed and at rest the intruder on my
quiet would not leave me and i at length roused myself
as if to put away my cause molestation my thoughts
were all confounded and obscure i knew not where i
could scarcely be said to know who i was a little more
effort brought with it a further capacity perception i
saw before me what was now the chief object my mortal
aversion the figure bethlem gabor it was some time
longer before i became aware that he had been employed
in taking up my apparently lifeless corpse placing it on a
stonebench in the side the cave and chaining it to the
wall he observed the motions that indicated in me returning
life he remarked the stare my glassy and rayless
eyes he now spoke with a stern and unpitying voice
there is food there is a light eat having thus said he
left me
what a cruel and remorseless treatment he cared not
for my life he disdained to make the slightest exertion to
restore me he left it to chance whether i should revive or
perish the figure a dying man that i presented did
not make one fibre his bosom bend or quiver
i revived i ate by degrees i recovered from the
deadly languor which had invaded my senses in about twelve
hours longer bethlem gabor returned with a new supply 
sustenance i was now strong enough to be able to converse
with him i heard the heavy sound opening locks and
removing bolts before he entered and i summoned my
faculties to expostulate with him
why am i here what is the meaning the unworthy
way in which you treat me 
it is he regarded me with a truculent aspect as if
he would pierce through my heart because i hate you 
you hate me good god is it possible what evil
have i done to you what good have i not done you 
what supplies have i refused you what occasions have
i neglected studying your advantage your interest and
your honour if thus your hatred is purchased how shall
that man demean himself who is to purchase your love 
travels st leon
oh think not my hatred idle or capricious heaven
knows i would have refrained from hating you if i had
been able i struggled against it with all the energies 
my soul but you have committed towards me the most
mortal offences that man ever endured there is an antipathy
between your nature and mine that all the menstruums
in the world could never bring to coalesce
eternal providence and what is the source this
antipathy 
and do you profess ignorance have you not gone
on day after day with the full consciousness and will to
torment me have i not warned you and expostulated
with you times without number 
 what have you warned me 
i hate mankind i was not born to hate them i have
no native obliquity character i have no diabolical maliciousness
 constitution but they have forced me to
hate them and the debt abhorrence shall be amply paid
i loved as never mortal loved no human heart was
ever so devoted and centred and enveloped in the kindly
affections family and parentage as mine has been was
not my wife were not my children murdered when i
came home to feast my eyes and tranquillise my soul with
the sight them did i not find all waste and desolation 
did i not find their bodies naked pale disfigured with
wounds plunged in blood and already putrid this was
the welcome i looked for this was the object i so
speeded to see no never was a moment like that my
whole nature was changed in an instant my eyes were
blasted and dried to horn my blood froze in my well
stored veins i have no longer delight but in human
misery
my revenge is not causeless this was not the act 
individuals all men in the place these murderers
would have done as they did they are in a league together
human pity and forbearance never had a harbour
but in my breast and i have now abjured them with
something more inwrought vigour and energy i will
become like to my brethren all men are excited by the
same motives urged by the same temptations influenced
 g travels st leon
by the same inducements why should i attempt a futile
distinction when nature had made none all men bear
the same figure i cannot view the human figure without
a torture the most dreadful
i always knew answered i your general hatred 
mankind but your manners and your behaviour persuaded
me that you exempted me from the general censure
f i wished to do so you made the attempt impossible
you told me that you had suffered the same misfortunes
which i had that you by the injustice and persecutions
 men had also lost your wife and your children i
hailed you as a brother in my heart i swore to you
eternal friendship i said we will carry on this holy warfare
together we communicated to each other our mutual
sorrows with you and you only i found moments 
consolation
soon i discovered my mistake instead like me
seeking occasions glorious mischief and vengeance you
took upon yourself to be the benefactor and parent mankind
what vocation had you to the task with the
spirit a slave who the more he is beaten becomes the
more servile and submissive you remunerated injuries with
benefits i found that there was not within you one atom
 generous sentiment one honest glow fervent indignation
chickenhearted wretch poor soulless poltroon 
to say the best you to your insensate heart it was the
same whether you were treated with reverence or scorn i
saw you hunted hooted at and pursued by the people you
fed you held on your course and fed them still i was
compelled to witness or to hear your senseless liberalities
every day i lived could i submit to this torment
and not endeavour to remove it i hate the man in whom
kindness produces no responsive affection and injustice no
swell no glow resentment i hated you the more because
having suffered what i had suffered your feelings
and conduct on the occasion have been the reverse 
mine your character i thank god is all beings the
most opposite to that bethlem gabor
at length you filled up the measure the various
thwarting with which you daily insulted me there was
travels st leon 
one native hungary between whom and me there subsisted
an open and eternal war i relate in no human ear
the cause my animosity to that man suffice it that it
was deep immeasurable inexpiable with a refinement 
cruelty and insult difficult to conceive you chose that man
for one the objects your beneficence would i consent
to see my name joined in pension list with my mortal
enemy the injury you inflicted on me would have been
less if you had stabbed me to the heart less that
would have been a blessing i impose on myself the task
 living for my revenge but never shall i deem that man
my foe who should rid me all this tumult passions
and this insupportable load existence together
you have heard my motives you may wonder at you
you may censure them but they are human i have
nothing further to say to you now you have no need to
recur to expostulation expostulation never moved the
heart bethlem gabor hereafter you shall hear more 
thus speaking he left me and i must confess with
whatever disgrace to my sagacity he opened upon me a
new world i conceived not till now the faintest suspicion
 what had been labouring in his bosom amidst
ah my experience the varieties human character this
was a species that had never fallen under my observation
before what a painful and mortifying occurrence is it
in human life when we have lived with a man from day today
when we have conversed with him familiarly and seen
him in all the changes circumstance and when we
flatter ourselves we have penetrated all the recesses his
heart suddenly to start upon something portentous that
brooded there which to that moment we had not the
lightest suspicion i am not the only individual to whom
this event has occurred
in a subsequent visit bethlem gabor to my cell for
he only attended me with provisions he would intrust the
secret my confinement to no other mortal i intreated
him to inform me with what intention he retained me a
prisoner and to fix a price on my ransom to this overture
he appeared to yield some degree attention he
made no explicit answer but asked with an inquisitive and
js b
 travels op st leon
severe tone in what manner i imagined i could procure
money in my dungeon 
let us agree upon the terms and set me at large you
have never found me deceitful and you shall not find me
deceitful now
f do not hope i will consent to that i ask you again
in what manner do you imagine you can procure money in
your dungeon 
i reflected for a moment liberty is ineffably sweet 
and whatever followed upon the present overture i was
determined not to neglect the faintest prospect that led to a
termination my confinement
there is answered i in my mansion at buda a
chest which if it can be brought to me hither will enable
me to supply your demands i have the key in my custody
and no key but my own will unlock the treasure
give me the key replied bethlem gabor
no rejoined i it is in my custody it is not upon
my person i have taken care that no human hand
shall touch it but my own
and how can i cause this chest to be brought to you
without risking a discovery your situation or that i had
a concern in your disappearance 
 that said i judge for yourself i have made
a proposition to you and i have done enough i will have
no share in the detail qf its execution
well said bethlem gabor after having ruminated
a moment the chest you shall have i undertake that
describe it
i described the chest and its situation in my house
with a minuteness that made mistake impossible
after a considerable time it was brought to me it was too
bulky and ponderous to be introduced into my cell by a single
arm but bethlem gabor having first caused me unconsciously
to swallow a powerful opiate found no difficulty
either to conceal my person in the dark shadows this ragged
subterranean or to cause some his followers to place
the chest within my reach believing that they placed it ina
vacant apartment i awoke and found it at hand i was
secure that the lock was such a one as could not be forced 
travels st leon
but i examined the different surfaces to see whether violence
 any other sort had been exercised on it there were
marks damage but not sufficiently unequivocal to enable
me to form a certain judgment on this point the chest
contained not gold but the implements for making and
fashioning gold allowing for the distance from which it
was brought they appeared to be pretty exactly in the state
in which i left them i had never placed much confidence
in this expedient for softening the heart bethlem gabor 
but i perceived that it would serve at worst to divert my
thoughts and by exciting in me some share expectation
might call off my attention from the miseries my present
condition embracing the occasions when i was most
secure against the intrusion my jailor i provided myself
with the sum that had been previously agreed on between
us my task being finished i carefully displayed the produce
 my labour against the next time bethlem gabor
should visit my cell he viewed it with an air sullen
and gloomy triumph he removed it from the cave which
was my habitation to an apartment this subterraneous
abode little distant from my own when he had concluded
this employment it seemed to be a just inference
that he was to give me my liberty he did no such thing
without uttering a word he closed the door my cavern
locked it and departed
when bethlem gabor next entered my cell i reproached
him with this as with the breach a solemn engagement
his first answer was an infernal laugh expressive 
derision hardheartiness and contempt by and by
however he condescended to explain himself more fully
i made no engagement cried he you talked a
ransom and i suffered you to talk i made you no answer 
i gave you no encouragement boy i deceived you not 
no though my heart pants for vengeance and for misery
i will never be guilty treachery i will break no engagements
 i am a knight and a soldier you have given
me ten thousand ducats what are ten thousand ducats tome
 do you think i am uninformed your secret i
opened your chest i found no gold its contents were
crucibles minerals chemical preparations and the tools 
e e 
 travels op st leon
an artist you are possessed the grand arcanum the
philosopher's stone if i had a doubt it before the
transaction yesterday converted conjecture into certainty
and did you suppose idiot driveller that you are that i
would take ten thousand ducats in commutation for wealth
inexhaustible no you are my prisoner and may choose
in this infallible dilemma whether you will remain my
slave to supply me daily resources as i shall daily think
proper to demand or at once make over to me your whole
mystery and place me in this respect on a level with
yourself
it was now my part to be peremptory and firm
 i refuse said i every part your dilemma and
all that you can propose to me do you talk my remaining
your slave to supply you with daily resources 
do you imagine that shut up in this dungeon i will
nevertheless labour for your gratification do you believe
that that gift which i received as the instrument my
own happiness and the benefit mankind shall be made
the pledge my perpetual imprisonment 
f with regard to imparting to you the secret you suppose
me to possess i answer without hesitation that dearly as
i prize liberty and numerous as are the motives you may
think i have to prize it i will not purchase my liberty at
that rate i would rather spend the days eternity in
this cavern than comply with your proposal the gift 
the philosopher's stone the moment a man possesses it
purifies his mind from sordid and ignoble inducements
the endowment which raises him so much above his
species makes him glory in his superiority and cherish his
innocence he cannot if he would mingle in the low
passions and pursuits the generality mankind for
myself i value too much the verdict my own heart ever
to allow myself to be influenced in the main concerns 
my existence by menaces and compulsion beside this
gift i received for holy and beneficent purposes to such
it is consecrated and if i ever impart it i must select its
depository with all the assiduity and penetration it is practicable
for me to exert you i will henceforth benefit no
more you hate me my disapprobation you is fixed
travels op st leon 
and irrevocable i weep to think how much i have been
deceived in you i weep to think how many high and
heroic qualities in your abreast are now converted into
malignity and venom you the possessor the philosopher's
stone you tell me the sole pursuit the rest 
your life is revenge and human misery what an image
do you raise in my mind if with such dispositions you
possessed the means which the acquisition riches inexhaustible
would confer on you and do you believe
that any consideration on earth could induce me to realise
such an image 
as you please replied bethlem gabor indignantly
i have nothing to propose to you think you that
either as my enemy or my slave and i hold you for both
i would descend to negotiate with you i simply told
you your situation yours be the consequences your
wilfulness and folly 
ff one mistake however that i see you make respecting
my purposes i will remove you seem to suppose that if
you were to communicate to me your secret i would then
set you at liberty no by heavens this cavern is your
abode for ever you shall never go forth from it alive 
and when you are dead here your flesh shall moulder and
your skeleton shall rest as long as the world remains
look round your walls enter fully into possession 
your final home i know that to keep you here and alive
my prisoner i must in a certain sense imprison myself
but at that i do not murmur i shall have the gratification
 beholding my foe and seeing him daily wither in
disappointment you wish to be a father to the human
race and i shall deem the scope my misanthropy almost
satisfied while in your restraint i image myself as making
the human race an orphan never shall bethlem gabor
set at large a man your unnatural and gallless disposition
and your powers for the indulgence that disposition
sieur de chatillon i do not want your secret it
suffices that i know you possess it have i not yourself
in my keeping it will be more joy to me rudely to issue
my commands and to see you complying with them in
spite the most heartfelt reluctance than to possess the
e e 
travels op st leon
richest gift on earth in the fullest independence think
you bethlem gabor incompetent to tame the tenant this
wretched cavern boy you are my prisoner you shall be
my creature i will humble you at my feet and teach you
to implore my bounty for the most miserable pittance
look to it you know your destiny do not provoke my
fury without a foresight the consequences 
i will enter into little further detail this my wretched
imprisonment in the wilds hungary it was not destitute
 its varieties and i could if i pleased fill a volume
with the artifices and the violence my gloomy superintendent
i could fill volumes with the detail the multiplied
expedients the furious menaces the gigantic starts
and rhapsodies passion by which he alternately urged
me to compliance and concession but i will not i will
bring to an the history bethlem gabor and then
having detailed the surprising events that immediately followed
it will close the page st leon's history for ever
i stood like a rock shut out from all other gratifications i
at least resolved to accumulate in my own person all the energies
 resistance if i were to unfold the story i could
command the reader's astonishment his admiration but the
object these papers is to record not my merits but my fate
how different was my imprisonment in the cavern the
manabhorring palatine from that which i had experienced
in the dungeons the inquisition there an inexorable
apathy prevailed my tyrants were indifferent whether i
died or lived filled with the sense their religious elevation
they held on the even gravity their course and
counted my groans and my tears neither for remorse nor
pleasure the variety i experienced in their dungeons was
the growth my own thoughts from without i encountered
no interruption it was not to be ascribed to those
who held me in durance if my faculties were not lethargic
into death bethlem gabor possessed no share their apathy
 his malice was ever alive his hatred ever ingenious
and new in its devices he had a purpose to answer to
extort from me the supply his necessities and projects it
was not so much perhaps that he stood in need this as
that he placed a pride in it and had fiercely resolved to show
travels st leon 
me that i was unreservedly his slave his animosity against
me was so fixed and insatiable that nothing that was pain
to me was indifferent to him if at any time he saw me
subsiding into insensibility he failed not to exert himself to
sting me into life again
the consequence this was somewhat different from
what bethlem gabor expected desponding as i was
weary life and almost finally alienated from the allotted
gift the philosopher's stone if he had left me to
myself i should very probably have sought in insensibility
relief from the torment my own thoughts but he
taught me a better lesson refusing me the indulgence 
torpor he obliged me to string myself to resistance he
gave me a passion he gave me an object he gave me comparative
happiness i was roused to opposition i was
resolved that placed as i seemed to be at his mercy i
would yield him no atom his desires thus employed
i found in my employment pride perpetual occasion presented
itself for fortitude and i gradually ascended to the
sweets consistency perseverance and selfgratulation i
had for years been inured to satisfy myself with a sparing
stock pleasures and i was less at a loss to expand and
ramify those which i now possessed than almost any other
man would have been in my situation if my attendant
train sensations was scanty bethlem gabor took care to
afford them a perpetual supply food and employment
and i was comparatively little exposed to the pain 
vacuity when he saw that i was inflexible and that he
could no longer gain from me the smallest compliance with
his will he raged against me with terrifying fury was ita
crime in me that this fury in my tyrant produced the
operation a sedative and a cordial there was no malignity
in the joy it gave me i had much aversion for
bethlem gabor but no hatred i took no pleasure in his
agonies because they were agonies my sympathies towards
him now i confess were small but the joy i felt was
because his fury told me was the unwilling evidence my
own value i left him to assail the mound i opposed to his
desires as he pleased it remained strong and unaffected
as the seabeaten promontory from the inefficacy his
e e 
 travels st leon
efforts i sometimes took occasion to remonstrate with my
jailor and demand the restoration my liberty but
bethlem gabor was not a man whom arguments and expostulations
like these could move in spite himself
however i commanded his wonder if not his esteem he
regarded the contrast as almost incredible between the
boyaspect under which he saw me and the inflexibility
and resources my timeinstructed mind
the contentment that i have here described in myself
was however a creature the imagination the forced progeny
 uncommon effort it was no natural state the
soul my mind would sometimes wander beyond the
limits my cavern and remember that there were other
persons beside bethlem gabor and myself in the world
i recollected the situation in which i had left my great
project for the reviviscence hungary and rejoiced to
remember that it was already in such forwardness as i
hoped no longer to stand in absolute need my assistance
yet what i had done was but a small portion a dismembered
branch what i had meditated to do and what
every person a generous and enterprising mind who
had been in possession the philosopher's stone would
have designed why was i thus stopped in the commencement
 a career so auspiciously begun and to which
an ardent fancy would prescribe no limits why was
every power the social constitution every caprice the
multitude every insidious project the noble thus instantly
in arms against so liberal and grand an undertaking
 nor could i help repining at the perverseness 
tiny fate which had decreed that i should savour all the
bitterness incidentally resulting from my plan and not be
permitted so much as to taste the applause and reward that
ought to grow out its completion thousands men
were at this instant indebted to my generosity and exertions
for every blessing they enjoyed and i was cast forth
as the refuse the earth pining under the alternate succession
 solitude negligence and malice my very existence
and the manner it unknown except to one
individual who had from the strangest and most unexpected
motives sworn eternal hostility to me
travels st leon 
bethlem gabor had resolved that so long as he lived i
should remain a prisoner when he died if he continued
my only jailor the single individual acquainted with the
place my confinement the probable issue was that i
should perish with hunger twelve years before i should
have contemplated this attitude and condition existence
with indescribable horror but within that time i had
been better taught i had received an education i thank
them in the dungeons the spanish inquisition and if
that be properly considered it will not be wondered at that
i was superior to ordinary terrors early in my present
situation the presentiment had suggested itself to me that
by some striking event i should be rescued from my
present confinement and improbable as the suggestion
was it made an indelible impression on my mind i had originated
in or it had produced a dream the scenes which
had appeared particularly luminous and vivid i imagined
i saw a knight cased complete in proof enter my prison
a smile angelic kindness beamed on his countenance
he embraced me with ardour he made a sign to me to
follow him i felt that i had seen him somewhere that
he had been my intimate friend yet all the efforts i made
in sleep or afterwards when i was awake were unavailing
to remove the mystery that hung upon his features i
rose to obey him the ground trembled under my feet like
an earthquake presently with the incoherency usually
attendant on a dream the figure changed to that a female
 unblemished grace and beauty it unfolded a pair 
radiant wings we ascended together in the air i looked
down and saw the castle bethlem gabor a prey to devouring
flames here ended my dream i soon felt that
i could reason myself out all confidence in the presages
 this wild and incongruous vision but i refused to doit
my consolations were not so plenteous in this frightful
solitude as that i should willingly part with one so delicious
reason thus applied i contemplated as an abhorred
intruder it was for a long time part my
occupation in every day to ruminate on this vision not
with the sternness a syllogist bat with the colouring 
a painter and the rapture a bard from thus obsti
 travels op st leon
namely dwelling on it in the day it happened that it became
again and again and again my vision the night slumbers
like these were truly refreshing and armed and nerved me
for the contentions my tyrant sacred and adorable
power fancy that can thus purify and irradiate the
damps a dungeon and extract from midnight glooms
and impervious darkness perceptions more lovely and inspiriting
than noontide splendour 
chapter xlii
i had now continued here for several months and in all
that time had received no external impressions but such as
related to the cell i inhabited and the misanthropical savage
by whom it was visited one evening that bethlem gabor
entered my dungeon i observed in him an air unusual
disturbance where apathy reigns the intercourse between
those over whom it presides will be marked with a deathlike
uniformity but wherever the furious passions take
their turn they will occasionally subside into a semblance
 familiarity and benevolence there was something in
the countenance my tyrant that made me for a moment
forget the complicated injuries i had received from him
what is it that has disturbed you cried i there was
no answer there was a knitting in his brow and a contraction
in his features that showed me his silence was an
effort he departed however and had already passed the
threshold my dungeon the door was in his hand he
returned chatillon said he perhaps you will never
see me more 
my castle is besieged i have passed through dangers
 a thousand names and i ought not to be made serious
by that which now assails me but a gloomy presentiment
hangs upon my mind the busy phantom life has
lasted too long and i am sick at heart in the worst event
i will not be made a prisoner i will die fighting
f i feel as if this were the last day my existence and
upon the brink the grave animosity and ferociousness
travels op st leon 
die away in my soul in this solemn moment my original
character returns here striking his heart to take possession
 its native home a character stern and serious if you
will hut not sanguinary not cruel not treacherous or unjust
between you and me there is a deadly antipathy 
but you did not make yourself you intended me friendship
and advantage the sufferings you have experienced from
me in return have been sufficiently severe if i die defending
my walls and you remain thus you will perish
with hunger i had intended it should be so but i am
now willing to remit this part your fate i will enter
into a compromise with you i will trust to your fidelity
and your honour i will take off your chains i will
bring you a timepiece and torches i will leave with you
the key the spring lock your cavern provided you
will engage your word to me that you will not attempt to
make use your advantages till the expiration twentyfour
hours
to these terms i assented without hesitation the chains
fell from my wrists and my ancles i stood up once more
unshackled and in respect my limbs a free man when
bethlem gabor was on the point to depart my soul melted
within me i took hold his hand my fingers trembled
i grasped and pressed the fingers my tyrant i cannot
describe what then passed in my bosom no man can
understand my sensations who had not been in my situation
who had not passed through a treatment arbitrary
ferocious and inhuman and had not then seen the being
who had wounded him so unpardonably suddenly changing
his character commiserating his fate and rescuing him
from destruction
from this time i saw bethlem gabor no more he died
as he had sworn to do in the last dike his fortress
his selfbalanced and mighty soul could not submit to the
condition a prisoner he was nothing if he were not
free as the air and wild as the winds i may be mistaken
 but this appears to me to have been a great and
admirable man he had within him all the ingredients 
sublimity and surely the ingredients sublimity are the
materials heroic virtue i have much cause com
 travels op st leon 
plaint against him he conceived towards me an animosity
the most barbarous and unprovoked but in writing this
narrative i have placed my pride in controlling the suggestions
 resentment and i have endeavoured to do him
justice
i had engaged to wait twentyfour hours i waited only
six i know not how the reader will decide upon the morality
 my conduct but i own i had not the force i believe
i may call it the insensibility to remain in my dungeon
any longer there was no doubt that if bethlem gabor
returned a conqueror the term my imprisonment would
be renewed and all his former menaces continued in force
what should i deserve to have thought me if i could
sit down idly and tamely wait the return my jailor
no liberty is one the rights that i put on when i put
on the form a man and no event is power to dissolve
or abdicate that right what validity was the promise
that bethlem gabor extorted from me by compulsion and
as the condition that which he had no title to withhold 
what gratitude did i owe to this man who treated me with
every contumely and shrunk from nothing bul the thought
 causing me to perish with hunger whatever became
 my attempt to escape i could at least in this vast subterranean
hide myself from the face him who had injured
me i had a provision phosphorus in my chest 
and could therefore extinguish my torch upon the slightest
alarm and relume it at pleasure what was the value 
life situated as i was situated it was better to perish in
the attempt to escape than linger on for ever in perpetual
imprisonment as a further resource i left a billet in my
dungeon for for this also i had implements intreating
bethlem gabor by every motive compassion and humanity
to provide for me the means sustenance as usual
having taken these precautions i lighted a fresh torch 
and unlocking the door and thrusting the key into my
girdle set out upon my expedition though bethlem
gabor had stipulated for twentyfour hours the siege might
even now be over and i trembled every instant lest my
jailor should return
i wandered for a considerable time among the alleys and
travels st leon 
windings this immeasurable cavern i had the precaution
to mark the sides the vault with characters and
tokens as i passed that if necessary i might be able to
find the way back to my dungeon this might prove an
indispensable resource to prevent me from perishing with
hunger once or twice i changed my route inferring
from a comparison circumstances the best i could make
that i was not in the direction the castle from which
bethlem gabor had led me to my imprisonment in all
this wandering i had seen nothing i had heard nothing
which could demonstrate to me that i was approaching the
habitation man i had groped my way for near two
hours when on a sudden i heard a loud and tremendous
shout that almost stunned me and that from its uncommon
shock could be at no great distance from the place
where i stood this was succeeded by a terrifying glare
 light i extinguished my torch both that i might be
better qualified to observe and that i might be less in
danger discovery by any one who should approach me
unawares the shouts were several times repeated the
light i found to proceed from that the vault towards
which i had been advancing and by the best conjectures i
could form i concluded the outlet into the castle to be at
no great distance i heard the crackling the flames
and the fall rafters and beams presently i discerned a
volume smoke approaching me and found that if i remained
long in my present station i should incur the risk
 being suffocated i formed my resolution i concluded
that bethlem gabor's castle was taken and set on fire by
the austrians i believed that my persecutor was already
no more to this faith i was undoubtedly prompted by the
presentiment which he had communicated to me i saw
that it would be impossible for me to emerge into light till
the flames should abate i once more therefore lighted
my torch and returned by the straightest road i could find
to my dungeon arrived there i proposed to pass the
interval quietly in the cavern where i had so long felt the
weight the hungarian's chains suddenly however the
suggestion occurred to me may not my conjectures be
false may not bethlem gabor yet repel the enemy and
 travels st leon
return to me from amidst the ruins his falling castle 
the thought was sickness and extinction to my heart
hope beautiful as are thy visions in how much anguish
and agony do they clothe the terrors disappointment 
never had bethlem gabor been half so dreadful to me as
now i shrunk away i took with me the fragments
 provision that yet remained i hid myself i deemed
no cell remote enough to conceal me from the inhuman
persecution my tyrant
i continued in the subterranean all that day and all the
succeeding night once in this period i attempted to reconnoitre
the avenue my escape but i found the situation
still so heated and suffocating that i did not venture to
proceed at length i came forth from this den horrors
and again beheld the light the sun the path had
already been sufficiently explored by me and i no longer
found any material obstacles i now saw that my conjectures
were true the castle my ferocious adversary was
a pile ruins the walls indeed for the most part remained
but choked with fragments the falling edifice
blackened with the flames and penetrated in every direction
by the light day with difficulty i climbed over
the ruins which opposed my egress from the subterranean
and rendered my passage to the outside the castle an
affair peril and caution here the first object that
struck me was some tents probably the soldiers who
had been employed in this work destruction i was
hailed by a sentinel and i demanded that he would conduct
me to his commander he led me to the centre 
the little encampment and i stood in the presence his
chief i lifted my eye to behold him and was petrified
with such astonishment as till that hour i had never felt
it was charles my son my only son the darling his
mother the idol my soul 
chapter xliii
it may seem extraordinary that i should instantly have
known him he was sitting at a table covered with
travels st leon 
papers and with one or two aidesdecamp waiting to receive
his orders he was clothed in complete armour
and his casque was resting on the ground by his side
when i entered his eye was fixed on a despatch that day
received from the great palatine hungary but in little
more than a minute he raised his head and his countenance
was completely presented to my view it was
fifteen years since i had beheld it he was then scarcely
above half his present age a mere stripling in whom the
first blush manhood had awakened the sentiment independence
and an honour impatient a shade he was
now a leader warlike bands his complexion olivet over
with service and his eye rendered steady with observation
and thought but i knew him j i knew him in a moment
my soul with the rapidity lightning told me who he
was not all the arts in the world could have hid him
from me not all the tales that delusion ever framed could
have baffled me i could have challenged him against the
earth 
i have already had occasion to explain the complexity 
my feelings when after a long absence i visited the
heiresses the house st leon the sweets recognition
that transporting effervescence the mind where
the heart bounds to meet a kindred heart where emotions
and tears mingle in speechless encounter where all is
gazing love and strict embrace these pleasures were
denied me i stood stiff and motionless in the presence 
my child my heart might burst but it must not and it
could not communicate its feelings
after an instant's pause overwhelming sensation i
sunk back on myself and considered my own figure it
happened that exactly opposite to me in the tent my son
hung his armour and over the rest his polished shield in
which i saw my own person clearly reflected the youth
 my figure indeed was still visible but the hardships 
my dungeon had imprinted themselves in glaring characters
on my face my beard was neglected my hair was matted
and shaggy my complexion was a strong and deadly
yellow my appearance to a considerable degree told my
story without the need words charles enquired 
 travels st leon
those who brought me where they had found this wretched
and unhappy figure and was told that i had been seen a
few minutes before coming out from the ruins bethlem
gabor's castle he humanely and naturally concluded
that i was a victim on whom the tyrant had exercised his
ferocity and that i had been shut up in some dungeon 
the fortress it was impossible that any person above ground
in the castle should have come out alive from the operation
 the flames he commanded that i should be led to a
neighbouring tent and taken care after having been
refreshed with food and rest and attired with other apparel
he directed that i should be brought to him again
that he might hear my story
under these circumstances there was nothing for which
i was more anxious than that i might recruit myself and
shake off as quickly as possible the effects my confinement
cordials were brought me and i tasted them 
i bathed in a neighbouring stream one my son's attendants
removed my beard and arranged my hair i now
desired to be left alone that i might take some needful
repose i could not sleep but i reclined my limbs upon
a couch and began to collect my thoughts
i saw myself in one hour the sport the most complete
reverse fortune that could happen to a mortal i had
been the prisoner a cavern so wild and pathless as almost
to defy the utmost extent human sagacity to explore
its recesses from this cavern but for the sudden
and extraordinary event which had just occurred i could
never have come forth alive all sober calculation would
have taught me to expect that i should have remained
there chained up like a savage tiger in his cage as long as
bethlem gabor existed and that when he died i should
perish unheard unknown no creature that lived suspecting
my situation no lapse ages ever bringing to light my
dismal catastrophe the remorse and relenting bethlem
gabor towards me seemed so little to accord with any thing
that i had personally witnessed his habits and his mind
that even now i feel myself totally unable to account for it
as it was however i was once again free from the state
 an outlaw imprisoned for life i suddenly saw myself at
travels st leon 
large inspirited by the light the sun and refreshed by
his genial rays in the full possession youth and all its
faculties enabled to return amidst my clients buda or
to seek some new adventure in any corner the earth to
which my inclination led me there is no man however
overwhelmed with calamities however persecuted with endless
disappointment however disgusted with life and all its
specious allurements to whom so sudden and admirable a
change would not convey some portion elasticity and
joy
but there was one thought that entirely occupied me i
cannot describe how my soul yearned towards this my only
son the sentiment even now as i write is an oppression
i am scarcely able to sustain willingly most willingly
would i have traversed every region the globe if so i
might have discovered his unknown retreat and now suddenly
without the smallest effort on my part he was placed
before me his last solemn parting his abjuration my society
and intercourse for ever rose to my memory and gave
a zest inexpressible to our present encounter at the thought
that my son was in the neighbouring tent all earthly objects
beside faded from my mind and appeared uninteresting
and contemptible i instantly resolved to devote myself
to his service and to place all my enjoyment in the
contemplation his happiness and the secret consciousness
 promoting it he had if i may so express myself in
my own person forbidden me his presence in my now
altered figure i might disobey his injunction without fearing
his rebuke let not the reader condemn me that endowed
as i was with unlimited powers action i preferred
a single individual my own son to all the world
beside philanthropy is a godlike virtue and can never be
too loudly commended or too ardently enjoined but natural
affection winds itself in so many folds about the
heart and is the parent so complicated so various and
exquisite emotions that he who should attempt to divest
himself it will find that he is divesting himself all
that is most to be coveted in existence it is not a selfish
propensity en the contrary i will venture to affirm that
the generosity it breathes is its greatest charm beside in
 travels op st leon
my case i considered my own existence as blasted and i
could therefore find nothing better than to forget myself in
my son i had made a sufficient experiment the philosopher's
stone and all my experiments had miscarried my
latest trials in attempting to be the benefactor nations
and mankind not only had been themselves abortive but
contained in them shrewd indications that no similar plan
could ever succeed i therefore discarded for the present
at least all ambitious and comprehensive views and believed
that i ought to be well content if i could prove the
unknown benefactor the son marguerite de damville
i entered into a solemn engagement with myself that i
would forget and trample upon every personal concern and
be the victim and the sacrifice if need were the happiness
 my child dismissing my project becoming a
factor for the hungarian people i determined to lay aside
the name chatillon and cut off every indication that
might connect my present existence with that the rich
stranger buda one the advantages i possessed for
that purpose was that no creature in hungary had the
slightest suspicion that the sieur de chatillon had ever been
the prisoner bethlem gabor
having thus arranged my thoughts i now called for the
garments that had been assigned me they were supplied
me from the stock my son and when i had put them
on i overheard the attendants whispering to each other their
astonishment at the striking resemblance between their
master and myself when i came once more into the
tent their captain and stood as in the former instance
before his shield i did not wonder at their remark
the coincidence our features was so great that had we
passed through a strange place in each other's company i
should infallibly have been regarded as his younger brother
yet there was something marguerite in the countenance
 charles that i wanted when i recovered as in a short
time afterwards i did my vigour and health i was more
blooming than he but there was something graceful ingenuous
and prepossessing in his aspect which i could by no
means boast in an equal degree and which might have
carried him unhurt and honoured through the world we
travels st leon 
shall see some the effects this in what i shall presently
have occasion to relate
when my son required me to declare who i was i
told him as i had already determined to do that i was a
cadet the house aubigny in france that after having
passed through several other countries i had come into
poland withthe floating and half formed purpose entering
as a volunteer against the turk but that before my
plan was completely arranged having been led by my
juvenile ardour in a hunting party far within the frontier
 hungary i had been so unfortunate as to become a
prisoner to the troopers bethlem gabor i added that
when introduced to their chief i had given him so much
offence by the firmness my manner and my refusing to
comply with certain propositions he made me that he had
thrust me into a dungeon from which but for the gallant
exertions the present detachment i should never have
come out alive
charles heard my story with attention and interest he
called on me to resume my courage and my hopes and to
be confident that my sufferings were now at an he
told me that he was a frenchman as well as myself and
like myself had been a soldier fortune he felt he
said a powerful sympathy in my tale j there was something
in my countenance that irresistibly won his kindness and
if i would put myself under his protection he did not
doubt to be the means my future success he spoke
with great asperity bethlem gabor who as an
intrepid indefatigable and sanguinary partisan had been
the author greater mischiefs to the christian cause than
any the immediate servants the sultan constantinople
he congratulated himself that the same action that
had delivered the world from so murderous a renegado had
rendered him the preserver a youth so much enterprise
and worth as he doubted not i should prove he
said there was but one other man in hungary who
had been so effectual an enemy to the cause truth
and christianity as bethlem gabor the name this
man he understood was chatillon and he grieved to say
f f 
 travels st leon
that he bore the appellation a frenchman to the
eternal disgrace the nation that gave him birth he had
joined the turkish standard and by exertions difficult to
be comprehended had rescued the infidels from famine at
a time when but for his inauspicious interference buda
and perhaps every strong town in hungary were on the
point falling into the hands the christians it was
this same man who had revived the resources bethlem
gabor after they had once before by his own fortunate
exertions been routed out and whom i might therefore
in some sense consider as the author my calamities as
well as the inveterate foe christendom such a wretch
as this was scarcely entitled to the common benefit the
laws war and he would not answer for himself if cotillon
had fallen into his power to what extremity his holy
resentment against this degenerate fellowcountryman might
have hurried him providence however had overtaken him
in his impious career and he had fallen obscurely as he
had lived basely in a night skirmish with a party 
marauders from the austrian camp the reader may
believe that i did not a little rejoice that in announcing
myself a few moments before i had taken the name not
 chatillon but d'aubigny what i heard however
occasioned in me a profound reflection on the capriciousness
 honour and fame and the strange contrarieties with
which opposite prejudices cause the same action to be
viewed i could not repress the vehemence my emotions
while i was thus calumniated and vilified for actions
which i had firmly believed no malice could misrepresent
and fondly supposed that all sects and ages as far as their
record extended would agree to admire
in another point view the invective which my son
thus unconsciously poured in my ears had the effect 
making me regard with a more complacent satisfaction the
plan i had formed devoting myself to his service here
i pursued no delusive meteor fame the very essence 
my project lay in its obscurity kings and prelates armies
and churches would no longer find an interest in disputing
about my measures i should indulge the secret promptings
 my soul undisturbed alike by the censure the
travels st leon 
world and its applause it was thus that under every
change fortune i continued to soothe my soul with delusive
dreams
meanwhile my project went on with the happiest auspices
the friendship between me and charles continued
hourly to increase as a frenchman whom chance had
introduced to his acquaintance in a distant country it was
natural that he should feel a strong bias affection towards
me but that sort fraternal resemblance which the most
inattentive spectator remarked in us operated forcibly to the
increase charles's attachment he would often in the
ingenuous opening his soul towards me call me his
brother and swear that i should for ever experience from
him a brother's love charles had by this time completed
the thirtysecond year his age i was in appearance at
least ten years younger than he there is something in
this degree disparity that greatly contributes to the cultivation
 kindness and is adapted to the engendering a
thousand interesting sentiments frequently would he exclaim
 our fortunes my dear henry that was the name i
assumed have been in a considerable degree similar we
were both us early cast on the world i indeed at the
immature age seventeen i entered the world without
an adviser or a friend but my destiny was favourable and
i escaped its quicksands and its rocks i have now by a
concurrence happy circumstances obtained a place among
honourable men and soldiers and for what is to come may
reasonably regard myself with some degree confidence
you are yet in one the most dangerous periods human
life your work is all to do your battles are yet to fight
suffer me my dear friend to represent your better genius
and act an elder brother's part you shall find me no
ignorant mentor and no ungentle one
nothing could be more gratifying to me than to see the
shoots affection thus springing up spontaneously in
charles's bosom i willingly humoured the generous deception
that he was putting on himself and heard with
transports inconceivable his assurances kindness and protection
we rode and we walked together we were in a
manner inseparable when he went out to reconnoitre i
f f 
 travels st leon
was his chosen companion when he inspected the discipline
and condition his soldiers he applied that opportunity
to initiate me in the science war when he expected to
encounter the enemy he placed me immediately by his side
sometimes he would open his heart to me and dwell
with a melancholy delight upon his secret sorrows fc it is
no wonder my henry he would say that i feel this uncommon
attachment to you i am alone in the world i
have no father no mother and no brethren i am an
exile from my country and cut off for ever from those 
my own lineage and blood it is with inexpressible delight
that i thus cheat the malice my fate and hold you to
my bosom as if you were indeed my brother i would not
part with the fiction for the mines peru and i know
not whether i do not cultivate it more assiduously and regard
it with a sentiment more anxiety and zeal because
it is a fiction than i should do if it were a reality i had
indeed added charles a mother and when he had
started this theme he would dwell for ever on her praises
i easily saw that never son loved a mother more cordially
than charles loved the allaccomplished marguerite with
what sentiments did i hear her eulogium i could not join
in her praises i could not be supposed to know her i
stood there as the statue prometheus might have done
if after being informed with a living soul the gods had
seen fit to chain its limbs in everlasting marble the passion
within me panted and laboured for a vent but i was
invincibly silent with what sentiments did i hear her
eulogium every word it was a dagger to my heart 
every word said and thou villain wert not thou her
murderer more painfully than the fiercest reproaches
could have done
when charles had celebrated with an eloquence truly
divine this incomparable mother a sudden pang memory
would make him start into rage and this mother i
left this mother i cannot tell whether she is alive or
dead what shall i say the crime or the not less fatal
error my father separated me from this mother i
loved my father i loved him because he was my father 
i had great obligations to him he once had virtues but
travels op st leon
my mother if i could have found her in the wildest
desert africa and have known her virtues a stranger
to my blood descended from the remotest tribe the human
race i should have chosen her for my friend my
preceptress and my guide beyond all that youth and beauty
with their most radiant charms could tender to my acceptance
 
thus unconsciously yet ingeniously did my dear son
from time to time torture his father's heart i could not
even deliver him from the gloomy and wretched uncertainty
whether this mother were alive or dead with one
word i could have composed his soul into a sober grief i
could have said your adorable mother at length rests from
her sorrows she is no longer the victim a misguided
and a cruel father you have no longer occasion to brood
over that most disconsolate reflections i know not what
anguish may be at this moment suffered by her who is entitled
to all my duty and all my affection with one
word i might have told this and that word i dared not
utter
chapter xliv
my son related to me his history and made me the depository
 his feelings and reflections the name st
leon indeed never passed his lips i felt that he had consigned
that to inviolable oblivion the appellation he bore
in the army was the chevalier de damville soon after he
abandoned me at dresden he had entered as a volunteer
in the imperial army charles the fifth was at that time
assembling forces to encounter the confederates the
league alcalde in this situation my son was eminently
fortunate he was distinguished for uncommon
enterprise and courage in some the first actions the
war and early attracted the notice gianbattista caswaldo
count piadena who held an eminent command
under the emperor in this army my son was a party to
f f 
 travels st leon
the decisive battle muhlberg in april four years
afterwards castaldo was appointed commander in chief
against the turks in hungary and the french chevalier
accompanied his patron to this new scene military enterprise
charles had felt dissatisfied with the grounds and
motives war between the catholics and protestants 
germany men worshipping the same saviour and appealing
to the same authorities but many them at least
from the most upright and ingenuous scruples differing in
their interpretation those authorities but in their contentions
between the crescent and the cross he entered
with unbounded enthusiasm into all the feelings that constitute
a champion or a martyr he conceived that whatever
was dear to the human race in this world or the next
hung on the issue he regarded the grandeur the cause
as purifying his efforts and consecrating his name and
when he lifted his sword in vindication an expiring
god he felt himself steeled with more than mortal energy
my son dwelt on the merits his patron with a degree
 veneration and love that knew no bounds castaldo
was ranked by the consenting voice mankind with the
most accomplished generals the age in which he lived i
knew him said charles in his most private hours and
stood next to and observed him in the greatest and most
critical occasions his life it was the least his merits
that he distinguished me that he took me up friendless and
an orphan that under every circumstance he was more
than a father to me that he corrected my faults that he
guided me with his advice that he instructed me with his
wisdom and supported me by his countenance castaldo
was the most persevering and indefatigable mankind no
difficulties could undermine his apparent serenity no accumulation
 dangers could appal or perplex him victory
never robbed him his caution misfortune and
defeat never destroyed th grandeur and elasticity his
soul i firmly believe that no general had ever a more discouraging
variety counteractions to struggle with the
enemy was barbarous and sanguinary yet firm and undismayed
in the full vigour their political health under
the rule the ablest their sovereigns the nobles 
travels st leon 
the country castaldo had to defend had almost all them
been alienated one after another by the tricking and illjudged
politics the house austria the nation was
ruined houseless and starving many the officers who
served under my general were the basest poltroons but
they were imposed upon him by his court he was compelled
to place them in important trusts and even when
in the most dastardly way they betrayed those trusts they
were by some pitiful intrigue sheltered from his discipline
and his justice the forces castaldo were mutinous
and ungovernable and he was almost constantly denied
the funds requisite for their pay
f for two years the count piadena struggled with these
complicated difficulties when he had obtained a hardearned
advantage at one extremity the kingdom he
found it rendered useless by some treachery or incapacity
in the other extremity which it was instantly necessary he
should hasten to repair he quelled four alarming mutinies
by his firmness his resources and the prudent combination
 his calmness and seventy in the midst one his
most arduous situations he suddenly received intelligence
that the states hungary which were at that time assembled
were debating whether they should enter into a treaty
with solyman for the purpose placing their country
under the turkish sceptre he immediately flew to the
place council the decision in favour solyman was
drawn up and ready to be adopted but castaldo by his
presence his authority and his eloquence recalled the
states to their duty and prevented them from eternally
staining the christian name surrounded with these difficulties
opposed to an enemy many times more numerous
than the forces he could bring against them and whose
wants were all plentifully supplied castaldo by his single
abilities kept the balance even or rather caused it to incline
in favour the christian scale but what added charles
avails the most consummate merit how may the most
incessant and undaunted exertions be shadowed by the veil
 obscurity the world judges by events success is
necessary to procure the palm fame after two years
 such labours as i witnessed and glory to describe a mutravels
 st leox
tiny broke out among the mercenary troops more formidable
than any that preceded it was no longer even in the
abilities castaldo to quell we honour and respect you
said the mutineers but we will no more serve without
pay we have been baffled two years we will march to the
gates vienna and demand from ferdinand our sovereign
why we are thus denied the arrears that are due tous
they chose leaders for this expedition among themselves
the great castaldo whose peculiar talent it is to
accommodate himself to events and never by any misfortune
to be deprived his invention arid resources saw
what it was that became him having in vain tried every
method for retaining his troops in hungary he offered
himself to lead them to vienna then was seen the true
ascendancy a noble mind goaded with want and distress
they had been deaf to the remonstrances their
general when he sought to direct them against the enemy
but when they saw him submitting himself to their rage
and impatience and fearlessly intrusting his safety to
those who had before refused even to listen to him and
who had reason to fear his retribution as their accuser and
judge they were awed and speechless they almost repented
 their frenzy and were half determined to return
to their duty their remorse indeed was imperfect and
ineffectual but castaldo led this band mutineers
through the heart the kingdom with as many symptoms
 regularity modesty and order as if they had been
the best paid the promptest and most loyal army in the
world
my son spoke in terms the warmest enthusiasm 
the defence erlau in the period castaldo's last and
most arduous campaign against the turks in respect 
fortifications the town was scarcely competent to resist the
feeblest enemy but its deficiency in this point was supplied
by the constancy and valour its garrison and inhabitants
the very women displayed an enterprise that
the more vigorous sex have seldom exhibited jn one instance
a heroine this sort was seen fighting in the presence
 her mother and her husband her husband fell
dead by her side let us my daughter said the motravels
 st leon
ther remove the body and devote the rest our care to
its honourable funeral may god returned the impassioned
widow e never suffer the earth to cover my husband's
corse till his death has been amply revenged this
is the hour battle not a time for funeral and for tears 
so speaking and seizing the sword and shield the
breathless champion she rushed upon the enemy nor did
she quit the breach till by the slaughter three turks
who were ascending the scaling ladders she had appeased
the fury in her breast and the ghost her departed husband
then raising the corpse and pressing it to her
bosom she drew it to the great church the city and
paid to it the last honours with all possible magnificence
many other examples a heroism not inferior to this
were displayed on the same occasion and shall i
added charles in a sally glorious enthusiasm ever
desert a cause which has been thus honoured shall i
betray a soil which has been immortalised by such illustrious
actions shall i join myself to the renegade bethhem
gabor and the execrable chatillon no such virtue
as i have described never could have been conceived
but in the bosom truth great as is the pious devotion
i feel for that god who died on the cross for the salvation
 mankind i own my weakness if it be a weakness his
cause is scarcely less endeared to me by the sublime exertions
 his heroic followers than by his own adorable
condescension and mercy
when the glorious castaldo departed with his rebellious

midst my anxieties but which i had not the courage to
mention this said he is your genuine sphere you

your happier destiny the count piadena bestowed
me so he was pleased to express himself upon nadasti
the great palatine the realm as the most precious pledge
 his friendship that it was in his power to confer
since the retreat castaldo the christian standard has
obtained little more either attention or aid from our
lawful sovereign now the possessor the imperial throne
ferdinand for a great part this time has had his negotiators
at constantinople whom the insulting turk has
condescended neither sincerely to treat with nor to dismiss
the christian army in hungary has been left to its own
resources but zeal has supplied the place magazines
and religious ardour has taught us to omit no occasion 
annoying and distressing the enemy the most considerable
occurrence this period has been the siege ziget about
four years ago solyman taking advantage certain factious
broils among our hereditary nobility appointed at that
time one his eunuchs bashaw buda and having
placed a numerous a numerous army under his command
dismissed him from the foot his throne with this arrogant
injunction not to enter the capital his province till he
had first sent the keys ziget as an offering to his royal
travels st leon 
master horatio the christian governor this fortification
is one the most accomplished and the bravest 
our native commanders and nadasti having sent him a
reinforcement the better to enable him to support the
threatened siege i was in the number the soldiers appointed
on this service the trenches were opened early
in june and the siege continued for the space seven
weeks the bashaw though an eunuch in person stunted
and monstrous deformity was distinguished for an uncommon
degree audacity and perseverance four times
he filled the dikes the fortification with wood and earth
and as often by means a furious sally the besieged
the materials which had thus with vast expence industry
and labour been accumulated were set fire to and consumed
on the twelfth day the siege he gained possession
 the town and drove us back into the citadel 
but on the day following we recovered the ground we had
lost and from that time the town was his no more the
actions these days were the severest the whole siege 
we fought the enemy street by street and inch by inch 
the great fountain in the marketplace ran with blood we
ascended hills the dead which the infidels opposed as a
barrier to our further progress i seized two turkish
standards and though wounded pursued the enemy
through the eastern gate and returned in triumph nafasti
in the sixth week the siege marched to our relief 
but he was met and worsted by the bashaw who returned
victorious to the foot the walls during the whole 
the siege mutual animosity was cherished by every species
 contrivance and the heads the distinguished dead
were exhibited on both sides as spectacles abhorrence
and terror the inflamed passions the combatants several
times found a vent in listed duels horatio the
governor killed in one these encounters a gigantic turk
who had sent a proud defiance to our host i procured
myself honour upon a similar occasion and the scarf
which i now wear composed the turban the infidel i
slew at length the disappointed bashaw was obliged to
raise the siege and he soon after died grief and mortification
in his palace at buda i confess i recollect the
 travels st leon
christian exploits in the defence ziget in which i also
had a share with rapture and delight they will serve to
awaken in me new animation when hereafter the coldness
 ordinary life might strike palsy to my soul i shall
never think i have lived in vain after having contributed
in however humble a place to arrest the career insolence
and impiety which under the standard the crescent
threatened to overrun the whole christian world
such were the adventures and such the sentiments the
gallant chevalier de damville i had been a warrior in my
youth and the discourse he held was sufficiently congenial
to my earliest propensities i saw indeed that he had
gained in the zeal a soldier the cross a source martial
heroism to which my military history had been a
stranger but though i could not entirely enter into this
sentiment his and indeed regarded it as an infatuation
and delusion i did not the less admire the grandeur soul
with which this heroic fable inspired him there was no
present propensity in my heart that led me to delight in
deeds blood and war i saw them in their genuine colours
without varnish or disguise i hated and loathed
them from my very inmost soul but notwithstanding this
i was sensible to the lustre which military zeal cast round
the character my son nor is this incredible or absurd 
the qualities a generous and enterprising champion are
truly admirable though the direction they have received
should be worthy eternal regret
charles de damville was my friend and when i say
this i cannot help stopping a moment for the indulgence
 reflecting on the contrast between my present intercourse
with my son and my late connection with bethlem gabor
i had sought the friendship the hungarian partisan
partly because i wanted a protector and an ally but partly
also because in my soul i looked up to and admired the
man i called bethlem gabor my friend i persuaded
myself that i had cogent reasons for calling him so but
there was little sympathy between us he was wrapped up
in his own contemplations he was withered by his own
calamities our souls scarcely touched in a single point
no no this is not friendship
travels st leon 
friendship is a necessity our nature the stimulating
and restless want every susceptible heart how wretched
an imposture in this point view does human life for the
most part appear with boyish eyes full sanguine
spirits and hope we look round us for a friend j we sink
into the grave broken down with years and infirmities and
still have not found the object our search we talk to
one man and he does not understand us we address ourselves
to another and we find him the unreal similitude
only what we believed him to be we ally ourselves to
a man intellect and worth upon further experience
we cannot deny him either these qualities but the more
we know each other the less we find resemblance he
is cold where we are warm j he is harsh where we are
melted into the tenderest sympathy what fills us with rapture
is regarded by him with indifference we finish with
a distant respect where we looked for a commingling soul
this is not friendship we know other men we have
viewed their countenances we have occasionally sat in their
society we believe it is impossible we should not find in
them the object we sought but disparity situation and
dissimilitude connections prove as effectual a barrier to
intimacy as if we were inhabitants different planets
it is one the most striking characteristics the nature
 man that we are eternally apt to grow dead and insensible
to the thing we have not half our faculties become
palsied before we are in the slightest degree aware that weare
not what we were and what we might be there are
philosophers who regard this as the peculiar privilege 
man a wise provision providence to render us contented
and easy with our lot in existence for my part
i do not envy and i have never aspired to the happiness
 ignorance and stupidity but be it a blessing or a
curse the phenomenon is undoubted present me with some
inestimable benefit that my nature fitted me to enjoy but
that my fortune has long denied me to partake and i instantly
rise as from an oppressive lethargy before it maybe
i felt myself uneasy but i knew no remedy i
dreamed it was my nature i did not put forth a finger for
relief but now that i have drawn the unexpected prize
 travels st leox
i grow astonished at my former blindness i become suddenly
sensible my powers and my worth the blood that
slept in my heart circulates and distends every vein i
tread on air i feel a calm yet ravishing delight i know
what kind an endowment life is to a being in whom
sentiment and affection are awakened to their genuine
action
this was the effect the mutual attachment produced
between me and charles i looked into him and saw a
man i saw expansive powers intellect and true sensibility
 heart to be esteemed and loved and protected by
such a man to have him to take one by the hand to enquire
into one's sorrows to interest himself in one's anxieties to
exult in one's good fortune and one's joys this and this
only deserves the name existence
i had however a painful drawback upon my satisfaction
it was my fate since the visit the stranger the lake 
constance to rejoice for moments and to lament for years
i could not at first ascend to that purity and eminence 
friendship to forget myself i could not but painfully feel
the contrast between me and my son how happy was
charles how respectable how selfapproving how cheerful
 heart i shall presently have occasion to speak a still
further addition to his happiness i looked indeed young
fair blooming a stranger to care but i had a secret worm
gnawing at my vitals this very deceitfulness my countenance
was a bitter aggravation to my remorse i never
saw my features reflected in the polished shield without
feeling myself struck to the core charles had walked
right onward in the paths honour he feared no detection
he had no secret consciousness that gave the lie to the voice
 applause partiality and friendship but i was all a lie 
i was no youth i was no man i was no member the
great community my species the past and the future
were equally a burthen to my thoughts to the eye that
saw me i was a youth flushed with hope and panting for
existence in my soul i knew and i only knew that i was
a worn out veteran battered with the storms life having
tried every thing and rejected every thing and discarded
for ever by hope and joy when i walked forth leaning
travels st leon 
on the arm him who delighted to call me his younger
brother this was the consciousness that hunted my steps
and blasted me with its aspect whichever way we turned
chapter xlv
among the various confidences reposed in me by my son
one was his love the object his attachment was a
young lady quality named pandora niece to nadasti
great palatine hungary in consequence the earnest
recommendation castaldoin nadasti had taken my
son under his particular protection and charles's principal
home at the periods when the army was dispersed in winterquarters
was at the palatine's house in the city presburg
here his manners had become more polished and his taste
more refined till then bred in tents and living amidst
the clangour arms he had been a mere soldier rough
generous manly and brave but nadasti was an elegant
scholar smitten with that ardent love classical and
ancient lore which has so eminently distinguished the sixteenth
century he assembled round him men letters
from various parts europe and under his auspices the
days matthias corvinus king hungary seemed to be
revived whose love literature was such that he kept three
hundred transcribers in his house constantly employed in
multiplying copies the precious relics roman and
athenian learning the consort nadasti was one the
most accomplished matrons the age in which she lived
and her three daughters were patterns every polite and
amiable accomplishment such was the school into which
the chevalier de damville entered at the age twentyfive
immediately after the retreat castaldo this may seem
an age somewhat late for newmodelling the character but
charles had an enterprising and aspiring temper and he
soon became a distinguished ornament courts and the
society ladies castaldo had taught him all he knew

the temper the manners and the science a military
chieftain the palace nadasti finished and completed the
education my son
pandora was only fourteen years age when charles de
damville first became a sort inmate the house her
uncle she at that time lived with her father but he
being afterwards killed in the battle which nadasti fought
for the relief ziget pandora occupied an apartment in
the palatine palace from the first hour he saw her a
mere child as it were accompanied by her governess charles
confessed to me that he had beheld her with eyes distinction
he had said to himself this little girl will hereafter
be a jewel worthy the crown an emperor he
had found something inexpressibly attractive in the starry
brightness her complexion her air he regarded as both
lighter and more graceful than any thing he had ever before
seen and her speaking and humid eye seemed to him the
very emblem sensibility and sweetness if at the girlish
and immature season fourteen he had ascribed to her all
these perfections it will easily be supposed that as she increased
in stature as the beauties form unfolded themselves
in her and she advanced in sentiment and a lovely
consciousness her worth the partiality charles became
more deep and unalterable but the orphan niece nafasti
was altogether without a portion and the great
palatine would have seen with more complacency the chevalier
de damville addressing his pretensions to one his
daughters
charles confessed to me that the passion he nourished
had been fruitful pleasures and griefs hope and perplexity
it was now almost a year since pandora and
himself had confessed a mutual affection the confession
had not been the result design on either side both had
wished to suppress it pandora from virgin dignity and
reserve and charles because he saw not how their affection
could be crowned with success and he dreaded more than
any misery to himself to be the author degradation and
misery to her he loved but what is ever uppermost in
the heart will at some time or other betray itself their
sympathetic and accordant feelings upon a point so deeply
travels op st leon 
interesting to both rendered them eagleeyed to discern
the smallest indications they had had a thousand opportunities
and a thousand opportunities had been resisted
they became more than usually silent and reserved towards
each other they shunned to meet and when they met
avoided each other's eyes one day a casual encounter ina
solitary retreat which each had sought principally with
intention to escape the presence the other had taken
them off their guard they were mutually hesitating and
perplexed each discerned more unequivocal indications
than had ever occurred before the state the other's
sentiments the entire accord snapped as it were at once
the chains reserve and each after a short interval 
hesitation spoke with an eloquence hitherto untried the
language love the difference years between them
gave a zest to the communication pandora seemed to be
throwing herself upon the protection an elder brother
 a guardian one in whose prudence she confided as the
antidote her inexperience charles felt his maturer years
as imposing on him more severely that sacred integrity the
obligation which at least as society is at present constituted
seems in the majority cases to grow out the
relative situation the sexes the protectorship the
one and the dependence the other
and now exclaimed charles what am i to do 
what am i to desire it would be affectation in me to
conceal from myself on an occasion like this that the reputation
i have acquired both in the arts peace and war
is such as to have caused nadasti to set his heart upon
my becoming his soninlaw the great palatine though
in many respects generous and liberal has that inflexibleness
 opinion which is perhaps more apt to grow up in
the hearts scholars than in other departments society
he is grave and solemn all his habits are a majestic
and lordly nature and i have small reason to hope that i
shall find him accessible to my representations he is little
subject to sallies passion his own propensities are wholly
under the control his judgment and it is not likely
that he will make allowance for the ardent affections 
other minds pandora is entirely dependent on him in
g o 
 travels st leon
any case the portion she would receive from him would he
very inadequate to her worth but discarded and discountenanced
by him who has the absolute rule christian
hungary what can she expect i am myself destitute 
fortune my provision as a soldier will be very inadequate
to the wants the first and softest her sex but even
 that provision nadasti will deprive me if i marry in
opposition to his pleasure shall i make pandora the inhabitant
 tents and encampments shall i expose her to
all the changes and hazards a military life shall i drag
her as the attendant a soldier fortune through every
climate europe no by heavens i should regard
myself as the most selfish and the basest mankind if i
could deliberate on such a question never shall the charmer
 my soul owe a single privation to her charles i love
her with so pure and entire a passion that i prefer her
prosperity to every earthly good nor is it merely necessary
to my attachment that she should live in plenty and ease 
i require that my pandora should be seen in her native
lustre that she should be surrounded with every appendage
due to her merit that she should command applause from
the mercenary and homage from the superficial her
praise is the only music i enjoy i could not bear to hear
her name coupled with levity and scorn i could not bear
that where she appeared every eye should not be turned
to her with reverence and honour my passion i confess
it is that a disciple liberal arts and a nobleman not
that an arcadian
the period the campaign now drew to an and
charles having requested me to accompany him set out
for his usual winter retreat in the city presburg i saw
pandora never in my life had i beheld any thing so
sweetly simple i had always been an admirer the sex 
but the perfections pandora were a nature that i had
not observed in any other woman her symmetry was so
perfect the pearly lustre her skin so admirable and her
form and carriage so light and ethereal that at first view it
was difficult to persuade one's self that she was framed 
the same gross materials as the rest the species she
seemed not constructed to endure the shocks the world
and the rude assaults ill humour or neglect censure or
travels st leon 
adversity her voice was the sweetest the clearest and
softest tone i ever heard there was a peculiar naivete in
her accents that riveted your soul in irresistible fetters
her conversation for in the sequel i enjoyed much her
conversation had a very uncommon zest she seemed to
have no art and what she uttered appeared as if wholly unchecked
by consideration or reserve you were persuaded
that she always delivered without restraint the first thing
that occurred to her mind yet in what she said there was
so much good sense so much true feeling and as the occasion
allowed so much whim and imagination that you could
not discover how any her words could be changed but
for a worse this circumstance strikingly contrasted with
the childish simplicity or rather the feminine softness and
sylphlike delicacy her manner and her tone the opposition
 appearance between her and my son made a
strong impression upon me he was a perfect soldier with
an ample chest broad shoulders and a figure though graceful
and well proportioned yet so strong that it seemed
framed to contend with and to conquer the wrestlers in the
grecian games his complexion shaded with luxuriant
curls manly hair was itself made brown with the rigours
 climate pandora was so heavenly fair so sweetly delicate
and slender that you would have thought she would be
withered and destroyed in his embrace like the frailest ornament
 the garden before the northern breeze but
courage to choose what is rugged and manlike is often characteristic
 the softest her sex
i speedily contracted an intimate commerce with the
beautiful pandora i was naturally desirous to be as consummate
a judge as possible those perfections which i
believed fated to determine the future happiness my son
when sufficiently satisfied in that respect i still continued
the indulgence and found a pure and exquisite pleasure in
the daily contemplation accomplishments that were to
prove the materials his gratification and delight whose
gratification i preferred to my own i had a still further
view in this commerce i was anxious to be perfectly informed
 the connections and family pandora that upon
them i might build a project i had deeply at heart beg

 travels st leon
stowing on her in the least questionable and exceptionable
manner a dowry that should place her upon an equality
with her cousins the daughters nadasti and deliver my
son from all apprehension the unpleasing consequences
to result from the resentment the great palatine nafasti
was opulent and the portions his daughters very
considerable and however inclined i could not exceed
this limit without risking the entire miscarriage my project
charles thought nothing too rich either in situation
or income to do honour to the mistress his soul but
separately from this enthusiastic sentiment both he and
pandora had too just a taste not to prefer the simple majesty
 ancient nobility to the expensive ostentations 
modern refinement
having digested my plan i was obliged to travel as far
as venice for the execution it the mother pandora
had been a venetian and the uncle her mother was one
 the adventurers who had sailed with pizarro for the conquest
 peru he had died before the completion that
business and had left behind him no relative so near to
him in blood as the lovely pandora by a singular piece
 good fortune i encountered at venice an individual who
had sailed in the same ship with the young lady's uncle
the uncle having died prematurely the share he might
otherwise have obtained the spoils peru was sunk in
the shares the rest and nothing was allowed to remain
that might have descended to his heirs his friend and
countryman i found though once rich with the booty he
made had by a series calamities before he reached his
native home been reduced to a state poverty the vicissitudes
he experienced had produced in him the effect
 a very uncommon eagerness for acquisition this man
i fixed on for my instrument i opened to him my plan
and offered him a very ample gratification provided he
acted successfully the part i assigned him in concert with
each other we digested and forged the various documents
that were best calculated to give credibility to the tale
having completed our arrangement i set out for presburg
without a moment's delay and directed my venetian not to
follow till after a stipulated interval he was not to enter
travels st leon 
into full possession his reward till he had completed the
task he had undertaken it was fixed that no person in
hungary should be acquainted with my visit to venice
but only be allowed to understand generally that i had been
engaged for a certain time in an excursion amusement
so hard is the fate the possessor the philosopher's
stone and so limited his power as to have rendered all
these precautions on my part indispensably necessary had
not the various circumstances concurred the detail which
is here stated the birth pandora's mother in a maritime
state the expedition pizarro to peru her uncle's engaging
in this expedition and dying before it was completed
and my own casual rencounter with his compagnon
du voyage my project would too probably have been baffled
a direct gift the fortune i designed would never have
been admitted and had not the coincidence been eminently
favourable even though i should have succeeded in
misleading every other party i could not hope to have
eluded the perspicacity and jealous honour my son
when i returned to presburg i again renewed my intercourse
with pandora the passion entertained by damville
for the beautiful orphan was a secret to every person
at court they had managed so discreetly as to have avoided
every hint suspicion and as it was universally known
that the great palatine had an eye on this gallant soldier for
one his daughters few persons entertained a doubt that
my son would speedily declare his election among the coheiresses
 nadasti on the other hand in the friendly
intercourse between me and pandora neither she nor myself
felt that there was any thing to conceal and it was
therefore a matter complete notoriety my blooming
youth appearance was remarked by the majority 
bystanders we were judged formed for each other and
before i was aware the beautiful hungarian was awarded
to me by the general voice as my destined bride when
however became acquainted with the rumour i was contented
to smile at it the consciousness in my own breast
how far the public sagacity had wandered in its guess gave
to that guess in my apprehension a certain air whimsical
and amusing
g q 
 travels st leon
chapter xl vi
such was the situation the affair pandora and i daily
looked for the arrival my venetian confederate when
suddenly i remarked an alteration in the carriage my
beautiful ally she had hitherto on all occasions sought
my conversation she now appeared sedulously to avoid
me her manner had been characterised by the gaiety
the sprightliness and general good humour incident to her
age and congenial to her disposition she was now melancholy
her melancholy assumed a tone correspondent
to the habits her mind and was peculiar and individual
it had an ingenuous and defenceless air inexpressibly calculated
to excite interest it seemed to ask what have i
done to deserve to be melancholy you felt for her as
for a spotless lily depressed by the unpitying storm you
saw that those enchanting features were never made for a
face sorrow and that that bewitching voice ought never
to have been modulated into an expression heaviness
i was in the highest degree anxious to learn the cause
 this revolution and was the farthest in the world from
suspecting its real foundation i pursued pandora with
so much importunity and demanded an interview with such
irresistible earnestness that she at length consented to grant
it we met in a remote part the garden why
henry said she do you thus persecute me you are
my evil genius the cause the greatest calamity that
could ever have overtaken me
i started for heaven's sake beautiful pandora what
do you mean 
i love the chevalier de damville i have loved him
long he is dearer to me than life and he has cast me off
for ever 
and am i the cause 
yes you and you alone i had for some time observed
a change in his behaviour that he was uncommonly
grave serious and reserved i endeavoured to soothe him
i redoubled my blandishments in our next season untravels
 st leon 
reserved discourse i tenderly enquired into the source 
his grief
for a long time he resisted my importunity at
length faithless girl said he have you the cruelty to
ask the meaning my depression this is the extremity
 insult is it not enough that i know your inconstancy
 is it not enough that i have found you like the
rest your frivolous sex the mere slave your sense 
sight regardless vows regardless an affection which
despised all interests but that tenderness and love
caught by the first appearance something younger softer
and more courtly than i pretend or desire to be will
nothing satisfy you but the confession my unhappiness
from my own mouth do you require expostulation intreaty
and despair from your discarded lover to fill up the
measure your triumph 
for a long time i was totally at a loss to apprehend
my dear chevalier's meaning
no continued he am not jealous there is no
temper i hold in such sovereign contempt as jealousy i
am not a disposition easily to conceive umbrage or
lightly to doubt the protestations the woman i adore i
have been blind too long but i see that you are eternally
together i see that you take advantage the distance at
which the despotic temper nadasti keeps us from each
other to give all your time to my favoured rival you
seem never to be happy out his society i was first led
to throw off the dulness my unsuspecting security by
the general voice the public the whole court gives you
to each other not a creature it holds but has discerned
that passion which you have the insolence to expect to
conceal from me since i have been awakened from my
security i have seen it a thousand times i have seen
your eyes seek and encounter each other i have seen
them suddenly lighted up by your interchanging glances
i have seen the signs your mutual intelligence i have
seen with what impatience the moment you could escape
from the crowded circle you have joined each other and
retired together ungenerous pandora
 but do not imagine i will enter the lists with the gaudy
 travels st leon
butterfly who has now attracted your favour i have told
you already that i am not formed for jealousy i am not
the sort man you have supposed me to be i have loved
you much i have loved you long but i would tear out
my heart from my manly breast if i believed it yet retained
an atom passion for you i know what it was
i loved i loved a character frankness ingenuousness
 simplicity which i fondly imagined was yours but
which i now find was the creature my own fancy
the pandora that stands before me the child art the
base wretch that could take advantage my forbearance in
regard to her uncle which was adopted purely out love
to her the unfeeling coquette that would wish to retain
me in her chains when she had discarded me from her
affections this creature i never did love and i never will
i know low deeply rooted the habit has been in my bosom
 regarding you as the thing you are not i know how
bitter it is to a temper like mine to detect so unlookedfor
a delusion i know what it will cost me to cast you off forever
but i never yet proposed to myself a conquest over
my own weakness that i did not gain nor will i now if
you were to discard this wretched d'aubigny tomorrow
if you were convinced and contrite for your error i
must ingenuously tell you no time no penitence could
restore you to my admiration i had set up an imaginary
idol in my bosom but you have convinced me its
littleness and dashed it to pieces
ff i endeavoured continued pandora by every imaginable
protestation to convince my late faithful lover his
mistake but it was to no purpose all i could say only
tended to swell the tide his fearful resentment
 be silent cried he add no further to the catalogue
 your wanton and causeless delusions do not
make me hate too much what i once so blindly and ardently
adored i feel that i have an enemy within me that would
fain cooperate with your deceptions and hypocrisy i
find that man treacherous to himself is formed by nature
to be the fool your artful sex but i will subdue this
propensity in me though i die for it i may be wretched 
but i will not despise myself have i not seen your falsetravels
 st leon 
hood have not all my senses been witnesses your
guilt the miracle is that i could have been duped so
long i have heard this stripling lover yours inexhaustible
in your praises and dwelling upon them with an ardour
that nothing but passion could have inspired i have
seen as i have already told you the intelligence your
eyes i have seen those melting glances i have heard
those tender and familiar tones between you that bespoke
the most perfect confidence and the most entire mingling 
heart if i did not believe this i should believe worse 
you i should think your heart not merely capricious but
an absolute prostitute j prepared to bestow upon hundreds
those sweet those nameless tenderness accent and
countenance which i fondly imagined were reserved forme
alone i should regard you as the worst and most pernicious
acquisition that could fall to the lot a man
 go pandora added he my heart is chaste my
soul is firm i can no longer be deceived by you i will
not dispute your charms with the idle boy you have now
thought proper to favour and saying thus he burst
from me in an agony impatience
ce alas continued the sweet and ingenuous pandora
my dear henry what shall i do how shall i remove
the unreasonable imaginations this noble mind bear
me witness heaven nothing could be more innocent than
the correspondence i allowed myself to hold with you my
adorable charles was continually calling you brother i
scarcely ever heard him speak you by any other appellation
i regarded charles as my husband i already viewed
you in anticipation as the brother my lord excluded
as i was from frequent conversation with him whom i most
loved i endeavoured to supply the deficiency by an unreserved
communication with you the extreme resemblance
 your persons increased my gratification you were his
picture his speaking image while i looked at you i
said e such once was my charles before he was the great
man the gallant soldier the accomplished cavalier the
adored object that now engrosses my affections beside i
knew that charles loved you as much as he did any man on
earth and that knowledge made you dear to me you
 travels st leon
were constantly eager to dwell upon and describe his excellences
 could i fail to be pleased with your conversation 
i own that the pleasure i took in it was unbounded and
the emotions it awakened in my affectionate heart delicious
but all this candidly explained was only an additional
proof the tenderness and constancy my earliest attachment

and now ever since the fatal day in which this conversation
passed with my charles he is absent from court
and i know not whither he is gone he has disdained to
seek any further explanation nor do i know how to appeal
to his calmer feelings and more deliberate mind one
thing however i had determined on and that was henry
strictly to avoid your society
i trust wherever my charles is he will hear this
i owe this expiation to his agonised feelings and to the
appearances that in some degree justify his misconstruction
i will wait patiently till the simplicity and singleness 
my conduct have cleared my faith if i should otherwise
have found pleasure and relief in your society i will make
a merit with myself sacrificing this to the apprehensive
delicacy my charles's mind in this single instance
your importunity has prevailed with me to dispense with
my rule you were not to blame and i thought upon more
mature reflection that i owed you an explanation but
henceforth if you have any kindness for me or value for
him who has acted and felt towards you like a brother i
must entreat you to cooperate with me in this and that
whether in public or private we may bestow no notice on
each other and avoid all opportunities communication
to persuade you to this was indeed a principal inducement
with me so far to deviate from the rule i had laid down to
myself as to admit this conversation
i was extremely affected with the unhappiness pandora
i exerted myself to console her i promised that
nothing on my part should be wanting to remove every
shadow doubt that hung upon her fidelity and i exhorted
her to believe that every thing would infallibly terminate
in the way most honourable arid gratifying to herself
pandora listened to me and dried her tears the contravels

sensation was interesting and soothing to us both we
regarded it as the last unreserved and sympathetic communication
we should ever have with each other it insensibly
grew longer and longer and we knew not how to put
an to it we were still in this state irresolution
when looking up i perceived charles danville approaching
from the further the walk that led to the alcove
i would have withdrawn i was anxious to remove the
unjust suspicion that hung upon his mind but the instant
that presented to him so strong an apparent confirmation 
them the instant that by so doing must have worked up his
soul into tumult did not appear a favourable one for explanation
to withdraw was impossible pandora had
discerned her lover at the same moment with myself she
was seized with a faintness she would have sunk to the
ground but i caught her in my arms i rested with one
knee on the earth her head was reclined on my bosom
charles approached with a quicker pace
 c rise said he this is beyond my hopes i left pres
burg with the purpose not revisiting it for years but
as i proceeded further and further from a place which had
lately been the centre my affections i began to doubt
whether i had not acted with precipitation and to believe
that there was yet some uncertainty hanging on my fate
the seemingly earnest protestations this delusive syren
rung in my ears mechanically without any formed resolution
i changed my course and returned on my steps
my doubts are now at an i find you taking instant
advantage my absence to throw yourselves into each
other's arms the feelings i so lately uttered in your presence
pandora would have kept you apart if my feelings
had been in the least sacred in your eyes if all my surmises
had not been too true he took by the hand the
weeping pandora and led her to the seat which a little
before she had quitted
why all this artifice why all this deceit it is said
that we are not masters our own hearts and that no
human passion is formed to endure for ever influenced
by these maxims i could have pardoned your inconstancy
too fair too fickle pandora but why strain every nerve
 travels op st leon
to make me believe you still retained a passion you had
discarded to subject me to the lingering torture deceit
instead communicating to me a truth agonising indeed
to human frailty but calculated to inspire fortitude and
decision this i cannot excuse this racks me with the
bitterest disappointments disappointment in the virtues
i had ascribed to you and convinces me that you are
neither worthy me nor worthy happiness
and you too d'aubigny you have acted a part in this
unworthy plot i rescued you from prison from a dungeon
from which a few hours before you had no hope 
coming forth alive i took you under my protection when
you had no friend i placed you next myself i conceived
for you the affection a brother loved you next in
degree to the mistress my soul in return for all that
i have done and all that i felt for you you have with
insidious heart and every base disguise seduced from me the
woman my choice why not frankly and ingenuously
have demanded her at my hands the heart is free 
your reciprocal passion though i might have regretted it
i should have been unable to blame it is the cloak that
you have drawn over it that proves the baseness its
origin do you think i had not the courage cheerfully
and without a murmur to resign to you this illustrious fair
one i feel that i was worthy to be openly treated had
i seen in you a mutual and ingenuous passion i would not
have been the bar to its just consummation i would not
have sought the person a woman whose heart in spite
perhaps her better resolutions was given to another i
should loathe myself for ever were i capable such a part
it was the sympathetic sentiment towards me beating in
accord to the sentiment my own bosom that i once saw
in pandora and not either her peerless beauties or the excellences
i imputed to her mind that formed the mastercharm
which fascinated my soul i feel that i had the
force in the negation my own happiness to have drawn
comfort and compensation from the happiness two creatures
i so dearly loved as d'aubigny and pandora
s
i sought to interrupt my son i could no longer bear to
see him involved in so painful an error and not exert every
nerve to rescue him from it but his passions were
wrought higher than mine he would not suffer me to
speak
be silent d'aubigny i cannot brook to be interrupted
now my heart is full and i must have leave to
utter the sentiments that agitate and distend it
he advanced towards pandora he took hold her
hand
rise madam i shall not long trouble you with the
boisterous impetuousness my passions do not resist me
now 
she rose and followed him her face still covered with
her handkerchief and drowned in tears he led her to the
front the alcove he motioned me to approach with
his other hand he took hold mine he seemed to lift
pandora's hand to his lips as if to kiss it with a sudden
start he put it down again he held it below the level 
his breast
during this scene pandora and myself were speechless
most women in the situation pandora would i suppose
have spoken and have been eager to vindicate themselves
from so groundless an imputation but what she did was
peculiar to the delicacy and defencelessness her personal
character she was overwhelmed and incapable effort
for my own part my feelings were uncommonly complicated
my apparent situation was a plain one the situation
 a youth mistaken by his friend for the seducer the
mistress that friend and had my feelings been merely
relative to this situation i could undoubtedly have spoken
without embarrassment but with this were involved the
sentiments originating in my secret character the sentiments
 a man anxious to benefit and who had devoted
himself to the interests another a father tremblingly
alive to the happiness his son and eager to dive into his
soul that he might the more sensibly admire his virtues
and with a more enlightened skill secure his fortune i was
silent charles de damville proceeded 
fc thus said he i join your hands thus i withdraw
 travels st leon
all my claims upon pandora thus i remove every impediment
to your wishes this pandora this d aubigny
i was capable if you had treated me honourably and
avowed an honest passion you do not know charles de
damville you have treated me as none but the most
groveling soul could deserve to be treated had you been
ingenuous i should have a consolation in what i am doing
that now i cannot have i can no longer persuade myself
that i am joining two worthy hearts to each other i can
no longer relieve the bitterness my own disappointment
by the image your future felicity may i be mistaken 
may you be truly happy in each other you cannot be
happy beyond the wishes formed in your favour by him
who will remember to the latest hour his existence how
much his heart was devoted to you both
saying this he burst away from us abruptly and disappeared
at first as i listened to the heroic language 
my son i asked myself whether it were the expression 
a warm heart or a cold one it costs nothing to a cold
heart to ape the language heroism and to pretend to
make the greatest sacrifices when its constitution has rendered
all effort unnecessary to the feat but i looked in
the face charles and forgot my doubts his voice he
had indeed wound up to the tone his speech it was a
little tremulous but in the main firm serious deliberate
and elevated but his countenance was the picture distress
there sat enthroned defying all banishment and
disguise the anguish his soul his eye was haggard 
his complexion was colourless and wan he had been absent
several days from presburg his appearance told me
that he could scarcely either have eaten or slept during the
period his absence he might talk the generosity
with which he could resign pandora i read in his face
what that resignation had cost and would go on to cost
him ingenuous noblehearted charles i doubted whether
but for a reverse the events he apprehended he
would be able to survive it
he had no sooner left us than i applied myself to comfort
pandora i swore to her that in spite every temporary
cloud i would yet witness the union her and her
travels st leon 
adored chevalier i assured her that i would not rest till
i had forced damville to hear me and compelled him to
credit the sincerity my tale
how many things were there that in the scene which
had just passed i might have urged in answer to damville
but respecting which my situation imposed upon me the
most rigorous silence i might have said you call yourself
my protector my benefactor my patron the real relation
between us is the reverse the picture you have
drawn i want not your protection j i am qualified if i
please to be a patron to all the world i am meditating
the most generous things in your behalf this perfidious
friend as you deem him has devoted all his thoughts and
postponed all his gratifications that he might prove himself
substantially arid in the most important particulars your
friend
more than this i might have said i might have said
 i am your father i have no inclinations no passions contravening
your gratification i love you with more thana
father's love i transfer to you all the affection i entertained
for your peerless murdered mother all my study
is your happiness you are to me the whole world and
more than the whole world extensive and singular as are
my prerogatives i fold them up i forget them all and
think you alone
i cannot give a stronger proof than is contained in what
i have here stated the misery my condition i was
cheated as i have once before remarked with the form 
a man but had nothing the substance i was endowed
with the faculty speech but was cut off from its proper
and genuine use i was utterly alone in the world separated
by an insurmountable barrier from every being my
species no man could understand me no man could
sympathise with me no man could form the remotest guess
at what was passing in my breast i had the use words 
i could address my fellowbeings i could enter into dialogue
with them i could discourse every indifferent
thing that the universe contained i could talk everything
but my own feelings this and not the dungeon 
 travels st leon
bethlem gabor is the true solitude let no man after
me pant for the acquisition the philosopher's stone 
charles de damville had again left presburg the very
instant he quitted the alcove when i inquired for him
in the palace i received this afflicting intelligence i did
not hesitate a moment in resolving that i would pursue
his steps it was the utmost consequence that i should
overtake him all that was most interesting to me hung
upon our interview the preparations however my
journey though followed with ardour inevitably reduced
me to the being some hours in the rear my son i was
continually in his track but could not come up with him 
to judge from events you would have supposed that he had
as strong a motive to fly as i had to pursue he led me
along the course the danube to the source that farfamed
and munificent river
i reached the passage the rhine and was on the point
 crossing into alsace but here i lost all notice charles 
no enquiry i could make was effectual to procure me the
slightest intelligence he had not crossed the river he
had proceeded neither to the right nor the left along its
banks i was disappointed mortified and distressed what
was i to do next could i return to pandora what
tale must i relate to this adorable creature whom i had
urged to depend upon my exertions could i leave her
however to the anguish and uncertainty that must follow
upon her hearing no more either from her lover or myself 
i think i never felt more truly depressed than in this
conjuncture most amply most critically did the curse 
the opus magnum attend upon my projects and render all
my exertions abortive it was the same whether my plans
were formed upon a larger or a smaller scale when i
endeavoured to live in total obscurity in madrid when i
undertook to be the steward and the father the people 
hungary and now that with a chastised ambition i sought
what is permitted to all other human creatures to provide
for the honourable settlement my only son still still my
evil genius pursued me and blasted every concern in which
i presumed to interfere i had intruded between two faithful
lovers unfortunate they had been indeed and consign
 st leon 
durable obstacles were interposed to their felicity but
obstacles are commonly found to yield to firmness and constancy
 and without my fatal interference charles and
pandora would one day have been happy if by adverse
fates they had hitherto been kept asunder still they understood
each other and rejoiced in their mutual confidence
and attachment this the consolation all their sorrows
and disappointments it was mine to have destroyed the
globe for aught i knew would speedily be interposed between
them and here i stood in the middle point like one
 those invincible repulsive powers hid in the storehouse
 nature forbidding to them all future retrogression to each
other
chapter xlvii
the picture which my distracted fancy thus set before the
eye my mind was not altogether verified in the event
after a thousand fruitless inquiries and perquisitions i
found to my utter astonishment that charles arresting
his career at the town fribourg had returned upon his
steps and sought a second time the metropolis austrian
hungary this was the class those events which we
sometimes meet with in the world that baffle all calculation
and strike us like magic or like madness in their
authors
i had nothing to do as i conceived on this occasion
but to follow the example my son and like him to resume
the route presburg i yet hoped to witness if not to
cooperate in the reconciliation charles and pandora
my spirits in this respect were revived and my prospects
made brighter by the thoughts that these virtuous and
meritorious lovers were at last likely to be once again inclosed
within the cincture the same city add to which
my venetian confederate had not yet made his appearance
at presburg and not only was i under engagements to
give him the meeting there but it was also clear that his
hh 
 travels st leon
errand could not be brought to its proper close without my
assistance
i once more entered the city to which pandora owed
her birth charles de damville had preceded my arrival
several days i should without delay have repaired to his
apartments but that i found at my own lodgings a letter
from benevento cabriera venice informing me that he
was now in presburg and to avoid all cause for suspicion
had taken up his residence in a remote quarter the
town from the enquiries i made i became satisfied
that my son had in some degree resumed his usual occupations
and that there was no appearance his again immediately
quitting the metropolis i therefore felt my transaction
with cabriera more urgent than an immediate
conference with charles though i had sought that conference
with earnest expedition yet i dreaded it it might
require the maturest consideration and the nicest management
to render it effectual for the purposes i sought i
found from certain intelligence that damville and pandora
had yet had no explanation with each other i therefore
regarded my exertions for that purpose as a final effort 
and i was willing that every thing should be in train and
the portion pandora fully adjusted before i entered
upon that interesting scene with cabriera i had little
difficulty the documents and evidences his tale we
had concerted at venice and i presently found that he
told his story so plausibly and supported it so consistently
that it was admitted by every one without the smallest
suspicion
no sooner had cabriera opened his business to the parties
to whom the cognisance it most properly belonged
than i once more presented myself to the beautiful and engaging
niece nadasti the instant i entered her apartment
i was shocked with the extreme change her personal
appearance all the airiness alertness and vivacity
that had once so exquisitely adorned her were gone the
roses in her cheek were faded and had given place to a delicate
but sickly paleness her arms though always what
is called white had before been round and had been distinguished
by the purest hue health they were now
travels op st leon 
emaciated skinny and colourless her eyes were hollow
and her eyelids inflamed with weeping all these changes
had taken place in about five weeks that had elapsed since
i saw her last i was so struck with the sight that involuntarily
started and could scarcely command myself
enough to refrain from tears it was plain that she carried
an arrow in her bosom which one hand only in the
universe could extract with safety as i approached she
raised her lovely head that had been depressed with grief
and lifted her white arms with an expression despair
ff come nearer my sweet henry said she i rejoice
to see you though you have proved my worst enemy the
destroyer my peace but your intentions my kind boy
my brother for such i will still call you have always been
good and innocent but ah henry you have deluded
me you urged me to banish despair and every day i see
more reason to despair 
i asked if she had not seen the chevalier since his return
to presburg
it were better for me replied pandora e if i had
not seen him what has really happened is worse than if
i had been denied to see him i have met him every day
in the apartments my aunt to an indifferent eye it
would have appeared as if he neither sought nor avoided
me he carries himself towards me with a cold and constrained
civility but he neither demands an interview
nor allows me the opportunity to utter a word to him in
private oh d'aubigny i see too well that i have lost
him for ever when he fled my presence when he resolved
to seek some distant region cruel as that conduct was it
convinced me that was some importance to him but
now he passes by me in stern neglect he has utterly driven
me from his heart indeed my brother this last blow is
too much i feel that i shall never recover it
and does the chevalier cried i appear at his ease
does he exhibit the wonted symptoms his health and
triumphant spirit
f away too pleasing deluder replied pandora
c cheat me not with false hopes flatter me not with unreal
expectations damville does not appear to be well or
 travels st leon
happy but you have deceived me too much the disappointments
that you prepared for me are too excruciating
i feel now at no time so high a degree gloomy satisfaction
and composure as when i press despair firmly to
my breast
but you henry continued she are probably uninformed
 my last and severest misfortune i had a great
uncle in the list the adventurers that achieved the conquest
 peru he has died and unexpectedly bequeathed mea
fortune that sets the portionless pandora upon a level with
the wealthy heiresses the great palatine himself for a
long time want fortune was the only obstacle that stood
between me and all my hopes happiness now that
poverty is no longer an evil to me and wealth no longer
desirable i have obtained this unwelcome acquisition
you can have no conception how painful a sensation is
produced by this mockery the gift ample possessions to
the votary despair
i endeavoured somewhat to encourage pandora but she
obstinately rejected my soothing i was the less importunate
on this subject as since the return my son i
persisted to persuade myself that i should soon have something
more substantial to offer her on his part than mere
guesses and conjectures the day after this conversation
i boldly sought the presence the chevalier till then
i had since our return to presburg avoided to meet him
i now resolved to force from him a hearing to assure
him with the most solemn asseverations my own innocence
and the constancy his mistress to represent to
him in how eminent a degree the newly acquired estate 
pandora was calculated to facilitate their mutual wishes 
and finally to offer him any pledge he should desire the
sincerity my declarations even to the banishing myself
from the presence and intercourse him and the lovely
pandora for ever
when i saw my son his appearance and air advanced
a forcible claim on my compassion i will not now describe
them suffice it that they completely proved how
true was the sympathy even to the minutest particulars
between him and his mistress the difference was only in
travels st leon
kind and not in degree hers a defenceless a delicate and
truly feminine grief while his amidst all its aggravations
had something in it the champion and the hero when
he felt most severely he seemed to disdain himself for
what he felt and though his struggles were excruciating
he resolutely smoothed his manly front and the loftiness
 his spirit produced on his cheek a generous and a settled
blush
i have just said that i had resolved to force from him a
hearing i was mistaken in my calculations on this point
dejected as his habits had lately been he no sooner saw
me than he advanced towards me with a fierce and imperative
demeanour that absolutely startled me
f how is it man cried he that you are at this
hour oat custody 
custody interdicted and astonished repeated i
yes custody if such a wretch as thou art be permitted
to go at large what human institution what human
possessions shall ever be secure 
good god said i what am i to understand by
your present rage know that you have considered meas
your personal enemy and the underminer your happiness
but when first you accused me this crime you
treated me in a manner less violent and disdainful than
that which you now employ
i brook not to explain read that letter i received
it at fribourg that letter brought me back from the confines
 france to the spot where now we meet
i took up the letter its contents were nearly as follow

t my dear friend you will permit me to call you
so since to me and me only you have recently thought
proper to confide your projects and your unfortunate passion
for the charming pandora what you related to me
on the subject convinced me how much she was unworthy
 your love and how basely she has conducted herself
towards you yet you will yourself feel some compassion
for her when you learn who it is upon whom she has 

 travels op st leon
stowed this unmerited preference know then that this
wretched d'aubigny is no other than the notorious cotillon
the infamous impostor who by his machinations
about a year ago preserved the turkish provinces hungary
from being conquered by the christian arms the
man is moreover a magician the pretended or real possessor
 the philosopher's stone he is therefore doubly
worthy death first as a traitor the abettor and comforter
 the common enemy the christian faith and
secondly as a dealer in the black art and a man notoriously
sold and delivered over to the devil
 i have received this information from the most unquestionable
authority a soldier in my old corps who has
lately escaped from a turkish prison no sooner saw him
than he identified his person i happened to be near the
fellow at the moment when by an unexpected exclamation
he betrayed his discovery it immediately struck me that
the circumstance might be importance to your interests 
and therefore taking the soldier aside i charged him not
to mention to any one what he had observed to render
his secrecy the more secure i have since removed him to
a garrison at some distance from presburg and i have
myself mentioned the circumstance to no living creature
that i might first receive your instructions on the subject
and act in all respects concerning it as you shall judge
proper the blackness the character the man sets all
exaggeration at defiance this very individual whom you
liberated from the bowels the earth who by the most
treacherous arts won your confidence and upon whom you
lavishly heaped every imaginable distinction was all the
while conscious to himself that he was the character that
 all that live you hated most in one word the renegado
chatillon he acted consistently with his preceding conduct
and his recent disingenuousness when he seduced
from you the affections the woman your choice
i am concerned to add that on the very day that i
made this discovery this chatillon d'aubigny disappeared
from presburg nor can i by any effort learn whither he is
gone it is impossible he should have been informed by any
human means the detection that had happened but indeed
travels st leon 
it is vain to attempt to form any reasonable conjecture respecting
a character so mysterious and inexplicable
your devoted friend
andrew count bather
fc well sir seeing i had finished the perusal and
what have you now to allege when i saw you simply as
the favoured lover pandora however treacherous and dishonourable
i might deem your conduct towards me i quitted
the field i did not trust myself to be a judge in my own
cause i did not confide in my estimate your unworthiness
when i was myself wholly concerned i had
some time before received an invitation from the duke
d'aumale who was collecting a number generous and
highspirited nobles to accompany mary queen scots
to the barbarous fields her native realm i at first declined
i now accepted the invitation i set out for paris
to join him i found that letter waiting my arrival at fribourg
and i returned deeply as pandora has sunk in
my esteem i determined i would never allow her to be
thrown away upon the infamous chatillon
fc you haunt my steps i heard you again and again
on my route as i returned from fribourg i arrive at
presburg and presently after you again make your appearance
what further villanies have you to act what new
treacheries have you devised against me this morning i
consented to the representations count bather and agreed
that you should be delivered up to justice why then are
you not in custody 
e when i consider the mystery and inscrutableness 
your character i am lost in conjecture you are said to bea
magician a dealer in the unhallowed secrets alchymy
and the elixir mice in cases like this all the ordinary
rules human sagacity and prudence are superseded the
wisest man is a fool and the noblest spirit feels the very
ground he stood on struck from under his feet how can
i know that the seduction pandora's affections is not
owing to magical incantations who in that case is rather
an object for compassion than for censure how can i tell
that the fraternal resemblance borne by your features to
 travels op st leon
my own and the sudden and ardent partiality that rose in
my breast when first i saw you have not been produced by
the most detested arts magic dissolves the whole principle
and arrangement human action subverts all generous
enthusiasm and dignity and renders life itself loathsome
and intolerable
this is to me the most painful all subjects i had a
father whom i affectionately loved he became the dupe 
these infernal secrets i had a mother the paragon the
creation that father murdered her all the anguish i
ever felt has derived its source from alchymy and magic
while the infamous chatillon thus stands before me i feel
all the longforgotten wounds my heart new opened and
the blood bursting afresh from every vein i have rested
and been at peace and now the red and venomed plague
that tarnished the years my opening youth returns to
blast me begone infamous thricedamned villain and
let me never see thee more 
wretch that you are continued charles for he saw
me motioning to withdraw i felt that all further expostulation
and discussion on my part was useless wretch
that you are what is it that you are about to do think
no to escape my vengeance in the midst all the tumultuous
passions you waken in my breast i still feel in
myself the soldier and the man honour i am not a thieftaker
or a bailiff you are within my power and that is
your present protection i will not now deliver you up to
the justice the state but will hurl against you my personal
defiance i am willing to meet you man to man i
thirst to encounter you as my worst and most mortal foe
who has perpetrated against me the basest injuries and excited
in my bosom the most hateful sensations though
you were fenced with all the legions hell i fear you not 
and seeing that after all that is past you have once again
intruded into my presence i here bind myself by all that is
sacred to pursue you to the death
what could i answer to such an attack i saw at once
that the case as to all future harmony between me and my
son was desperate and irremediable what hope could i
entertain further what had hitherto been the result 
travels st leon 
our illfated intercourse every offence and prejudice that
can gall the human mind had been brought forward in it in
turn i had wounded damville in the most sensible point
 private life and had blasted his hopes there where he
stored them all i had offended his most rooted political
prepossessions by aiding the turk and feeding a nation
that perished with hunger i was an equivocal character
assuming different names and wandering over the world
with different pretences last all i had revived in his
mind the images his father and his mother all that had
once been most dear and now was most painful to his recollection
 and had tortured his fancy with nameless horrors
these sentiments could never be removed all the explanations
in the world could never reconcile me to his mind 
and i felt that i had that within which in what was to
come as it had in what was past must for ever annihilate
all confidence between us at once therefore i accepted his
challenge arranged with him the terms a hostile encounter
on the following morning and immediately after bid
adieu to presburg and to the sight every soul contained
within its walls for ever
this is i powerfully feel the last adventure that i shall
ever have the courage to commit to writing a few minutes
more and i will lay down my pen and resolve in the most
solemn and sacred manner never to compose another line
indeed all other adventures must necessarily be frigid and
uninteresting compared with that which i have now described
great god what a fate was mine anxious as
i had been to prove myself in the most momentous respects
the benefactor my son dismissing all other thoughts and
cares from my mind journeying with this sole object in
view from presburg to venice and from venice to
presburg from hungary to the banks the rhine and
from the banks the rhine back again to hungary
the whole scene was now terminated by a declaration on his
part that nothing could appease the animosity he cherished
against me short rioting in the blood his father's
heart i was reduced to the necessity either lifting my
sword against my son running myself upon the point 
his weapon or forfeiting the engagement between us
 travels op st leon
and suffering him to brand me as a coward in the face 
christendom i mention not this because the variety 
objects choice produced in me the slightest hesitation
weary as i was life i could cheerfully have consented
to die but not to stain the sword charles de damville
with my vital blood i prevented him from being the assassin
 his father's life could not prevent him from
being the assassin his father's character he was assiduous
and indefatigable in spreading against me the blackest
invectives which he regarded as the most unerring truths
all hungary has resounded for thirty years with the atrocities
 the sieur de chatillon what is here recorded contains
the whole and unvarnished truth on the subject
this narrative however shall never see the light till the
melancholy hour when charles de damville shall be no
more
yet in the midst the anguish the disappointment 
every cherished hope which rends my soul i have one
consolation and that an invaluable one in the virtues the
glory and the happiness my son i said i would forget
every gratification and sentiment my own in him i am
now more than ever instigated to do so when i quitted
presburg i left cabriera behind me in that city and i
took care to obtain a parting interview with him he
afterwards gave me the meeting as we then concerted at
trieste in the duchy carniola it happened as i had
flattered myself the event would prove that the visible
source umbrage being removed charles and pandora in
no long time came to a mutual understanding and were
finally made happy in each other i had been the fortunate
means supplying to this excellent and incomparable
creature the only defect under which she laboured a want
 fortune her uncle having no longer a pretence to
oppose their mutual passion united their hands and at
the time which i am speaking they were regarded as
the most graceful and accomplished couple in the whole
hungarian dominions the chevalier de damville is considered
in that country as the great bulwark the christian
frontier and the most generous and illustrious pupil in
the school the bayards and the scanderbeg cabriera
travels st leon 
worn out with years and fatigues but still grasping and
avaricious to his latest hour expired in my arms in the
city trieste and by his death yielded me this contentment
that henceforth the only obvious means for detecting
my beneficent fraud in securing the dower pandora was
for ever removed
that the reader may enter the more fully into my sentiment
 congratulation upon the happiness my son
and rise from the perusal my narrative with a more
soothing and pleasurable sensation i will here shortly recapitulate
the good qualities that had been unfolded in this
truly extraordinary young man from his earliest infancy
he was a child only nine years age at the period the
truly affecting and exemplary behaviour the reader may remember
him to have displayed while i was at paris squandering
the property my family at the gamingtable in
the alienation mind produced in me by that dreadful
catastrophe he was my constant attendant my careful
nurse and my affectionate friend when twelve months
after we were driven by our calamities out switzerland
and i lay extended to all human appearance on the bed 
death charles was the comforter his mother the friend
 his sisters and even young as he was contributed to the
maintenance my starving family by the labour his infant
hands at dresden as yet no more than seventeen
years age he was assailed by one the severest trials
with which the mind man can in any case be beset but
he hesitated not a moment obliged to choose between
poverty and innocence with the sacrifice all his habitudes
and the loss every friend on the one side and
wealth new to his enjoyment with ignominy or an equivocal
character on the other his determination was instant
and unalterable cast at so immature an age alone and
portionless upon the world he almost immediately by his
gallantry his winning qualities and his virtues gained to
himself a friend in one the greatest captains the age
unaided by the brilliancy family or fortune he acquired
the character the bravest soldier in hungary where all
were brave this last trial to which i had been the undesigning
means subjecting him was none the least
travels st leon
arduous love often entails imbecility on the noblest 
mankind but charles surmounted the most perilous attacks
 this allconquering passion when he thought
pandora unworthy he tore himself from her and would
not admit a struggle when he believed she loved another
he disdained to claim a heart that seemed alienated from
him and himself joined the hands his mistress and his
rival he might have died he could not disgrace himself
i was the hero's father but no i am not blinded by
paternal partiality but no he was indeed what i thought
him as near the climax dignity and virtue as the frailty
 our nature will admit his virtue was at length crowned
with the most enviable reward the earth has to boast
the faithful attachment a nobleminded and accomplished
woman i am happy to close my eventful and somewhat
melancholy story with so pleasing a termination whatever
may have been the result my personal experience 
human life i can never recollect the fate charles and
pandora without confessing with exultation that this busy
and anxious world ours yet contains something in its
stores that is worth living for

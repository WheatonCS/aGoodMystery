and listen to the stories of the humble cottagers their
countenances were open and beautifully fair with an expression of
high refinement but at the same time a frank cheerfulness and engaging
affability their brothers were tall and elegantly formed they were
dressed fashionably but simply with strict neatness and propriety but
without any mannerism or foppishness their whole demeanor was easy
and natural with that lofty grace and noble frankness which bespeak
free-born souls that have never been checked in their growth by feelings
of inferiority there is a healthful hardiness about real dignity that
never dreads contact and communion with others however humble it is
only spurious pride that is morbid and sensitive and shrinks from every
touch i was pleased to see the manner in which they would converse with
the peasantry about those rural concerns and field-sports in which the
gentlemen of the country so much delight in these conversations there
was neither haughtiness on the one part nor servility on the other and
you were only reminded of the difference of rank by the habitual respect
of the peasant

in contrast to these was the family of a wealthy citizen who had
amassed a vast fortune and having purchased the estate and mansion of
a ruined nobleman in the neighborhood was endeavoring to assume all the
style and dignity of an hereditary lord of the soil the family always
came to church en prince they were rolled majestically along in a
carriage emblazoned with arms the crest glittered in silver radiance
from every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed
a fat coachman in a three-cornered hat richly laced and a flaxen wig
curling close round his rosy face was seated on the box with a sleek
danish dog beside him two footmen in gorgeous liveries with huge
bouquets and gold-headed canes lolled behind the carriage rose and
sunk on its long springs with a peculiar stateliness of motion the very
horses champed their bits arched their necks and glanced their eyes
more proudly than common horses either because they had caught a little
of the family feeling or were reined up more tightly than ordinary

i could not but admire the style with which this splendid pageant
was brought up to the gate of the churchyard there was a vast effect
produced at the turning of an angle of the wall a great smacking of the
whip straining and scrambling of the horses glistening of harness and
flashing of wheels through gravel this was the moment of triumph and
vainglory to the coachman the horses were urged and checked until they
were fretted into a foam they threw out their feet in a prancing trot
dashing about pebbles at every step the crowd of villagers sauntering
quietly to church opened precipitately to the right and left gaping in
vacant admiration on reaching the gate the horses were pulled up with
a suddenness that produced an immediate stop and almost threw them on
their haunches

there was an extraordinary hurry of the footmen to alight pull down the
steps and prepare everything for the descent on earth of this august
family the old citizen first emerged his round red face from out the
door looking about him with the pompous air of a man accustomed to rule
on change and shake the stock market with a nod his consort a fine
fleshy comfortable dame followed him there seemed i must confess
but little pride in her composition she was the picture of broad
honest vulgar enjoyment the world went well with her and she liked
the world she had fine clothes a fine house a fine carriage fine
children everything was fine about her it was nothing but driving
about and visiting and feasting life was to her a perpetual revel it
was one long lord mayor's day

two daughters succeeded to this goodly couple they certainly were
handsome but had a supercilious air that chilled admiration and
disposed the spectator to be critical they were ultrafashionable in
dress and though no one could deny the richness of their decorations
yet their appropriateness might be questioned amidst the simplicity of
a country church they descended loftily from the carriage and moved up
the line of peasantry with a step that seemed dainty of the soil it trod
on they cast an excursive glance around that passed coldly over the
burly faces of the peasantry until they met the eyes of the nobleman's
family when their countenances immediately brightened into smiles and
they made the most profound and elegant courtesies which were returned
in a manner that showed they were but slight acquaintances

i must not forget the two sons of this inspiring citizen who came to
church in a dashing curricle with outriders they were arrayed in the
extremity of the mode with all that pedantry of dress which marks
the man of questionable pretensions to style they kept entirely by
themselves eying every one askance that came near them as if measuring
his claims to respectability yet they were without conversation except
the exchange of an occasional cant phrase they even moved artificially
for their bodies in compliance with the caprice of the day had been
disciplined into the absence of all ease and freedom art had done
everything to accomplish them as men of fashion but nature had denied
them the nameless grace they were vulgarly shaped like men formed for
the common purposes of life and had that air of supercilious assumption
which is never seen in the true gentleman

i have been rather minute in drawing the pictures of these two families
because i considered them specimens of what is often to be met with in
this country the unpretending great and the arrogant little i have no
respect for titled rank unless it be accompanied with true nobility
of soul but i have remarked in all countries where artificial
distinctions exist that the very highest classes are always the most
courteous and unassuming those who are well assured of their own
standing are least apt to trespass on that of others whereas nothing
is so offensive as the aspirings of vulgarity which thinks to elevate
itself by humiliating its neighbor

as i have brought these families into contrast i must notice their
behavior in church that of the nobleman's family was quiet serious
and attentive not that they appeared to have any fervor of devotion
but rather a respect for sacred things and sacred places inseparable
from good-breeding the others on the contrary were in a perpetual
flutter and whisper they betrayed a continual consciousness of finery
and the sorry ambition of being the wonders of a rural congregation

the old gentleman was the only one really attentive to the service he
took the whole burden of family devotion upon himself standing bolt
upright and uttering the responses with a loud voice that might be
heard all over the church it was evident that he was one of these
thorough church-and-king men who connect the idea of devotion and
loyalty who consider the deity somehow or other of the government
party and religion a very excellent sort of thing that ought to be
countenanced and kept up

when he joined so loudly in the service it seemed more by way of
example to the lower orders to show them that though so great and
wealthy he was not above being religious as i have seen a turtle-fed
alderman swallow publicly a basin of charity soup smacking his lips at
every mouthful and pronouncing it excellent food for the poor

when the service was at an end i was curious to witness the several
exits of my groups the young noblemen and their sisters as the day
was fine preferred strolling home across the fields chatting with the
country people as they went the others departed as they came in grand
parade again were the equipages wheeled up to the gate there was again
the smacking of whips the clattering of hoofs and the glittering of
harness the horses started off almost at a bound the villagers again
hurried to right and left the wheels threw up a cloud of dust and the
aspirin family was rapt out of sight in a whirlwind




the widow and her son

 pittie olde age within whose silver haires
 honour and reverence evermore have rain'd
 marlowe's tamburlaine

those who are in the habit of remarking such matters must have noticed
the passive quiet of an english landscape on sunday the clacking of
the mill the regularly recurring stroke of the flail the din of the
blacksmith's hammer the whistling of the ploughman the rattling of
the cart and all other sounds of rural labor are suspended the
very farm-dogs bark less frequently being less disturbed by passing
travellers at such times i have almost fancied the wind sunk into
quiet and that the sunny landscape with its fresh green tints melting
into blue haze enjoyed the hallowed calm

 sweet day so pure so calm so brigh
 the bridal of the earth and sky

well was it ordained that the day of devotion should be a day of rest
the holy repose which reigns over the face of nature has its moral
influence every restless passion is charmed down and we feel the
natural religion of the soul gently springing up within us for my
part there are feelings that visit me in a country church amid the
beautiful serenity of nature which i experience nowhere else and if
not a more religious i think i am a better man on sunday than on any
other day of the seven

during my recent residence in the country i used frequently to attend
at the old village church its shadowy aisles its mouldering monuments
its dark oaken panelling all reverend with the gloom of departed years
seemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation but being in a
wealthy aristocratic neighborhood the glitter of fashion penetrated
even into the sanctuary and i felt myself continually thrown back upon
the world by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms around me the
only being in the whole congregation who appeared thoroughly to feel the
humble and prostrate piety of a true christian was a poor decrepit old
woman bending under the weight of years and infirmities she bore the
traces of something better than abject poverty the lingerings of decent
pride were visible in her appearance her dress though humble in the
extreme was scrupulously clean some trivial respect too had been
awarded her for she did not take her seat among the village poor but
sat alone on the steps of the altar she seemed to have survived all
love all friendship all society and to have nothing left her but the
hopes of heaven when i saw her feebly rising and bending her aged form
in prayer habitually conning her prayer-book which her palsied hand
and failing eyes could not permit her to read but which she evidently
knew by heart i felt persuaded that the faltering voice of that poor
woman arose to heaven far before the responses of the clerk the swell
of the organ or the chanting of the choir

i am fond of loitering about country churches and this was so
delightfully situated that it frequently attracted me it stood on a
knoll round which a small stream made a beautiful bend and then wound
its way through a long reach of soft meadow scenery the church was
surrounded by yew trees which seemed almost coeval with itself its
tall gothic spire shot up lightly from among them with rooks and crows
generally wheeling about it i was seated there one still sunny morning
watching two laborers who were digging a grave they had chosen one of
the most remote and neglected corners of the churchyard where from the
number of nameless graves around it would appear that the indigent and
friendless were huddled into the earth i was told that the new-made
grave was for the only son of a poor widow while i was meditating on
the distinctions of worldly rank which extend thus down into the very
dust the toll of the bell announced the approach of the funeral they
were the obsequies of poverty with which pride had nothing to do a
coffin of the plainest materials without pall or other covering was
borne by some of the villagers the sexton walked before with an air
of cold indifference there were no mock mourners in the trappings of
affected woe but there was one real mourner who feebly tottered after
the corpse it was the aged mother of the deceased the poor old woman
whom i had seen seated on the steps of the altar she was supported by
a humble friend who was endeavoring to comfort her a few of the
neighboring poor had joined the train and some children of the village
were running hand in hand now shouting with unthinking mirth and now
pausing to gaze with childish curiosity on the grief of the mourner

as the funeral train approached the grave the parson issued from the
church-porch arrayed in the surplice with prayer-book in hand and
attended by the clerk the service however was a mere act of charity
the deceased had been destitute and the survivor was penniless it
was shuffled through therefore in form but coldly and unfeeling the
well-fed priest moved but a few steps from the church door his voice
could scarcely be heard at the grave and never did i hear the funeral
service that sublime and touching ceremony turned into such a frigid
mummery of words

i approached the grave the coffin was placed on the ground on it were
inscribed the name and age of the deceased george somers aged 
years the poor mother had been assisted to kneel down at the head
of it her withered hands were clasped as if in prayer but i could
perceive by a feeble rocking of the body and a convulsive motion of
the lips that she was gazing on the last relics of her son with the
yearnings of a mother's heart

preparations were made to deposit the coffin in the earth there was
that bustling stir which breaks so harshly on the feelings of grief and
affection directions given in the cold tones of business the striking
of spades into sand and gravel which at the grave of those we love
is of all sounds the most withering the bustle around seemed to
waken the mother from a wretched revery she raised her glazed eyes and
looked about with a faint wildness as the men approached with cords to
lower the coffin into the grave she wrung her hands and broke into
an agony of grief the poor woman who attended her took her by the arm
endeavoring to raise her from the earth and to whisper something like
consolation nay now nay now don't take it so sorely to heart
she could only shake her head and wring her hands as one not to be
comforted

as they lowered the body into the earth the creaking of the cords
seemed to agonize her but when on some accidental obstruction there
was a jostling of the coffin all the tenderness of the mother burst
forth as if any harm could come to him who was far beyond the reach of
worldly suffering

i could see no more my heart swelled into my throat my eyes filled
with tears i felt as if i were acting a barbarous part in standing by
and gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish i wandered to another
part of the churchyard where i remained until the funeral train had
dispersed

when i saw the mother slowly and painfully quitting the grave leaving
behind her the remains of all that was dear to her on earth and
returning to silence and destitution my heart ached for her what
thought i are the distresses of the rich they have friends to
soothe pleasures to beguile a world to divert and dissipate their
griefs what are the sorrows of the young their growing minds soon
close above the wound their elastic spirits soon rise beneath the
pressure their green and ductile affections soon twine round new
objects but the sorrows of the poor who have no outward appliances to
soothe the sorrows of the aged with whom life at best is but a wintry
day and who can look for no after-growth of joy the sorrows of a
widow aged solitary destitute mourning over an only son the last
solace of her years these are indeed sorrows which make us feel the
impotency of consolation

it was some time before i left the churchyard on my way homeward i met
with the woman who had acted as comforter she was just returning from
accompanying the mother to her lonely habitation and i drew from her
some particulars connected with the affecting scene i had witnessed

the parents of the deceased had resided in the village from childhood
they had inhabited one of the neatest cottages and by various rural
occupations and the assistance of a small garden had supported
themselves creditably and comfortably and led a happy and a blameless
life they had one son who had grown up to be the staff and pride of
their age oh sir said the good woman he was such a comely lad
so sweet-tempered so kind to every one around him so dutiful to his
parents it did one's heart good to see him of a sunday drest out in
his best so tall so straight so cheery supporting his old mother to
church for she was always fonder of leaning on george's arm than on her
good man's and poor soul she might well be proud of him for a finer
lad there was not in the country round

unfortunately the son was tempted during a year of scarcity and
agricultural hardship to enter into the service of one of the small
craft that plied on a neighboring river he had not been long in this
employ when he was entrapped by a press-gang and carried off to sea
his parents received tidings of his seizure but beyond that they could
learn nothing it was the loss of their main prop the father who was
already infirm grew heartless and melancholy and sunk into his grave
the widow left lonely in her age and feebleness could no longer
support herself and came upon the parish still there was a kind
feeling towards her throughout the village and a certain respect as
being one of the oldest inhabitants as no one applied for the cottage
in which she had passed so many happy days she was permitted to remain
in it where she lived solitary and almost helpless the few wants of
nature were chiefly supplied from the scanty productions of her little
garden which the neighbors would now and then cultivate for her it was
but a few days before the time at which these circumstances were told
me that she was gathering some vegetables for her repast when she
heard the cottage-door which faced the garden suddenly opened a
stranger came out and seemed to be looking eagerly and wildly around
he was dressed in seamen's clothes was emaciated and ghastly pale and
bore the air of one broken by sickness and hardships he saw her and
hastened towards her but his steps were faint and faltering he sank on
his knees before her and sobbed like a child the poor woman gazed upon
him with a vacant and wandering eye oh my dear dear mother don't
you know your son your poor boy george it was indeed the wreck
of her once noble lad who shattered by wounds by sickness and foreign
imprisonment had at length dragged his wasted limbs homeward to
repose among the scenes of his childhood

i will not attempt to detail the particulars of such a meeting where
sorrow and joy were so completely blended still he was alive he was
come home he might yet live to comfort and cherish her old age nature
however was exhausted in him and if any thing had been wanting to
finish the work of fate the desolation of his native cottage would have
been sufficient he stretched himself on the pallet on which his widowed
mother had passed many a sleepless night and he never rose from it
again

the villagers when they heard that george somers had returned crowded
to see him offering every comfort and assistance that their humble
means afforded he was too weak however to talk he could only
look his thanks his mother was his constant attendant and he seemed
unwilling to be helped by any other hand

there is something in sickness that breaks down the pride of manhood
that softens the heart and brings it back to the feelings of infancy
who that has languished even in advanced life in sickness and
despondency who that has pined on a weary bed in the neglect and
loneliness of a foreign land but has thought on the mother that looked
on his childhood that smoothed his pillow and administered to his
helplessness oh there is an enduring tenderness in the love of a
mother to a son that transcends all other affections of the heart
it is neither to be chilled by selfishness nor daunted by danger
nor weakened by worthlessness nor stifled by ingratitude she will
sacrifice every comfort to his convenience she will surrender every
pleasure to his enjoyment she will glory in his fame and exult in his
prosperity and if misfortune overtake him he will be the dearer to
her from misfortune and if disgrace settle upon his name she will
still love and cherish him in spite of his disgrace and if all the
world beside cast him off she will be all the world to him

poor george somers had known what it was to be in sickness and none to
soothe lonely and in prison and none to visit him he could not endure
his mother from his sight if she moved away his eye would follow her
she would sit for hours by his bed watching him as he slept sometimes
he would start from a feverish dream and look anxiously up until he saw
her bending over him when he would take her hand lay it on his bosom
and fall asleep with the tranquillity of a child in this way he died

my first impulse on hearing this humble tale of affliction was to visit
the cottage of the mourner and administer pecuniary assistance and if
possible comfort i found however on inquiry that the good feelings
of the villagers had prompted them to do everything that the case
admitted and as the poor know best how to console each other's sorrows
i did not venture to intrude

the next sunday i was at the village church when to my surprise i saw
the poor old woman tottering down the aisle to her accustomed seat on
the steps of the altar

she had made an effort to put on something like mourning for her son
and nothing could be more touching than this struggle between pious
affection and utter poverty a black ribbon or so a faded black
handkerchief and one or two more such humble attempts to express by
outward signs that grief which passes show when i looked round upon
the storied monuments the stately hatchments the cold marble pomp with
which grandeur mourned magnificently over departed pride and turned to
this poor widow bowed down by age and sorrow at the altar of her god
and offering up the prayers and praises of a pious though a broken
heart i felt that this living monument of real grief was worth them
all

i related her story to some of the wealthy members of the congregation
and they were moved by it they exerted themselves to render her
situation more comfortable and to lighten her afflictions it was
however but smoothing a few steps to the grave in the course of a
sunday or two after she was missed from her usual seat at church and
before i left the neighborhood i heard with a feeling of satisfaction
that she had quietly breathed her last and had gone to rejoin those she
loved in that world where sorrow is never known and friends are never
parted




a sunday in london

 part of a sketch omitted in the preceding editions


in a preceding paper i have spoken of an english sunday in the country
and its tranquillizing effect upon the landscape but where is its
sacred influence more strikingly apparent than in the very heart of that
great babel london on this sacred day the gigantic monster is charmed
into repose the intolerable din and struggle of the week are at an
end the shops are shut the fires of forges and manufactories are
extinguished and the sun no longer obscured by murky clouds of smoke
pours down a sober yellow radiance into the quiet streets the
few pedestrians we meet instead of hurrying forward with anxious
countenances move leisurely along their brows are smoothed from the
wrinkles of business and care they have put on their sunday looks and
sunday manners with their sunday clothes and are cleansed in mind as
well as in person

and now the melodious clangor of bells from church towers summons their
several flocks to the fold forth issues from his mansion the family
of the decent tradesman the small children in the advance then the
citizen and his comely spouse followed by the grown-up daughters
with small morocco-bound prayer-books laid in the folds of their
pocket-handkerchiefs the housemaid looks after them from the window
admiring the finery of the family and receiving perhaps a nod and
smile from her young mistresses at whose toilet she has assisted

now rumbles along the carriage of some magnate of the city peradventure
an alderman or a sheriff and now the patter of many feet announces it
procession of charity scholars in uniforms of antique cut and each with
a prayer-book under his arm

the ringing of bells is at an end the rumbling of the carriage has
ceased the pattering of feet is heard no more the flocks are folded
in ancient churches cramped up in by-lanes and corners of the crowded
city where the vigilant beadle keeps watch like the shepherd's dog
round the threshold of the sanctuary for a time everything is hushed
but soon is heard the deep pervading sound of the organ rolling and
vibrating through the empty lanes and courts and the sweet chanting of
the choir making them resound with melody and praise never have i been
more sensible of the sanctifying effect of church music than when i
have heard it thus poured forth like a river of joy through the inmost
recesses of this great metropolis elevating it as it were from all
the sordid pollutions of the week and bearing the poor world-worn soul
on a tide of triumphant harmony to heaven

the morning service is at an end the streets are again alive with the
congregations returning to their homes but soon again relapse into
silence now comes on the sunday dinner which to the city tradesman
is a meal of some importance there is more leisure for social enjoyment
at the board members of the family can now gather together who are
separated by the laborious occupations of the week a school-boy may be
permitted on that day to come to the paternal home an old friend of
the family takes his accustomed sunday seat at the board tells over
his well-known stories and rejoices young and old with his well-known
jokes

on sunday afternoon the city pours forth its lesions to breathe the
fresh air and enjoy the sunshine of the parks and rural environs
satirists may say what they please about the rural enjoyments of a
london citizen on sunday but to me there is something delightful in
beholding the poor prisoner of the crowded and dusty city enabled thus
to come forth once a week and throw himself upon the green bosom of
nature he is like a child restored to the mother's breast and they
who first spread out these noble parks and magnificent pleasure-grounds
which surround this huge metropolis have done at least as much for
its health and morality as if they had expended the amount of cost in
hospitals prisons and penitentiaries




the boar's head tavern eastcheap

a shakespearian research

a tavern is the rendezvous the exchange the staple of good fellows
i have heard my great-grandfather tell how his great-great-grandfather
should say that it was an old proverb when his great-grandfather was a
child that it was a good wind that blew a man to the wine

mother bombie

it is a pious custom in some catholic countries to honor the memory of
saints by votive lights burnt before their pictures the popularity of
a saint therefore may be known by the number of these offerings
one perhaps is left to moulder in the darkness of his little chapel
another may have a solitary lamp to throw its blinking rays athwart his
effigy while the whole blaze of adoration is lavished at the shrine
of some beatified father of renown the wealthy devotee brings his huge
luminary of wax the eager zealot his seven-branched candlestick and
even the mendicant pilgrim is by no means satisfied that sufficient
light is thrown upon the deceased unless he hangs up his little lamp
of smoking oil the consequence is that in the eagerness to enlighten
they are often apt to obscure and i have occasionally seen an unlucky
saint almost smoked out of countenance by the officiousness of his
followers

in like manner has it fared with the immortal shakespeare every writer
considers it his bounden duty to light up some portion of his character
or works and to rescue some merit from oblivion the commentator
opulent in words produces vast tomes of dissertations the common herd
of editors send up mists of obscurity from their notes at the bottom of
each page and every casual scribbler brings his farthing rushlight of
eulogy or research to swell the cloud of incense and of smoke

as i honor all established usages of my brethren of the quill i thought
it but proper to contribute my mite of homage to the memory of the
illustrious bard i was for some time however sorely puzzled in what
way i should discharge this duty i found myself anticipated in every
attempt at a new reading every doubtful line had been explained a dozen
different ways and perplexed beyond the reach of elucidation and as
to fine passages they had all been amply praised by previous admirers
nay so completely had the bard of late been overlarded with panegyric
by a great german critic that it was difficult now to find even a fault
that had not been argued into a beauty

in this perplexity i was one morning turning over his pages when i
casually opened upon the comic scenes of henry iv and was in a
moment completely lost in the madcap revelry of the boar's head tavern
so vividly and naturally are these scenes of humor depicted and with
such force and consistency are the characters sustained that they
become mingled up in the mind with the facts and personages of real
life to few readers does it occur that these are all ideal creations
of a poet's brain and that in sober truth no such knot of merry
roisterers ever enlivened the dull neighborhood of eastcheap

for my part i love to give myself up to the illusions of poetry a hero
of fiction that never existed is just as valuable to me as a hero of
history that existed a thousand years since and if i may be excused
such an insensibility to the common ties of human nature i would not
give up fat jack for half the great men of ancient chronicle what
have the heroes of yore done for me or men like me they have conquered
countries of which i do not enjoy an acre or they have gained laurels
of which i do not inherit a leaf or they have furnished examples of
hair-brained prowess which i have neither the opportunity nor the
inclination to follow but old jack falstaff kind jack falstaff sweet
jack falstaff has enlarged the boundaries of human enjoyment he has
added vast regions of wit and good-humor in which the poorest man may
revel and has bequeathed a never-failing inheritance of jolly laughter
to make mankind merrier and better to the latest posterity

a thought suddenly struck me i will make a pilgrimage to eastcheap
said i closing the book and see if the old boar's head tavern still
exists who knows but i may light upon some legendary traces of dame
quickly and her guests at any rate there will be a kindred pleasure in
treading the halls once vocal with their mirth to that the toper enjoys
in smelling to the empty cask once filled with generous wine

the resolution was no sooner formed than put in execution i forbear to
treat of the various adventures and wonders i encountered in my travels
of the haunted regions of cock lane of the faded glories of little
britain and the parts adjacent what perils i ran in cateaton street
and old jewry of the renowned guildhall and its two stunted giants the
pride and wonder of the city and the terror of all unlucky urchins and
how i visited london stone and struck my staff upon it in imitation of
that arch-rebel jack cade

let it suffice to say that i at length arrived in merry eastcheap that
ancient region of wit and wassail where the very names of the streets
relished of good cheer as pudding lane bears testimony even at the
present day for eastcheap says old stow was always famous for its
convivial doings the cookes cried hot ribbes of beef roasted pies well
baked and other victuals there was clattering of pewter pots harpe
pipe and sawtrie alas how sadly is the scene changed since the
roaring days of falstaff and old stow the madcap roisterer has given
place to the plodding tradesman the clattering of pots and the sound of
harpe and sawtrie to the din of carts and the accurst dinging of the
dustman's bell and no song is heard save haply the strain of some
syren from billingsgate chanting the eulogy of deceased mackerel

i sought in vain for the ancient abode of dame quickly the only
relict of it is a boar's head carved in relief in stone which formerly
served as the sign but at present is built into the parting line of two
houses which stand on the site of the renowned old tavern

for the history of this little abode of good fellowship i was referred
to a tallow-chandler's widow opposite who had been born and brought up
on the spot and was looked up to as the indisputable chronicler of the
neighborhood i found her seated in a little back parlor the window
of which looked out upon a yard about eight feet square laid out as a
flower-garden while a glass door opposite afforded a distant view of
the street through a vista of soap and tallow candles the two views
which comprised in all probability her prospects in life and the
little world in which she had lived and moved and had her being for the
better part of a century

to be versed in the history of eastcheap great and little from london
stone even unto the monument was doubtless in her opinion to be
acquainted with the history of the universe yet with all this she
possessed the simplicity of true wisdom and that liberal communicative
disposition which i have generally remarked in intelligent old ladies
knowing in the concerns of their neighborhood

her information however did not extend far back into antiquity she
could throw no light upon the history of the boar's head from the time
that dame quickly espoused the valiant pistol until the great fire of
london when it was unfortunately burnt down it was soon rebuilt
and continued to flourish under the old name and sign until a dying
landlord struck with remorse for double scores bad measures and
other iniquities which are incident to the sinful race of publicans
endeavored to make his peace with heaven by bequeathing the tavern to
st michael's church crooked lane toward the supporting of a chaplain
for some time the vestry meetings were regularly held there but it
was observed that the old boar never held up his head under church
government he gradually declined and finally gave his last gasp about
thirty years since the tavern was then turned into shops but she
informed me that a picture of it was still preserved in st michael's
church which stood just in the rear to get a sight of this picture
was now my determination so having informed myself of the abode of
the sexton i took my leave of the venerable chronicler of eastcheap my
visit having doubtless raised greatly her opinion of her legendary lore
and furnished an important incident in the history of her life

it cost me some difficulty and much curious inquiry to ferret out the
humble hanger-on to the church i had to explore crooked lane and divers
little alleys and elbows and dark passages with which this old city is
perforated like an ancient cheese or a worm-eaten chest of drawers
at length i traced him to a corner of a small court surrounded by lofty
houses where the inhabitants enjoy about as much of the face of heaven
as a community of frogs at the bottom of a well

the sexton was a meek acquiescing little man of a bowing lowly habit
yet he had a pleasant twinkling in his eye and if encouraged would
now and then hazard a small pleasantry such as a man of his low estate
might venture to make in the company of high churchwardens and other
mighty men of the earth i found him in company with the deputy
organist seated apart like milton's angels discoursing no doubt
on high doctrinal points and settling the affairs of the church over a
friendly pot of ale for the lower classes of english seldom deliberate
on any weighty matter without the assistance of a cool tankard to clear
their understandings i arrived at the moment when they had finished
their ale and their argument and were about to repair to the church
to put it in order so having made known my wishes i received their
gracious permission to accompany them

the church of st michael's crooked lane standing a short distance
from billingsgate is enriched with the tombs of many fishmongers
of renown and as every profession has its galaxy of glory and
its constellation of great men i presume the monument of a mighty
fishmonger of the olden time is regarded with as much reverence by
succeeding generations of the craft as poets feel on contemplating the
tomb of virgil or soldiers the monument of a marlborough or turenne

i cannot but turn aside while thus speaking of illustrious men to
observe that st michael's crooked lane contains also the ashes of
that doughty champion william walworth knight who so manfully clove
down the sturdy wight wat tyler in smithfield a hero worthy of
honorable blazon as almost the only lord mayor on record famous for
deeds of arms the sovereigns of cockney being generally renowned as the
most pacific of all potentates


 the following was the ancient inscription on the monument
 of this worthy which unhappily was destroyed in the great
 conflagration

 hereunder lyth a man of fame
 william walworth callyd by name
 fishmonger he was in lyfftime here
 and twise lord maior as in books appere
 who with courage stout and manly myght
 slew jack straw in kyng richard's sight
 for which act done and trew entent
 the kyng made him knyght incontinent
 and gave him armes as here you see
 to declare his fact and chivaldrie
 he left this lyff the yere of our god
 thirteen hundred fourscore and three odd

an error in the foregoing inscription has been corrected by the
venerable stow whereas saith he it hath been far spread abroad by
vulgar opinion that the rebel smitten down so manfully by sir william
walworth the then worthy lord maior was named jack straw and not wat
tyler i thought good to reconcile this rash-conceived doubt by such
testimony as i find in ancient and good records the principal leaders
or captains of the commons were wat tyler as the first man the
second was john or jack straw etc etc stow's london


adjoining the church in a small cemetery immediately under the back
window of what was once the boar's head stands the tombstone of robert
preston whilom drawer at the tavern it is now nearly a century since
this trusty drawer of good liquor closed his bustling career and was
thus quietly deposited within call of his customers as i was clearing
away the weeds from his epitaph the little sexton drew me on one side
with a mysterious air and informed me in a low voice that once upon
a time on a dark wintry night when the wind was unruly howling and
whistling banging about doors and windows and twirling weathercocks
so that the living were frightened out of their beds and even the dead
could not sleep quietly in their graves the ghost of honest preston
which happened to be airing itself in the churchyard was attracted
by the well-known call of waiter from the boar's head and made its
sudden appearance in the midst of a roaring club just as the parish
clerk was singing a stave from the mirre garland of captain death to
the discomfiture of sundry train-band captains and the conversion of an
infidel attorney who became a zealous christian on the spot and
was never known to twist the truth afterwards except in the way of
business

i beg it may be remembered that i do not pledge myself for the
authenticity of this anecdote though it is well known that the
churchyards and by-corners of this old metropolis are very much infested
with perturbed spirits and every one must have heard of the cock lane
ghost and the apparition that guards the regalia in the tower which has
frightened so many bold sentinels almost out of their wits

be all this as it may this robert preston seems to have been a worthy
successor to the nimbletongued francis who attended upon the revels of
prince hal to have been equally prompt with his anon anon sir
and to have transcended his predecessor in honesty for falstaff the
veracity of whose taste no man will venture to impeach flatly accuses
francis of putting lime in his sack whereas honest preston's epitaph
lands him for the sobriety of his conduct the soundness of his wine
and the fairness of his measure the worthy dignitaries of the church
however did not appear much captivated by the sober virtues of the
tapster the deputy organist who had a moist look out of the eye made
some shrewd remark on the abstemiousness of a man brought up among
full hogsheads and the little sexton corroborated his opinion by a
significant wink and a dubious shake of the head


 as this inscription is rife with excellent morality i
 transcribe it for the admonition of delinquent tapsters it
 is no doubt the production of some choice spirit who once
 frequented the boar's head

 bacchus to give the toping world surprise
 produced one sober son and here he lies
 though rear'd among full hogsheads he defy'd
 the charms of wine and every one beside
 o reader if to justice thou rt inclined
 keep honest preston daily in thy mind
 he drew good wine took care to fill his pots
 had sundry virtues that excused his faults
 you that on bacchus have the like dependence
 pray copy bob in measure and attendance


thus far my researches though they threw much light on the history of
tapsters fishmongers and lord mayors yet disappointed me in the
great object of my quest the picture of the boar's head tavern no
such painting was to be found in the church of st michael's marry and
amen said i here endeth my research so i was giving the matter
up with the air of a baffled antiquary when my friend the sexton
perceiving me to be curious in everything relative to the old tavern
offered to show me the choice vessels of the vestry which had been
handed down from remote times when the parish meetings were held at the
boar's head these were deposited in the parish club-room which had
been transferred on the decline of the ancient establishment to a
tavern in the neighborhood

a few steps brought us to the house which stands no miles lane
bearing the title of the mason's arms and is kept by master edward
honeyball the bully-rock of the establishment it is one of those
little taverns which abound in the heart of the city and form the centre
of gossip and intelligence of the neighborhood we entered the barroom
which was narrow and darkling for in these close lanes but few rays of
reflected light are enabled to struggle down to the inhabitants whose
broad day is at best but a tolerable twilight the room was partitioned
into boxes each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth
ready for dinner this showed that the guests were of the good old
stamp and divided their day equally for it was but just one o'clock
at the lower end of the room was a clear coal fire before which a
breast of lamb was roasting a row of bright brass candlesticks and
pewter mugs glistened along the mantelpiece and an old fashioned clock
ticked in one corner there was something primitive in this medley of
kitchen parlor and hall that carried me back to earlier times and
pleased me the place indeed was humble but everything had that look
of order and neatness which bespeaks the superintendence of a notable
english housewife a group of amphibious-looking beings who might be
either fishermen or sailors were regaling themselves in one of the
boxes as i was a visitor of rather higher pretensions i was ushered
into a little misshapen back room having at least nine corners it was
lighted by a sky-light furnished with antiquated leathern chairs and
ornamented with the portrait of a fat pig it was evidently appropriated
to particular customers and i found a shabby gentleman in a red nose
and oil-cloth hat seated in one corner meditating on a half empty pot of
porter

the old sexton had taken the landlady aside and with an air of profound
importance imparted to her my errand dame honeyball was a likely
plump bustling little woman and no bad substitute for that paragon
of hostesses dame quickly she seemed delighted with an opportunity to
oblige and hurrying upstairs to the archives of her house where
the precious vessels of the parish club were deposited she returned
smiling and courtesying with them in her hands

the first she presented me was a japanned iron tobacco-box of gigantic
size out of which i was told the vestry had smoked at their stated
meetings since time immemorial and which was never suffered to be
profaned by vulgar hands or used on common occasions i received it
with becoming reverence but what was my delight at beholding on
its cover the identical painting of which i was in quest there was
displayed the outside of the boar's head tavern and before the door was
to be seen the whole convivial group at table in full revel pictured
with that wonderful fidelity and force with which the portraits of
renowned generals and commodores are illustrated on tobacco-boxes for
the benefit of posterity lest however there should be any mistake
the cunning limner had warily inscribed the names of prince hal and
falstaff on the bottoms of their chairs

on the inside of the cover was an inscription nearly obliterated
recording that this box was the gift of sir richard gore for the use of
the vestry meetings at the boar's head tavern and that it was repaired
and beautified by his successor mr john packard such is a
faithful description of this august and venerable relic and i question
whether the learned scriblerius contemplated his roman shield or
the knights of the round table the long-sought san-greal with more
exultation

while i was meditating on it with enraptured gaze dame honeyball
who was highly gratified by the interest it excited put in my hands
a drinking-cup or goblet which also belonged to the vestry and was
descended from the old boar's head it bore the inscription of having
been the gift of francis wythers knight and was held she told me in
exceeding great value being considered very antyke this last opinion
was strengthened by the shabby gentleman with the red nose and oilcloth
hat and whom i strongly suspected of being a lineal descendant from the
variant bardolph he suddenly aroused from his meditation on the pot of
porter and casting a knowing look at the goblet exclaimed ay ay
the head don't ache now that made that there article

the great importance attached to this memento of ancient revelry by
modern churchwardens at first puzzled me but there is nothing sharpens
the apprehension so much as antiquarian research for i immediately
perceived that this could be no other than the identical parcel-gilt
goblet on which falstaff made his loving but faithless vow to dame
quickly and which would of course be treasured up with care among the
regalia of her domains as a testimony of that solemn contract


 thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet sitting
 in my dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea-coal
 fire on wednesday in whitsun-week when the prince broke
 thy head for likening his father to a singing man at
 windsor thou didst swear to me then as i was washing thy
 wound to marry me and make me my lady thy wife canst
 thou deny it henry iv part 


mine hostess indeed gave me a long history how the goblet had been
handed down from generation to generation she also entertained me
with many particulars concerning the worthy vestrymen who have seated
themselves thus quietly on the stools of the ancient roisterers of
eastcheap and like so many commentators utter clouds of smoke in
honor of shakespeare these i forbear to relate lest my readers should
not be as curious in these matters as myself suffice it to say the
neighbors one and all about eastcheap believe that falstaff and his
merry crew actually lived and revelled there nay there are several
legendary anecdotes concerning him still extant among the oldest
frequenters of the mason's arms which they give as transmitted down
from their forefathers and mr m'kash an irish hair-dresser whose
shop stands on the site of the old boar's head has several dry jokes
of fat jack's not laid down in the books with which he makes his
customers ready to die of laughter

i now turned to my friend the sexton to make some further inquiries but
i found him sunk in pensive meditation his head had declined a little
on one side a deep sigh heaved from the very bottom of his stomach
and though i could not see a tear trembling in his eye yet a moisture
was evidently stealing from a corner of his mouth i followed the
direction of his eye through the door which stood open and found it
fixed wistfully on the savory breast of lamb roasting in dripping
richness before the fire

i now called to mind that in the eagerness of my recondite
investigation i was keeping the poor man from his dinner my bowels
yearned with sympathy and putting in his hand a small token of my
gratitude and goodness i departed with a hearty benediction on him
dame honeyball and the parish club of crooked lane not forgetting my
shabby but sententious friend in the oil-cloth hat and copper nose

thus have i given a tedious brief account of this interesting
research for which if it prove too short and unsatisfactory i can
only plead my inexperience in this branch of literature so deservedly
popular at the present day i am aware that a more skilful illustrator
of the immortal bard would have swelled the materials i have touched
upon to a good merchantable bulk comprising the biographies of william
walworth jack straw and robert preston some notice of the eminent
fishmongers of st michael's the history of eastcheap great and
little private anecdotes of dame honeyball and her pretty daughter
whom i have not even mentioned to say nothing of a damsel tending the
breast of lamb and whom by the way i remarked to be a comely lass
with a neat foot and ankle the whole enlivened by the riots of wat
tyler and illuminated by the great fire of london

all this i leave as a rich mine to be worked by future commentators
nor do i despair of seeing the tobacco-box and the parcel-gilt goblet
which i have thus brought to light the subject of future engravings
and almost as fruitful of voluminous dissertations and disputes as the
shield of achilles or the far-famed portland vase




the mutability of literature

a colloquy in westminster abbey

 i know that all beneath the moon decays
 and what by mortals in this world is brought
 in time's great periods shall return to nought
 i know that all the muses heavenly rays
 with toil of sprite which are so dearly bought
 as idle sounds of few or none are sought 
 that there is nothing lighter than mere praise
 drummond of hawthornden

there are certain half-dreaming moods of mind in which we naturally
steal away from noise and glare and seek some quiet haunt where we may
indulge our reveries and build our air castles undisturbed in such a
mood i was loitering about the old gray cloisters of westminster abbey
enjoying that luxury of wandering thought which one is apt to dignify
with the name of reflection when suddenly an irruption of madcap boys
from westminster school playing at football broke in upon the monastic
stillness of the place making the vaulted passages and mouldering tombs
echo with their merriment i sought to take refuge from their noise by
penetrating still deeper into the solitudes of the pile and applied to
one of the vergers for admission to the library he conducted me through
a portal rich with the crumbling sculpture of former ages which opened
upon a gloomy passage leading to the chapter-house and the chamber in
which doomsday book is deposited just within the passage is a small
door on the left to this the verger applied a key it was double
locked and opened with some difficulty as if seldom used we now
ascended a dark narrow staircase and passing through a second door
entered the library

i found myself in a lofty antique hall the roof supported by massive
joists of old english oak it was soberly lighted by a row of gothic
windows at a considerable height from the floor and which apparently
opened upon the roofs of the cloisters an ancient picture of some
reverend dignitary of the church in his robes hung over the fireplace
around the hall and in a small gallery were the books arranged in
carved oaken cases they consisted principally of old polemical writers
and were much more worn by time than use in the centre of the library
was a solitary table with two or three books on it an inkstand without
ink and a few pens parched by long disuse the place seemed fitted
for quiet study and profound meditation it was buried deep among the
massive walls of the abbey and shut up from the tumult of the world
i could only hear now and then the shouts of the school-boys faintly
swelling from the cloisters and the sound of a bell tolling for prayers
echoing soberly along the roofs of the abbey by degrees the shouts of
merriment grew fainter and fainter and at length died away the bell
ceased to toll and a profound silence reigned through the dusky hall

i had taken down a little thick quarto curiously bound in parchment
with brass clasps and seated myself at the table in a venerable
elbow-chair instead of reading however i was beguiled by the solemn
monastic air and lifeless quiet of the place into a train of musing
as i looked around upon the old volumes in their mouldering covers thus
ranged on the shelves and apparently never disturbed in their repose
i could not but consider the library a kind of literary catacomb where
authors like mummies are piously entombed and left to blacken and
moulder in dusty oblivion

how much thought i has each of these volumes now thrust aside with
such indifference cost some aching head how many weary days how
many sleepless nights how have their authors buried themselves in the
solitude of cells and cloisters shut themselves up from the face of
man and the still more blessed face of nature and devoted themselves
to painful research and intense reflection and all for what to occupy
an inch of dusty shelf to have the titles of their works read now and
then in a future age by some drowsy churchman or casual straggler like
myself and in another age to be lost even to remembrance such is the
amount of this boasted immortality a mere temporary rumor a local
sound like the tone of that bell which has tolled among these towers
filling the ear for a moment lingering transiently in echo and then
passing away like a thing that was not

while i sat half-murmuring half-meditating these unprofitable
speculations with my head resting on my hand i was thrumming with the
other hand upon the quarto until i accidentally loosened the clasps
when to my utter astonishment the little book gave two or three yawns
like one awaking from a deep sleep then a husky hem and at length
began to talk at first its voice was very hoarse and broken being much
troubled by a cobweb which some studious spider had woven across it and
having probably contracted a cold from long exposure to the chills and
damps of the abbey in a short time however it became more distinct
and i soon found it an exceedingly fluent conversable little tome
its language to be sure was rather quaint and obsolete and its
pronunciation what in the present day would be deemed barbarous but i
shall endeavor as far as i am able to render it in modern parlance

it began with railings about the neglect of the world about merit being
suffered to languish in obscurity and other such commonplace topics of
literary repining and complained bitterly that it had not been opened
for more than two centuries that the dean only looked now and then into
the library sometimes took down a volume or two trifled with them for
a few moments and then returned them to their shelves what a plague
do they mean said the little quarto which i began to perceive was
somewhat choleric what a plague do they mean by keeping several
thousand volumes of us shut up here and watched by a set of old
vergers like so many beauties in a harem merely to be looked at now
and then by the dean books were written to give pleasure and to be
enjoyed and i would have a rule passed that the dean should pay each of
us a visit at least once a year or if he is not equal to the task let
them once in a while turn loose the whole school of westminster among
us that at any rate we may now and then have an airing

softly my worthy friend replied i you are not aware how much
better you are off than most books of your generation by being stored
away in this ancient library you are like the treasured remains of those
saints and monarchs which lie enshrined in the adjoining chapels while
the remains of their contemporary mortals left to the ordinary course
of nature have long since returned to dust

sir said the little tome ruffling his leaves and looking big i
was written for all the world not for the bookworms of an abbey i was
intended to circulate from hand to hand like other great contemporary
works but here have i been clasped up for more than two centuries and
might have silently fallen a prey to these worms that are playing the
very vengeance with my intestines if you had not by chance given me an
opportunity of uttering a few last words before i go to pieces

my good friend rejoined i had you been left to the circulation of
which you speak you would long ere this have been no more to judge
from your physiognomy you are now well stricken in years very few of
your contemporaries can be at present in existence and those few owe
their longevity to being immured like yourself in old libraries which
suffer me to add instead of likening to harems you might more properly
and gratefully have compared to those infirmaries attached to religious
establishments for the benefit of the old and decrepit and where by
quiet fostering and no employment they often endure to an amazingly
good-for-nothing old age you talk of your contemporaries as if in
circulation where do we meet with their works what do we hear of
robert grosteste of lincoln no one could have toiled harder than he for
immortality he is said to have written nearly two hundred volumes he
built as it were a pyramid of books to perpetuate his name but
alas the pyramid has long since fallen and only a few fragments are
scattered in various libraries where they are scarcely disturbed
even by the antiquarian what do we hear of giraldus cambrensis the
historian antiquary philosopher theologian and poet he declined two
bishoprics that he might shut himself up and write for posterity but
posterity never inquires after his labors what of henry of huntingdon
who besides a learned history of england wrote a treatise on the
contempt of the world which the world has revenged by forgetting him
what is quoted of joseph of exeter styled the miracle of his age in
classical composition of his three great heroic poems one is lost
forever excepting a mere fragment the others are known only to a few
of the curious in literature and as to his love verses and epigrams
they have entirely disappeared what is in current use of john wallis
the franciscan who acquired the name of the tree of life of william
of malmsbury of simeon of durham of benedict of peterborough of john
hanvill of st albans of 

prithee friend cried the quarto in a testy tone how old do you
think me you are talking of authors that lived long before my time and
wrote either in latin or french so that they in a manner expatriated
themselves and deserved to be forgotten but i sir was ushered into
the world from the press of the renowned wynkyn de worde i was written
in my own native tongue at a time when the language had become fixed
and indeed i was considered a model of pure and elegant english

i should observe that these remarks were couched in such intolerably
antiquated terms that i have had infinite difficulty in rendering them
into modern phraseology

i cry you mercy said i for mistaking your age but it matters
little almost all the writers of your time have likewise passed into
forgetfulness and de worde's publications are mere literary rarities
among book-collectors the purity and stability of language too on
which you found your claims to perpetuity have been the fallacious
dependence of authors of every age even back to the times of the worthy
robert of gloucester who wrote his history in rhymes of mongrel saxon
even now many talk of spenser's well of pure english undefiled as
if the language ever sprang from a well or fountain-head and was not
rather a mere confluence of various tongues perpetually subject to
changes and intermixtures it is this which has made english literature
so extremely mutable and the reputation built upon it so fleeting
unless thought can be committed to something more permanent and
unchangeable than such a medium even thought must share the fate of
everything else and fall into decay this should serve as a check
upon the vanity and exultation of the most popular writer he finds
the language in which he has embarked his fame gradually altering and
subject to the dilapidations of time and the caprice of fashion he
looks back and beholds the early authors of his country once the
favorites of their day supplanted by modern writers a few short ages
have covered them with obscurity and their merits can only be relished
by the quaint taste of the bookworm and such he anticipates will be
the fate of his own work which however it may be admired in its day
and held up as a model of purity will in the course of years grow
antiquated and obsolete until it shall become almost as unintelligible
in its native land as an egyptian obelisk or one of those runic
inscriptions said to exist in the deserts of tartary i declare added
i with some emotion when i contemplate a modern library filled
with new works in all the bravery of rich gilding and binding i feel
disposed to sit down and weep like the good xerxes when he surveyed
his army pranked out in all the splendor of military array and
reflected that in one hundred years not one of them would be in
existence


 in latin and french hath many soueraine wittes had great
 delyte to endite and have many noble thinges fulfilde but
 certes there ben some that speaken their poisye in french
 of which speche the frenchmen have as good a fantasye as w
 ave in hearying of frenchmen's englishe chaucer's
 testament of love

 holinshed in his chronicle observes afterwards also
 by diligent vell f geffry chaucer and john gowre in the
 time of richard the second and after them of john scogan
 and john lydgate monke of berrie our said toong was
 brought to an excellent passe notwithstanding that it never
 came unto the type of perfection until the time of queen
 elizabeth wherein john jewell bishop of sarum john fox
 and sundrie learned and excellent writers have fully
 accomplished the ornature of the same to their great praise
 and mortal commendation


ah said the little quarto with a heavy sigh i see how it is these
in modern scribblers have superseded all the good old authors i suppose
nothing is read nowadays but sir philip sidney's arcadia sackville's
stately plays and mirror for magistrates or the fine-spun euphuisms of
the unparalleled john lyly

there you are again mistaken said i the writers whom you suppose in
vogue because they happened to be so when you were last in circulation
have long since had their day sir philip sidney's arcadia the
immortality of which was so fondly predicted by his admirers and
which in truth was full of noble thoughts delicate images and
graceful turns of language is now scarcely ever mentioned sackville
has strutted into obscurity and even lyly though his writings were
once the delight of a court and apparently perpetuated by a proverb is
now scarcely known even by name a whole crowd of authors who wrote and
wrangled at the time have likewise gone down with all their writings
and their controversies wave after wave of succeeding literature has
rolled over them until they are buried so deep that it is only now and
then that some industrious diver after fragments of antiquity brings up
a specimen for the gratification of the curious


 live ever sweete booke the simple image of his gentle
 witt and the golden pillar of his noble courage and ever
 notify unto the world that thy writer was the secretary of
 eloquence the breath of the muses the honey bee of the
 daintyest flowers of witt and arte the pith of morale and
 intellectual virtues the arme of bellona in the field the
 tongue of suada in the chamber the spirits of practise in
 esse and the paragon of excellence in print harvey
 pierce's supererogation


for my part i continued i consider this mutability of language a
wise precaution of providence for the benefit of the world at large and
of authors in particular to reason from analogy we daily behold the
varied and beautiful tribes of vegetables springing up flourishing
adorning the fields for a short time and then fading into dust to
make way for their successors were not this the case the fecundity of
nature would be a grievance instead of a blessing the earth would groan
with rank and excessive vegetation and its surface become a tangled
wilderness in like manner the works of genius and learning decline and
make way for subsequent productions language gradually varies and with
it fade away the writings of authors who have flourished their allotted
time otherwise the creative powers of genius would overstock the world
and the mind would be completely bewildered in the endless mazes of
literature formerly there were some restraints on this excessive
multiplication works had to be transcribed by hand which was a slow
and laborious operation they were written either on parchment which
was expensive so that one work was often erased to make way for
another or on papyrus which was fragile and extremely perishable
authorship was a limited and unprofitable craft pursued chiefly by
monks in the leisure and solitude of their cloisters the accumulation
of manuscripts was slow and costly and confined almost entirely to
monasteries to these circumstances it may in some measure be owing
that we have not been inundated by the intellect of antiquity that the
fountains of thought have not been broken up and modern genius drowned
in the deluge but the inventions of paper and the press have put an end
to all these restraints they have made every one a writer and enabled
every mind to pour itself into print and diffuse itself over the
whole intellectual world the consequences are alarming the stream of
literature has swollen into a torrent augmented into a river-expanded
into a sea a few centuries since five or six hundred manuscripts
constituted a great library but what would you say to libraries such
as actually exist containing three or four hundred thousand volumes
legions of authors at the same time busy and the press going on with
fearfully increasing activity to double and quadruple the number
unless some unforeseen mortality should break out among the progeny of
the muse now that she has become so prolific i tremble for posterity
i fear the mere fluctuation of language will not be sufficient
criticism may do much it increases with the increase of literature
and resembles one of those salutary checks on population spoken of by
economists all possible encouragement therefore should be given to
the growth of critics good or bad but i fear all will be in vain let
criticism do what it may writers will write printers will print and
the world will inevitably be overstocked with good books it will soon
be the employment of a lifetime merely to learn their names many a man
of passable information at the present day reads scarcely anything but
reviews and before long a man of erudition will be little better than a
mere walking catalogue

my very good sir said the little quarto yawning most drearily in my
face excuse my interrupting you but i perceive you are rather given
to prose i would ask the fate of an author who was making some noise
just as i left the world his reputation however was considered quite
temporary the learned shook their heads at him for he was a poor
half-educated varlet that knew little of latin and nothing of greek
and had been obliged to run the country for deer-stealing i think his
name was shakespeare i presume he soon sunk into oblivion

on the contrary said i it is owing to that very man that the
literature of his period has experienced a duration beyond the ordinary
term of english literature there rise authors now and then who seem
proof against the mutability of language because they have rooted
themselves in the unchanging principles of human nature they are like
gigantic trees that we sometimes see on the banks of a stream which
by their vast and deep roots penetrating through the mere surface and
laying hold on the very foundations of the earth preserve the soil
around them from being swept away by the ever-flowing current and hold
up many a neighboring plant and perhaps worthless weed to perpetuity
such is the case with shakespeare whom we behold defying the
encroachments of time retaining in modern use the language and
literature of his day and giving duration to many an indifferent
author merely from having flourished in his vicinity but even he i
grieve to say is gradually assuming the tint of age and his whole form
is overrun by a profusion of commentators who like clambering vines
and creepers almost bury the noble plant that upholds them

here the little quarto began to heave his sides and chuckle until at
length he broke out into a plethoric fit of laughter that had wellnigh
choked him by reason of his excessive corpulency mighty well cried
he as soon as he could recover breath mighty well and so you would
persuade me that the literature of an age is to be perpetuated by a
vagabond deer-stealer by a man without learning by a poet forsooth a
poet and here he wheezed forth another fit of laughter

i confess that i felt somewhat nettled at this rudeness which however
i pardoned on account of his having flourished in a less polished age i
determined nevertheless not to give up my point

yes resumed i positively a poet for of all writers he has the best
chance for immortality others may write from the head but he writes
from the heart and the heart will always understand him he is the
faithful portrayer of nature whose features are always the same and
always interesting prose writers are voluminous and unwieldy their
pages crowded with commonplaces and their thoughts expanded into
tediousness but with the true poet every thing is terse touching or
brilliant he gives the choicest thoughts in the choicest language he
illustrates them by everything that he sees most striking in nature and
art he enriches them by pictures of human life such as it is passing
before him his writings therefore contain the spirit the aroma if i
may use the phrase of the age in which he lives they are caskets which
inclose within a small compass the wealth of the language its family
jewels which are thus transmitted in a portable form to posterity the
setting may occasionally be antiquated and require now and then to be
renewed as in the case of chaucer but the brilliancy and intrinsic
value of the gems continue unaltered cast a look back over the long
reach of literary history what vast valleys of dulness filled with
monkish legends and academical controversies what bogs of theological
speculations what dreary wastes of metaphysics here and there only
do we behold the heaven-illumined bards elevated like beacons on
their widely-separated heights to transmit the pure light of poetical
intelligence from age to age

i was just about to launch forth into eulogiums upon the poets of the
day when the sudden opening of the door caused me to turn my head it
was the verger who came to inform me that it was time to close the
library i sought to have a parting word with the quarto but the worthy
little tome was silent the clasps were closed and it looked perfectly
unconscious of all that had passed i have been to the library two
or three times since and have endeavored to draw it into further
conversation but in vain and whether all this rambling colloquy
actually took place or whether it was another of those old day-dreams
to which i am subject i have never to this moment been able to
discover

rural funerals

 here's a few flowers but about midnight more

 the herbs that have oil them cold dew o the night
 are strewings fitt'st for graves 
 you were as flowers now withered even so
 these herblets shall which we upon you strow
 cymbeline

among the beautiful and simple-hearted customs of rural life which still
linger in some parts of england are those of strewing flowers before the
funerals and planting them at the graves of departed friends these it
is said are the remains of some of the rites of the primitive church
but they are of still higher antiquity having been observed among the
greeks and romans and frequently mentioned by their writers and were
no doubt the spontaneous tributes of unlettered affection originating
long before art had tasked itself to modulate sorrow into song or story
it on the monument they are now only to be met with in the most distant
and retired places of the kingdom where fashion and innovation have not
been able to throng in and trample out all the curious and interesting
traces of the olden time

in glamorganshire we are told the bed whereon the corpse lies is
covered with flowers a custom alluded to in one of the wild and
plaintive ditties of ophelia

 white his shroud as the mountain snow

 larded all with sweet flowers
 which be-wept to the grave did go
 with true love showers

there is also a most delicate and beautiful rite observed in some of
the remote villages of the south at the funeral of a female who has
died young and unmarried a chaplet of white flowers is borne before
the corpse by a young girl nearest in age size and resemblance and
is afterwards hung up in the church over the accustomed seat of the
deceased these chaplets are sometimes made of white paper in imitation
of flowers and inside of them is generally a pair of white gloves they
are intended as emblems of the purity of the deceased and the crown of
glory which she has received in heaven

in some parts of the country also the dead are carried to the grave
with the singing of psalms and hymns a kind of triumph to show says
bourne that they have finished their course with joy and are become
conquerors this i am informed is observed in some of the northern
counties particularly in northumberland and it has a pleasing though
melancholy effect to hear of a still evening in some lonely country
scene the mournful melody of a funeral dirge swelling from a distance
and to see the train slowly moving along the landscape

 thus thus and thus we compass round
 thy harmless and unhaunted ground
 and as we sing thy dirge we will
 the daffodill
 and other flowers lay upon
 the altar of our love thy stone
 herrick

there is also a solemn respect paid by the traveller to the passing
funeral in these sequestered places for such spectacles occurring
among the quiet abodes of nature sink deep into the soul as the
mourning train approaches he pauses uncovered to let it go by he then
follows silently in the rear sometimes quite to the grave at other
times for a few hundred yards and having paid this tribute of respect
to the deceased turns and resumes his journey

the rich vein of melancholy which runs through the english character
and gives it some of its most touching and ennobling graces is finely
evidenced in these pathetic customs and in the solicitude shown by the
common people for an honored and a peaceful grave the humblest peasant
whatever may be his lowly lot while living is anxious that some little
respect may be paid to his remains sir thomas overbury describing the
faire and happy milkmaid observes thus lives she and all her care
is that she may die in the spring-time to have store of flowers stucke
upon her winding-sheet the poets too who always breathe the feeling
of a nation continually advert to this fond solicitude about the grave
in the maid's tragedy by beaumont and fletcher there is a beautiful
instance of the kind describing the capricious melancholy of a
broken-hearted girl

 when she sees a bank
 stuck full of flowers she with a sigh will tell
 her servants what a pretty place it were
 to bury lovers in and made her maids
 bluck em and strew her over like a corse

the custom of decorating graves was once universally prevalent osiers
were carefully bent over them to keep the turf uninjured and about
them were planted evergreens and flowers we adorn their graves says
evelyn in his sylva with flowers and redolent plants just emblems
of the life of man which has been compared in holy scriptures to those
fading beauties whose roots being buried in dishonor rise again in
glory this usage has now become extremely rare in england but it
may still be met with in the churchyards of retired villages among the
welsh mountains and i recollect an instance of it at the small town of
ruthven which lies at the head of the beautiful vale of clewyd i have
been told also by a friend who was present at the funeral of a young
girl in glamorganshire that the female attendants had their aprons full
of flowers which as soon as the body was interred they stuck about
the grave

he noticed several graves which had been decorated in the same manner
as the flowers had been merely stuck in the ground and not planted
they had soon withered and might be seen in various states of decay
some drooping others quite perished they were afterwards to be
supplanted by holly rosemary and other evergreens which on some
graves had grown to great luxuriance and overshadowed the tombstones

there was formerly a melancholy fancifulness in the arrangement of these
rustic offerings that had something in it truly poetical the rose
was sometimes blended with the lily to form a general emblem of frail
mortality this sweet flower said evelyn borne on a branch set with
thorns and accompanied with the lily are natural hieroglyphics of our
fugitive umbratile anxious and transitory life which making so
fair a show for a time is not yet without its thorns and crosses the
nature and color of the flowers and of the ribbons with which they were
tied had often a particular reference to the qualities or story of the
deceased or were expressive of the feelings of the mourner in an
old poem entitled corydon's doleful knell a lover specifies the
decorations he intends to use

 a garland shall be framed
 by art and nature's skill
 of sundry-colored flowers
 in token of good-will

 and sundry-colored ribbons
 on it i will bestow
 but chiefly blacke and yellowe
 with her to grave shall go

 i'll deck her tomb with flowers
 the rarest ever seen
 and with my tears as showers
 i'll keep them fresh and green

the white rose we are told was planted at the grave of a virgin her
chaplet was tied with white ribbons in token of her spotless innocence
though sometimes black ribbons were intermingled to bespeak the grief
of the survivors the red rose was occasionally used in remembrance of
such as had been remarkable for benevolence but roses in general were
appropriated to the graves of lovers evelyn tells us that the custom
was not altogether extinct in his time near his dwelling in the county
of surrey where the maidens yearly planted and decked the graves
of their defunct sweethearts with rose-bushes and camden likewise
remarks in his britannia here is also a certain custom observed time
out of mind of planting rose-trees upon the graves especially by the
young men and maids who have lost their loves so that this churchyard
is now full of them

when the deceased had been unhappy in their loves emblems of a more
gloomy character were used such as the yew and cypress and if flowers
were strewn they were of the most melancholy colors thus in poems by
thomas stanley esq published in is the following stanza

 yet strew
 upon my dismall grave
 such offerings as you have
 forsaken cypresse and yewe
 for kinder flowers can take no birth
 or growth from such unhappy earth

in the maid's tragedy a pathetic little air is introduced
illustrative of this mode of decorating the funerals of females who had
been disappointed in love

 lay a garland on my hearse
 of the dismall yew
 maidens willow branches wear
 say i died true

 my love was false but i was firm
 from my hour of birth
 upon my buried body lie
 lightly gentle earth

the natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and elevate
the mind and we have a proof of it in the purity of sentiment and the
unaffected elegance of thought which pervaded the whole of these
funeral observances thus it was an especial precaution that none but
sweet-scented evergreens and flowers should be employed the intention
seems to have been to soften the horrors of the tomb to beguile the
mind from brooding over the disgraces of perishing mortality and
to associate the memory of the deceased with the most delicate and
beautiful objects in nature there is a dismal process going on in the
grave ere dust can return to its kindred dust which the imagination
shrinks from contemplating and we seek still to think of the form
we have loved with those refined associations which it awakened when
blooming before us in youth and beauty lay her i the earth says
laertes of his virgin sister

 and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
 may violets spring

herrick also in his dirge of jephtha pours forth a fragrant flow
of poetical thought and image which in a manner embalms the dead in the
recollections of the living

 sleep in thy peace thy bed of spice
 and make this place all paradise
 may sweets grow here and smoke from hence
 fat frankincense

 let balme and cassia send their scent
 from out thy maiden monument
 
 may all shie maids at wonted hours
 come forth to strew thy tombe with flowers
 may virgins when they come to mourn
 male incense burn
 upon thine altar then return
 and leave thee sleeping in thy urn

i might crowd my pages with extracts from the older british poets who
wrote when these rites were more prevalent and delighted frequently
to allude to them but i have already quoted more than is necessary i
cannot however refrain from giving a passage from shakespeare even
though it should appear trite which illustrates the emblematical
meaning often conveyed in these floral tributes and at the same time
possesses that magic of language and appositeness of imagery for which
he stands pre-eminent

 with fairest flowers
 whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele
 i'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
 the flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
 the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
 the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
 outsweetened not thy breath

there is certainly something more affecting in these prompt and
spontaneous offerings of nature than in the most costly monuments of
art the hand strews the flower while the heart is warm and the tear
falls on the grave as affection is binding the osier round the sod but
pathos expires under the slow labor of the chisel and is chilled among
the cold conceits of sculptured marble

it is greatly to be regretted that a custom so truly elegant and
touching has disappeared from general use and exists only in the most
remote and insignificant villages but it seems as if poetical custom
always shuns the walks of cultivated society in proportion as people
grow polite they cease to be poetical they talk of poetry but they
have learnt to check its free impulses to distrust its sallying
emotions and to supply its most affecting and picturesque usages by
studied form and pompous ceremonial few pageants can be more stately
and frigid than an english funeral in town it is made up of show and
gloomy parade mourning carriages mourning horses mourning plumes
and hireling mourners who make a mockery of grief there is a grave
digged says jeremy taylor and a solemn mourning and a great talk
in the neighborhood and when the daies are finished they shall be and
they shall be remembered no more the associate in the gay and crowded
city is soon forgotten the hurrying succession of new intimates and new
pleasures effaces him from our minds and the very scenes and circles in
which he moved are incessantly fluctuating but funerals in the country
are solemnly impressive the stroke of death makes a wider space in
the village circle and is an awful event in the tranquil uniformity
of rural life the passing bell tolls its knell in every ear it steals
with its pervading melancholy over hill and vale and saddens all the
landscape

the fixed and unchanging features of the country also perpetuate
the memory of the friend with whom we once enjoyed them who was the
companion of our most retired walks and gave animation to every lonely
scene his idea is associated with every charm of nature we hear his
voice in the echo which he once delighted to awaken his spirit haunts
the grove which he once frequented we think of him in the wild upland
solitude or amidst the pensive beauty of the valley in the freshness of
joyous morning we remember his beaming smiles and bounding gayety
and when sober evening returns with its gathering shadows and subduing
quiet we call to mind many a twilight hour of gentle talk and
sweet-souled melancholy

 each lonely place shall him restore
 for him the tear be duly shed
 beloved till life can charm no more
 and mourn'd till pity's self be dead

another cause that perpetuates the memory of the deceased in the country
is that the grave is more immediately in sight of the survivors they
pass it on their way to prayer it meets their eyes when their hearts
are softened by the exercises of devotion they linger about it on
the sabbath when the mind is disengaged from worldly cares and most
disposed to turn aside from present pleasures and present loves and
to sit down among the solemn mementos of the past in north wales the
peasantry kneel and pray over the graves of their deceased friends
for several sundays after the interment and where the tender rite of
strewing and planting flowers is still practised it is always renewed
on easter whitsuntide and other festivals when the season brings
the companion of former festivity more vividly to mind it is also
invariably performed by the nearest relatives and friends no menials
nor hirelings are employed and if a neighbor yields assistance it
would be deemed an insult to offer compensation

i have dwelt upon this beautiful rural custom because as it is one of
the last so is it one of the holiest offices of love the grave is
the ordeal of true affection it is there that the divine passion of the
soul manifests its superiority to the instinctive impulse of mere animal
attachment the latter must be continually refreshed and kept alive by
the presence of its object but the love that is seated in the soul can
live on long remembrance the mere inclinations of sense languish and
decline with the charms which excited them and turn with shuddering
disgust from the dismal precincts of the tomb but it is thence that
truly spiritual affection rises purified from every sensual desire and
returns like a holy flame to illumine and sanctify the heart of the
survivor

the sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be
divorced every other wound we seek to heal every other affliction
to forget but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open this
affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude where is the mother
who would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom from
her arms though every recollection is a pang where is the child that
would willingly forget the most tender of parents though to remember be
but to lament who even in the hour of agony would forget the friend
over whom he mourns who even when the tomb is closing upon the remains
of her he most loved when he feels his heart as it were crushed in
the closing of its portal would accept of consolation that must be
bought by forgetfulness no the love which survives the tomb is one of
the noblest attributes of the soul if it has its woes it has likewise
its delights and when the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed
into the gentle tear of recollection when the sudden anguish and the
convulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved is
softened away into pensive meditation on all that it was in the days of
its loveliness who would root out such a sorrow from the heart though
it may sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety
or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom yet who would
exchange it even for the song of pleasure or the burst of revelry no
there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song there is a remembrance
of the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the living oh
the grave the grave it buries every error covers every defect
extinguishes every resentment from its peaceful bosom spring none but
fond regrets and tender recollections who can look down upon the grave
even of an enemy and not feel a compunctious throb that he should ever
have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies mouldering before
him

but the grave of those we loved what a place for meditation there
it is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue
and gentleness and the thousand endearments lavished upon us almost
unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy there it is that we dwell
upon the tenderness the solemn awful tenderness of the parting
scene the bed of death with all its stifled griefs its noiseless
attendance its mute watchful assiduities the last testimonies
of expiring love the feeble fluttering thrilling oh how
thrilling pressure of the hand the faint faltering accents
struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection the last
fond look of the glazing eye turning upon us even from the threshold of
existence

ay go to the grave of buried love and meditate there settle the
account with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited every
past endearment unregarded of that departed being who can
never-never never return to be soothed by thy contrition

if thou art a child and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul or a
furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent if thou art a
husband and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole
happiness in thy arms to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth
if thou art a friend and hast ever wronged in thought or word or deed
the spirit that generously confided in thee if thou art a lover and
hast ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart which now lies
cold and still beneath thy feet then be sure that every unkind look
every ungracious word every ungentle action will come thronging back
upon thy memory and knocking dolefully at thy soul then be sure that
thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave and utter
the unheard groan and pour the unavailing tear more deep more bitter
because unheard and unavailing

then weave thy chaplet of flowers and strew the beauties of nature about
the grave console thy broken spirit if thou canst with these tender
yet futile tributes of regret but take warning by the bitterness of
this thy contrite affliction over the dead and henceforth be more
faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living

 

in writing the preceding article it was not intended to give a full
detail of the funeral customs of the english peasantry but merely to
furnish a few hints and quotations illustrative of particular rites to
be appended by way of note to another paper which has been withheld
the article swelled insensibly into its present form and this is
mentioned as an apology for so brief and casual a notice of these usages
after they have been amply and learnedly investigated in other works

i must observe also that i am well aware that this custom of adorning
graves with flowers prevails in other countries besides england indeed
in some it is much more general and is observed even by the rich and
fashionable but it is then apt to lose its simplicity and to degenerate
into affectation bright in his travels in lower hungary tells of
monuments of marble and recesses formed for retirement with seats
placed among bowers of greenhouse plants and that the graves generally
are covered with the gayest flowers of the season he gives a casual
picture of filial piety which i cannot but transcribe for i trust it is
as useful as it is delightful to illustrate the amiable virtues of the
sex when i was at berlin says he i followed the celebrated iffland
to the grave mingled with some pomp you might trace much real feeling
in the midst of the ceremony my attention was attracted by a young
woman who stood on a mound of earth newly covered with turf which she
anxiously protected from the feet of the passing crowd it was the tomb
of her parent and the figure of this affectionate daughter presented a
monument more striking than the most costly work of art

i will barely add an instance of sepulchral decoration that i once
met with among the mountains of switzerland it was at the village of
gersau which stands on the borders of the lake of lucerne at the foot
of mount rigi it was once the capital of a miniature republic shut up
between the alps and the lake and accessible on the land side only by
footpaths the whole force of the republic did not exceed six hundred
fighting men and a few miles of circumference scooped out as it were
from the bosom of the mountains comprised its territory the village
of gersau seemed separated from the rest of the world and retained
the golden simplicity of a purer age it had a small church with a
burying-ground adjoining at the heads of the graves were placed crosses
of wood or iron on some were affixed miniatures rudely executed but
evidently attempts at likenesses of the deceased on the crosses
were hung chaplets of flowers some withering others fresh as if
occasionally renewed i paused with interest at this scene i felt
that i was at the source of poetical description for these were the
beautiful but unaffected offerings of the heart which poets are fain to
record in a gayer and more populous place i should have suspected them
to have been suggested by factitious sentiment derived from books but
the good people of gersau knew little of books there was not a novel
nor a love-poem in the village and i question whether any peasant of
the place dreamt while he was twining a fresh chaplet for the grave of
his mistress that he was fulfilling one of the most fanciful rites of
poetical devotion and that he was practically a poet




the inn kitchen

 shall i not take mine ease in mine inn
 falstaff

during a journey that i once made through the netherlands i had arrived
one evening at the pomme d'or the principal inn of a small flemish
village it was after the hour of the table d'hote so that i was
obliged to make a solitary supper from the relics of its ampler board
the weather was chilly i was seated alone in one end of a great gloomy
dining-room and my repast being over i had the prospect before me
of a long dull evening without any visible means of enlivening it i
summoned mine host and requested something to read he brought me the
whole literary stock of his household a dutch family bible an almanac
in the same language and a number of old paris newspapers as i sat
dozing over one of the latter reading old news and stale criticisms
my ear was now and then struck with bursts of laughter which seemed to
proceed from the kitchen every one that has travelled on the continent
must know how favorite a resort the kitchen of a country inn is to the
middle and inferior order of travellers particularly in that equivocal
kind of weather when a fire becomes agreeable toward evening i threw
aside the newspaper and explored my way to the kitchen to take a peep
at the group that appeared to be so merry it was composed partly of
travellers who had arrived some hours before in a diligence and partly
of the usual attendants and hangers-on of inns they were seated round
a great burnished stove that might have been mistaken for an altar at
which they were worshipping it was covered with various kitchen vessels
of resplendent brightness among which steamed and hissed a huge copper
tea-kettle a large lamp threw a strong mass of light upon the group
bringing out many odd features in strong relief its yellow rays
partially illumined the spacious kitchen dying duskily away into remote
corners except where they settled in mellow radiance on the broad side
of a flitch of bacon or were reflected back from well-scoured utensils
that gleamed from the midst of obscurity a strapping flemish lass
with long golden pendants in her ears and a necklace with a golden heart
suspended to it was the presiding priestess of the temple

many of the company were furnished with pipes and most of them with
some kind of evening potation i found their mirth was occasioned by
anecdotes which a little swarthy frenchman with a dry weazen face and
large whiskers was giving of his love-adventures at the end of each of
which there was one of those bursts of honest unceremonious laughter in
which a man indulges in that temple of true liberty an inn

as i had no better mode of getting through a tedious blustering evening
i took my seat near the stove and listened to a variety of travellers
tales some very extravagant and most very dull all of them however
have faded from my treacherous memory except one which i will endeavor
to relate i fear however it derived its chief zest from the manner in
which it was told and the peculiar air and appearance of the narrator
he was a corpulent old swiss who had the look of a veteran traveller
he was dressed in a tarnished green travelling-jacket with a broad belt
round his waist and a pair of overalls with buttons from the hips to
the ankles he was of a full rubicund countenance with a double chin
aquiline nose and a pleasant twinkling eye his hair was light and
curled from under an old green velvet travelling-cap stuck on one side
of his head he was interrupted more than once by the arrival of guests
or the remarks of his auditors and paused now and then to replenish his
pipe at which times he had generally a roguish leer and a sly joke for
the buxom kitchen-maid

i wish my readers could imagine the old fellow lolling in a huge
arm-chair one arm a-kimbo the other holding a curiously twisted
tobacco-pipe formed of genuine ecume de mer decorated with silver chain
and silken tassel his head cocked on one side and a whimsical cut of
the eye occasionally as he related the following story




the spectre bridegroom

a traveller's tale

 he that supper for is dight
 he lyes full cold i trow this night
 yestreen to chamber i him led
 this night gray-steel has made his bed
 sir eger sir grahame and sir gray-steel

on the summit of one of the heights of the odenwald a wild and romantic
tract of upper germany that lies not far from the confluence of the
main and the rhine there stood many many years since the castle of the
baron von landshort it is now quite fallen to decay and almost
buried among beech trees and dark firs above which however its old
watch-tower may still be seen struggling like the former possessor i
have mentioned to carry a high head and look down upon the neighboring
country

the baron was a dry branch of the great family of katzenellenbogen
and inherited the relics of the property and all the pride of his
ancestors though the warlike disposition of his predecessors had much
impaired the family possessions yet the baron still endeavored to keep
up some show of former state the times were peaceable and the german
nobles in general had abandoned their inconvenient old castles perched
like eagles nests among the mountains and had built more convenient
residences in the valleys still the baron remained proudly drawn up in
his little fortress cherishing with hereditary inveteracy all the
old family feuds so that he was on ill terms with some of his nearest
neighbors on account of disputes that had happened between their
great-great-grandfathers


 the erudite reader well versed in good-for-nothing lore
 will perceive that the above tale must have been suggested
 to the old swiss by a little french anecdote a circumstance
 said to have taken place in paris

 ie cat's elbow the name of a family of those parts
 and very powerful in former times the appellation we are
 told was given in compliment to a peerless dame of the
 family celebrated for a fine arm


the baron had but one child a daughter but nature when she grants but
one child always compensates by making it a prodigy and so it was with
the daughter of the baron all the nurses gossips and country cousins
assured her father that she had not her equal for beauty in all germany
and who should know better than they she had moreover been brought up
with great care under the superintendence of two maiden aunts who had
spent some years of their early life at one of the little german courts
and were skilled in all branches of knowledge necessary to the education
of a fine lady under their instructions she became a miracle of
accomplishments by the time she was eighteen she could embroider to
admiration and had worked whole histories of the saints in tapestry
with such strength of expression in their countenances that they
looked like so many souls in purgatory she could read without great
difficulty and had spelled her way through several church legends and
almost all the chivalric wonders of the heldenbuch she had even made
considerable proficiency in writing could sign her own name without
missing a letter and so legibly that her aunts could read it without
spectacles she excelled in making little elegant good-for-nothing
lady-like knicknacks of all kinds was versed in the most abstruse
dancing of the day played a number of airs on the harp and guitar and
knew all the tender ballads of the minnelieders by heart

her aunts too having been great flirts and coquettes in their younger
days were admirably calculated to be vigilant guardians and strict
censors of the conduct of their niece for there is no duenna so rigidly
prudent and inexorably decorous as a superannuated coquette she was
rarely suffered out of their sight never went beyond the domains of
the castle unless well attended or rather well watched had continual
lectures read to her about strict decorum and implicit obedience and
as to the men pah she was taught to hold them at such a distance and
in such absolute distrust that unless properly authorized she would
not have cast a glance upon the handsomest cavalier in the world no
not if he were even dying at her feet

the good effects of this system were wonderfully apparent the young
lady was a pattern of docility and correctness while others were
wasting their sweetness in the glare of the world and liable to be
plucked and thrown aside by every hand she was coyly blooming into
fresh and lovely womanhood under the protection of those immaculate
spinsters like a rosebud blushing forth among guardian thorns her
aunts looked upon her with pride and exultation and vaunted that
though all the other young ladies in the world might go astray yet
thank heaven nothing of the kind could happen to the heiress of
katzenellenbogen

but however scantily the baron von landshort might be provided with
children his household was by no means a small one for providence
had enriched him with abundance of poor relations they one and all
possessed the affectionate disposition common to humble relatives were
wonderfully attached to the baron and took every possible occasion
to come in swarms and enliven the castle all family festivals were
commemorated by these good people at the baron's expense and when they
were filled with good cheer they would declare that there was nothing
on earth so delightful as these family meetings these jubilees of the
heart

the baron though a small man had a large soul and it swelled with
satisfaction at the consciousness of being the greatest man in the
little world about him he loved to tell long stories about the stark
old warriors whose portraits looked grimly down from the walls around
and he found no listeners equal to those who fed at his expense he
was much given to the marvellous and a firm believer in all those
supernatural tales with which every mountain and valley in germany
abounds the faith of his guests exceeded even his own they listened
to every tale of wonder with open eyes and mouth and never failed to be
astonished even though repeated for the hundredth time thus lived the
baron von landshort the oracle of his table the absolute monarch of
his little territory and happy above all things in the persuasion
that he was the wisest man of the age

at the time of which my story treats there was a great family gathering
at the castle on an affair of the utmost importance it was to receive
the destined bridegroom of the baron's daughter a negotiation had been
carried on between the father and an old nobleman of bavaria to unite
the dignity of their houses by the marriage of their children the
preliminaries had been conducted with proper punctilio the young people
were betrothed without seeing each other and the time was appointed for
the marriage ceremony the young count von altenburg had been recalled
from the army for the purpose and was actually on his way to the
baron's to receive his bride missives had even been received from him
from wurtzburg where he was accidentally detained mentioning the day
and hour when he might be expected to arrive

the castle was in a tumult of preparation to give him a suitable
welcome the fair bride had been decked out with uncommon care the two
aunts had superintended her toilet and quarrelled the whole morning
about every article of her dress the young lady had taken advantage of
their contest to follow the bent of her own taste and fortunately
it was a good one she looked as lovely as youthful bridegroom could
desire and the flutter of expectation heightened the lustre of her
charms

the suffusions that mantled her face and neck the gentle heaving of
the bosom the eye now and then lost in reverie all betrayed the soft
tumult that was going on in her little heart the aunts were continually
hovering around her for maiden aunts are apt to take great interest in
affairs of this nature they were giving her a world of staid counsel
how to deport herself what to say and in what manner to receive the
expected lover

the baron was no less busied in preparations he had in truth nothing
exactly to do but he was naturally a fuming bustling little man and
could not remain passive when all the world was in a hurry he worried
from top to bottom of the castle with an air of infinite anxiety he
continually called the servants from their work to exhort them to be
diligent and buzzed about every hall and chamber as idly restless and
importunate as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day

in the mean time the fatted calf had been killed the forests had rung
with the clamor of the huntsmen the kitchen was crowded with good
cheer the cellars had yielded up whole oceans of rhein-wein and
ferre-wein and even the great heidelberg tun had been laid under
contribution everything was ready to receive the distinguished guest
with saus und braus in the true spirit of german hospitality but the
guest delayed to make his appearance hour rolled after hour the sun
that had poured his downward rays upon the rich forest of the odenwald
now just gleamed along the summits of the mountains the baron mounted
the highest tower and strained his eyes in hopes of catching a distant
sight of the count and his attendants once he thought he beheld them
the sound of horns came floating from the valley prolonged by the
mountain-echoes a number of horsemen were seen far below slowly
advancing along the road but when they had nearly reached the foot of
the mountain they suddenly struck off in a different direction the last
ray of sunshine departed the bats began to flit by in the twilight the
road grew dimmer and dimmer to the view and nothing appeared stirring
in it but now and then a peasant lagging homeward from his labor

while the old castle of landshort was in this state of perplexity a very
interesting scene was transacting in a different part of the odenwald

the young count von altenburg was tranquilly pursuing his route in that
sober jog-trot way in which a man travels toward matrimony when his
friends have taken all the trouble and uncertainty of courtship off his
hands and a bride is waiting for him as certainly as a dinner at the
end of his journey he had encountered at wurtzburg a youthful
companion-in-arms with whom he had seen some service on the
frontiers herman von starkenfaust one of the stoutest hands and
worthiest hearts of german chivalry who was now returning from the
army his father's castle was not far distant from the old fortress of
landshort although an hereditary feud rendered the families hostile and
strangers to each other

in the warm-hearted moment of recognition the young friends related all
their past adventures and fortunes and the count gave the whole history
of his intended nuptials with a young lady whom he had never seen but
of whose charms he had received the most enrapturing descriptions

as the route of the friends lay in the same direction they agreed to
perform the rest of their journey together and that they might do it
the more leisurely set off from wurtzburg at an early hour the count
having given directions for his retinue to follow and overtake him

they beguiled their wayfaring with recollections of their military
scenes and adventures but the count was apt to be a little tedious now
and then about the reputed charms of his bride and the felicity that
awaited him

in this way they had entered among the mountains of the odenwald and
were traversing one of its most lonely and thickly wooded passes it is
well known that the forests of germany have always been as much infested
by robbers as its castles by spectres and at this time the former were
particularly numerous from the hordes of disbanded soldiers wandering
about the country it will not appear extraordinary therefore that the
cavaliers were attacked by a gang of these stragglers in the midst
of the forest they defended themselves with bravery but were nearly
overpowered when the count's retinue arrived to their assistance at
sight of them the robbers fled but not until the count had received a
mortal wound he was slowly and carefully conveyed back to the city
of wurtzburg and a friar summoned from a neighboring convent who was
famous for his skill in administering to both soul and body but half
of his skill was superfluous the moments of the unfortunate count were
numbered

with his dying breath he entreated his friend to repair instantly to the
castle of landshort and explain the fatal cause of his not keeping his
appointment with his bride though not the most ardent of lovers he was
one of the most punctilious of men and appeared earnestly solicitous
that his mission should be speedily and courteously executed unless
this is done said he i shall not sleep quietly in my grave he
repeated these last words with peculiar solemnity a request at a moment
so impressive admitted no hesitation starkenfaust endeavored to soothe
him to calmness promised faithfully to execute his wish and gave him
his hand in solemn pledge the dying man pressed it in acknowledgment
but soon lapsed into delirium raved about his bride his engagements
his plighted word ordered his horse that he might ride to the castle
of landshort and expired in the fancied act of vaulting into the
saddle

starkenfaust bestowed a sigh and a soldier's tear on the untimely
fate of his comrade and then pondered on the awkward mission he had
undertaken his heart was heavy and his head perplexed for he was to
present himself an unbidden guest among hostile people and to damp
their festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes still there were
certain whisperings of curiosity in his bosom to see this far-famed
beauty of katzenellenbogen so cautiously shut up from the world for
he was a passionate admirer of the sex and there was a dash of
eccentricity and enterprise in his character that made him fond of all
singular adventure

previous to his departure he made all due arrangements with the holy
fraternity of the convent for the funeral solemnities of his friend
who was to be buried in the cathedral of wurtzburg near some of his
illustrious relatives and the mourning retinue of the count took charge
of his remains

it is now high time that we should return to the ancient family of
katzenellenbogen who were impatient for their guest and still more
for their dinner and to the worthy little baron whom we left airing
himself on the watch-tower

night closed in but still no guest arrived the baron descended from
the tower in despair the banquet which had been delayed from hour to
hour could no longer be postponed the meats were already overdone the
cook in an agony and the whole household had the look of a garrison
that had been reduced by famine the baron was obliged reluctantly to
give orders for the feast without the presence of the guest all were
seated at table and just on the point of commencing when the sound of
a horn from without the gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger
another long blast filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes
and was answered by the warder from the walls the baron hastened to
receive his future son-in-law

the drawbridge had been let down and the stranger was before the
gate he was a tall gallant cavalier mounted on a black steed his
countenance was pale but he had a beaming romantic eye and an air of
stately melancholy the baron was a little mortified that he should
have come in this simple solitary style his dignity for a moment was
ruffled and he felt disposed to consider it a want of proper respect
for the important occasion and the important family with which he was to
be connected he pacified himself however with the conclusion that it
must have been youthful impatience which had induced him thus to spur on
sooner than his attendants

i am sorry said the stranger to break in upon you thus
unseasonably 

here the baron interrupted him with a world of compliments and
greetings for to tell the truth he prided himself upon his courtesy
and eloquence the stranger attempted once or twice to stem the torrent
of words but in vain so he bowed his head and suffered it to flow on
by the time the baron had come to a pause they had reached the inner
court of the castle and the stranger was again about to speak when he
was once more interrupted by the appearance of the female part of the
family leading forth the shrinking and blushing bride he gazed on her
for a moment as one entranced it seemed as if his whole soul beamed
forth in the gaze and rested upon that lovely form one of the maiden
aunts whispered something in her ear she made an effort to speak her
moist blue eye was timidly raised gave a shy glance of inquiry on the
stranger and was cast again to the ground the words died away but
there was a sweet smile playing about her lips and a soft dimpling of
the cheek that showed her glance had not been unsatisfactory it was
impossible for a girl of the fond age of eighteen highly predisposed
for love and matrimony not to be pleased with so gallant a cavalier

the late hour at which the guest had arrived left no time for parley
the baron was peremptory and deferred all particular conversation until
the morning and led the way to the untasted banquet

it was served up in the great hall of the castle around the walls
hung the hard-favored portraits of the heroes of the house of
katzenellenbogen and the trophies which they had gained in the field
and in the chase hacked corselets splintered jousting-spears and
tattered banners were mingled with the spoils of sylvan warfare the
jaws of the wolf and the tusks of the boar grinned horribly among
crossbows and battle-axes and a huge pair of antlers branched
immediately over the head of the youthful bridegroom

the cavalier took but little notice of the company or the entertainment
he scarcely tasted the banquet but seemed absorbed in admiration of his
bride he conversed in a low tone that could not be overheard for the
language of love is never loud but where is the female ear so dull that
it cannot catch the softest whisper of the lover there was a mingled
tenderness and gravity in his manner that appeared to have a powerful
effect upon the young lady her color came and went as she listened with
deep attention now and then she made some blushing reply and when his
eye was turned away she would steal a sidelong glance at his romantic
countenance and heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness it was evident
that the young couple were completely enamored the aunts who were
deeply versed in the mysteries of the heart declared that they had
fallen in love with each other at first sight

the feast went on merrily or at least noisily for the guests were
all blessed with those keen appetites that attend upon light purses and
mountain air the baron told his best and longest stories and never had
he told them so well or with such great effect if there was anything
marvellous his auditors were lost in astonishment and if anything
facetious they were sure to laugh exactly in the right place the
baron it is true like most great men was too dignified to utter any
joke but a dull one it was always enforced however by a bumper of
excellent hockheimer and even a dull joke at one's own table served
up with jolly old wine is irresistible many good things were said by
poorer and keener wits that would not bear repeating except on similar
occasions many sly speeches whispered in ladies ears that almost
convulsed them with suppressed laughter and a song or two roared out
by a poor but merry and broad-faced cousin of the baron that absolutely
made the maiden aunts hold up their fans

amidst all this revelry the stranger guest maintained a most singular
and unseasonable gravity his countenance assumed a deeper cast of
dejection as the evening advanced and strange as it may appear even
the baron's jokes seemed only to render him the more melancholy at
times he was lost in thought and at times there was a perturbed and
restless wandering of the eye that bespoke a mind but ill at ease
his conversations with the bride became more and more earnest and
mysterious lowering clouds began to steal over the fair serenity of her
brow and tremors to run through her tender frame

all this could not escape the notice of the company their gayety was
chilled by the unaccountable gloom of the bridegroom their spirits were
infected whispers and glances were interchanged accompanied by shrugs
and dubious shakes of the head the song and the laugh grew less and
less frequent there were dreary pauses in the conversation which were
at length succeeded by wild tales and supernatural legends one
dismal story produced another still more dismal and the baron nearly
frightened some of the ladies into hysterics with the history of the
goblin horseman that carried away the fair leonora a dreadful story
which has since been put into excellent verse and is read and believed
by all the world

the bridegroom listened to this tale with profound attention he kept
his eyes steadily fixed on the baron and as the story drew to a close
began gradually to rise from his seat growing taller and taller until
in the baron's entranced eye he seemed almost to tower into a giant
the moment the tale was finished he heaved a deep sigh and took a
solemn farewell of the company they were all amazement the baron was
perfectly thunderstruck

what going to leave the castle at midnight why everything was
prepared for his reception a chamber was ready for him if he wished to
retire

the stranger shook his head mournfully and mysteriously i must lay my
head in a different chamber to-night

there was something in this reply and the tone in which it was uttered
that made the baron's heart misgive him but he rallied his forces and
repeated his hospitable entreaties

the stranger shook his head silently but positively at every offer
and waving his farewell to the company stalked slowly out of the hall
the maiden aunts were absolutely petrified the bride hung her head and
a tear stole to her eye

the baron followed the stranger to the great court of the castle where
the black charger stood pawing the earth and snorting with impatience
when they had reached the portal whose deep archway was dimly lighted
by a cresset the stranger paused and addressed the baron in a hollow
tone of voice which the vaulted roof rendered still more sepulchral

now that we are a lone said he i will impart to you the reason of
my going i have a solemn an indispensable engagement 

why said the baron cannot you send some one in your place

it admits of no substitute i must attend it in person i must away to
wurtzburg cathedral 

ay said the baron plucking up spirit but not until
to-morrow to-morrow you shall take your bride there

no no replied the stranger with tenfold solemnity my engagement
is with no bride the worms the worms expect me i am a dead man i
have been slain by robbers my body lies at wurtzburg at midnight i am
to be buried the grave is waiting for me i must keep my appointment

he sprang on his black charger dashed over the drawbridge and the
clattering of his horse's hoofs was lost in the whistling of the night
blast

the baron returned to the hall in the utmost consternation and related
what had passed two ladies fainted outright others sickened at the
idea of having banqueted with a spectre it was the opinion of some that
this might be the wild huntsman famous in german legend some talked of
mountain-sprites of wood-demons and of other supernatural beings with
which the good people of germany have been so grievously harassed since
time immemorial one of the poor relations ventured to suggest that it
might be some sportive evasion of the young cavalier and that the
very gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with so melancholy a
personage this however drew on him the indignation of the whole
company and especially of the baron who looked upon him as little
better than an infidel so that he was fain to abjure his heresy as
speedily as possible and come into the faith of the true believers

but whatever may have been the doubts entertained they were completely
put to an end by the arrival next day of regular missives confirming the
intelligence of the young count's murder and his interment in wurtzburg
cathedral

the dismay at the castle may well be imagined the baron shut himself up
in his chamber the guests who had come to rejoice with him could not
think of abandoning him in his distress they wandered about the courts
or collected in groups in the hall shaking their heads and shrugging
their shoulders at the troubles of so good a man and sat longer than
ever at table and ate and drank more stoutly than ever by way of
keeping up their spirits but the situation of the widowed bride was
the most pitiable to have lost a husband before she had even embraced
him and such a husband if the very spectre could be so gracious and
noble what must have been the living man she filled the house with
lamentations

on the night of the second day of her widowhood she had retired to her
chamber accompanied by one of her aunts who insisted on sleeping with
her the aunt who was one of the best tellers of ghost-stories in all
germany had just been recounting one of her longest and had fallen
asleep in the very midst of it the chamber was remote and overlooked a
small garden the niece lay pensively gazing at the beams of the rising
moon as they trembled on the leaves of an aspen tree before the lattice
the castle clock had just tolled midnight when a soft strain of music
stole up from the garden she rose hastily from her bed and stepped
lightly to the window a tall figure stood among the shadows of
the trees as it raised its head a beam of moonlight fell upon the
countenance heaven and earth she beheld the spectre bridegroom a loud
shriek at that moment burst upon her ear and her aunt who had been
awakened by the music and had followed her silently to the window fell
into her arms when she looked again the spectre had disappeared

of the two females the aunt now required the most soothing for she was
perfectly beside herself with terror as to the young lady there was
something even in the spectre of her lover that seemed endearing there
was still the semblance of manly beauty and though the shadow of a man
is but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a lovesick girl
yet where the substance is not to be had even that is consoling the
aunt declared she would never sleep in that chamber again the niece
for once was refractory and declared as strongly that she would sleep
in no other in the castle the consequence was that she had to sleep in
it alone but she drew a promise from her aunt not to relate the story
of the spectre lest she should be denied the only melancholy pleasure
left her on earth that of inhabiting the chamber over which the
guardian shade of her lover kept its nightly vigils

how long the good old lady would have observed this promise is
uncertain for she dearly loved to talk of the marvellous and there is
a triumph in being the first to tell a frightful story it is however
still quoted in the neighborhood as a memorable instance of female
secrecy that she kept it to herself for a whole week when she was
suddenly absolved from all further restraint by intelligence brought to
the breakfast-table one morning that the young lady was not to be found
her room was empty the bed had not been slept in the window was open
and the bird had flown

the astonishment and concern with which the intelligence was received
can only be imagined by those who have witnessed the agitation which the
mishaps of a great man cause among his friends even the poor relations
paused for a moment from the indefatigable labors of the trencher when
the aunt who had at first been struck speechless wrung her hands
and shrieked out the goblin the goblin she's carried away by the
goblin

in a few words she related the fearful scene of the garden and
concluded that the spectre must have carried off his bride two of the
domestics corroborated the opinion for they had heard the clattering of
a horse's hoofs down the mountain about midnight and had no doubt that
it was the spectre on his black charger bearing her away to the tomb
all present were struck with the direful probability for events of
the kind are extremely common in germany as many well-authenticated
histories bear witness

what a lamentable situation was that of the poor baron what a
heartrending dilemma for a fond father and a member of the great family
of katzenellenbogen his only daughter had either been rapt away to the
grave or he was to have some wood-demon for a son-in-law and perchance
a troop of goblin grandchildren as usual he was completely bewildered
and all the castle in an uproar the men were ordered to take horse and
scour every road and path and glen of the odenwald the baron himself
had just drawn on his jack-boots girded on his sword and was about
to mount his steed to sally forth on the doubtful quest when he was
brought to a pause by a new apparition a lady was seen approaching the
castle mounted on a palfrey attended by a cavalier on horseback she
galloped up to the gate sprang from her horse and falling at the
baron's feet embraced his knees it was his lost daughter and her
companion the spectre bridegroom the baron was astounded he looked
at his daughter then at the spectre and almost doubted the evidence of
his senses the latter too was wonderfully improved in his appearance
since his visit to the world of spirits his dress was splendid and
set off a noble figure of manly symmetry he was no longer pale and
melancholy his fine countenance was flushed with the glow of youth and
joy rioted in his large dark eye

the mystery was soon cleared up the cavalier for in truth as you
must have known all the while he was no goblin announced himself as
sir herman von starkenfaust he related his adventure with the young
count he told how he had hastened to the castle to deliver the
unwelcome tidings but that the eloquence of the baron had interrupted
him in every attempt to tell his tale how the sight of the bride had
completely captivated him and that to pass a few hours near her he
had tacitly suffered the mistake to continue how he had been sorely
perplexed in what way to make a decent retreat until the baron's
goblin stories had suggested his eccentric exit how fearing the feudal
hostility of the family he had repeated his visits by stealth had
haunted the garden beneath the young lady's window had wooed had
won had borne away in triumph and in a word had wedded the fair

under any other circumstances the baron would have been inflexible for
he was tenacious of paternal authority and devoutly obstinate in all
family feuds but he loved his daughter he had lamented her as lost
he rejoiced to find her still alive and though her husband was of
a hostile house yet thank heaven he was not a goblin there was
something it must be acknowledged that did not exactly accord with his
notions of strict veracity in the joke the knight had passed upon him of
his being a dead man but several old friends present who had served
in the wars assured him that every stratagem was excusable in love
and that the cavalier was entitled to especial privilege having lately
served as a trooper

matters therefore were happily arranged the baron pardoned the young
couple on the spot the revels at the castle were resumed the
poor relations overwhelmed this new member of the family with
loving-kindness he was so gallant so generous and so rich the
aunts it is true were somewhat scandalized that their system of strict
seclusion and passive obedience should be so badly exemplified but
attributed it all to their negligence in not having the windows grated
one of them was particularly mortified at having her marvellous story
marred and that the only spectre she had ever seen should turn out a
counterfeit but the niece seemed perfectly happy at having found him
substantial flesh and blood and so the story ends




westminster abbey

 when i behold with deep astonishment
 to famous westminster how there resorte
 living in brasse or stoney monument
 the princes and the worthies of all sorte
 doe not i see reformde nobilitie
 without contempt or pride or ostentation
 and looke upon offenselesse majesty
 naked of pomp or earthly domination
 and how a play-game of a painted stone
 contents the quiet now and silent sprites
 whome all the world which late they stood upon
 could not content nor quench their appetites
 life is a frost of cold felicitie
 and death the thaw of all our vanitie
 christolero's epigrams by t b 

on one of those sober and rather melancholy days in the latter part of
autumn when the shadows of morning and evening almost mingle together
and throw a gloom over the decline of the year i passed several hours
in rambling about westminster abbey there was something congenial to
the season in the mournful magnificence of the old pile and as i passed
its threshold it seemed like stepping back into the regions of antiquity
and losing myself among the shades of former ages

i entered from the inner court of westminster school through a long
low vaulted passage that had an almost subterranean look being dimly
lighted in one part by circular perforations in the massive walls
through this dark avenue i had a distant view of the cloisters with
the figure of an old verger in his black gown moving along their shadowy
vaults and seeming like a spectre from one of the neighboring tombs
the approach to the abbey through these gloomy monastic remains prepares
the mind for its solemn contemplation the cloisters still retain
something of the quiet and seclusion of former days the gray walls are
discolored by damps and crumbling with age a coat of hoary moss has
gathered over the inscriptions of the mural monuments and obscured the
death's heads and other funeral emblems the sharp touches of the chisel
are gone from the rich tracery of the arches the roses which adorned
the keystones have lost their leafy beauty everything bears marks of
the gradual dilapidations of time which yet has something touching and
pleasing in its very decay

the sun was pouring down a yellow autumnal ray into the square of
the cloisters beaming upon a scanty plot of grass in the centre
and lighting up an angle of the vaulted passage with a kind of dusky
splendor from between the arcades the eye glanced up to a bit of blue
sky or a passing cloud and beheld the sun-gilt pinnacles of the abbey
towering into the azure heaven

as i paced the cloisters sometimes contemplating this mingled
picture of glory and decay and sometimes endeavoring to decipher the
inscriptions on the tombstones which formed the pavement beneath my
feet my eye was attracted to three figures rudely carved in relief
but nearly worn away by the footsteps of many generations they were
the effigies of three of the early abbots the epitaphs were entirely
effaced the names alone remained having no doubt been renewed in later
times vitalis abbas and gislebertus crispinus abbas 
and laurentius abbas i remained some little while musing over
these casual relics of antiquity thus left like wrecks upon this distant
shore of time telling no tale but that such beings had been and had
perished teaching no moral but the futility of that pride which hopes
still to exact homage in its ashes and to live in an inscription a
little longer and even these faint records will be obliterated and the
monument will cease to be a memorial whilst i was yet looking down
upon the gravestones i was roused by the sound of the abbey clock
reverberating from buttress to buttress and echoing among the cloisters
it is almost startling to hear this warning of departed time sounding
among the tombs and telling the lapse of the hour which like a billow
has rolled us onward towards the grave i pursued my walk to an
arched door opening to the interior of the abbey on entering here the
magnitude of the building breaks fully upon the mind contrasted with
the vaults of the cloisters the eyes gaze with wonder at clustered
columns of gigantic dimensions with arches springing from them to such
an amazing height and man wandering about their bases shrunk into
insignificance in comparison with his own handiwork the spaciousness
and gloom of this vast edifice produce a profound and mysterious awe
we step cautiously and softly about as if fearful of disturbing the
hallowed silence of the tomb while every footfall whispers along the
walls and chatters among the sepulchres making us more sensible of the
quiet we have interrupted

it seems as if the awful nature of the place presses down upon the soul
and hushes the beholder into noiseless reverence we feel that we are
surrounded by the congregated bones of the great men of past times who
have filled history with their deeds and the earth with their renown

and yet it almost provokes a smile at the vanity of human ambition
to see how they are crowded together and jostled in the dust what
parsimony is observed in doling out a scanty nook a gloomy corner a
little portion of earth to those whom when alive kingdoms could not
satisfy and how many shapes and forms and artifices are devised to
catch the casual notice of the passenger and save from forgetfulness
for a few short years a name which once aspired to occupy ages of the
world's thought and admiration

i passed some time in poet's corner which occupies an end of one of
the transepts or cross aisles of the abbey the monuments are generally
simple for the lives of literary men afford no striking themes for
the sculptor shakespeare and addison have statues erected to their
memories but the greater part have busts medallions and sometimes
mere inscriptions notwithstanding the simplicity of these memorials
i have always observed that the visitors to the abbey remained longest
about them a kinder and fonder feeling takes place of that cold
curiosity or vague admiration with which they gaze on the splendid
monuments of the great and the heroic they linger about these as about
the tombs of friends and companions for indeed there is something of
companionship between the author and the reader other men are known
to posterity only through the medium of history which is continually
growing faint and obscure but the intercourse between the author and
his fellowmen is ever new active and immediate he has lived for them
more than for himself he has sacrificed surrounding enjoyments and
shut himself up from the delights of social life that he might the more
intimately commune with distant minds and distant ages well may the
world cherish his renown for it has been purchased not by deeds of
violence and blood but by the diligent dispensation of pleasure
well may posterity be grateful to his memory for he has left it an
inheritance not of empty names and sounding actions but whole treasures
of wisdom bright gems of thought and golden veins of language

from poet's corner i continued my stroll towards that part of the abbey
which contains the sepulchres of the kings i wandered among what once
were chapels but which are now occupied by the tombs and monuments
of the great at every turn i met with some illustrious name or the
cognizance of some powerful house renowned in history as the eye
darts into these dusky chambers of death it catches glimpses of quaint
effigies some kneeling in niches as if in devotion others stretched
upon the tombs with hands piously pressed together warriors in armor
as if reposing after battle prelates with crosiers and mitres and
nobles in robes and coronets lying as it were in state in glancing
over this scene so strangely populous yet where every form is so still
and silent it seems almost as if we were treading a mansion of that
fabled city where every being had been suddenly transmuted into stone

i paused to contemplate a tomb on which lay the effigy of a knight in
complete armor a large buckler was on one arm the hands were pressed
together in supplication upon the breast the face was almost covered by
the morion the legs were crossed in token of the warrior's having been
engaged in the holy war it was the tomb of a crusader of one of those
military enthusiasts who so strangely mingled religion and romance
and whose exploits form the connecting link between fact and fiction
between the history and the fairytale there is something extremely
picturesque in the tombs of these adventurers decorated as they are
with rude armorial bearings and gothic sculpture they comport with the
antiquated chapels in which they are generally found and in considering
them the imagination is apt to kindle with the legendary associations
the romantic fiction the chivalrous pomp and pageantry which poetry has
spread over the wars for the sepulchre of christ they are the relics
of times utterly gone by of beings passed from recollection of customs
and manners with which ours have no affinity they are like objects from
some strange and distant land of which we have no certain knowledge
and about which all our conceptions are vague and visionary there is
something extremely solemn and awful in those effigies on gothic tombs
extended as if in the sleep of death or in the supplication of the dying
hour they have an effect infinitely more impressive on my feelings
than the fanciful attitudes the over wrought conceits the allegorical
groups which abound on modern monuments i have been struck also with
the superiority of many of the old sepulchral inscriptions there was a
noble way in former times of saying things simply and yet saying
them proudly and i do not know an epitaph that breathes a loftier
consciousness of family worth and honorable lineage than one which
affirms of a noble house that all the brothers were brave and all the
sisters virtuous

in the opposite transept to poet's corner stands a monument which is
among the most renowned achievements of modern art but which to
me appears horrible rather than sublime it is the tomb of mrs
nightingale by roubillac the bottom of the monument is represented
as throwing open its marble doors and a sheeted skeleton is starting
forth the shroud is falling from his fleshless frame as he launches his
dart at his victim she is sinking into her affrighted husband's arms
who strives with vain and frantic effort to avert the blow the whole
is executed with terrible truth and spirit we almost fancy we hear
the gibbering yell of triumph bursting from the distended jaws of the
spectre but why should we thus seek to clothe death with unnecessary
terrors and to spread horrors round the tomb of those we love the
grave should be surrounded by everything that might inspire tenderness
and veneration for the dead or that might win the living to virtue it
is the place not of disgust and dismay but of sorrow and meditation

while wandering about these gloomy vaults and silent aisles studying
the records of the dead the sound of busy existence from without
occasionally reaches the ear the rumbling of the passing equipage the
murmur of the multitude or perhaps the light laugh of pleasure the
contrast is striking with the deathlike repose around and it has a
strange effect upon the feelings thus to hear the surges of active life
hurrying along and beating against the very walls of the sepulchre

i continued in this way to move from tomb to tomb and from chapel
to chapel the day was gradually wearing away the distant tread of
loiterers about the abbey grew less and less frequent the sweet-tongued
bell was summoning to evening prayers and i saw at a distance the
choristers in their white surplices crossing the aisle and entering
the choir i stood before the entrance to henry the seventh's chapel a
flight of steps leads up to it through a deep and gloomy but magnificent
arch great gates of brass richly and delicately wrought turn heavily
upon their hinges as if proudly reluctant to admit the feet of common
mortals into this most gorgeous of sepulchres

on entering the eye is astonished by the pomp of architecture and the
elaborate beauty of sculptured detail the very walls are wrought into
universal ornament encrusted with tracery and scooped into niches
crowded with the statues of saints and martyrs stone seems by the
cunning labor of the chisel to have been robbed of its weight and
density suspended aloft as if by magic and the fretted roof achieved
with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb

along the sides of the chapel are the lofty stalls of the knights of
the bath richly carved of oak though with the grotesque decorations
of gothic architecture on the pinnacles of the stalls are affixed the
helmets and crests of the knights with their scarfs and swords
and above them are suspended their banners emblazoned with armorial
bearings and contrasting the splendor of gold and purple and crimson
with the cold gray fretwork of the roof in the midst of this grand
mausoleum stands the sepulchre of its founder his effigy with that of
his queen extended on a sumptuous tomb and the whole surrounded by a
superbly-wrought brazen railing

there is a sad dreariness in this magnificence this strange mixture of
tombs and trophies these emblems of living and aspiring ambition
close beside mementos which show the dust and oblivion in which all
must sooner or later terminate nothing impresses the mind with a deeper
feeling of loneliness than to tread the silent and deserted scene of
former throng and pageant on looking round on the vacant stalls of
the knights and their esquires and on the rows of dusty but gorgeous
banners that were once borne before them my imagination conjured up the
scene when this hall was bright with the valor and beauty of the land
glittering with the splendor of jewelled rank and military array alive
with the tread of many feet and the hum of an admiring multitude all
had passed away the silence of death had settled again upon the place
interrupted only by the casual chirping of birds which had found
their way into the chapel and built their nests among its friezes and
pendants sure signs of solitariness and desertion

when i read the names inscribed on the banners they were those of men
scattered far and wide about the world some tossing upon distant seas
some under arms in distant lands some mingling in the busy intrigues
of courts and cabinets all seeking to deserve one more distinction in
this mansion of shadowy honors the melancholy reward of a monument

two small aisles on each side of this chapel present a touching instance
of the equality of the grave which brings down the oppressor to a
level with the oppressed and mingles the dust of the bitterest enemies
together in one is the sepulchre of the haughty elizabeth in the other
is that of her victim the lovely and unfortunate mary not an hour in
the day but some ejaculation of pity is uttered over the fate of
the latter mingled with indignation at her oppressor the walls of
elizabeth's sepulchre continually echo with the sighs of sympathy heaved
at the grave of her rival

a peculiar melancholy reigns over the aisle where mary lies buried the
light struggles dimly through windows darkened by dust the greater part
of the place is in deep shadow and the walls are stained and tinted by
time and weather a marble figure of mary is stretched upon the tomb
round which is an iron railing much corroded bearing her national
emblem the thistle i was weary with wandering and sat down to
rest myself by the monument revolving in my mind the chequered and
disastrous story of poor mary

the sound of casual footsteps had ceased from the abbey i could only
hear now and then the distant voice of the priest repeating the
evening service and the faint responses of the choir these paused for
a time and all was hushed the stillness the desertion and obscurity
that were gradually prevailing around gave a deeper and more solemn
interest to the place

 for in the silent grave no conversation
 no joyful tread of friends no voice of lovers
 no careful father's counsel nothing's heard
 for nothing is but all oblivion
 dust and an endless darkness

suddenly the notes of the deep-laboring organ burst upon the ear
falling with doubled and redoubled intensity and rolling as it were
huge billows of sound how well do their volume and grandeur accord
with this mighty building with what pomp do they swell through its vast
vaults and breathe their awful harmony through these caves of death
and make the silent sepulchre vocal and now they rise in triumphant
acclamation heaving higher and higher their accordant notes and piling
sound on sound and now they pause and the soft voices of the choir
break out into sweet gushes of melody they soar aloft and warble along
the roof and seem to play about these lofty vaults like the pure
airs of heaven again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling thunders
compressing air into music and rolling it forth upon the soul what
long-drawn cadences what solemn sweeping concords it grows more and
more dense and powerful it fills the vast pile and seems to jar the
very walls the ear is stunned the senses are overwhelmed and now it
is winding up in full jubilee it is rising from the earth to heaven
the very soul seems rapt away and floated upwards on this swelling tide
of harmony

i sat for some time lost in that kind of reverie which a strain of
music is apt sometimes to inspire the shadows of evening were gradually
thickening round me the monuments began to cast deeper and deeper
gloom and the distant clock again gave token of the slowly waning day

i rose and prepared to leave the abbey as i descended the flight of
steps which lead into the body of the building my eye was caught by the
shrine of edward the confessor and i ascended the small staircase that
conducts to it to take from thence a general survey of this wilderness
of tombs the shrine is elevated upon a kind of platform and close
around it are the sepulchres of various kings and queens from this
eminence the eye looks down between pillars and funeral trophies to
the chapels and chambers below crowded with tombs where warriors
prelates courtiers and statesmen lie mouldering in their beds of
darkness close by me stood the great chair of coronation rudely
carved of oak in the barbarous taste of a remote and gothic age the
scene seemed almost as if contrived with theatrical artifice to produce
an effect upon the beholder here was a type of the beginning and the
end of human pomp and power here it was literally but a step from the
throne to the sepulchre would not one think that these incongruous
mementos had been gathered together as a lesson to living greatness to
show it even in the moment of its proudest exaltation the neglect
and dishonor to which it must soon arrive how soon that crown which
encircles its brow must pass away and it must lie down in the dust and
disgraces of the tomb and be trampled upon by the feet of the meanest
of the multitude for strange to tell even the grave is here no longer
a sanctuary there is a shocking levity in some natures which leads them
to sport with awful and hallowed things and there are base minds
which delight to revenge on the illustrious dead the abject homage and
grovelling servility which they pay to the living the coffin of edward
the confessor has been broken open and his remains despoiled of their
funereal ornaments the sceptre has been stolen from the hand of the
imperious elizabeth and the effigy of henry the fifth lies headless
not a royal monument but bears some proof how false and fugitive is the
homage of mankind some are plundered some mutilated some covered with
ribaldry and insult all more or less outraged and dishonored

the last beams of day were now faintly streaming through the painted
windows in the high vaults above me the lower parts of the abbey were
already wrapped in the obscurity of twilight the chapels and aisles
grew darker and darker the effigies of the kings faded into shadows
the marble figures of the monuments assumed strange shapes in the
uncertain light the evening breeze crept through the aisles like the
cold breath of the grave and even the distant footfall of a verger
traversing the poet's corner had something strange and dreary in its
sound i slowly retraced my morning's walk and as i passed out at the
portal of the cloisters the door closing with a jarring noise behind
me filled the whole building with echoes

i endeavored to form some arrangement in my mind of the objects i
had been contemplating but found they were already falling into
indistinctness and confusion names inscriptions trophies had all
become confounded in my recollection though i had scarcely taken my
foot from off the threshold what thought i is this vast assemblage
of sepulchres but a treasury of humiliation a huge pile of reiterated
homilies on the emptiness of renown and the certainty of oblivion it
is indeed the empire of death his great shadowy palace where he sits
in state mocking at the relics of human glory and spreading dust and
forgetfulness on the monuments of princes how idle a boast after all
is the immortality of a name time is ever silently turning over his
pages we are too much engrossed by the story of the present to think
of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past and
each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten the idol of
to-day pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection and will in
turn be supplanted by his successor of tomorrow our fathers says sir
thomas browne find their graves in our short memories and sadly tell
us how we may be buried in our survivors history fades into fable
fact becomes clouded with doubt and controversy the inscription
moulders from the tablet the statue falls from the pedestal columns
arches pyramids what are they but heaps of sand and their epitaphs
but characters written in the dust what is the security of a tomb or
the perpetuity of an embalmment the remains of alexander the great have
been scattered to the wind and his empty sarcophagus is now the mere
curiosity of a museum the egyptian mummies which cambyses or time
hath spared avarice now consumeth mizraim cures wounds and pharaoh is
sold for balsams

what then is to ensure this pile which now towers above me from sharing
the fate of mightier mausoleums the time must come when its gilded
vaults which now spring so loftily shall lie in rubbish beneath the
feet when instead of the sound of melody and praise the wind shall
whistle through the broken arches and the owl hoot from the shattered
tower when the garish sunbeam shall break into these gloomy mansions of
death and the ivy twine round the fallen column and the fox-glove hang
its blossoms about the nameless urn as if in mockery of the dead
thus man passes away his name passes from record and recollection his
history is as a tale that is told and his very monument becomes a ruin

christmas

but is old old good old christmas gone nothing but the hair of his
good gray old head and beard left well i will have that seeing i
cannot have more of him hue and cry after christmas

 a man might then behold
 at christmas in each hall
 good fires to curb the cold
 and meat for great and small
 the neighbors were friendly bidden
 and all had welcome true
 the poor from the gates were not chidden
 when this old cap was new
 old song

nothing in england exercises a more delightful spell over my imagination
than the lingerings of the holiday customs and rural games of former
times they recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in the may morning
of life when as yet i only knew the world through books and believed
it to be all that poets had painted it and they bring with them the
flavor of those honest days of yore in which perhaps with equal
fallacy i am apt to think the world was more homebred social and
joyous than at present i regret to say that they are daily growing
more and more faint being gradually worn away by time but still more
obliterated by modern fashion they resemble those picturesque morsels
of gothic architecture which we see crumbling in various parts of the
country partly dilapidated by the waste of ages and partly lost in the
additions and alterations of latter days poetry however clings with
cherishing fondness about the rural game and holiday revel from which
it has derived so many of its themes as the ivy winds its rich foliage
about the gothic arch and mouldering tower gratefully repaying their
support by clasping together their tottering remains and as it were
embalming them in verdure

of all the old festivals however that of christmas awakens the
strongest and most heartfelt associations there is a tone of solemn and
sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality and lifts the spirit to
a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment the services of the church
about this season are extremely tender and inspiring they dwell on the
beautiful story of the origin of our faith and the pastoral scenes that
accompanied its announcement they gradually increase in fervor and
pathos during the season of advent until they break forth in full
jubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men i do not
know a grander effect of music on the moral feelings than to hear the
full choir and the pealing organ performing a christmas anthem in a
cathedral and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant
harmony

it is a beautiful arrangement also derived from days of yore that
this festival which commemorates the announcement of the religion
of peace and love has been made the season for gathering together of
family connections and drawing closer again those bands of kindred
hearts which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are
continually operating to cast loose of calling back the children of a
family who have launched forth in life and wandered widely asunder once
more to assemble about the paternal hearth that rallying-place of the
affections there to grow young and loving again among the endearing
mementos of childhood

there is something in the very season of the year that gives a charm to
the festivity of christmas at other times we derive a great portion of
our pleasures from the mere beauties of nature our feelings sally forth
and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape and we live abroad
and everywhere the song of the bird the murmur of the stream the
breathing fragrance of spring the soft voluptuousness of summer the
golden pomp of autumn earth with its mantle of refreshing green and
heaven with it deep delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence all
fill us with mute but exquisite delight and we revel in the luxury of
mere sensation but in the depth of winter when nature lies despoiled
of every charm and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow we turn for
our gratifications to moral sources the dreariness and desolation of
the landscape the short gloomy days and darksome nights while they
circumscribe our wanderings shut in our feelings also from rambling
abroad and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasure of the social
circle our thoughts are more concentrated our friendly sympathies more
aroused we feel more sensibly the charm of each other's society
and are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for
enjoyment heart calleth unto heart and we draw our pleasures from the
deep wells of loving-kindness which lie in the quiet recesses of our
bosoms and which when resorted to furnish forth the pure element of
domestic felicity

the pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room
filled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire the ruddy blaze
diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room and lights
up each countenance in a kindlier welcome where does the honest face of
hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smile where is the
shy glance of love more sweetly eloquent than by the winter fireside
and as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the hall claps
the distant door whistles about the casement and rumbles down the
chimney what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober and
sheltered security with which we look round upon the comfortable chamber
and the scene of domestic hilarity

the english from the great prevalence of rural habit throughout
every class of society have always been found of those festivals and
holidays which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life and
they were in former days particularly observant of the religious and
social rites of christmas it is inspiring to read even the dry details
which some antiquaries have given of the quaint humors the burlesque
pageants the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship with
which this festival was celebrated it seemed to throw open every door
and unlock every heart it brought the peasant and the peer together
and blended all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness
the old halls of castles and manor-houses resounded with the harp and
the christmas carol and their ample boards groaned under the weight of
hospitality even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with
green decorations of bay and holly the cheerful fire glanced its rays
through the lattice inviting the passengers to raise the latch and join
the gossip knot huddled round the hearth beguiling the long evening with
legendary jokes and oft-told christmas tales

one of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it
has made among the hearty old holiday customs it has completely taken
off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments
of life and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished
but certainly a less characteristic surface many of the games and
ceremonials of christmas have entirely disappeared and like the
sherris sack of old falstaff are become matters of speculation and
dispute among commentators they flourished in times full of spirit
and lustihood when men enjoyed life roughly but heartily and
vigorously times wild and picturesque which have furnished poetry with
its richest materials and the drama with its most attractive variety of
characters and manners the world has become more worldly there is
more of dissipation and less of enjoyment pleasure has expanded into a
broader but a shallower stream and has forsaken many of those deep
and quiet channels where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom of
domestic life society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone
but it has lost many of its strong local peculiarities its homebred
feelings its honest fireside delights the traditionary customs
of golden-hearted antiquity its feudal hospitalities and lordly
wassailings have passed away with the baronial castles and stately
manor-houses in which they were celebrated they comported with the
shadowy hall the great oaken gallery and the tapestried parlor but
are unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay drawing-rooms of the
modern villa

shorn however as it is of its ancient and festive honors christmas
is still a period of delightful excitement in england it is gratifying
to see that home-feeling completely aroused which holds so powerful a
place in every english bosom the preparations making on every side
for the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred the
presents of good cheer passing and repassing those tokens of regard and
quickeners of kind feelings the evergreens distributed about houses
and churches emblems of peace and gladness all these have the most
pleasing effect in producing fond associations and kindling benevolent
sympathies even the sound of the waits rude as may be their
minstrelsy breaks upon the mid-watches of a winter night with the
effect of perfect harmony as i have been awakened by them in that still
and solemn hour when deep sleep falleth upon man i have listened
with a hushed delight and connecting them with the sacred and
joyous occasion have almost fancied them into another celestial choir
announcing peace and good-will to mankind

how delightfully the imagination when wrought upon by these moral
influences turns everything to melody and beauty the very crowing
of the cock heard sometimes in the profound repose of the country
telling the night-watches to his feathery dames was thought by the
common people to announce the approach of this sacred festival

 some say that ever gainst that season comes
 wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated
 this bird of dawning singeth all night long
 and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
 the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
 no fairy takes no witch hath power to charm
 so hallow'd and so gracious is the time

amidst the general call to happiness the bustle of the spirits and
stir of the affections which prevail at this period what bosom can
remain insensible it is indeed the season of regenerated feeling the
season for kindling not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall but
the genial flame of charity in the heart

the scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile
waste of years and the idea of home fraught with the fragrance of
home-dwelling joys reanimates the drooping spirit as the arabian
breeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the
weary pilgrim of the desert

stranger and sojourner as i am in the land though for me no social
hearth may blaze no hospitable roof throw open its doors nor the
warm grasp of friendship welcome me at the threshold yet i feel the
influence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of
those around me surely happiness is reflective like the light of
heaven and every countenance bright with smiles and glowing with
innocent enjoyment is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a
supreme and ever-shining benevolence he who can turn churlishly away
from contemplating the felicity of his fellow-beings and can sit down
darkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful may
have his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification but he
wants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a
merry christmas




the stage-coach

 omne bene
 sine poena
 tempua est ludendi
 venit hora
 absque mora
 libros deponendi
 old holiday school-song

in the preceding paper i have made some general observations on the
christmas festivities of england and am tempted to illustrate them by
some anecdotes of a christmas passed in the country in perusing which
i would most courteously invite my reader to lay aside the austerity of
wisdom and to put on that genuine holiday spirit which is tolerant of
folly and anxious only for amusement

in the course of a december tour in yorkshire i rode for a long
distance in one of the public coaches on the day preceding christmas
the coach was crowded both inside and out with passengers who by
their talk seemed principally bound to the mansions of relations or
friends to eat the christmas dinner it was loaded also with hampers of
game and baskets and boxes of delicacies and hares hung dangling their
long ears about the coachman's box presents from distant friends for
the impending feast i had three fine rosy-cheeked school boys for my
fellow-passengers inside full of the buxom health and manly spirit
which i have observed in the children of this country they were
returning home for the holidays in high glee and promising themselves a
world of enjoyment it was delightful to hear the gigantic plans of the
little rogues and the impracticable feats they were to perform during
their six weeks emancipation from the abhorred thraldom of book birch
and pedagogue they were full of anticipations of the meeting with the
family and household down to the very cat and dog and of the joy
they were to give their little sisters by the presents with which their
pockets were crammed but the meeting to which they seemed to look
forward with the greatest impatience was with bantam which i found to
be a pony and according to their talk possessed of more virtues than
any steed since the days of bucephalus how he could trot how he could
run and then such leaps as he would take there was not a hedge in the
whole country that he could not clear

they were under the particular guardianship of the coachman to whom
whenever an opportunity presented they addressed a host of questions
and pronounced him one of the best fellows in the world indeed i could
not but notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and importance of
the coachman who wore his hat a little on one side and had a large
bunch of christmas greens stuck in the buttonhole of his coat he
is always a personage full of mighty care and business but he is
particularly so during this season having so many commissions to
execute in consequence of the great interchange of presents and here
perhaps it may not be unacceptable to my untravelled readers to have a
sketch that may serve as a general representation of this very numerous
and important class of functionaries who have a dress a manner a
language an air peculiar to themselves and prevalent throughout the
fraternity so that wherever an english stage-coachman may be seen he
cannot be mistaken for one of any other craft or mystery

he has commonly a broad full face curiously mottled with red as if
the blood had been forced by hard feeding into every vessel of the
skin he is swelled into jolly dimensions by frequent potations of malt
liquors and his bulk is still further increased by a multiplicity of
coats in which he is buried like a cauliflower the upper one reaching
to his heels he wears a broad-brimmed low-crowned hat a huge roll of
colored handkerchief about his neck knowingly knotted and tucked in
at the bosom and has in summer-time a large bouquet of flowers in his
buttonhole the present most probably of some enamored country
lass his waistcoat is commonly of some bright color striped and his
small-clothes extend far below the knees to meet a pair of jockey boots
which reach about halfway up his legs

all this costume is maintained with much precision he has a pride in
having his clothes of excellent materials and notwithstanding the
seeming grossness of his appearance there is still discernible
that neatness and propriety of person which is almost inherent in an
englishman he enjoys great consequence and consideration along the
road has frequent conferences with the village housewives who look
upon him as a man of great trust and dependence and he seems to have
a good understanding with every bright-eyed country lass the moment
he arrives where the horses are to be changed he throws down the reins
with something of an air and abandons the cattle to the care of the
ostler his duty being merely to drive from one stage to another when
off the box his hands are thrust into the pockets of his great coat and
he rolls about the inn-yard with an air of the most absolute lordliness
here he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of ostlers
stableboys shoeblacks and those nameless hangers-on that infest
inns and taverns and run errands and do all kind of odd jobs for the
privilege of battening on the drippings of the kitchen and the leakage
of the tap-room these all look up to him as to an oracle treasure up
his cant phrases echo his opinions about horses and other topics of
jockey lore and above all endeavor to imitate his air and carriage
every ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the
pockets rolls in his gait talks slang and is an embryo coachey

perhaps it might be owing to the pleasing serenity that reigned in
my own mind that i fancied i saw cheerfulness in every countenance
throughout the journey a stage-coach however carries animation always
with it and puts the world in motion as it whirls along the horn
sounded at the entrance of the village produces a general bustle some
hasten forth to meet friends some with bundles and bandboxes to secure
places and in the hurry of the moment can hardly take leave of the
group that accompanies them in the meantime the coachman has a world of
small commissions to execute sometimes he delivers a hare or pheasant
sometimes jerks a small parcel or newspaper to the door of a public
house and sometimes with knowing leer and words of sly import
hands to some half-blushing half-laughing house-maid an odd-shaped
billet-doux from some rustic admirer as the coach rattles through the
village every one runs to the window and you have glances on every side
of fresh country faces and blooming giggling girls at the corners are
assembled juntos of village idlers and wise men who take their stations
there for the important purpose of seeing company pass but the sagest
knot is generally at the blacksmith's to whom the passing of the coach
is an event fruitful of much speculation the smith with the horse's
heel in his lap pauses as the vehicle whirls by the cyclops round the
anvil suspend their ringing hammers and suffer the iron to grow cool
and the sooty spectre in brown paper cap laboring at the bellows leans
on the handle for a moment and permits the asthmatic engine to heave a
long-drawn sigh while he glares through the murky smoke and sulphurous
gleams of the smithy

perhaps the impending holiday might have given a more than usual
animation to the country for it seemed to me as if everybody was in
good looks and good spirits game poultry and other luxuries of
the table were in brisk circulation in the villages the grocers
butchers and fruiterers shops were thronged with customers the
housewives were stirring briskly about putting their dwellings in
order and the glossy branches of holly with their bright-red berries
began to appear at the windows the scene brought to mind an old
writer's account of christmas preparation now capons and hens besides
turkeys geese and ducks with beef and mutton must all die for in
twelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little now
plums and spice sugar and honey square it among pies and broth now
or never must music be in tune for the youth must dance and sing to
get them a heat while the aged sit by the fire the country maid leaves
half her market and must be sent again if she forgets a pack of cards
on christmas eve great is the contention of holly and ivy whether
master or dame wears the breeches dice and cards benefit the butler
and if the cook do not lack wit he will sweetly lick his fingers

i was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation by a shout from
my little travelling companions they had been looking out of the
coach-windows for the last few miles recognizing every tree and cottage
as they approached home and now there was a general burst of joy
there's john and there's old carlo and there's bantam cried the
happy little rogues clapping their hands

at the end of a lane there was an old sober-looking servant in livery
waiting for them he was accompanied by a superannuated pointer and by
the redoubtable bantam a little old rat of a pony with a shaggy mane
and long rusty tail who stood dozing quietly by the roadside little
dreaming of the bustling times that awaited him

i was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows leaped
about the steady old footman and hugged the pointer who wriggled his
whole body for joy but bantam was the great object of interest all
wanted to mount at once and it was with some difficulty that john
arranged that they should ride by turns and the eldest should ride
first

off they set at last one on the pony with the dog bounding and barking
before him and the others holding john's hands both talking at
once and overpowering him with questions about home and with school
anecdotes i looked after them with a feeling in which i do not know
whether pleasure or melancholy predominated for i was reminded of those
days when like them i had known neither care nor sorrow and a holiday
was the summit of earthly felicity we stopped a few moments afterwards
to water the horses and on resuming our route a turn of the road
brought us in sight of a neat country-seat i could just distinguish the
forms of a lady and two young girls in the portico and i saw my
little comrades with bantam carlo and old john trooping along the
carriage-road i leaned out of the coach-window in hopes of witnessing
the happy meeting but a grove of trees shut it from my sight

in the evening we reached a village where i had determined to pass the
night as we drove into the great gateway of the inn i saw on one side
the light of a rousing kitchen-fire beaming through a window i entered
and admired for the hundredth time that picture of convenience
neatness and broad honest enjoyment the kitchen of an english inn
it was of spacious dimensions hung round with copper and tin vessels
highly polished and decorated here and there with a christmas green
hams tongues and flitches of bacon were suspended from the ceiling a
smoke-jack made its ceaseless clanking beside the fireplace and a clock
ticked in one corner a well-scoured deal table extended along one side
of the kitchen with a cold round of beef and other hearty viands
upon it over which two foaming tankards of ale seemed mounting guard
travellers of inferior order were preparing to attack this stout repast
while others sat smoking and gossiping over their ale on two high-backed
oaken settles beside the fire trim housemaids were hurrying backwards
and forwards under the directions of a fresh bustling landlady but
still seizing an occasional moment to exchange a flippant word and have
a rallying laugh with the group round the fire the scene completely
realized poor robin's humble idea of the comforts of midwinter

 now trees their leafy hats do bare
 to reverence winter's silver hair
 a handsome hostess merry host
 a pot of ale now and a toast
 tobacco and a good coal fire
 are things this season doth require


 poor robin's almanack 


i had not been long at the inn when a post-chaise drove up to the door
a young gentleman stept out and by the light of the lamps i caught a
glimpse of a countenance which i thought i knew i moved forward to
get a nearer view when his eye caught mine i was not mistaken it was
frank bracebridge a sprightly good-humored young fellow with whom i
had once travelled on the continent our meeting was extremely cordial
for the countenance of an old fellow-traveller always brings up
the recollection of a thousand pleasant scenes odd adventures and
excellent jokes to discuss all these in a transient interview

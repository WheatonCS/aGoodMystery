all the world knows that there is nothing on
earth to be compared to a highland chief he
has his loch and his islands his mountains and
its castle his piper and his tartan his forests
and his deer his thousands acres untrodden
heath and his tens thousands blackfaced
sheep and his bands bonneted clansmen
with claymores and gaelic and hot blood and
dirks
all these and more had the chief glenroy
for he had a familytree upon which all the
birds the air might have roosted doctor johne
destiny
son to be sure has said that there are no such
things as family trees in the highlands but the
doctor's calumnies against trees every description
or rather no description throughout
scotland are too well known to require refutation

glenroy therefore had a tree and as for his
rentroll it was like a journey in a fairy tale
 longer and longer and longer than i can tell
however as the chief himself was not particular
in ascertaining the precise amount his
income but lived as if the whole highlands and
islands with their kelp and black cattle had
been at his disposal it would ill become his
biographer to pry into the state his affairs for
the gratification the curious suffice it therefore
to say that the chief glenroy lived in a
style which was deemed suitable to his rank and
fortune by all and they were neither few nor
fdr between who partook his hospitality in
person as in fortune glenroy had been equally
ted he was a tall handsome man with fine
regular features a florid complexion an open
but haughty countenance and a lofty though
destiny 
somewhat indolent air the inward man was
much what the outward man denoted he was
proud prejudiced and profuse he piqued himself
upon the antiquity his family the heroic
deeds his ancestors the extent ot his estates
the number his followers their physical
strength their devoted attachment on the
other hand he was an open temper a social
disposition liberal to his tenantry generous
to his dependents and hospitable to all his
manners though somewhat coarse were by no
means vulgar and when a little under control
he could be both pleasing and gentlemanly in
his deportment
his supremacy being universally acknowledged
throughout the extensive district where
his possessions lay he bore his faculties with
that sort indolent pomp which betokens undisturbed
power he felt himself a great man 
and though he did not say even to himself that
he was the greatest man in the world he certainly
would have been puzzled to say who was
greater
such was glenroy and with all these ad
 destiny
vantages it was naturally expected that he
would form an alliance worthy himself and
his clan all whom identified themselves with
their chief and consequently looked upon his
marriage as an event in which they had an undoubted
interest as it was impossible however
that any one so great in himself could make
a great marriage his friends and followers beg
reasonable people merely expected that he would
make the best marriage possible
 greater speculation could scarcely have been
excited at the court king ahasuerus as to a
successor to the rebellious vashti than that which
prevailed amongst the clan on the subject forming
k suitable alliance for their chief each had
his favourite and exalted fair in one or other 
the most illustrious scottish families on whom he
conceived that glenroy should place his affections
but vain are the schemes man i instead
 these glorious results glenroy did what many
wiser men have done before him he feu in love
and made what wait called a most unaccountable
marriage for he married a merely pretty
girl neither family nor fortune the orphan
destiny 
daughter a poor hundredth cousin his own
the fact was glenroy was too proud to consider
it a matter much importance whom he married 
he could derive no consequence from his wife 
his wife must owe au her dignity to him this
was a blow to the clan which all the youth
beauty and sweetness the lady could not
reconcile them to and it was not till the birth
 an heir that they recovered their spirits but
then bonfires blazed bagpipes played spartans
waved whisky flowed all in short was done
to welcome to this vain world an heir to its vanities
alas how shortsighted are sometimes
even secondsighted mortals 
at the two years a daughter was born
but fax otherwise was her birth commemorated
a lifeless mother a widowed euler a funeral
procession tears regrets lamentations and
woe these were the symbols that marked her
entrance into life and cast a gloom upon her
infant days the child was christened edith
after its mother and so ended glenroy's first
attempt at connubial happiness
 destiny
chapter ii
glenroy mourned the loss his wife as
much as it was in his nature to do but he was
not the man either to live with a breaking heart
or to die a broken one in due time therefore
it occurred to him that great as his loss
appeared to be it was nevertheless one which
might be repaired but too proud and indolent
to take any measures for the accomplishment 
his design he left it entirely to time chance or
circumstances to carry it into effect and these
did seem to conspire to bring it to pass during
an occasional visit to london he more than once
happened to find himself in parties where he was
so much in the background that but for the
notice the lady elizabeth waldegrave he
would have passed almost unobserved great
as glenroy was he therefore found he was capable
 being still greater yet greatness by
destiny 
means a wife a woman and that wife an
english woman this was a startling thought to
the proud chief but his stay in town was protracted
 he continued to meet the lady elizabeth
who was so very affable and agreeable 
such an enthusiastic admirer tartan and highland
bonnets and highland scenery that glenroy
was captivated and he even came to the
conclusion that he would not be the worse for
being connected with some the highest families
in the kingdom then although lady
elizabeth was somewhat passee she was still a
showylooking woman quite suitable to him in
point years and more likely to make a good
staid stepmother than a younger wife would have
been to be sure she was not very bright
but glenroy hated clever women they were all
so managing and manoeuvring in short from an
admirer the chief became a suitor and thought
himself a lucky man when he was the accepted
lover had glenroy been better acquainted with
the character and circumstances the lady he
would not have been quite so much elated with
his good fortune
a
 destiny
lady elizabeth waldegrave was sister to the
marquis heywood and widow the honourable
edward waldegrave a fashionable spendthrift
who had closed a brief career folly
leaving his widow and infant daughter to the
charity relations it may be supposed then
that lady elizabeth's circumstances were anything
but affluent she was in fact struggling to
keep her place in society upon a small annuity
from her fatherinlaw lord waldegrave who
having had to pay largely for the extravagance
 his son was little inclined to be liberal to
his widow and child glenroy's proposals therefore
came in good time and the union being
 course warmly approved by the lady's
family and connexions no obstacle stood in the
way so that as soon as the lawyers and milliners
had done their parts the marriage was
celebrated with the utmost eclat on the one
side there was a special licence the presence
 a prince the blood the benediction an
archbishop with peers and peeresses lace and
pearls a magnificent saloon an elegant dejeuner
a line splendid equipages c such
destiny
was the scene in st james square while at
the glenroy anne the event was celebrated
by a numerous meeting the tenantry and vassals
 the chief with barbaric pomp a roasted
ox and half a score sheep barrels ale and
bowls whisky long speeches loud shouting
toasting cheering bonfires bagpipes and the
highland fling
much as glenroy loved pomp and retinue he
was somewhat startled at the magnitude his
lady's bridal train in addition to his own travelling
carriage and servants there followed miss
waldegrave's equipage containing that young
lady about five years age her french governess
and english subgoverness and attended by
her own maid and the lady elizabeth's footmen
glenroy thought less might have served her 
but it was too soon or rather too late to say so 
and lady elizabeth expatiated largely upon the
goodness old lord waldegrave in allowing
her to take his favourite son's only child to scotland
with her the chief tried to feel sufficiently
grateful for ike favour conferred upon him in
this addition to his family but in spite 
destiny
self he felt something like shame at this importation
to glenroy the arrival the new married
pair was celebrated with great rejoicing
lady elizabeth was dressed in the clantartan
wore a highland bonnet looked well made a
speech and was at once pronounced to be a most
charming woman
but scarcely were the rejoicing over before
glenroy began to suspect that he had not drawn
the capital prize in the marriagelottery and
these his first faint misgivings began to assume
a less questionable shape as the features the
lady's postnuptial character became to be more
fully developed at length they boldly resolved
themselves into tastes habits and pursuits the
most decided dissimilarity from her husband's
how it happened that this discovery had
not been made before marriage instead after
was one those mysteries which though 
onion occurrence have never yet been fully
cleared up to the satisfaction singleminded
people whence it is that two persons who
seem to have been born only to hate each other
would under any circumstances ever fancy that
destiny id
they actually love each other is a phenomenon
which even philosophers may have encountered
but which they certainly have not yet explained
no two human beings born and bred in a civil
used country could be more different than the
chief and his lady and as both were independent
and both had arrived at years discretion
it seemed but natural that they should remain
as fate seemed to place them perfect antipodes
the lady had been accustomed to a gay
london life and she had also heed abroad
she had seen much the world and the world
had seen much her she had been admired
for her talents her manners her music her
taste her dress and although the admiration
had long been on the wane the craving still
continued she was in fact when without her
adventitious aids a mere showy superficial
weak woman with a fretful temper irritable
nerves and a constitution tending ta rheumatism
which she imputed entirely to the climate
 scotland
in direct opposition to all this glenroy detested
london despised every part the globe
 destiny
save scotland hated all music except that 
the bagpipe had little enjoyment in any society
but that his mends and followers and when
he spoke the world meant only his own county
and clan he had also become subject to attacks
 the gout which he ascribed to his
visits to london and therefore vowed he never
would set foot in it again
although glenroy saw much good company
at his hospitable mansion yet it was only during
a short period the year for the highlands
may be said to open for the season as the king's
theatre shuts and thanks to grouse and deer
the one has become almost as fashionable a place
 amusement as the other during this season
therefore lady elizabeth lived pretty much in
her own element but when that was over a
long and dreary interval ensued not that the
house ever emptied visitors be the season or
weather what they might but the company was
not suited to her taste for it must be owned
glenroy was not nice in the choice his associates
although his vanity was gratified with
occasionally entertaining the best in the land
destiny 
still the same principle together with his love
 ease made him prefer in general being what
is called the king his company
amongst sundry his adherents whose persons
and manners were particularly obnoxious to the
lady elizabeth the most offensive was the laird
 benbowie friend and clansman the chief's
who from having been all his life in the habit
 paying long and frequent visits at the castle
had gradually become domesticated there to the
infinite annoyance its mistress the laird
 benbowie was an elderly man the most
ordinary exterior possessing no very distinguishing
traits except a pair voluminous eyebrows
very round shoulders a wig that looked as
if it had been made spun yam an unvarying
snuffcoloured coat and a series the most frighted
waistcoats that ever were seen benbowie's
mental characteristics were much upon a par
with his personal peculiarities he was made up
 stupidities he was sleepyheaded and absent
she chewed tobacco snored in presence slobbered
when he ate walked up and down with a pair
 creaking shoes and drummed upon the table
 destiny
with a snuffy hand nay more with that same
obnoxious snuffy hand he actually dared to pat
the head or shoulder the elegant refined miss
waldegrave as often as she came within his
reach but all these things were mere leather
and prunella to his chief whose feelings and
perceptions were by no means so refined as his
lady's benbowie was the very apple his eye
for he was devoted to him he never contradicted
him or rather he invariably coincided wite
him he rode with him or walked with him
or sailed with him or sat still with him he
played at backgammon with him and when there
was no one else did well enough to be beaten
at billiards yet no one could call benbowie a
hangeron for he had a good estate and a pretty
place his own both which he neglected for
the sake living with his friend and although
he was not profuse his own money yet to do
him justice he was equally sparing his chief su
what pleasure or profit glenroy could find
in benbowie's company no one could discover
but so it was and glenroy could have better
spared a better man although if pressed for a
destiny 
reason his preference he could only have resolved
it into that unanswerable argument je
i'aime parceque c'est lui c lady elizabeth
had at once attempted to expel benbowie from
the house but she might as well have attempted
to move one his own brown mountains benbowie
was invulnerable in his stupidity and obtuseness
and nothing less than the united efforts
 the fairy and the genie who lifted up prince
camaralzaman and carried him a thousand
leagues without waking him could have made
benbowie dream leaving a house where habit
had completely domesticated him and where his
instinct made him feel comfortable and happy
some one has well said lorsque ne pent
teindre une lumiere on seen laisse clairer
but lady elizabeth did not adopt this wise
maxim she could not extinguish benbowie's
light faint and dark as it was neither would she
permit it to shine even in its native dim eclipse
the consequence was that poor benbowie who
seemed to have been born without a single spark
 fire in his composition became a sort 
smouldering brand in the fiunily his friend
 destiny
as neither the chief nor his lady were young
enough to be moulded anew or wise enough to
make the most what each mutually thought a
bad bargain it may be supposed their lives did
not glide away like that parnell's hermit
in one clear unruffled stream but rather resembled
the course their own mountain torrents
which chafe foam murmur and take then own
way
destiny 
chapter iii
time rolled on but did nothing to smooth the
asperities glenroy and his lady pride was
the ruling passion both and unhappily there
was no mutual object on which they might concentrate
this predominant principle the lady
elizabeth added no branches to the family tree 
and thus the unjust and overweening partiality
 each parent for their own separate offspring
continued to grow with their growth and
strengthen with their strength
such was the state the chief's family when
he received a visit from his brotherinlaw sir
angus malcolm with his only son a spoiled
handsome boy about the same age as his cousin
norman sir angus was a widower and had been
recently appointed to a high command in india
whither he was to proceed when he should have
 destiny
found a situation for his son suited to the anxieties
 a fond parent but that was a matter 
difficulty as indeed it must be to any one to
part with his choicest treasure and commit it
to untried love and alien tenderness why did
he leave it for wealth that which tempts so
many to leave each thing beloved most dearly
sir angus had a fine estate but it was
loaded with debt time selfdenial and management
might have retrieved it but to wait
on the one and submit to the other was not in
the nature an impetuous openhearted openhanded
highlander and he preferred the easier
task retrieving his fortune by methods more
congenial to him in a foreign land his only
care was to secure a safe and happy asylum for
his child and as besides being allied to glenroy
by marriage he was also his nearest kinsman
by blood he flattered himself the chief would
take charge his son and educate him with his
own his only doubt was with regard to lady
elizabeth whom he had not heard the most
favourable reports but he was a sanguine goodnatured
undiscerning man and his little misdestiny

giving were quickly dispelled by the affectionate
and gracious reception he met with glenroy
was more than hospitably kind and his lady won
by the admiration expressed for her darling and
the beautiful presents bestowed upon her acted
a most amiable and delightful part glenroy at
once anticipated the subject uppermost in the
breast the parent by inviting him to leave
his boy with him during his absence and in a
few minutes all was settled to the mutual satisfaction
 both parties lady elizabeth was
flattered by seeing that it was to her the father
looked for care and protection to his son and
her vanity was gratified at becoming the patroness
 the young heir to an ancient title and
noble fortune but above all her favour was
secured by the predilection evinced by the young
reginald towards morinda upon being asked
by his father which his two cousins he would
choose for his wife he declared instantly in savour
 morinda as being by far the prettiest he then
followed up the avowal his admiration with
an offer to marry her which was no less promptly
freed to on the lady's part especially when she
 destiny
heard the gold and diamonds and pearls that
were awaiting her
the little florinda was indeed an uncommonly
pretty child with a skin dazzling
whiteness a profusion golden ringlets large
blue eyes a sylphlike figure and an air distinction
which although not always the accompaniment
 high birth is rarely to be seen
except among the true patrician orders she was
also a gay sportive disposition and winning
manners thus her natural endowments and early
acquirements rendered her a perfect epitome 
feminine grace and beauty edith on the contrary
possessed no uncommon attractions for the
superficial observer her features were soft and
delicate her countenance mild and thoughtful
and her manners more grave than is usual at
her age for no fond mother's heart had ever
pillowed her infant head no tender mother's
hand had wiped away her childish tears and even
a father's arms were seldom open to her for norman's
place was there disregarded or checked
in the natural expression her feelings she
gradually learnt to repress them within her own
destiny 
breast and while to careless observers the feelings
themselves seemed wanting the roots had
only struck the deeper into the heart while the
shoots were thus carelessly trodden down
edith was too much accustomed to see florinda
preferred to her to feel any the envy
and heartburnings an offended rival but
meekly yielded up the prize lady elizabeth
was silly enough to feel gratified at this childish
fancy and continued so kind and caressing to
her little soninlaw as she styled him during
the week his father remained that he departed
with a mind relieved from all doubts and fears as
to the situation in which he had left his son and
heir
 destiny
chapter iv
for a little time all went on smoothly in the
youthful circle glenroy but unhappily inconstancy
is known in childhood as well as in manhood
and reginald began to discover that even the
beautiful florinda had her ult she was very
greedy and was too much petted and wanted
every thing her own way and as he had been
accustomed to be no less despotic many a childish
squabble ensued at length not having the
fear damages for breach promise marriage
before his eyes he in a transport indignation
one day declared that he had quite changed
his mind that she was not to be called his
wife any more for that he was going to take
edith she was much better tempered would
part with any her playthings to him and never
cried when she was contradicted and at any
destiny 
rate brown hair and pale cheeks were much
prettier than yellow hair and pink ones in
short for any other reason why his affections
were transferred lady elizabeth was weak
enough to resent this affront and to enter into
all the childish feuds that followed aggravated
as they often were by nursery maids to whom
a spoiled unruly boy is always a subject torment
and course blame
the consequence was her fondness for reginald
which had always beei a very precarious
nature now turned into downright aversion
 while he unused to control at home and
encouraged by glenroy in all his freaks set
her authority completely at defiance even ben
bowie his tobacco his snore his shoes and
his waistcoats almost all ceased to be objects
 animosity compared with this new annoyance
at length matters came to a climax and
threatened to add one more to the many proof
that great events do often spring ft'om trivial
causes
one day when the two boys and edith were
vol i b
 destiny
engaged in some play in which florinda was
deemed incompetent to join to get rid her
importunities reginald lent her his watch the
parting gift his father receiving many assurances
in return that she would take the greatest
care it these promises however were soon
forgotten the watch was opened examined
wound up and broken sublunary revenge is
always the first impulse the childish heart
and reginald in his rage shook florinda withall
his might slapped her on the cheek and even
left the print his nails on her arm her shrieks
soon brought lady elizabeth to the spot when
she found her darling almost convulsed with
terror and indignation st this rude assault the
extreme fairness and delicacy her skin rendered
the slightest touch at all times perceptible
and on tide present occasion showed the offence
in glowing colours and told a tale outrage
that raised all the mother in lady elizabeth's
breast in vain did norman and edith attempt
to palliate the offence by detailing the provocations
and declaring that reginald had not meant
to hurt her they were sure he had only just
destiny 
given her a slap for breaking hifi watch lady
elizabeth would listen to nothing but the sobs
and exclamations her darling till at length
she worked herself up to assert and course to
believe that her child had been seriously hurt
and would have been killed had not she come
to her rescue the whole was wound up with
the soothing assurance to her angel that the
savage should be sent fnh the house that very
day
 but this house is not yours retorted reginald
with equal warmth it is my uncle's
house and i am to stay here till my papa comes
home and then i shall make him send that
wicked nmmkey to prison for breaking my watdu
the little wretch i hate and despise her for
telling lies yes you shall go to prison and
be fed on bread and water you little lying yel
lowhaired wasp and he shook his hand at
her with renewed vehemence
 this is t all endurance cried lady
elizabeth with violence begone all you i
and in the recklessness h anger she pushed
with who had been upon her knees caress
destiny
ing and soothing horinda as she lay in her
mamma's lap edith fell and struck her temple
against the corner the chair but she uttered
aio cry
there cried reginald as he flew to help
her up see what you hav done to edith
and how good she is but betty miyor says
you are very bad to edith and don't love her
because she is not your child but love her
and she is to be my wife and she shall be all
covered with gold and diamonds that my papa is
to bring me yes that you shall edith but
she shall have nothing but dirty old rags to wear
and good enough too for betty mivor says
her skin is just like cream cheese and her hair
like a lint tap
a fresh burst screams and tears from the
fair florinda made lady elizabeth hastily withdraw
with her from the scene action in the
tumult exasperated and exaggerated feeling
she hastened to glenroy and denouncing reginald
as the destroyer her child demanded
that both he and betty mivor should be sent
from the house a scornful and peremptory
destiny 
negative was course returned the lady
persisted as she commonly did and rising in
far passion at the contemptuous indifference her
complaints met with she at last declared her
determination leaving the house and taking
her child along with her unless her demand was
complied with this threat being treated with
anger and derision led to a scene altercation
and mutual recrimination when people
are ready primed for quarrelling a very little
matter will serve the purpose just as a single
spark applied to a train gunpowder will do
the business an earthquake so it was with
gienroy and his lady it had been 
with them for many a day and now from
less to more from bad to worse it ended in a
threatened separation the lady declared she
would go and the chief would not ask her to
stay glenroy would have been the last man
to have turned his wife and her child from his
house however obnoxious they might have been
and he felt rather annoyed at the thoughts 
such a thing being said but he was too proud
to betray his feelings or to make any confess
destiny
sion he merely contented himself with remarking
to benbowie that if her ladyship chose to go
she might go she was welcome to go or stay for
him
very right glenroy on my conscience
that's very right responded benbowie but if
she goes i wish you may not have to aliment her
the acrimonious feelings the parents could
not fail to keep alive the resentment the children
a spirit absolute hatred towards each
other seemed to bum in the young hearts 
reginald and florinda and they never niet
without mutual provocation being given and
taken in full measure in vain the gentle edith
strove to reconcile them no sooner was an old
offence patched up than a new one broke out
and the only thing they both agreed in was in
liking her
it was at this crisis that an afflicting dispensation
in the waldegrave family accelerated the
separation between the chief and his lady at
the time their marriage lord waldegrave
had two sons then in the prime life but
nearly about the time that the eldest was killdestiny


ed by a dl from hk horse the youngest died
 the yellow fever in the west indies thus
the young morinda became at once presumptive
heir to her grandfather who brokenhearted
and paralytic was not likely to stand long in the
way the succession and as the tithe and
estates descended in the female line she might
now be considered as future baroness wade
grave with such prospects before her lady
elizabeth felt as if there were degradation in
her remaining longer under tie roof a coarse
overbearing highlander and she
therefore signified her intention immediately
removing her daughter to england in order to be
near her aged grandfather she yielded so four
indeed as to say that provided glenroy would
send the boys to school and engage to spend
eight or nine months the year in or near london
she would have no objections to pass the
other three or four in the highlands but an
indignant refusal being returned arrangements
were immediately made for a final separation
the approaching departure the mother and
daughter caused universal satisfaction through
 resting
out the house wych had long been divided mt
tiro parties as fierce as the montagues and capulet
glenroy's adherents did not course
like his lady and his servants had long looked
fdth fiery indignation on the importance attached
to miss waldegrave and the airs superiority
assumed by that young lady's suite while
the governesses and ladies maids hailed with
transport their emancipation from a long dull
winter at glenroy as the contrasted gaieties 
london rose to their mindseye glenroy's
own sensations were a mixed nature he felt
that his lady's absence would be an inexpressive
relief but there was something wounded
pride which alloyed the pleasure the parting
with shed many tears at the thoughts losing
florinda to whom she was really attached for
her warm and affectionate heart was ready to love
every thing that did not repel her by harshness
or indifference and florinda loved edith as
much as a spoiled child can ever love any thing
beyond self
 do not cry edith said the little future
baroness with a patronizing air for when i
destiny 
halve a house my own in london i shall make
a point having you to stay with me indeed
i shal but i will not invite you nor you to
the boys
 k you did we should not go retorted
reginald we are too glad to get rid ugly
linttops to follow them to dirty smoky london

 how happy i am to leave this ugly dull
place exclaimed the indignant florinda and
jenkins says it is quite inconceivable how we
have been able to exist here so long only
dear edith i am very sorry to leave you but
i hope i shall never see glenroy castle again
 and we hope we shall never see you here
again retorted reginald as florinda skipped
past hin to the carriage from which with an
air insolent triumph she smiled and waved
her little white hands
edith was the only one the family who
grieved at the separation which had taken place
her warm tender heart had fondly attached
itself to florinda and her only consolation at
parting had been florinda's promise writing
b
s destiny
her a letter whenever she got to london poor
edith had watched from day to day for this letter
 her jrst letter and all may remember the
anticipations their first letter anticipations
filly realized by the actual receipt it what
a new world broke upon us with the breaking 
the first seal what glorious visions unfolded
themselves as we for the first time unfolded a
letter to ourselves containing perhaps some few
words jiiu text who ever received a first
letter that did not spell and con it fifty times
over who did not lay it under their pillow at
night and fall asleep longing for morning that
was to give the treasure again to their eyes but
these were joys only pictured to edith's imagination
as each day she rose in fresh hopes that
that was the day her letter would arrive thus
dupe tomorrow days passed away till at
length poor edith's expectations died the natural
death hope deferred

chapter v
the lady's departure was the signal for a
gathering the clan who as upon all occasions
either condolence or congratulation sidled not
to rally round their chief in full force even
benbowie although in general obtuse as a hedgehog
seemed to feel this as an epoch to be commemorated
and he therefore ordered a new
waistcoat ten times more hideous than any its
predecessors his characteristics also began to
expand more freely and as if they owned some
genial influence he slept more and snored
louder than ever he inhaled his soup with an
inspiration that might hare sucked in a fleet 
his wig grew more small and wiry and when
his feet were not creaking up and down the
room they were to be foimd reposing on the
bars his neighbour's chair halcyon days

ensued glenroy was himself again and a
neverending still beginning course reveky
was kept up till the castle more resembled a
petty court than a private dwelling
a tutor had been provided for the boys by
sir angus before leaving britain and to his
are they had been committed he was an
jpoiushman a firstrate scholar a man ele
glmut refined manners fond study yet skilled
ia lighted accomplishments somewhat epicure
in his taste and habits and altogether such a one
lis was calculated to form the perfect gentleman
and nothing more
at first glenroy grumbled a good deal to
benbowie at what he called the insufferable airs
 the fine english dominie but as they did
not interfere much with his own ways he was
too indolent to resent them and at last he
became gradually accustomed to bear with mr
jellies as the most consummate puppy he had
ever known
a governess was talked for edith but
that was such a secondary consideration that
glenroy could not be troubled to make any
detint 
exertion to procure one so in the meantime

good stout sound warm heart which would
cheerfully have given itself and its last drop for
the honour and glory the race glenroy
she had also just as much religion as an irreligious
man could tolerate for her religion was
a compound the simplest articles belief
and certain superstitious notions secondsight
visions dreams and so forth which sometimes
afforded amusement or at any rate always
served for ridicule as for her accomplishments
they were many and various and being mostly
selfacquired they possessed a sort originality
which in some degree compensated for other
deficiencies she was a perfect adept in the
now muchdespised art needlework and
besides the more vulgar arts hemming running
stitching playing baiting c she had a
hand for
tent work raised work laid work frostwork net work
most curious pearls and rare italian cat work
destiny 
fin libmf every one that her company was in grit
request and by none more than by the chief
liitnself in proof this besides many other
acts liberality towards her he had not only
fitted up for her a cottage in the vicinity the
castle but had likewise assigned her an apartment
there from which however in lady elizabeth's
time she had been wholly banished butin
which she was now become a fixture this
chamber was the favourite rendezvous the children
who delighted in beating upon her om
spinner and in being allowed to daub paper
cbrty their fingers and look at clothdogs 
tinselgrottos filigree figures
birds made real dyed feathers and all the
rest mrs macauley's monstrosities while she
her goodhumoured face beaming with pleasure
was no less happy in the belief that she was rendering
the most essential benefit to her benefit
destiny 
tor ia thus imparting her accompaniments to
his children
glenroy to be sure scouted the idea her
teaching them any thing but her own brogue
and took great delight in ridiculing her accomplishments
even to herself but then as he said
to benbowie mary macauley although a great
idiot was a kindhearted wellmeaning body
apt was fond and careful the children and if
they learned little good from her they would
learn as little evil for she was a simple honest
creature as ever breathed to which the usual
affirmative or rather confirmation was returned
that's very true glenroy on my conscience
there's a great deal good sense in that
molly macaidey is a very decent girl and costs
nothing
such was the preceptress the chief's
daughter and in the genial warmth her social
love and sympathy edith's young heart expanded
as a flower to the sun
it is a trite remark that the most important
part our education is given by ourselves if
edith was not so regularly and wellinstructed
 destiny
as she might have been she escaped the still
more dangerous error having her mind overworked
and overloaded with premature knowledge
 and how many a mind has been worked
perhaps to the weakening those very powers
which it was the aim the teacher to strengthen
and expand in the moral as in the physical constitution
nature is the best guide and nature
spoke wisely even by the lips mrs macauley
when she said childer will be childer let us do
as we will we cannot put grey heads upon
green shoulders

chapter vi
scarcely had glenroy begun to enjoy his
emancipation from one species domestic ty
umy when he found himself groaning under
another avery different description that the
minister the parish and if the chief and his
lady could have agreed even in their antipathies
mr mdow might have had the merit reconciling
them but glenroy had not even the
luxury openly complaining this torment
for like his former one it was one his own
providing placed there not merely with his consent
but by his own free will mr m'dow was
the man his own choice the chosen many
candidates the church having become vacant
by the death the former minister much
canvassing and competition had course ensued
and at least twenty licensed graduates
 destiny
had presented themselves each with testimonials
and credentials enough to have entitled them to
a bishopric
put the two whose recommendations cares
red most weight the one was the present pastor
the reverend duncan m'dow and the other
was the evangelical side a party whom glenroy
although professing christianity held in
the utmost abhorrence not that he knew very
well what it was they did profess he only giiesi
ed it was something he did not practise he
had a vague confused apprehension that nati
evangelical pastor was a sort compound a
popish priest a stiflenecked presbyterian a
sourfitted covenanter a lankhaired seceder
a meddling jesuit a foultongued john knox
a what not that had evil in its composition
no reasonable person surely can doubt that
there have been and still are many bright ornaments
 the church amongst both parties cf
christians and it is much to be lamented when
prejudice runs high on either side and a man is
applauded or defamed not according to his practice
but his profession as little may it be
destiny 
questioned that in their respective congregations
the wheat and the tares grow promiscuously
even to this day but this was not the
view glenroy took the subject and he was
loud against all highfliers newlights gospellers
bigots zealots enthusiasts saints and so
forthbeing
a moderate man he like all moderate
people was most violently opposed to the admission
 any person that description within the
precincts the parish as the other heritors were
few in number the patronage in this instance
was conceded to him and his choice fell upon the
present minister who had been twenty years
tutor in the fiunily the laird kindles
and who never had been branded with any 
these appellations but bore the character being
an easy goodhumoured sensible moderate man
who troubled nobody but minded his own affairs
this last qualification he certainly possessed as
glenroy soon found to his cost
the reverend duncan mdow was a large
loudspoken splayfooted man whose chief characteristics
were his bad preaching his love 
 destiny
eating his rapacity for augmentations or as he
termed it fermentations and a want tact in
all the instances life which would have driven
lord chesterfield frantic his hands and feet
were in every body's way the former indeed
like huge grappling irons seized upon everything
they could possibly lay hold while the latter
were commonly to be seen sprawling at an immeasurable
distance from his body and projecting
into the very middle the room like two
prodigious moles or bastions he dealt much in
stale jokes and bad puns he had an immense
horselaugh which nothing ever restrained and
an enormous appetite which nothing seemed to
damp and which he took care always to supply
with the best things at table he used a great
quantity snuff and was for ever handing about
his mull an ugly cow's horn with a foul dingy
cairngorm set in silver on the top to sum 
us personal enormities when he spoke he had
a practice always advancing his bu as close
as possible to the person he was addressing
although a strongbodied sturdy man he was
extremely careful his health and even in a
destiny 
fine summer's day was tx be seen in a huge
woolly greatcoat that reached to his heels trotting
aloi on a stout dun pony just high enough
to keep its master's feet off the ground
such were the outward man and beast the
inward man was very much the same stamp
mr m'dow's principal object in this world was
self and his constant and habitual thoughts had
naturally operated on his outward manners to
such a degree as to blunt all the nicer perceptions
 human nature and render him in very
truth his own microcosm he was no dissembler
for a selfish dissembler is aware that in order to
please one must appear to think others and
forget self this fictitious politeness he had
neither the tact to acquire nor the cunning to
feign consequently he was devoid all the
means pleasing not that we mean to recommend
dissimulation or to insinuate that mr m
dow would in reality have been a better man
had he been able and willing to form himself on
the model the chesterfield school he would
merely have been less offensive in the ordinary
intercourse life and would have sinned less
 destiny
against the common observances society bat
had he been earnest in his calliiy had he sought
to have his mind enlightened by the knowledge
 those divine truths vrhich he professed to
teach their unction would have softened and
refined even the ruggedness his nature and
have rendered him an object respect instead
 a subject ridicule
from the moment he was ordained minister
 the gospel mr mdow had done nothing
but make demands for augmentation stipend
enlargement glebe additions to the manse
new offices and so on now there was no sky
in which his money could go that was so unsatisfactory
to glenroy as when it was claimed as a
matter right more especially by the clergy
whom he looked upon as the worst species 
landtax besides like all idle indolent people
he had an utter abhorrence every thing that
occasioned trouble or was a bore and mr duncan
mdow was a bore that beset him on all sides
he was a stumblingblock in his path a thorn in
his side a weed that had taken root in the very
heart his estate and which it was impossible
destiny 
for him to extirpate true he was not molested
with spiritual admonitions plans for building
churches subscriptions for establishing schools
or schemes for employing the industrious or
peering the indigent or reclaiming the wicked
r but then he was haunted with estimates for
etdaing the manse and repairing the bam or
hints for rebuilding both house and offices or
he was beset with a copy the new locality oran
extract the last decreet or a notice a
second summons for augmentation or an interlocutor
 the teind court in favour some
other minister one or other if not all which
missiles mr mdow bore as constantly about
his person as a highwayman does his pistols
but what provoked glenroy even more than all
this was the utter impossibility overawing
the minister or keeping him at a proper distance
for mr m'dow possessed that sort callous goodnature
which rendered him quite invulnerable
to all rebuffs as well might a needle have been
applied to the skin a rhinoceros as a gibe ora
taunt to the feelings the minister they
were all received as good jokes which only
vol i c
 destiny
called forth roars laughter in return besides
the impression was so completely implanted in
his brain glenroy's extreme predilection for
him from having appointed him his pastor in
spite all opposition that any thing he now said
or did could not possibly remove it in a word
henry the second and thomas a becket were
a joke to glenroy and mr duncan mdow

chapter vil
glenroy's property was too princely in extent
to admit any very near neighbours who could
vie with him in state and consequence yet two
 his nearest kinsmen had dwellings within a
short distance him or rather the distance
was reckoned short in a country where stormy
faiths and pathless mountains oppose no such
obstacles to social intercourse as are enjoined by
the flimsy forms fashion and etiquette
all that glenroy's eye looked upon hill and
glen lake and forest were his own with the
exception one single feature in the landscape
and that the fairest in au the goodly scene this
was a beautiful richlywooded promontory which
stretched far into the bosom the estuary that
almost siutounded it and gave it the appearance
 a sylvan isle it had once formed part the
 destiny
glenroy estate and had even been the original
seat the family as was indicated by some
grey ivygrown walls wluch crowned the summit
 one its green knolls but by one 
the many mutations land is subject to it had
been severed from the greater part the property
and had passed to a younger branch 
the family by whom it had for generations
been possessed this younger branch had now
dwindled away to one sear and yellow leaf
a rich and childless old man who lead lately succeeded
by the death a nephew whose first
act upon coming age had bee to repair and
furnish such part the old castle as could be
rendered habitable for the shooting season his
successor was not personally known in the country
as he had left it at an early age to push his
fortune in a remote provincial town in england
and had only visited it once since glenroy had
long looked with a wistful eye towards this property
which indeed was the very crown jewel ot
the fondly and for which he would gladly have
exchanged many thousand acres muir and
maintain but hitherto he had coveted in vail
bestir 
au his overtures had been rejected for to tell
 truth glenroy had every thing but money
to offer for it and money unfortunately is the
only thing that ever induces pecle to part with
their lands but now he seemed in a sur way
to gain possession it not by conquest as
the law terms purchase but by gift or inheritance
as he said he was the nearest heir to the
childless old man who waa now the proprietor
even if it had been otherwise it was little
consequence as the property was not entailed
and it was but natural to suppose he would leave
it to him as the rightful owner and the head the
family especially as he could have nobody else
to leave it to having quarrelled with all the
dan with whom he had ever come into contact
at a more respectful distance from the proud
turrets glenroy stood the humble dwelling
 his cousin captain malcolm a halfpay officer
in delicate health the possessor a paternal
arm and the stiver eight children in early
use he had made a love massage with a lady 
good family and great beauty but no fortune
this step had course displeased the friends
 destiny
so called on both sides and the young pair
had been left to struggle through life as they
best could and a hard struggle it had been
but as has been truly said unfitness minds
more than circumstances is what in general
niiars the marriage ilion where these are suited
means contentment and happiness are within
reach and in ims instance so it had proved
mrs malcolm though highly born and delicately
bred had followed her husband through all the
changes a soldier's life had shared his hair
ships and privations with cheerfulness and bad
now refused with him to a bleak highland firm
with that contentment which was ready to find
good in every thing if their claims had been
strictly investigated it would probably have been
found that captain malcolm was still more nearly
related to the inch orran branch the family
than the chief himself but his chance the
succession was such a hopeless one that he never
had allowed himself to indulge the slightest expectation
in his first outset in life he had
disobliged mungo malcolm the present proprietor
by refusing to be received into his office
destiny 
and bred to his profession that a scrivener
one offence was quite sufficient to make an
enemy for life mungo malcolm but when
this act disobedience was followed up by 
rash and imprudent marriage assurance was made
doubly sure the door was completely closed
and barred against him and it seemed as if little
less than a miracle could ever open it again
when this family first came to the neighbourhood
glenroy had shewn them considerable
kindness and attention in an ostentatious patronizing
way and they had received his favours as
people willing to be obliged because they felt
that in similar circumstances they would have
been happy in obliging others but at the saide
time the chief's pompous civilities were met
with a simple courtesy which while it showed
they were not insensible to them yet denoted
minds too elevated a cast to be overwhelmed
by condescension or oppressed by trivial favours
this however was what glenroy could not understand
and did not like he was more lavish
than generous he gave freely but he loved to
 destiny

brandish his favours and always looked fqr jan
immediate return in gratitude or adulation
the calm manner and moderate expressions
 captain malcolm were therefore ill calculated
to feed the cravings his vanity boast ashe
might his boastings never called forth any
bursts admiration or applause from his poor
kinsman nor did all the display his wealth
and state appear to excite the slightest envy or
even astonishment in his breast yet there
was nothing sour or cynical in this plainness
nothing that betrayed a contempt for what he
could not attain on the contrary his manners
were mild and pleasing to all who could value
simplicity and sincerity and he was ever ready
to commend and admire when he could do so
consistently with truth
there is perhaps nothing more baffling to
pride than when it meets with contentment ina
humble station it is then like the wind wasting
its strength where there is nothing to oppose it
or the waves spending their foam upon the
smooth printless sand in like manner the
lofty bearing and arrogant pretensions the
destiny 
detain met neither with encouragement nor
opposition in the quiet but independent satisfies
tion his poor cousins
pride is easily instilled even into generous
natures and the glenroy children were not slow
in learning how greatly they were thought superior
to the young donald begs as the chief
contemptuously nicknamed his kinsman's family
this knowledge however availed them little in
practice for the young malcolm though gay
goodhumoured and obliging were free from
that serve spirit which denotes the mercenary
dependent and in their childish intercourse
preserved an ease and equality as remote from
false shame as from vulgar forwardness educated
by pious and enlightened parents their
yoimg minds were imbued with that most elevating
 all principles the genuine spirit 
christianity and by it they were early taught
to distinguish between those things which the
world despises and those thin which are in
themselves despicable though poor they therefore
attached no degrading ideas to poverty
nor affixed undue importance to wealth their
c
 destiny
minds were kept free from sordid passions and
vulgar prejudices while all the nobler qualities
 their nature were strengthened and improved
by the constant exercise the mind's best attributes
love charity contentment fortitude
temperance and selfdenial these were the treasures
the parents sought to lay up in the hearts
itf their children and if they did not always
itoceeed in raising these plants heaveiblygrowt
in that strange and wayward soil the human
heart the very attempt produced a wholesome
uifiuence in displacing pride prejudice and
selfishness those bitter roots envy hatred
and malice
 there was something so sweet and attractive
in mrs malcolm and so pleasing in the whole
family that edith was never so happy as when
allowed to spend some days at lochdhu but
she would have been ashamed to acknowledge
how much she loved them all for she was accustomed
to hear them spoken in a slighting and
somewhat contemptuous manner thus is many
 pure and generous feeling stifled in the young
heart by the withering breath ridicule

chapter viii
it was at this time that the new laird 
inch oman was expected to take possession e
his inheritance and nothing else was talked 
throughout the district while many and various
were the rumours afloat concerning him the
only point they all agreed in was that he was a
very particular man which is the next thing to
being called a hydra but particular men and
particular women too well deserve a chapter to
themselves which they shall perhi have at
another time but this one must be devoted to the
particularities inch orran that partibus
lar man then it was generally reported that he
was a very capricious bad temper or according
to the nursery phrase that he was very apt
toijiave the black dog on his back when that
happened it was said he was in the practice

 sitting in profound silence all the tina theft
lasted with a red nightcap on his head which
red nightcap he would not have lifted fiptr the
king himself till the black dog had taken his
departure and then it was hung up on its own
particular peg till the return the said buck
dog another edition was that he always allowed
his beard to grow with the growth and
strengthen with the strength the fit till at
length in a malting mood he had again recourse
t the razor and came forth with a newmowo
chin ready to salute all the world others said
that inch orran hung out no deadlights on the
approach a storm nor hoisted any signals by
which the enemy could be warned their danger
his black dog it was said was seldom off
his back and went and came just as it happened
without saying by your leave that he had 
black dog nobody doubted and that he was
idrost thoroughly disagreeable was never disputed
whether he had a wife was not so certain 
some said they had seen her others had never
even heard her a third reported her dead
and a fourth in confinement there was also
destiny 
much speculation as to how he would come
when he would arrive where he would reside
whether he would entertain the county c
olenroy ind written a pressing invitation to its
kinsman to take up his abode for the present
wfui him but a very brief dry refusal had been
returned which had hired the chieftain's blood
till he recollected that he was a particular man 
and even a great man must give way to a particular
man inasmuch as the one is sometimes a
poor man and the other is always a rich man
glenroy's next step was to have scouts stationed
to give him the very earliest intelligence inch
orran's arrival and no sooner was that hath
bounced than he ordered his barge to be manned
and accompanied by benbowie he embarked
on the smooth surface a summer's seato

lit up the tales flowers mountains leaves add streaios 
with a diviner day the spirit bright beams

there would have been rapture in every beam

amid such scenes but glenroy and benbowie
cared for none these things though the woods
and waters hills and dales suggested ideas to
them such as they were as they sailed along
and they were pleased holding parley in their
own way and as imagination bodies forth
the fcprm things so the two friends turned
them to shapes and gave to airy nothings a
local habitation and a name glenroy and
benbowie then although they could not be said
to find sermons in stones tongues in the trees
destiny 
or books in the ninny brooks yet found much
profitable matter discourse in the various objects
ctf nature that presented themselves the
crystal depths the limpid waters over which
the sun was shedding his noonday effulgence

sheepwalks blackfaced wethers and

shore inch orran they broke into no idle raptures
about the water plants the fern the wildflowers
the tall foxglove the grey rocks and
bright mossy stones half hid beneath the broad
leafed coltsfoot that formed the rich and variegated
foreground for they were casting searching
looks for black tang and yellow tang
and bell wrack and jagged wrack and

although the ruins inch orran castle hm
an imposing effect when viewed from a distance
e respect they excited was considerably dii
niidied on a nearer survey they stood anti the
summit and close to the edge a romantic eminence
which rose abruptly from the water and
gave them an air grandeur to which they could
not have otherwise aspired the building had
been originally in the form a square with a
court in the centre but two sides it were bow
mere shapeless weatherstained masses stone
which time was every day crumbling into more
picturesque forms and mantling with ivy and
wallflowers thus making beautiful what else
were bleak and bare while such parts the
budding as had fallen down were overgrown
with creeping plants and briars that gave it an
appearance intricacy and thus heightened the
interest wych the mouldering and dilapidated
destiny 
remains a human dwelling never ail to excite
one side the square that next the water had
been repaired and now formed the dwellinghouse
but it was so sombre and so perfectly in
harmony with the rest the building that it
gave no offence for it conveyed no impression
 any modem usurper having invaded the precincts
o the departed it rather seemed as
if soooae its former inmates still lingered
there amid the wreck former ages glenroy
knocked at the door but it was some time ere
his summons was answered at length a very
corpulent redfetched sourlooking servingman
speared and after a little seeming hesitation
in his own mind acknowledged that he believed
his master was at home then with a slow tod
cling reluctant gait he led the way to the apartment
where sat the lord the castle
 destiny
chapter ix
it was a spacious room panelled with oak
and handsomely furnished in the modem antique
style three windows looked upon the loch
and one at the the apartment confronted
an ivymantled tower which admitted few 
day's garish beams at any time much less at
present when there stood stationed there the
huge person mr duncan m'dow
on the entrance the chief he instantly
hastened towards him with his grapplingirons
extended and before glenroy knew where he
was benbowie and he were actually led forward
in a triumphant manner and presented by the
minister to the master the house
i am amazingly proud said he in his
loudest and most emphatic manner that it has
fallen to my lot to introduce my respected friend
destiny 
and patrons glenroy to you inch orran and
likewise my very worthy friend benbowie this
is really a treat 
glenroy certainly had been struck dumb else
he never could have borne this in silence but
he began to rally his forces although he refrained
from breaking out before his kinsman he therefore
merely bit his lip and cast a look at mr
duncan which if looks could have killed would
certainly have laid the pastor senseless at his feet
he then turned to inch orran who had risen to
receive him from before a table on which lay
some law books ledgers bundles papers and
parchments
inch orran was a little meagre sicklylooking
man with a sharp bitter ace a pair fiery vindictive
eyes and a mouth all puckered up as if to
keep in the many cutting things which otherwise
would have got out and indeed it must be
owned that but few escaped in comparison the
multitude that lodged within for he was one 
those gifted individuals who have un grand talent
pour le silence neither red cap nor black
dog were visible but on the contrary the marks
 destiny
 the razor were still visible on his chin and he
welcomed his visitors with something that approached
to bare civility however people maybe
thankful when they meet with even bare civility
from a particular man and glenroy was not one to
be daunted even by bare civility so he shook his
kinsman heartily by the hand and expressed hi
pleasure at seeing him in a very cordial mannes
 you are welcome to the highlands inch
qnan said he warmly and i hope you will
like us well enough to remain amongst u
 sir i thank you was the replywitbafuu
stop
when did you arrive inch orran 
 on tuesday evening at a quarter past six
sir in a loud sharp cracked voice
 i wish i could have prevailed upon you to
take up your quarters at glenroy said the
chief i think i may venture to say you
would have found yourself comfortable there
there sir you must allow me to judge for
myself was the reply
here mr m'dow thought was a fit opportunity
for him to strike in
destiny 
i assure you inch orran said he however
little glenroy may think this house in
comparison his omni yet i can only say i
would be very well pleased if i had a room half
die size this in the manse
 you are very moderate sir returned inch
orran with a bitter sneer which was quite
thrown away upon mr m'dow who went on 
 this house has been wonderfully well repaired
and improved it's really a most commodious
comfortable dwelling and most handsomely
furnished but in general it's my opinion a man
should not think adding to or repairing an old
house a man will never make his place a
bawbee by repairing for instance there's the
estimate the addition and repairs for the
manse and offices that i was mentioning to you
when my worthy and respected patronage in
my house is really a poor affair my byre's ina
most dreadful state and my stable's not 
great deal better sand by the by as if recollecting
himself i'm not sure but i slipped the
estimate into my pocket before i came away
diving into an enormous pouch like a sack he
 destiny
drew forth a large bundle papers which he
turned over as if to ascertain their identity
although every letter was as familiar to him as
his own fingers
aye here it is estimate the necessary
repairs for the manse offices c auchter
truckle you can take a glance at it any time
you are at leisure inch orran upon which he
laid it on the table and making another dive
fished up his snuffmull which shaking and
patting he offered to inch orran who in the
same dry caustic manner said
 sir snuffing is a practice which i despise
and abominate
hoot toot inch orran you must not say
that cried the undaunted mr mdow with a
great roar laughter here's my excellent
friend benbowie has no objections to a snuff
any more than myself here benbowie and he
exchanged boxes and by the by that puts
me in mind a hong mote i read in the edinburgh
caledonian mercury the tli ultimo
that i was very much taken with i thought it
really very good i really had a good laugh at
destiny 
it hach hack hach ho two snuffers happened
to meet one day at the cross i think it was 
says the one to the other as they exchanged
their mulls just as we have been doing says
the one to the other
 a friend's a good thing at a pinch
 yes says the other but is it not still
better for friends to be laying out their money
this way at scent per scent 
here a tremendous volley laughter broke
forth peal upon peal roar upon roar while he
rubbed his hands rocked upon his chair and
threw his body about in all directions in perfect
ecstasy cent per cent benbowie would soon
build the manse and mend my byre and
this witticism was followed by another roar in
which no one joined except benbowie who
did not know at any time what he laughed at
but mr m'dow and his mull were not done
yet though you are no snuffer inch orran
you may perhaps admire the setting 
my mull it's a topers on the top a highland
cairngoreum an uncommon large fine
sone it was given to me in a present by
 destiny
my excellent frond kinduuie on ate ooemton
ef way leaving his unity it was a very gfta
lying token bis regard for me andef the
manner in wueh he was satisfied i had pexfbnned
my duty in educating his seven sis or
highland mulls and caimgoreums are all the
fashion now inch orran
 i am no lapidary sir said inch outran
without deigning even to cast his eyes upon it
that's just my own case inch orr 
quoth the undaunted minister i know very
little about these things myself i have ahmys
had other things to mind and i have nearer given
much attention to your fashionable gimcracks
it's a pity sir said inch orran in that
significant tone which would have conveyed the
most cutting sarcasm to every ear but that 
duncan m'dow
glenroy all this time was fuming to himself
at the laconic dryness his host on the one
hand and the facetious familiarity his minister
on the other and indeed a more discordant
party scarcely ever met together in friendly
semblance and it seemed in vain t expect any
destiny 
thing pleasant from such a compoanl 
glenroy thought the fiunily seat and the
filkjr thousand pounds and he made another 
to be agreeable
 you hare been a great stranger in scotland
inch qrran it must be a long while since you
hate visited your own country 
 forty years sir and upwards
forty years that is a long time what
wonderful changes you must see 
 i do see a change sir but that is not
wonderful
the impertinent old cur thought glenroy
what does he mean by snarling at my words 
and he sat in sullen silence while the old man
kept his scrutinizing eyes fastened upon him with
that terrific expression which eyes sometimeshave
 being not only eyes but ears
forty years is a long time said benbowie 
on my conscience it is a very long time
if there were any ladies present benbowie
you and i who are bachelors would not be very
keen maybe kenning any thing about forty
years said mr mdow with a sly wink and a

but i tell him i must first get my dookit before
i think providing a dow for it don't you
think fm right there inch orran with a
thundering peal laughter
 sir 
o it's entirely a joke on both sides you
understand it glenroy i must get my addition
if not an entire new manse and offices
before i can ask a lady to come and preside
there i can give you no mrs mdow till you
give me my drawingroom and my byre at all
events don't you think that's but reasonable
inch orran 
really mr m'dow this is not a time to
introduce your private affairs said the chief
haughtily
i beg your pardon glenroy but i really
must differ from you there only consider
here's a meeting my three principal heritors 
destiny 
who knows when i may have such another
opportunity though i am sure i trust we may
have many pleasant meetings for all that but
however since i have the pleasure seeing my
principal heritors convened i think ther an be
no harm in just taking a slight glance at my
summons augmentation wych with the
interim locality i happen to have by mere chance
about me and plunging his arm into the
other bottomless gulf a pocket out came a
huge bunch papers from which even ben
bowie instinctively drew away his chair you
see it is no great bulk you'll soon glance over
it there's first the summons that's it no i
summons at the instance the rev duncan
mdow minister auchterbruckle for an augmentation
 stipend c then there's the
interlocutor the court with the interim
locality and decreet for you see although my
allocation is upon the tends 
i hope you have brought mrs malcolm
with you inch orran said glenroy making
a desperate attempt to get the better the
tends
 destiny
certainly sir was the laconic reply
 i trust i shall have the pleasure paying
my respects to her then if convenient 
do you wish to see my wife sir demanded
inch jordan in no very sweet accent
 if quite convenient and agreeable i should
be happy to welcome your lady to the highlands

inch orran rung the bell which was answered
by the fat servingman be so good simon
said he in a voice like a lamb as desire mrs
malcolm to come here
she is dressing i believe said simon
send her here when she is ready simon
and simon with a bang the door withdrew

in a few minutes the door opened and the
lady entered she was arrayed in a bright amber
silk gown a full dress cap decorated with
scarlet ribbons and even more than the usual
number bows that tied nothing and ends that
evidently had no ends to answer save that 
swelling the milliner's bill she had a mean
vacant countenance and a pair most unhandylooking
hands crossed before her clothed in
bright purple gloves with long empty fingerends
dangling in all directions all artists
admit that there is as much character displayed
in hands as in heads and mrs malcolm's hands
were perfectly characteristic they proclaimed
at once that they could do nothing that they
were utterly helpless and morally not physically
imbecile
 destiny
inch orran seemed instinctively aware her
approach for without looking the way she was
he merely said mrs malcolm gentlemen 
and mrs malcolm advancing in an awkward
trailing manner made sundry low curtseys to
her guests and extending her empty fingereiids
which were eagerly caught at by mr m'dowi
she in a peaking monotonous voice pireed
her pleasure at sight them
why mr malcolm had married mrs maldliil
was one those mysteries which had baffled all
 if
offer it could be called being put to benbonde
be was so little in the habit refusing anydiii
except to give money and besides had such a
willing appetite that he at once greeduyassented
mr mdow rubbed his hands drew out his
pockethandkerchief placed his hands upon his
knees and began snuffing the air as though m
already caught the scent some savoury mss
 the bell was faintly rung by indi organs
but some minutes elapsed and no one answered
that's always the way with that simon
said mrs malcolm i'm sure i wish we had a
wellbehaved clever active boy for
but a bitter look and a sh sh from her lord
stopped her tongue while a fierce tingle the
bell brought forth simon
 refreshments if you please simon said
his master in a softer tone and manner than he
had yet evinced
refreshments sir repeated simon putting
his hand to his forehead with an air 
great perplexity
 i think some warm broth would be the best
destiny sf
thing in such a want day said mrs malcolm 
 for when people are warm they should nev
take any thing cold it's very dangerous i had
an aunt once
 something cold simon said his masters
decidedly
 cold sir repeated simon then seem
 to recollect himself he withdrew
then ensued a great deal heart tramping
to and fro and a mighty clattering plates
knives and forks which was music to the ears 
benbowie and mr mdow
at length entered simon and with mvuk
seeming exertion began to rub down a table
although there was neither sped nor spot upcm
it in the most ostentatious manner puffing and
blowing all the while as though he had been in
the treadmill
 take care the carpet simon said ite
mistress but simon seemed as though he heard
her not he then unfolded and ciffblly laid
a tablecloth with mathematical precision retiring
a few paces to judge its general effects
 destiny
and then returning to adjust what his eye pronounced
to be amiss 
 i think the doth shoidd be rather nunre this
way simon said his mistress drawings it towards
her with an air great importance
tut muttered simon as he jerked it in
the contrary direction
once more he withdrew and another pause
ensued during which glenroy made another
attempt to draw his host into conversation
 this is a beautiful situation yours inch
orran said he i really know nothing
finer
it is a very dmrajfe property sir returned
the old man with marked emphasis
you have one the noblest views in scotland
from these windows said the chief proudly
as he looked on his own princely domain
it may be sir but i have other things to
look tp than fine views on this neglected property
replied inch orran
that's precisely my own case inch orran
said mr m'dow one person has been saying
when they came to the manse o what a beaudestiny

tifiil situation mr mdow another says oh
such grand view mr mdow another cries
 i really think you beat glen roy himself in your
prospects mr m'dow that may all be says
i but the best prospects i have in view are a
comfortable manse an addition to the glebe and
the decreet for my augmentation ho hoche
hoch ho
neither glenroy nor inch orran took the
smallest notice this sally and the former
continued to address the latter
i have the advantage you in one respect
inch orran for diis place yours forms one
 the finest features in the view from my 
windows though without vanity i
may say glenroy is also a very fine object from
yours
 probably sir you may have more pleasure
in the view my property than i have in contemplating
yours
glenroy felt his cheek flush at this palpable
hit but just then the door was thrown wide
open and simon appeared with his arms at full
stretch bearing a tray which he deposited on a
s jestivy
tdhtable and then proceeded to arrange
intents with the same bustling importance y
 at the top the table was placed the wist

to you when i can make it convenient to myself
i shall not fsdl to apprise you
tuswas more than glenroy had expected or
eihaps wished for now that he had experienced
the nature the man but course he wait
all pleasure gratification and so forth a hope
was then expressed that mrs malcolm would

most certainly sir replied inch orran
keep no separate establishment for my wife
 i'm sure i shall be very happy to go said
she for i'll be thankful to go any where this
is such a dull place only if the ladies here dress
much to go out to dinner i'm sure i don't know
what i shall do mr malcolm for a cap fo r 
buta sh sh and a wave his hand firjom
her hudbandji stopped her mouth and the visitors
took leave 
as they traversed the long passage they descried
simon at the other extremity waddling
along with a foaming tankard in one hand aafkd
a longnecked bottle in the other and at the
same time the nostrils benbowie and mr
mdow were assailed with the smell some
very gusty viands towards which mr simon
seemed to have been steering his course
the halfopen door a housekeeper's room
from whence issued the fragrance induced them
both to thrust in their heads and there stood
disclosed a table neatly laid for two with a
smoking tureen hodgepodge and a magnificent
jowl salmon at this sight the two
destiny 
stood as if entranced with open mouths and
outstretched necks but it was short duration 
for direct a quick foot an invisible hand and
the door was shut with an angry slap
 on my conscience but i would rather bethe
man than the master said benbowie with
a grunt dissatisfaction as he followed his friend
to th barge
 at least i woidd rather take potuck with
him said mr mdow with a faint attempt at
a laugh as with a discomfited air he betook
himsdf to his amailye as he had christened his
pony in honour the lady kindlier and
trotted away in quest better cheer
 destiny
chapter xl
glenroy returned home much dissatisfied
with his visit he had been provoked at the
dry impertinence the old man disgusted with
the tiresome weakness his wife and incensed
beyond measure at the innumerable offences 
mr mdow neither was his illhumour appeased
when at the a week he received the
following dispatch written in the plainest and
squarest and most inflexible hands
mr mungo malcolm presents his compliments
to mr norman malcolm glenroy and
if still convenient for him to receive a visit mr
mungo malcolm will in pursuance his original
intention wait upon him on wednesday
next the th ult in the course the afternoon
and purposes to be his guest till the following
saturday forenoon when he positively takes
destiny 
leave mr m malcolm will be accompanied
by his wife and male servant
glenroy chafed like a boar at being thus addressed
as mr norman malcolm and scouted the
whole style the billet but it is much to be
wished that the world in general and many very
worthy people in particular would follow the
example mr mungo malcolm in thus precisely
marking the limits their intended stay
all householders whatever they may pretend
must at some period or other have groaned under
the indefinable misery an undefined length 
visit and every family must have felt the want
 a chronometer for ascertaining the respective
ideas both parties as to the reasonable latitude
and longitude a visit in good old times scotland
had its regular standard measure for visiting
as it had for its oatmeal and potatoes a rest day
a dress day and a press day were the appointed
measure a visitor's days the first was con
separated to repose after the fatigues the journey
whether there had been a journey or not 
the second was allotted to showing off the fulldress
suit prepared perhaps for the occasion
 destiny
and the third was delicately appropriated to the
pressing solicitations the host and always conferred
as an act bounty over and above thus
both parties were pleased the presser and the
pressed the presser at having conquered the
pressed at having conceded and thus they parted
happy to part happy to meet and hajy to
part again
but since this barrier has been broken down
by modem innovation visiting has no longer
any limits except such as exist in the minds 
the respective parties and accordingly there's
the respect that makes cautious people pause
before bringing upon themselves a visit a
visit how vaguift how undefined how dark
how immeasurable how obscurehow unfathomable
 how mysterious is a visit a visit
may be meant for a day or a week or a month 
and it may be taken for a winter or a summer
or a year a visit may be the cement friendship
or it may be the bane domestic happiness
 a visit may be like an angel's coming
brief and rare or it may be like a wounded
crocodile drawing its slow length along
destiny 
but none these evils could befall the host
 mr miingo malcolm for the day and hour
and minute his departure were always settled
as upon this occasion long before his arrival
glenroy anticipated any thing but pleasure from
this visit but he comforted himself by considering
it as a compliment and the next thing to
being declared heir to inch orran he therefore
resolved to pay all honour to his guest and
to win his heart by the good cheer and gaiety
he would provide for him
the appointed day arrived a raw bleak
chill unhappylooking day not stormy enough
to be grand but just rough enough to be disagreeable
the hills were covered with mist
the sky with clouds the sea with foam and
doubts were entertained whether the old man
would venture forth on such a day when in the
midst c mist and clouds and rain and foam a
little black dripping boat was descried rowing
along which being run ashore out stepped inch
orran his aspect completely harmonizing with
that nature next was dragged forth mrs
malcolm a mass cloaks and shawls next
 destiny
followed simon with a small bundle under his
arm his person snugly ensconced beneath a high
umbrella which he affected to hold carefully over
his lady but which she got only the droppings
the laird and his lady were welcomed by
glenroy with every demonstration courtesy
and goodwill they were received by him in
his great hall decorated with banners and broads
swords and dirks and claymores and targets
and deers heads and warlike trophies every
description amidst which a consequential fulllimited
piper paced to and fro altogether the
effect was grand and imposing but it was quite
lost upon the guests inch orran if he noticed
at all noticed only to hate such trumpery
and his lady did not know a dirk from a deer's
horn glenroy's attempts at striking them with
awe on their first entrance were therefore all
in vain it was to no purpose that he pointed
out the stately banner one chief and the
singular dirk another and related anecdotes
pertaining to each
inch orran's horrid listening eyes were bent
straight upon him but he never opened his lips
destiny 
unless to utter a monosyllable but still more
enraging was his lady's commotion upon discovering
that she had lost one her gloves it
was a new glove a pink glove a french glove
a habit glove it was the fellow the glove she
had on she must have left it in the boat or it
must have fallen into the sea or she must have
dropped it on the road or simon must have seen
it or it must be in mr malcolm's pocket for it
could not be lost and it was not about her and
she shook herself round and round in testimony
thereof these her surmises and lamentations
were uttered in a low slow monotonous tone to
benbowie and mrs macauley as with a dementia
air she looked all round about and not seeing
her pink glove she saw nothing else mrs macauley
and benbowie bestirred themselves withall
their might in search the stray glove for
it was a case that came home to both their
bosoms they had each lost gloves at different
periods their lives they therefore knew what
it was to lose a glove they entered into the
nature the loss they did not idly sympathize
in it they exerted themselves to seek for it
vol i e
 destiny
they wondered for it they lamented for it they
poked about for it in all improbable as well as
impossible places in short all the energies 
their heads hearts and hands were put in motion
for the recovery the glove but in vain 
simon was next summoned and he ended the
matter at once by boldly declaring that he had
seen the glove drop into the water as his lady
was coming out the boat and that just as he
was trying to recover it a monstrous wave had
swept it away and he could see no more it
i'm sure i never know whether to believe
simon or not said the lady to mrs macauley 
 for i think he'll say any thing just to save
himself trouble 
a rich repast under the head luncheon
was now served up but this inch orran refused
point blank even to approach and upon being
pressed by his host to partake in a manner that
savoured more hospitality than free will left
it will doubtless be a relief to the compassionate reader
to learn that the glove was all this while in mrs malcolm's
own pocket
destiny 
to his guest he said in his most peremptory manner
 sir i make it a rule to dine but once aday
this was uttered in a tone not to be disputed but
he added in a somewhat softer key but i request
sir may be no restraint on your usual practices
and motioning his host towards the table
he betook himself to a roff comer the room
the most remote and inaccessible where he began
to read a newspaper and glenroy already boiling
at his dogged impertinence left him to chew
the cud his own reflections while he did the
honours the banquet

the party were scarcely seated when young
norman came bounding into the apartment in all
the exuberance unchecked animal spiritsjust let
loose fixm the restraints the schoolroom and
evidently master his own actions everywhere
else he was a handsome sprightly boy with a
haughty careless air that showed he was already
aware his own importance he eyed inch
orran for a moment with a look that seemed to
say who are you as he brushed past him
to the table followed by a large greyhound
 go and shake hands with that gentleman
norman said his father that is inch orran
but norman heard as though he heard him
not
i am hungry papa said he casting a
wandering glance from dish to dish all over the
destiny 
table i hope you have got something good
for me o do make haste pray no no i won't
have a muttonchop drawing away his plate
quickly as mrs macauley was preparing to help
him then as suddenly retracting yes you
may give me one for fingal here rn fin my
pretty fellow here is a muttonchop for you 
now eat it like a gentleman and don't grease
the carpet
 norman did you hear me desire you to go
and shake hands with our friend inch orran 
said glenroy in a more authoritative tone
yes papa i will presently but 
 go then sir when i desire you cried the
chief in rising displeasure
 yes papa ah hampile that is so good 
and he jumped and shook his hands in ecstasy
 now do give me some papa there is nothing
i love so much
unless you do as i desire you sir deuce a
bit any thing you shall taste today cried
glenroy angrily his authority over hia son
always requiring to be backed by a threat or a
bribe or an oath sometimes by all three

destiny
well then remember yon promised me
some hampie papa and slowly approaching
inch orran with his head riveted to the table
and his eye upon the dish he extended his hand
to him but it met nth no corresponding more
ment on the part inch orran whose hands
remained firmly closed before him nowise
disconcerted however his young kinsman made
a sort snatch at his hand and then satisfied
he had done his part skipped away back to enjoy
the reward his obedience glenroy tout a
glance at the old man in the comer but he did
not like his look his lips were drawn in till
they were invisible his cheeks were distended
like bolus's bags and his eyes glared like a catin
the dark his lady was all this while seated
between benbowie and mrs macauley and enjoying
herself to her heart's content in conversing
with them
what's become reginald and edith
today enquired glenroy and at that moment
the sound young voices in the hall seemed to
answer the question fingal pricked up his ears
and wagged his tail while his master sprung up
destiny 
and bounded away followed by bis favourite
wbo almost jumped over inch orran in his
eagerness to gain the door
 what are these children about demanded
glenroy angry as the uproar increased
 you must come in you shall come in 
don't let him go hold him fast resounded
through the hall and presently entered a youthful
group consisting the three children die
house all hanging round a fine manlylooking
boy dripping wet and evidently a different
stock from his more daintylooking companions
 there is ronald papa whispered edith
as she ran up to her father
well and what that answered he ina
dissatisfied tone do you see no greater
strangers than him here that you should be
making all this noise 
edith blushed and turned to mrs malcolm 
then but with still more timidity went to inch
orran who relaxing from his sternness took
the little hand that was held out to him and
even bestowed a pat on the head as if to make
 destiny
up for the rebuff she had met with from her
either meanwhile the two boys had compelled
their guest to approach to the table quite unconscious
 the haughty looks with which glenroy
regarded him
 now you are our prisoner cried norman 
 so sit down and you shall have something to
eat though you deserve to be fed on bread and
water for attempting to escape here fin at
him if he offers to stir without my leave
 how your dirty shoes have stained my
towers said reginald pettishly as he rubbed
tome spots mud from his white trowsers i
wish i hadn't gone near you and i am so hot
putting his fingers through his hair and throwing
himself at full length upon two chairs he
began to fan himself with a napkin
 so master ronald what has brought you
here this bad day enquired the chieftain in no
very encouraging accent
the boy coloured as if he felt the rudeness
 the enquiry then answered i came to
return norman's fishingrod
destiny 
plioo there could be no hoary in tfaai
said the chief stul more coldly
 i had promised to bring it today said
ronald
 pshaw what signified that said nonnan
carelessly you needn't have got yourself wet
for a promise if that was all
 i would rather have to swim for my life
than break my word said ronald warmly
the two boys burst into a fit laughing 
 on my conscience but there's a great difference
said benbowie with a look alarobu
 come come let us have no more nonsense 
said glenroy impatiently and if you're fer
any thing to eat boys make haste for everybody's
done
ronald declined the ungracious invitation
and whs retiring when he was again seized by
his two friends
 o you know you are our prisoner so you
needn't attempt to get away you trust stay
and you shall eat so sit down
 must and shall repeated ronald with a
smile while his open countenance and fine
 bfistiky
intrepid air showed that he yielded more from
goodhumour than from false shame or fear for
he wore
 upon his forehead clear
the freedom a mountaineer 
a face with gladness overspread
and looks by human kindness bred
altogether there was an air noble artless
sttttplieity about the boy extremely prepossess
king and rendered still more striking when contented
with the more artificial elegance his
companions and the saucy capricious airs cf
superiority which marked the children confluence

 now although you are a prisoner said
norman i shall allow you to choose for yourself
what will you have here is a hampie
which i can recommend papa i told barclay
that i thought he had put rather too many truffles
and morels in the last and not enough 
eggs and by the by plover's eggs are much
the best if you like venison ronald here is a
imsh which is by far the best way eating
venison at least in my opinion
destiny 
 i'll take a muttonchop said ronald helping
himself to what was next him
a muttonchop horrible that's fingal's
dish but he wouldn't eat them now for they
are almost cold
it is very good said ronald eating with
a hearty appetite
perhaps you choose a cold potatoes too
said reginald contemptuously holding one up
warm ones are better said ronald taking
a potatoes but i don't care it doesn't signify

 no to be sure if people have no taste it
does not signify said norman piqued at the
indifference his guest and bent upon showing
his power and consequence especially before
such queerlooking people as inch orran and
his lady
 you are quite wet ronald said edith sofas
she put her hand on his arm then whispered
to her father fray papa give ronald a glass
 wine
 here's a glass wine for you said glen
roy pouring it out ungraciously and as if be
 destiny
wished to the scene but ronald declined
taking it
 do take it dear ronald said edith
 we shall mike him take it said the young
heir whose hospitality was the most peremptory
nature
 if i was to take it for any body it would
be for edith said ronald but i don't choose
any wine thank you
 come drink it off and go away and amuse 
yourselves somewhere else cried glenroy in a
very bad humour
ronald instantly rose but was again seized
by his two tormentors
o you shall not stir till you have drank it
to the last drop
and norman taking the glass wine would
have forced it to his lips but he shook him off
 nothing will make me drink wine said he
firmly
 oh you are a turk a mussulman a
turk a turk shouted the two boys in derision


a spark shot from the corner inch orran's
eye as he turned abruptly away muttering something
between his teeth the rain fell without
intermission for the rest the day which seeih
ed endless duration to both parties and glen
roy was at last obliged to have recourse to mrs
macauley's much despised musical powers ta
wile away the time

chapter xii
the following day cleared up and there was
a bright sun and a sweet blowing wind and
every thing looked gay and every body pleased
except inch orran who minded neither sun nor
wind and was alike insensible to the charms 
nature and the influence weather
glenroy had invited a large party that is he
had summoned all who were within call to do
honour to his kinsman's visits and the house
which indeed was seldom empty had continued
to fill during the whole morning with invited
guests as also with chance droppersin various
descriptions the chief felt as if there was
safety om his kinsman's illhumour in the multitude
that surrounded him his courage rose
his spirits revived and he was himself again
but it was a transitory calm the dinner hour
destiny 
was drawing near the guests were all assembled
when suddenly borne on the breeze came
the distant neighing a steed glenroy started
and turned red another and another loud and
long and shrill and joyful burst it was the
wellknown happy neigh amailye announcing
the approach mr duncan mdow had
the castle possessed a drawbridge it certainly
would have been raised on the instant but as
there were neither javelinmen nor moat to
oppose him the minister rode boldly on arrayed
as usual in his large woolly greatcoat and red
worsted comforter
mrs malcolm caught the sotigh his names
and thereupon thought proper to address glenroy

 is that the mr mdow that was so good as
to call one day at inch orran what an uncommon
pleasant sensible wellinformed man he is 
i was really very much pleased with him he's
so polite and wellbred and has so much to say 
he seems a very superior man it must be a great
advantage to have such a man for a clergyman
and i'm sure you have great credit in your
 destiny
choice for there's really something so very 
ahem a so imcommonly sl a s much 
the gentleman about him
glenroy disdained to reply
 here the announcement mr mdow put a
stop to the remarks and presently his heavy
foot announced itself although there was a
large assemblage ladies and gentlemen present
mr mdow as usual made a point grappling
with each individually right and left here
and there cross hands and down backs in the
most indefatigable manner then fastening upm
his host he burst out with one his itvaht courier
roars laughter
 well glenroy there's one thing i'm sure
you'll not say me as was said a poor friend
 mine who was thought rather neglectful 
his parish in the visiting way and something too
metaphysical in his discourses om his pulpit 
it was really very ready said sho hoch how 
that he was a most wonderful man for he was
invisible six days in the week and incomprehensible
on the seventh very clever rather
destiny 
severe to be sure but ic was really just the
truth how how ho hoeh
glenroy was not like hamlet he could have
used daggers but he could not speak them he
did not excel in repartee at any time for when
provoked he was instantly in a passion and npt
daring to give scope to it in the present instance
all he could do was to dart a furious glance at
the intruder and turn on his heel but heel or
toe it was all one to the minister who was
quite insensible to all rebuffs especially as he
met with a warm reception from such the
party as being more remote and inaccessible in
their dwellings and having nothing to say as
to the augmentation were not favoured with so
much his company in their ovm houses
and as one person easy manners no matter
how vulgar sis always acceptable to the
guests whatever he may be to the host mr
mdow's bad jokes and hearty laugh were very
palatable to some the party who found them
much more relishing than the overbearing pomp
 glenroy or the morose silence inch orran
mr mdowj therefore was very soon riding on
 destiny
the rigging his own good spirits and peal
upon peal roar upon roar followed in quick
succession and raised many an echo from the
lower orders the company his staying to
dinner wa a matter course in the first fluid
 his gratified feelings at having got the man 
his choice a moderate man an honest fellow
and also pleased dth the convivial habits and
jolly manners which he saw would be no restraint
on his own glenroy had in a rash moment given
him a general invitation to his house which the
minister had not been slack in availing himself
 particularly if there was any thing going on
that promised better cheer or more amusement
than common as surely therefore as glenroy
had any new arrivals consequence or a larger
or more ceremonious party than usual or an
extraordinary influx company or any strangers
 great distinction he might depend upon
mr m'dow's dropping in it was quite wonderful
how and where he acquired such speedy
and certain intelligence for in a remote and
thinlypeopled country where dwellings were
few and far between it could neither be by seedestiny

ing or hearing or smelling but so it was no
wild indian could have tracked his prey with
greater certainty and finesse than mr mdow
did a good dinner indeed nothing could surpass
the accuracy and success with which he
followed the trail a jolly party or what he
termed an innocent recreation
glenroy having surmounted the first shock 
his appearance though still boiling with wrath
against him resolved to make it pl that his
company was not expected at dinner and therefore
said in his stateliest manner you are too
late for luncheon mr m'dow but if you wish
for any refreshment i shall order some to the
eatingroom for you
you are really extremely kind and considerate
glenroy replied his guest with much
hearty warmth manner but it is quite unnecessary
in you to put yourself to that trouble
as i had a snack at your friend captain malcolm's
 and indeed i was pressed to stay still
there which i would have done if i had not
previously intended mysdf the honour taking
my poduek with you as you were so very polite
 destiny
as to assure me being always welcome a piece 
 kindness and hospitality which i am sure i
shall never forget
that's just as it should be remarked a
laird who had three ferries between him and
mr m'dow there ought always to be an
open door to the minister
 it's b pleasant thing to see the heritors and
ministers on a friendly footing said another
whose tends were valued and exhausted
in that respect i have really reason to be
proud said mr m'dow rapping his mull with
an air modest importance for ever since
my induction i have met with uncommon attention
and hospitality not only from my respected
patron here but likewise from the very gentlemen
who thought proper to oppose the presentation
there's captain malcolm for instance
he was very keen against me more so indeed
than what many men in my situation would have
overlooked but he's a little the highflyer 
the very shem the unco gude hoch hoch
how one o your gospellers in short what one
 my worthy brethren calls your saimtshoch
destiny 
hoch ho but i believe he is a wellmeaning
man for all that so i made a point showing
him that i bore no illwill against him and that
i had no objections whatever to be on a friendly
footing with him with another long selfsuffix 
cent pinch snuff
he's a very honest man captain malcolm
said a goodnatured bluff laird and has as fine
a family as i ever saw and as well brought up
too there's not a prettier girl in all the shire
than lucy malcolm and he'll be a lucky man
that gets her for his wife
mr m'dow now addressed inch orran i
was just saying sir that i had the pleasure
this forenoon paying my respects to a very
worthy gentleman a clansman and i believe a
relation yours captain john malcolm a
slight stiff bend from inch orran was the only
reply but mr m'dow went on my principal
object in calling on him today was that i
wished particularly to see a set farmoffices
which i heard he had lately built and also some
improvements which he had made upon his
house and i thought i might pick up some
 destiny
useful hints from them to lay before my excellent
patron here especially in respect a
byre there's nothing in my remembrance
that there's been greater improvements in than in
byres however i must say i was disappointed
he has made ho addition any signification to
the house and the offices are really upon a very
moderate scale every much extremely moderate
indeed
 sir youmistake me i never said i b
been ill used
 i beg pardon but i certainly understood
you to say so inch organs
 then sir you misunderstood me
i'm happy to hear it inch orran for i
assure you i should have been very sorry if any
misunderstanding had taken place between us 
for there are few men for whom i entertain a
higher respect than i do for you
 excuse me sir there is a misunderstanding

sir said the qiief i am really at a loss
etikt 
to understand you if i have edged in any
attentions 
 no want attention sir in a tone as mu
as to say rather too much it
 has there been any thing in any o the
company to offend you inch orran 
y much pronounced in a most emphatic
banner then after a little pause every thing
and in all them sir
 indeed upon my soul sir you are ill 
please you have met with some the first
gentlemen in the aunty i can tell youwfaat
ever you may think 
again his mouth was contemptuously purled
while the chief took a turn up and down the
room to cool himself he then stopped and
having gulped down his anger said come
come inch orran i see how it is yoq area
sober man yourself and you have been a
little scandalized at seeing some my meofh
take their glass so freely but every country this
its own customs you know and i did'nt dispose
you expected to find a company hermits in
the highlands scotland
 nsstint
 sir if by hermits you mean anelmnrites cit
holy hypocrites i despise them as mxtck as you
do but i was met primed to witness such
excesses in eating and drinking

 there something else sir
 then you had better go on sir much better

style i live in
 sir you mistake i find no front i only
speak my mind
destiny 
c call it what you please sir you object to
my friends and my table
 excuse me again sir i object to neither
i have sat at the one and associated with the
oder though they were both highly offensive tome

 and i can tell you sir your behaviour hs
ben no less tensive to me and my friends by
heaven there is not another man on the ceof
the earth i would have suffered to stay in my
house and sit at my table for three days without
opening his lips sir let me tell you such behaviour
is more like that a spy than any thing
else and glenroy's passion was now at its
heififht
 exactly sir said his antagonist pursing
up his mouth with an air sovereign contempt
 i came to your house not as a babbler and
wineobibber but as a note and observer and i
have accomplished my purpose
by a violent effort glenroy regained his temper
and seeing all was at hazard he restive to
humour the old man and let him go his way in
peace he therefore said with a laugh well

is men who what you call liked their glass de
gained as they were to a level with the brutes
who still retained some manly feelings but i
never knew an epicure who cared for any o

glenroy had stood the attack upon himself
his friends and his table with wonderful eqiia

here gfenroyr could scarcely

agree to such a thing
and he walked hastily up and down in start
itadon while the old man sat looking as demave
as a cat isr continued he i don't desire
you your son or your son any thing he has
any right to so neither you moor he hare any
business to say buff or sty in the matter 
bursting with halfrestrained rage gremio

uttered some unintelligible ejaculations and
allowed his kinsman to go on i
 sir the one to mend a degenerate breed is
he who speaks the truth who keeps his word
who honours his parents who is nogormandizev 
who minds neither wind nor weather sid who
has been born and bred in wholesome poverty
such a one is the lad i saw scorned aft browbeat
at your table and provided he ronald
malcolm will at a proper age consent to take
your maister to wife and she has sense enough
to accede to the proposal the property call be
settled upon their heirsmale on the other
hand should he refuse
but here an oath burst from glenroy's lips
like a thunderbolt and the floodgates f im
longrepressed fury were opened loud and
fierce was the torrent that broke loose but tike
old man sat and bore it all with the most perfect
composure and even seemed as if he enjoyed
the storm he had raised
at that moment a servant entered to say that
the boat was ready and the tide answered inch
orran rose
destiny 
 time and tide will no man bide glenroy
i have now spoken my mind to you and i shall
leave you to deliberate on my proposal
 i would rather see any daughter mine in
her cobn than the wife any beggarly tacks

 i have other views for my daughter and i will
dispose her as i think proper
 quite right sir if you can
 sir i both can and trtvz
 you are a lucky man sir it seems i have
no more to say
 sir i have something to say to you tina

i
opposition was a tiling glenroy was uttl
accustomed to at any time but to be tlus
bearded and got the better in bison hous
in the very heart his friends guests ad
countrymen was an indignity he uld not away
with for a time he gave full play to his passions
and like a very dragon dd breathed
ape and fiery all around but as what is violent
is never lasting he soon cooled down to his
usual temperature and being a sanguine disposition
he even began to look upon what had
passed as a sort bad joke or illnatured whim
 the old man's which would go no farther and
would not be followed by any bad consequences
the calm however was short duration the
first intelligence he heard was that ronald
malcolm had been invited to inch orran and
destiny 
was actually living there in high favour with his
kinsman
this went so far beyond glenroy's worst anticipations
that he disdained to be in a passion
about it he was perfectly cool and composed
as every body might see only his colour was
considerably higher than usual and though he
hummed a soi it was much out tune and
when he laughed very heartily nobody knew
very well what it was at in short he had all
the gaiety and indifference which people commonly
have when very much agitated and dis
necessary for glenroy either to sing out timid
or laugh out time or contradict his son or do
any thing put the common course nature
it was reported that ronald malcolm so eur
from having been invited to inch orran had
been sent there by his father to try to bribing
about a reconciliation that instead that lie
had met with a very bad reception and been
even turned from the house late yes he did his mother and i saw no readestiny
s
son figaiiist it on the contrary we were both
in hopes it might lead the way to a reconciliation
and i trust we were actuated by something
better than mere worldly motives in wishing it
though no doubt these had their influence too
but whether as christians or as mere selfinterested
parents we certainly did most earnestly
desire it it has however been otherwise appointed
and we are satisfied
it was reported said glenroy that your
son had been taken into high favour was there
then no foundation for that 
he was well received and kindly treated
said captain malcolm but 
but it didn't last cried glenroy with
something triumph in his tone i could have
told him that for between ourselves the man's
as mad as a march hare but how came ronald
to quarrel with him for at one time he seemed
to have got into his good graces 
 thanks to you for that glenroy said captain
malcolm and he might perhaps have been
there still if he had not preferred his parents to
a fortune it was such a strange unnatural 
destiny
psal the old man made him that i can only
account for it on the plea insanity he kept
ronald for three days shewed him all his property
told him all his wealth and then
offered to adopt him to make him his heir and
settle his whole fortune upon him on condition
 his renouncing all intercourse with his own
fiunily 
 ay that s just a piece with his threatening
to disinherit roman for asking for the
back a moorfowl one day at dinner the man's
certainly mad and what did your son say to
that r
few boys i believe would have been base
and sordid enough to have yielded to the temptation
but some them might have listened toit
more calmly instead which ronald whose
temper and feelings are warm was so indignant
that he instantly left the house and set out to
walk twenty miles in a dark stormy night
he should have come to me cried glenroy
warmly my house was all in the way and
i would have made him welcome at any hour 
die night for i assure you i approve highly
destiny 
 his behaviour he did just what he ought to
have done it gives me a very good opinion 
your son it does indeed very good 
this was uttered with great emphasis and as
if his encomium would be the making ronald's
fortune
we have indeed reason to thank god that
he is deserving our affection said captain
malcolm with emotion
yes he seems really a promising boy and
he acted in that matter just as he ought to have
done to be sure it would have been very bad
if he had done otherwise and by the by what
are you going to make him is it not full
time you were thinking that 
 i have had many an anxious thought on
that subject said captain malcolm with a
sigh
aye to be sure it's no joke setting out a
lad in the world now every profession is so
overstocked but its time ronald should learn
something
 i trust he has learnt something and is everyday
learning more said his father

i might have saved my four hundred ayear 
habits and opinions i really never happened ta

captain malcolm was quite accustomed to

overbearing nonsense the most insufferable
 all the varieties nonsense and he had the
ikerit always answering him as calmly as
though he had been conversing with plato himself

 the actions each day and hour are what
form the habits hei replied and the taste and
affections are what influence the opinions both
combined are what insensibly form the character
ronald is deficient in many things but i trust
he has imbibed good principles i am sure he
possesses kindly affections he is not wanting in
solid learning and his habits are those a hardy
highland boy who minds neither wind nor
weather hunger nor thirst and who can climb
the rock swim the water and sleep among the
heather
 destiny
o i have no doubt you have done all you
could for him said the chief slightingly but
we all know there are few gentlemen fit to
educate their sons
 yet i believe it is from their parents that
children receive by far the most important part
 their educations replied captain malcolm
the deuce you do then i for one can
assure you i take no sort charge my son's
education i pay four hundred ayear which i
think a pretty fair allowance for a dominie and
i should think it rather hard after that if i was
expected to educate him myself 
captain malcolm smiled perhaps at the ostentation
with which this was uttered then replied
 yet his habits and opinions will be much more
influenced by you than by his tutor and these
are what i consider as the most important parts

 my good sir any herd's son in the country
can do all that said glenroy contemptuously 
 but that's nothing to the purpose we were
talking your son's education which is quite a
different thing there's my own boy although
i say it i don't believe there's a boy in the
kingdom farther advanced in his education than
he is
those who can afford to purchase instruction
for their children are in the right to do it
said captain malcolm mildly for a liberal
education is a great advantage but those who
cannot ought to be satisfied with giving their
children a virtuous and a useful one you
and i glenroy are differently circum s danced 
wealth educates your son but poverty must train
mine and the best education a poor man can
give his son is to make him know and feel
betimes that he is the son a poor man
that s all very true said glenroy but
what are you to make him what would you
think making a preacher him i could be
 some use to you there i have a good deal

patronage tny own ai well as something to
say in other quarters
 i thank you but ronald's bent does not lie
that way and no motive worldly interest dll
even prompt me to urge any son mine to enter

 a very good sensible choice cried the
chief just the very thing for him and the
sooner he goes the better learn young learn
fisdr is you know a good old saying
he will go i expect next year said captain
malcolm a cousin his mother's captain
stanley a worthy man and gallant oiffier
has offered ronald a birth in his ship
ah that's very well but you ought to send
him in the meantime to a public school it's a
great advantage for a boy who has his way to
push in the world to have had some training
before he begins and he'll learn more the
world in one year at a seat public school than
he will do all his life at home
i am no friend to a premature knowledge

my son a good man rather than a great one

glenroy contemptuously but if s a great dial
too fine for me i have no notion your romantic

receive these testimonies the minister's good
wills which she did with her usual sweetness 
aimer and though few things could be more
offensive to her tian the company mr mdow
she yet behaved towards him with that polite
endurance which to one his gross ken was
equal to the most flattering encouragement
v there are some uncommon fine prospects
about the manse miss lucy said he as he
found her one day sketching the view from the
parlour window i think you would make a
fine hand them
 the views in your neighbourhood are indeed
very beautiful said lucy and i have
long wished to take a few sketches there if it
were not too presumptuous in me to attempt it
 oh miss lucy exclaimed mr m'dow
how can you say that but i'm really happy
that you admire the situation the manse
every body must admire it said lucy 
 it is quite charming
i'm delighted to hear you think so cried
mr m'dow for it's rather a remote secluded
situation though to be sure the prospect's much
destiny 
more animated than it was nor that the ttekbii
boat comes our way regularly twice awekilim
touches at the village which is not above d gunshot
from the manse she's an amazing convenience
besides making a most interesting
object in the view for instance i get my tea
and sugar brought to my very door by her fop a
mere trifle i can even get a loaf bread from
glasgow within fourandtwenty hours after itfk
ont the oven for a penny or so additional
which is no consideration to me in comparison
 the comfort the thing if s uncommon fine
bread too
a pause ensued for the minister's communications
called for no reply and lucy busied
herself with her drawing mr mdow resumed
 eh miss lucy if i might but hope for the
honour seeing you at the manse some day
you would really make me very proud
i should be sorry if a visit from me were to
have that effect said lucy smiling but certainly
i shall be very happy some day when
papa and i are taking a ride to bring my sketch
 
 
 destiny
bowl to auchteibmckle and carry off il i cfm
some ito beauties
before the minister libertine to utter his raptures
captain malcolm entered the room and
after the usual preliminaries mr mdow began
 i have just been admiring miss lucy's painting
pointing to her pencilnsketch i'm no
great cafmyshtire indeed but it strikes me as
being uncommonly well executed 
 and in return i have been praising mr
mdovs fine views papa said she and
have even been bold enough to talk attempting
to sketch some them
 i assure you sir i am very mundi flattered
with miss lucy's approbation my prospects 
and i was just requesting as a most particular
favour that she would do me the honour some
day to come over with you and take a look 
 my premises there's not much to be seen to
be sure just now about the manse but the
prospects all round are much admired and when
i get my decreet things will be made more
decent about the doors than they are at present
you little know what you are about when
destiny 
ypu invite such a noted sketcher as locylxi
visit you said captain malcolm with a nnik
 she is such an enthusiast and you have so great
a variety jane views in your neighbourhood
that i warn you you will find it difficult to get
rid her again
 ru take my chance that captain with
a prodigious roar delight i'll take my
chance that and now captain will you not
just do me the favour to fix a day dipn miss
lucy and you will ride over and take a look 
my premises 
we had better take our chance a fine
day said lucy who privately thrust the
minister's absence was not the worst that could
befit them
i beg your pardon miss lucy but really
the disappointment would be dreadful if i wad
to miss the honour a visit from the captain
and you perfectly dreadful and it miffkt happen
for i have occasion to be a good deal from
home in fact i consider it as a principal part
 my duty to visit a good deal and to be on the
best footing with the heritors my parish it's
 destiny
a discreditable thing when the minister and the
gentry are no just at one and wherever i have
been i have always made a point keeping the
very best company
 a clergyman who fedthfiilly discharges his
duty must see great varieties company said
captain malcolm and ought neither to consider
himself as elevated by the notice the
higher orders or debased by mingling occasionally
with the lowest and poorest his
flock
there i perfectly agree with you captain
replied mr mdow with much hearty warmth 
these are precisely my own sentiments on the
subject from the honourable nature my
office i have always looked upon myself as upon
a footing if not rather shoopayreor to gentlemen
 larger fortune and who may perhaps
make a greater dash in the world than i do and
on the other hand i never refuse when properly
called upon to attend to the poorest man or
woman in the parish
this was uttered with a modest air selfdestiny

approbation and concluded with a long selfcomplacent
pinch snuff
 there is indeed a reverence due to the
clergy as a body said captain malcolm and
in a christian country they are always sure 
meeting with it but that is a feeling which
operates very slightly upon the minds the
community and unless ministers can claim
individually the respect due to superior piety
and excellence i fear collectively it is little
avail
 you're perfectly right captain i agree
with you entirely every clergyman is called
upon to keep up the dignity his station and
to cut a respectable figure in the world it
doesn't do for a man to let himself down too
much
 in my opinion a clergyman who is in the
way his duty never can let himself down 
said captain malcolm for he must be endeavouring
to raise the minds those around him
to the highest standard moral excellence
that s really not an easy matter captain
said mr m'dow for the common people are
 destiny
a bad set but here comes mrs malcolm i
hope i'll get her on my side to fix a day for the
visit to the manse
and herewith mrs malcolm was assailed with
entreaties to use her influence for that puisse
or as the minister elegantly expressed it just
to nail the business at once mrs malcolm was
pleased at the thought a little excursion for
lucy so she seconded the minister's proposal
and to his great delight a day was fixed when
captain malcolm and his daughter were to pay
a pining visit at the manse auchterbruckle

chapter xvii
glenroy's anger against inch orran had
much abated since he had ascertained what he
called the defeat the donald begs
after all inch orran is not a bad body
he would say to benbowie he knows what
he's about and will not be easily taken in or
i'm much mistaken i begin to think i was
rather short with him when he was here though
the wretch was most confoundedly provoking
too but he's an old man and a particular man
and he has such an idiot a wife i really
believe after all he meant nothing
 on my conscience i believe so responded
benbowie nothing nothingnothing at
au
still this nothing had left an awkwardness
which glenroy did not know very well how to
get over something ought to be done to prove
 destiny
there was nothing but what that something was
he could not tell after what had passed he
could not possibly renew the overtures in poison
still less could he send benbowie as his
ambassador had inch orran been like anybody
else he might have felt his pulse with a
haunch venison but that most likely would
cmly lead to fresh hostilities so difficult is it te
manage people who have no weak side or rather
no favourite sense to gratify
inch orran had a weak side indeed but that
was rather his strong point for the love 
money was his prevailing passion and all
besetting sins that is perhaps the most difficult
gratify harpagon to be sure had his fo
sine but in general the difficulty administering
to the pure love gold must be greater than
that pampering any other evil propensity
glenroy was however relieved from his embarrassment
by received the following dispatch
from his kinsman
 mr mungo malcolm inch orran presents
compliments to mr norman malcolm pf
glenroy and requests the favour his company
lyestiny 
and that his friend mr lachlan malcolm 
benbowie at his house on the afternoon 
wednesday the th instant to remain till the
forenoon saturday the th instant mr m
malcolm begs to intimate that he can also accommodate
mr n malcolm's body servant
an invitation to inch orran was what glenroy
had not looked for and though the manner
in which it was couched was highly offensive
yet that was passed over with a slight oath or
two the visit itself indeed would be an act
tf the severest penance both to mind and body
blhumour impertinence and starvation to be
endured for three days even glenroy's stout
heart quailed to think but to refuse would
be at once to renounce all hopes and expectations
it yeas a golden opportunity for bringing
matters to the point it was evident inch orran
was making up in his own way it would
be madness to refuse to meet him go he must
even in the face the bladebone mutton 
benbowie at first made a faint resistance as even
his dull fancy pictured to itself the fleshpots
 glenroy in mournful contrast with the bare
 bbtikt
bones inch qmm but be was so lite in the
habit tii opposing his chief that he soon succumbed
so after much consideration the following
answer was dispatched 
 glenroy returns kind compliments to inch
orran and assures him he will allow no engages
ments to stand in the way hn accepting his
friendly invitation for wednesday the th and
will if possible make such arrangements as may
enable him to remain till the th vnik his worthy
kinsman benbowie begs his best respects
and will do himself the honour waiting upon
inch orran at the same time
well for my part said mrs macaulay
when she heard the invitation discussed 
day afternoon and staid till the saturday forenoon
 and then he asks you and benbowie and
your servant just to do the same thing and is
not that saying i'll give you neither less nor
more than what you gave me 
p you're a soothsayera diviner are you 
 destiny
you can tell what s passing in people's minds 
but i would advise you mrs mary macauley to
stick to your needles and thread for you know
no more mankind than one your own
worsted monsters i 
 well well glenroy i know you're a great
deal wiser than me but we'll see who's rights
for all that
wednesday the th arrived and looked most
auspicious the chief and his mend having
made a hearty luncheon and sighed to think it
was the last plentiful meal they should behold
for three days embarked with a favourable gale
and were in due time safely landed at inch
orran
if glenroy had any misgivings in his own
mind as to the sincerity the reconciliation they
were soon dispelled by the courteous reception
he met with no symptom displeasure apr
feared either in the looks or manners his host 
on the contrary he was studiously polite and
even accosted him with a smile or something
intended for such though so suspicious a
character that it would have made any one else
destiny 
instinctively bethink them the canny old 
scottish motto touch not the cat but a
glove however glenroy was not the man to
be daunted by a smile so he returned it in full
measure and a most cordial greeting tool place
inch orran even enquired in a mild and courteous
manner after the health young norman
which glenroy considered as the next thing to
declaring him his heir
 i have had three gentlemen residing with
me for some days said inch orran addressing
the chief whom it was my wish that you should
see here one is my lawagent or man 
business mr medium another is my factor
mr mfarlane and the third is mr crowfoot
an eminent landsurveyor their business with
me has been an important nature and has
proved highly satisfactory in its results it was
concluded this morning but the gentlemen 
remain with me tiu tomorrow in order to celebrate
the termination our labours and also to
afford you sir an opportunity acquiring any
information you think proper on the subject

narrow stone passage with a door on each sides
and there was a perpendicular wooden stair and
that was all that was to be seen at the first coop
dbiu but if little was revealed to the eye the
secrets the house were yielded with less coy
reserve to the other senses for there was to be
heard the sound a jack now beginning with
that low slow nioumfiil whine which jacks ei
sensibility are sure to have then gradually rising
to a louder and more grating pitch till at length
one mighty crash succeeded as all mighty crashes
are by a momentary silence then comes the
winding up which contrary to all the rules 
the draxna is in fact only a new beginning and
so on ad infinitum till the deed is done withall
these progressive sounds was mingled the
sharp shrill loud voice and gaelic accented in a house pu suppose
jbvlre the mistress to have your kitchen
filled with all the clamjamphray the eountr
drunken soldiers randy beggars illtongued
tinklers and so on how it would do i say for a
young lady your delicacy and refinement going
down to order your dinner to find the very scum
 the earth sitting perhaps on your kitchen
dresser 
that is indeed a climate to be avoided
said captain malcolm laughing and pm
afraid lucy you must admit that charming lis
your favourite picture is it is one which in these
days it would not do to copy too closely we
may please ourselves by such representations 
primitive manners but i fear they no longer
exist except in the poet's page or your imagination
steamboats and stagecoaches have
now brought each village and hamlet in close
contact with some great town even with london
itself and the evils the poet so beautifully predicted
are i fear coming on apace i doubt we
should now in vain seek from the land's to
destiny 
jobnogroat's house for a sweet auburn
rose best riches are ignorance wealth
but i see lucy won't give up her love for beggars
for all we can say
lucy smiled as she replied mr mdos
representation christian charity is certainly
very different from the poet's but i am still
inclined to side with him and to think that

much may be made human nature even in
its worst state by kindness as mrs fry has
testified and so i believe good mr stuart has
often found it the lines that follow are still
more descriptive him pray papa read
them and captain malcolm went on 
 thus to relieve the wretched was his pride
and even his failings lean'd to virtue's side
but in his duty prompt at every call
he watch'd aid wept and felt and prayed for all 
and as a bird each fond endearment tries
to tempt its newfledged offspring to the skies
he tried each art reproved each dull delay
allured to brighter worlds and led the way
allow me in the meantime to lead the
way to something more substantial miss lucy
cried mr m'dow seizing her hand as jess put
 dystimr
hm head in at the door and haying given a
gjjare with her eyes and wide opened her mouth
emitting a sort guttural sounds importing that
 aw's ready galloped down stairs again as
had and fast as she could 
 give me leave miss lucy but the stair's
rather narrow for two you know the way
torn to the left hand my trance ifs very
easy for these poets to preach but it's not so
easy always for us preachers to practise hocb
ho 
this sentiment uttered a grace was hurried
over and the company seated themselves at
table which was literally covered with didke
all close huddled together in the middle was
a tureen leek soup alias cockyleeks with
prunes at one a large dish innumerable
small clammy freshwater trouts at the other
two enormous fat ducks stuffed to the throat
with onions and decorated with onion rings

were minced collops and tripe confronted vna
a dish lai old pease drowned for iskej

mashed potatoes scored and restored with the
marks the kitchenknife a weapon which is
to be found in all kitchens varying in length
fran one to three feet and in uncivilized hands
used indiscriminately to cut meat fish fowl
onions bread and butter saucers full illcoloured
pickles filled up the interstices
i ordered merely a slight refreshment
said mr mdow surveying his banquet with
gleam complacency i think it preferable to a
more solid mail in this weather all good
scotch dishes in my opinion there's none equal
to cockyleeks as a friend mine said it's both
nectar and ambrosia you'll find that uncom
only good miss lucy if you'll just try it 
for it's made by a receipt my mother's and
she was always famous for cockyleeks the
prunes are a great improvement they give 
great delicacy to the flavour my leeks are not
come to their full strength yet but they are
extremely sweet you may help me to a few
i
 destiny
more the broth capimn and don't spare ae
leeks i never see cockyleeks without tkiid
ing the honest man who found a snail ink 
tak ye that snack my man says he for
ltking sae like a plumday hach hach ho 
there's a roasted hare coming to remove tk
fish and i believe you see your refreshment
there's merely a few trifles coming 
lucy had accepted one mr dud's little
muddy trouts as the least objectionable article
 the repast and while mr mdow's mouth
was stuffed with prunes and leeks silence ensued
but having dispatched a second plateful iaifd
taken a bumper wine he began again i
can answer for the ducks miss lucy if you'll
do me the favour to try them a clean knife
and fork jess to mr dugald to cut them i
prefer ducks to a goose a goose is an inconvenient
sort bird for it's rather large for one
person and it's not big enough for two but
my stars jess what is the meaning this 
the ducks are perfectly raw in an accent 
utter despair what is the meaning it 
you must take it to the brander and get it done
destiny q
as fast as you can how came espy to go so 
wrong i wonder 
jess here emitted some her guttural ound
which being translated amounted to this that
the jack had run down and ppy couldn't g
it et going again 
that's most ridiculous exclaimed jvt
mdow indignantly when i was at the pains
to show her myself how to manage her she's
the auchnagoil jack which i bought and ft
most famous goer but you see how it is mi
lucy you must make allowance for a bachelor's
house there's a roasted hare coming jessie
take away the fish and bring the hare to me
the hare was herewith introduced and flung
rather than placed before her master oh
this is quite intolerable there's really no bearing
this the hare's burnt to a perfect stick 
the whole rise is out its body 
your cook's not a good haredresser that's
all that can be said quoth mr dugald
very well said extremely good said mr
m'dow trying to laugh off his indignation
and after all i believe it's only a little 
destiny
ihrecl do me the fkyoar to lay a morsel 
it miss lucy with a little jelly jessy put
down the jelly oh have you nothing but a
ptgf to put it in demanded he in a most
wrathful accent as jess chipped down a large
native jellypot upon the table where's the
handsome cut crystal jellydish i bought at the
anchnagoil roup 
 jess's ace turned very red and a downcast
look conscious guilt told that the handsome
cut crystal jellydish was no more
this is really most provoking but if
you'll not taste the hare miss lucy will you dome
the kindness to try the pinched collops ora
morsel tripe it's a sweet simple dish 
a great favourite my mother's both you and
the captain are really poor eaters so you and
i mr dugald must just keep each other in
countenance
and another pause ensued till at last an
 scorched
f s england an animal in scotland a piece 
crockery
debtiinr 
order was given to take every thing away and
bring the few trifles but wui you niab less
noise there's no hearing ourselves speak for
you but jess rattled away nevertheless till
she vanished leaving the door wide open a
few minutes elapsed before she reappeared
with the greasy apparition espy at her back
standing on the threshold with her hands fui
now take the pigeonpie to mr dugald 
bring the pudding to me put the puffs and
cheesecakes at the sides and the cream in the
middle fm sorry fve no jellies and law

magis for miss lucy if you won't taste the
pie do me the favour to take a bit this odin
it's quite a simple pudding made brook a
recipe my mother's
lucy accepted a bit the simple pudding
which as its name implied was a sort mawkish
squash flavoured with peatreek whisky
 i'm afraid the pudding's not to your taste
miss lucy you're making no hand it will
you try a jam puff i'm sure you'll find them
good they come from glasgow sent by my
good mother i must really taste them if it
d destiny
ilrere only out respect to her oh miss
lucy will you not halve a puff with me 
the minister and his friend having now ate
and drank copiously all that was upon the
table captain malcolm said my daughter his
not yet accomplished the object her visit here
and we must soon be returning home so you
have no time to lose my dear to lucy who
skirted up from table like a bird from its cage
 if indeed it is not lost already he added as
lucy and he walked to the window the bright
blue sky had now changed to one misty whites
ness showers were seen drifting along over the
scattered isles and even while they spoke a
sudden gust wind and rain came sweeping
along and all the beauteous scenery was in an
instant blotted from the sight
captain malcolm was not a person to be disconcerted
by trifles but on the present occasion
he could not refrain from expressing his regret
as he every moment felt an increasing repugnance
to the company mr m'dow and his
friend and still more on lucy's account than
his own it seemed like contamination for so
destiny 
fair and pure a creature to be seated between
two such coarse barbarians mr m'dow affected
to sympathize in the disappointment but it
was evident he was exulting in the delay
shower after shower followed in such quick
succession that lucy found the object her visit
completely defeated at length the clouds rolled
away but the day was too far advanced to admit
 farther tarriance and besides both the father
and daughter were impatient to extricate themselves
from the overpowering hospitalities mr
mdow
 i hope you will have many opportunities 
taking drawings here said he with a significant
tenderness look and manner as he assisted
lucy to mount her pony and when the manse
is hurled and i get my new offices the view
will be much improved
lucy bowed as she hastily took the bridle
into her own hands and gladly turned her suck
on the manse and the minister
 dmtiinr
chapter xxi
the showers had passed away the raine
was smiling on the faded storm the fragpftmt
air was mild the herds and flocks were cropping
die dewy grass the declining son shot a slaiit
and mellow radiance and all things seemed
imbued with new life and beauty captain
malcolm and his daughter proceeded for som
time in silence each felt the beauty and the
harmony nature and as they slowly paced
side by side amongst the windings the green
hills they needed not words to utter the feelings
 their hearts captain malcolm was the first
to speak
you are unusually meditative lucy said
her father what is engaging your thoughts
so much 
i have been thinking papa said lucy
rousing herself from her reverie what a sweet
thing silence is
 that is to say you admire silence as la
buyers did solitude 
 oh certainly silence is sweeter when
shared with another who can understand its
beauty but after such a day such a coarse
unpleasant day as we have spent even solitary
silence would be sweet and grateful had mr
mdow given us some nice clean wellboiled
potatoes and milk and have allowed us to walk
about and enjoy the beautiful scenery how
much more pleasantly and profitably the day
would have been spent 
 mr mdow is indeed a coarse specimen 
a coarse propensity said captain malcolm
 and has fallen into a common error that 
seeking to raise himself by appearances as if
these could exalt the character especially a
minister the gospel one who is as poor
yet making many rich as having nothing and
yet possessing all things 
 one is always pleased with the humble are
 a cottage said lucy and i am sure most
 destiny
people would feel additional respect for the sims
jcity a clergyman's or indeed any one's
style living when proportioned to their
means
 certainly said captain malcolm poverty
in itself is never despicable or ridiculous
except to vulgar or thoughtless minds it is
only when it carries pretension along with it
that we feel privileged to laugh at so preposterous
a union we are also apt to be more
disgusted with a coarse gourmand than with a
refined epicure though there certainly is not
more moral or intellectual superiority evinced in
the love turtle and venison or evenfricandeau
and banquets than in cockyleeks and ducks
 oh how much i lament having lost this
day sighed lucy as she stopped her pony to
admire a lovely peep between the hills
 i fear your lost day is not to be understood
in the same sense as the emperor's was said
her father i suspect it is only your lost
sketches you lament
lucy smiled as she acknowledged the feet
 but surely papa she added you must
destiny 
allow it was rather harcl instead roaming
amongst rocks and glens and filling my porters
femme with sketches to be shut up all day with
mr m'dow indeed papa his company is
any thing but agreeable
 i am aware that my dear but as a clergyman
i wish to show him au the respect in
my power his sacred office i consider the
jlpo i which h b h
engaged and the most difficult when one considers
what various states mind a faithful
pastor must be called upon to minister to
 but you surely cannot call him a faithful
pastor papa i cannot possibly conceive anyone
consulting him about spiritual matters or
even asking him for a prayer i am sure i could
not
 i never heard you so severe upon any one
lucy when you have lived longer in the
world you will find there are worse characters
in the church than mr mdow though
happily there are also others whose genius
learning and piety shed a lustre over the age
in which they live mr m'dow is not an 
ixbstunr
mont man otherwise i would not have gone to
visit hint
 the most offensive part his character i
think said lucy next to his love eating
is his constant jocularity not that i should hke
a morose austere pastor who would look upon
all gaiety as sin but i should like to see one
as cowper says serious in a serious cause 
 i agree with you said her father that
when a clergyman views in its true light the
importance and the responsibility the office
he has undertaken an office which as an old
water says is a weight under which angels
shoulders might shrink his great object will be
to get men to think seriously not to laugh lightly
though wit being a natural talent like every
other it may be turned to good account
ah there is old sandy exclaimed lucy
as a sudden turn the road gave to view an old
greyhaired shepherd on the hillside basking
in the rays the evening sun with his 
and his dog how finely he is in keeping
with the landscape i wish we were nearer to
have a little conversation with him for i find
destiny 
tmth pleasure and improvement in conversing
with him he is simple and artless but not vulgar
for he knows his bible and that truly
maketh wise the simple 
he is indeed a very favourable specimen 
humble life said captain malcolm for i
have always found that where common education
is built on solid religious principles it never
fails to elevate the mind and give that contented
and independent spirit which is a nation's truest
strength and safety
 how perfectly he realizes grahame's picture
 a sabbath evening shepherd said lucy
still gazing on the picturesque figure her old
favourite 
behold the man 
the grandsire and the saint his silvery locks
beam in the parting raj before him lies
upon the smoothcropt sward the open 
his comfort stay and ever new delight
 and there is a setting sun said captain
malcolm as they emerged from the glen and
the blazing luminary burst upon their sight
 destiny
ft
 that would defy all painting for as wordsworth
says
 such beauty varying in the light
 living nature cannot be portrayed
by words nor by the pencil's silent skill 
but is the property him alone
who hath beheld it noted it with care
and in his mind recorded it with love 
oh papa do let us alight here for a few
minutes to feast our eyes with this lovely sunsets
cried lucy when they had gained the svaor
mit a hill which gave to view all the glories
 the scene the sun with all his retinue 
flaming clouds sinking to rest in the bosom 
the waters
captain malcolm loved to encourage in his
children a taste for the beauties nature a
pleasure so cheap so pure and so elevating and
he readily assented to his daughter's request
seating themselves on a grassy spot by the side
 a wild mountain brook they gazed with
eyes intent on the refulgent spectacle at
length lucy said how perfectly barton has
destiny 
realized such an evening as this with all its
accompanying feelings in that sweet poem 
his morning and evening every verse seems
to me a perfect picture in itself and a picture
too that excites such pure and holy thoughts 
and her soft blue eyes shone with an expression
 love and adoration as she contemplated
the glories the heavens and recalled the
beautiful imagery the poet
it is a comparison he draws between the
rising and the setting sun is it not said captain
malcolm my memory for these things
is not so good as it was lucy but i dare say
you can repeat it to me word for word and this
is just the time and place for hearing it lucy
in a sweetly modulated voice and simple manner
then recited the last stanzas bernard
barton's morning and evening 
 tis when day's parting light
dazzling no more the sight
its chastening glory to the eye is granting
that thoughts too deep for tears
unearthly hopes and fears
and voiceless feelings in the heart are panting
 destiny
 while that the western sky
delights the gazing eye
with thrilling beauty touching and endearing 
what still earth is fair
borrows its beauty there
though every borrowed charm is disappearing
 ere yet those charms grow dim
creation's vesper hymn
grateful and lovely is from earth ascending 
till with that song pndse
the hearts those who gaze
with solemn feelings delight are mending
 then from those portals bright
a farewell gleam light
breaks with unearthly glory on the vision 
and through the folding doors
the eye thought explores
seraphic forms and fantasies elysian
 these pass like thought away 
yet may their hallow'd sway
rest on the heart as dewdrops round adorning
the drooping silent flowers
feed them through nights dark hours
and keep them fresh and living till the morning
thus should the sunset hour
with soulabsorbing power
nurse by its glories the immortal spirit 
and plume its wings flight
to realms cloudless light
regions its god hath form'd it to inherit

destiny 
 fair bright and sweet is moan 
when daylight newly born
in all its beauty is to sense appealing 
yet eve to me is fraught
with more unearthly thought
and purer touches immortal feeling 
the shades evening began to gather around
but the gloom was still enlivened by streaks 
sunshine on the mountain tops the silence and
solitude that reigned and the stupendous objects
that surrounded them filled the hearts the
father and daughter with solemn thoughts and
as they journeyed slowly home they felt this
was indeed the time for unearthly thought
and immortal feeling

chapter xxii
little more was heard inch orran for some
weeks he had gone upon a voyage discovery
to two the isles where the principal part
 his property was situated and was actively
employed in detecting abuses redressing grievances
making surveys getting estimates quarrelling
with his neighbours discarding his factor
threatening his vassals and so forth and all in
the face the worst and stormiest weather that
ever was seen even on a western island at
the some weeks he returned to inch
orran and glenroy and he soon after met at a
county meeting the chief as well as everyone
present was immediately struck with the
change that had taken place in the old man's
appearance since his first arrival in the country 
destiny 
in fact he more resembled a livid skeleton thana
living man
i am glad to see you safely returned to us
inch orran said glenroy accosting him with
much cordiality i'm afraid you have had buta
fatiguing expedition 
 sir returned his kinsman i desire to be
excused from being either congratulated or interrogated

and with a slight wave his hand he turned
away
glenroy could scarcely keep from strangling
him for his insolence but he saw death in the
old man's face already and he refrained so
swallowing the indignity even although put in
open court he consoled his wounded pride by
anticipating the rich reward that soon awaited
his forbearance indeed to all human appearance
the time was not far distant when tee
possessor the longcoveted lands would be
called on to relinquish them it was evident he
was then labouring under severe indisposition
though when some one remarked to him that
he appeared to have caught cold he denied the
 bestir
fact with much asperity then as if to give
the lie to the offensive insinuation he mounted
his horse and rode home ten miles in a pour
 rain without greatcoat or umbrella the
following day he was still worse but nevertheless
being in one his invincible fits ill
humour and obstinacy he chose to stand out for
six hours in wind and rain seeing his potatoes
lifted carted and measured that he might take
his measures accordingly
the cold bad as it was might perhaps have
ended like other colds had it been treated in a
gentlemanly way but it was not inch orran's
mode to treat any thing gently or give place to
any the beggarly elements human nature
he had likewise an utter contempt for doctors
without having a wellgrounded faith in anything
else unless it were in that phantom called
nature which was the only thing simon excepted
that had any control over him to
nature then he in the first place committed
himself but the cold grew worse and worse in
the most natural way possible he then submitted
himself to simon who boldly undertook
destiny 
the cure but simon had only two recipes in
the world the one was ale saps the other was
atholl brose
in spite nature and simon and saps and
brose inch orran's case became desperate and
then a doctor was called but came in vain another
was summoned but with no better success
glenroy was most attentive but to no purpose
the patient grew gradually worse and worse
till at the a few weeks all solicitude was
vain for inch orran ceased to breathe
mrs malcolm behaved as well as could be
expected on this trying occasion she said it
was just to be expected for mr malcolm was
an old man and a very particular man and it
was no wonder he died for he never minded a
word she said and with mrs macauley to sit
by and assent to all her propositions and listen
to her complaints simon and concert with
her about her mourning and talk over the cereporridge
made with ale
f a composition honey and whisky
 destiny
menials the funeral mrs malcolm was soon
wonderfully well
it is a tormenting law which exists in scotland
 keeping the will the deceased a dead
secret until after the interment especially as
wills are things so capricious in their nature as
to defy die speculation the living and baffle all
their attempts at anticipation during that dread
internal how are the hearts lee nearest kin
 a childless miser or a wealthy old bachelor or a
saving elderly spinster agitated with lee emotions
 hope and fear doubts resolving themselves
into certainties and certainty fading away into
doubt as their omissions duty and commissions
 offence rise successively to view in the
present instance the only parties who seemed
privileged to entertain either hopes or fears
doubts or certainties were glenroy and captain
malcolm as the nearest relatives the deceased
and both standing much in the same degree 
propinquity but the latter waved his pretensions
in favour the chief who therefore took
upon himself the arrangement the funeral
and also bore the whole burden the fortnight's
destiny 
suspense which intervened between the death
and burial having seen the last remains 
inch orran safely deposited in the mily vault
glenroy returned to the mansion the departed
to unseal the repositories and cause them to render
up their secrets the search was soon ended
the first thing that presented itself was inch
orran's settlement or general disposition new
and neat formally drawn up and regularly
signed and attested in the most businesslike
manner possible but as the reading a settlement
is a tax too heavy to impose upon any save
those who are to profit by it it will be sufficient
to extract the kernel from the voluminous husk
in which for wise purposes the law has thought
proper to encase it but which it is not everyone's
jaws that can penetrate suffice it therefore
to say that the settlement set forth in the usual
strain for good causes and considerations giving
granting assigning and disponing all houses
lands heritages debts movables goods and
chattels writs and evident c c e to christopher
blanche isaac snipes and mark lippe

assignees the proceeds during the life the
said ronald malcolm until he shall have attained
the age twentysix years to be invested
in the three per cent consols there to accumulate
not a farthing the money was to
be touched under any pretence and the said
ronald malcolm was not to be alienated or
subsisted therefrom but to be considered as having
no right whatever in the premises until he
should have attained the aforesaid age failing
the said ronald malcolm his heirs c the
whole was to go to his father without restriction
 any kind a small jointure to mrs malcolm
five hundred pounds to each the trustees
a legacy a thousand pounds and an
annuity thirty to simon small for his faithful
services were the sole bequests contained in this
inconsistent and capricious disposition
glenroy was too much confounded at first to
be able to be in a passion it was only when he
had collected his senses that his energies were
roused and he was able to articulate with his
destiny 
face in a flame and his eyes flashing fire and
fury ronald malcolm oh certainly a very
proper person every i shem i wish you joy
sir to captain malcolm stamping his foot ashe
spoke your son is very welcome in a
voice thunder perfect welcome for me 
and with a muttered oath the chief took an
abrupt leave the party mourners and
tearing off his crape and weepers threw them
into the loch and returned home
 destiny
chapter xxii
although every body declared they lead
expected a most extraordinary settlement from
inch orran still this hi surpassed the anticipations
even the most experienced and afforded
an ample field fpr animadversion to all yet
perverse unjust and capricious wills are things
 such common occurrence the only surprise is
that people should still continue to be surprised
at them surprised however every one was
and none more so than the family at lochdhu
who were perhaps the only people the name
who had not dreamt either hardship or legacy
neither captain nor mrs malcolm were
people to be much elated with any portion 
mere worldly prosperity and this succession
 their son's was not such as to call forth any
very exuberant demonstrations joy it could
destiny 
be no immediate advantage to themselves or
their children for situated as they were with a
narrow income and a large family necessarily
enduring many privations a single year's rent
 the estate would have been more beneficial
to them now than the accumulated treasclfm
 a long minority might prove hereafter but
above all they dreaded the effect this seducing
prospect might have upon the mind their son
with wealth and consequence thus placed before
him as the goal at which he must ultimately
arrive without any exertions his own convinced
as they were that the moral part our
nature is best developed amidst struggles and
difficulties in the outset life they dreaded the
various temptations to ease and pleasure which
would beset his path yet in spite these
sobering reflections they hailed with gratitude
the prospect that was still afar off even though
it neither gilded the present nor cast any delusive
glare on the future
as for the young heir he felt much as any
other generous warmhearted boy would have
done upon such an occasion and many were the
 destiny
romantic schemes which passed through his mind
and burst from his lips in the first ardour youthful
emotion great was his disappointment at
finding he could not till the appointed time
dispossess himself a farthing his nominal
wealth and his heart revolted at the injustice
that had been committed against his parents
he loved his mother with that deep and earnest
love which a mother's virtues only can excite in
the hearts her children and contrasting the
poverty and privations she endured with the
comforts and luxuries he witnessed elsewhere he
was indignant at the barriers that were opposed
to the gratification his wishes
bent upon discovering some means by which
his future wealth might be turned to the immediate
benefit his family ronald's mind became
restless and dissatisfied and his thoughts occupied
with vain wishes and impracticable projects
wandered far from the daily occupations he was
wont to pursue with ardour and alacrity yet
his was the restlessness a noble mind aiming
at good which he could not realize
he was beginning as usual one day with
destiny 
oh how i wish when his father gently
stopped him
my dear ronald said he i was in hopes
your good sense would before now have suggested
to you what a dangerous habit you are
acquiring constantly wishing
dangerous papa repeated ronald how
can that possibly be 
i consider it very dangerous replied his
father mildly and so will you i am very
sure when you come to reflect upon it it is
positive waste time and thought and contentment
wishing has been called the hectic a
fool k it is not the proof a dissatisfied mind
which in your case i trust it is not it inevitably
leads to it for wishing is not very four
from murmuring it is not to inculcate an improvident
habit but a contented mind that weare
charged to take no thought tomorrow
but in my situation it is scarcely possible
to avoid wishing said ronald
 you surely do not mean to say it is scarcely
possible for you to avoid indulging in an idle
and foolish habit said his father mildly we
 destiny
have indeed little controul over circumstances 
these are regulated by a higher power but as
ibilional and reflecting beings we are accountable
for the exercise our faculties
but my wishes are not so much for myself
as for others said ronald reddening a little at
the reproof
i am aware that my boy for yours is
not the sordid spirit that would merely seek its
own gratification but nevertheless you can do
us no good by indulging those vain wishes 
yours perhaps eventually you could do us
none had you the power gratifying them as
it is very certain we know not the things that
are best for us and were our wishes granted it
might often be to our ruin one thing you maybe
assured your mother and i would rather
see you poor if possessed a grateful heart
and contented mind than master millions with
a restless and dissatisfied spirit i forget what
philosopher it is who says it is better to be
born with a cheerful temper than heir to ten
thousand ayear for my part i think its value
is incalculable when it springs from the right
destiny 
source mth and love such i am sure i have
found it in your mother you know but little
 the privations she suffered in marrying me
but never have i even heard her utter a wish
for any mere temporal benefit her wishes
ronald have been prayers and we flattered
ourselves we should by the blessing god be
enabled to make our children rich in contentment
if in nothing else you will not then
disappoint us ronald 
ronald could not answer but his feelings
were depicted on his open countenance as he
wring his father's hand in silent emotion from
henceforth he sought to stifle his murmurs amid
the sober realities practical duties kept in
wholesome exercise throughout the daily walks
 life
but ronald seemed destined only to feel the
disquiet riches without partaking their enjoyments
the news his succession had spread fie
and wide throughout the district but the particulars
were as all particulars are very variously
and imperfectly stated and course much error
and exaggeration prevailed particularly amongst
 destiny
the lower orders the more remote vassals and
tenants the consequence was the young her
was assailed from all quarters with petitions for
and remonstrances against this that and the
other evil while a hoard grievances that had
lain slumbering for many a year were now
brought to light and laid before him in the
sure and certain expectation being all speedily
redressed wives came from afar to speak for
the renewing their husbands leases and mothers
walked many a weary mile to get a word
 the young laird about the enlarging their
sons crofts and widows crossed many a rough
ferry and climbed many a long hill to petition
for a cow's grass or to claim favour in right 
their husbands or their fathers having lost an
arm or a leg serving under a captain angus
malcolm some tenth cousin the last laird
in the american war in vain did ronald protest
to these poor people that he possessed no
more power than they did themselves he was
heard with sorrowful incredulity or renewed
entreaties that if he could not help them himdestiny

self he woiild speak a word for them to those
who could but ronald had already found 
what stuff messrs blanche snipes and lippe
were made and that it was in vain to attempt
to seek favour at their hands faithful to the
trust confided in them that turning every thing
to money they had already commenced their operations
in the most systematic manner and were
deaf as adders to all appeals that came merely
recommended by mercy or liberality but it
was in vain ronald sought to convince the malcontents
it is at all times difficult to convince
the poor that those they deem rich and powerful
cannot relieve them if they choose but
with the lower class the highlanders it is
next to an impossibility to make them comprehend
how their superiors should not have the
power to redress every grievance and supply
every want as promptly as it is made known
many was the slow reluctant step ronald
saw at length turn away from him as if still lingering
in the expectation being recalled and
many was the groan and the sigh and the shake
 destiny 
 the head and the shrug the shoulder and
the discontented weelaweel he received
in answer to his protestations such was the
young heir's initiation to his inheritance
destiny 
chapter xxiv
but ronald's cares had they been weighed
in a balance would have been found light as
feathers compared to glenroy's wrath not
even the pains the gout which ensued could
drive the disappointment from his mind there
are people alas for those who know them 
who have never done with a subject especially
if it is a disagreeable nature they feed
upon disquiet themselves and force others to
partake the same sorry fare
such was glenroy's practice and upon this
occasion his colloquial powers had received an
impetus which seemed likely to keep them going
to the last it was a stillbeginning neverending
theme morning noon and night he
spoke the injury he had sustained as though
he lead been robbed and his son murdered till
 destiny
by dint hearing the same thing so constantly
repeated he at length talked himself and all
around him into the firm belief that he had been
cheated and circumvented in the most shameful
manner by the lochdhu family and as his head
was none the clearest or his reasoning powers
 the strongest the proofs for or against were
all mixed up in one solid mass invective
it is not the value the property that i
care about he would repeat at least ten times
aday to his allenduring friends benbowie and
mrs macauley as they sat by his gouty chair
the one with his tobaccobox the other with her
workbasket shapingscissors and spectacles
but i hate the dirty underhand way these
people have gone about the business i was
completely thrown off my guard by them but
i never knew one these canting dogs that
wasn't a complete hypocrite
on my conscience that's very true glenroy
said benbowie
i'm as sure as i am my own existence
continued the chief that there was a regular
laid down plan from the moment the old
destiny 
mans arrival in the country you may remem
ber he had hardly entered this house when that
ronald that young saint was at his heels sent
to play the spy and show off before him the
father knew better than to face the old dragon
himself and so he set his son to dodge him and
fawn upon him he had his lesson and knew
what he was about the day he came here i saw
through them even then
on my conscience i really believe so
said benbowie
 i have no doubt it was these incendiaries
that were at the bottom that insane proposal
the old scrivener made me about edith but i
would rather a thousand times have seen her in
her grave than the wife any beggarly tacksman's
son and to cut out her brother too 
well now is not that very curious said
mrs macauley are not these just the very
words that i heard mr reginald using the t'other
day edith says he i would rather see you
killed a thousand times than that you should have
disgraced yourself by marrying the tacksman's
son oh reginald said she you know that
 destiny
could not be for i am engaged to be married to
you and so i would not marry ronald even if
he were a king 
 you'll really make these children as great
fools as you are yourself cried glenroy impatiently
 how can you put such nonsense into
their heads 
me glenroy deed i never put any thing
into their heads i woidd be very sorry so far
from that when the boys said that you hated
ronald for he was a bad boy i said to them
well childer your papa may say what he pleases
and you ought to mind every thing he says when
it is good and fit to be remembered and when
he happens to say what is maybe not just so
right then you must be sure to forget it
i really don't believe there is such another
fool as yourself in existence cried glenroy
and i only wish you had this gout mine in
your tongue to silence it
well i'm sure i wish i had if it would
take it out your toe glenroy but wait till
you hear oh says norman i shall take
care never to forget that he cheated me out 
destiny 

an estate nor i says reginald that he
had the impudence to want to marry edith a
pretty husband indeed for edith a poor tacksman's
son chiltern says i i fear you read
your bible to little purpose or you would not
speak evil your neighbour or be so scornful
 any body for being more humbly born than
yourselves for we are such curious creatures
we cannot tell what may happen to us you
ought to remember how joseph that was sold
for a slave came to be a ruler over his proud
brethren and was not there king david the
greatest all the kings the earth what was
he but a poor shepherd boy but it pleased god
to make him a great king and if it please providence
to appoint that ronald should live to
become a great man who knows but he may be
married to miss edith 
providence appoint what is it you
mean mrs macauley do you know what it is
you are saying cried glenroy furiously
deed i do glenroy and i'm sure so do
you that it is providence that appoints our
lot 
 destiny
providence appoint lot do you
mean to make my children predestination 
cried glenroy passionately i thought you
had been merely a simpleton but i see you've
a most mischievous creature and i cannot suffer
you in my family if you sport such doctrines as
these
well glenroy if you think so i cannot
help it and poor mrs macauley's heart rose at
the thoughts having to choose between her
chief and her conscience
but i don't believe you know yourself what
it is you mean cried he somewhat mollified at
sight her distress
deed then but i know very well glenroy

then i say you are a very dangerous and
mischievous woman cried glenroy enraged
that she would not take advantage the loophole
he had opened for her escape
well maybe i am glenroy was the
humble reply but i'm very sure i do not
mean it
you are really not fit to associate with either
destiny 
men or children cried the chief striking his
crutch on the floor as he spoke
well may be not was said in a very
dejected tone but you may say what you
please me glenroy for there's no harm in
that but i do not like to hear you casting outwith
providence
who's casting out as you call it with providence
you old goose 
well i really thought you was affronted at
my saying that we did not get every thing our
own way in this hrprld but that providence
appoints our lot for us
 then i tell you again mrs macauley that
i will not suffer such doctrines in my mily 
i'm for none your predestinarian notions here
i suppose you'll have my servants cutting my
throat and saying it was appointed i i it's
really a most infamous doctrine
 oh glenroy that is not the christian
notion the thing at all if s only poor ignorant
heathen craaters or them who do not take pains
to read their bible who can misuse it that way 
for how can we think we are appointed to do
vol i l
 destiny
mischief to one another when does not he tellus
that we are to love our neighbour as ourselves 
deed if an angel were to tell me the contrary
 i would not believe it
you really you know nothing about the
matter and i desire i may hear no more such
doctrines there's no knowing where it would

 deed then i think it would just ha
our being contented minds and learning to
ynsk humbly dth god casting all our care upon
him who caret for u 
 oh you are setting up for a saint too but
i'm for no saints id this house remember
well you know if you wish me to go my
way i cannot help it it is my duty to go
here tears streamed down mrs macauley's
cheeks
yes yes you're ready to go and leave meat
the very time when you might be some
use you might at least have the discretion to
stay till i have got somebody to take your place 
but do as you please
oh glenroy how can you think it would
destiny 
please me to leave you and your children cried
poor mrs macauley quite overcome
 well stay where you are cried glenroy
somewhat softened only don't go and fill
the children's heads with these pernicious doctrines
 yours mrs macauley's face fell at
the conclusion this sentence
i must speak the truth to them glenroy
said she with a sigh whatever may come 
it and i think we are such curious craaters
and know so little that we cannot tell what may
happen to us it may be god's will to raise us
up or to cast us downe
are you at it again interrupted glenroy
furiously when i tell you mrs macauley i
will not suffer these doctrines in my family 
 well glenroy i am sorry it should be my
lot to displease you for i owe you a great deal
 kindness and i would lay down the hair 
my head for you and your childer but i cannot
eve up my principles
 who's meddling with your principles
demanded glenroy again softened at sight 
her distress
 resting
 well i thought it was not like you to doit
 you who have such good principles your
own
 it's my opinion said glenroy you know
nothing about principles i don't believe you
know what they are are they flesh and blood
or are they skin and bone 
oh glenroy i wonder to hear you who
have so much good sense speak that way when 
you know what respectable things principles are
and what poor craaters we would be without
them no glenroy when i die i will leave
those things behind me but i expect to carry
my principles along with me for no doubt they
will be use to me in the next world
that's very true said benbowie waking
out a doze on my conscience we should
keep all we can
i don't believe there's a man on earth but
myself that could put up with two such idiots
muttered glenroy
oh deed we have all our appointed trials
glenroy said mrs macauley looking in his
face with the most perfect goodnature and
destiny 
sympathy but we have all a great deal to be
thankful for too and myself most all for
 man proposes but god disposes and so he
has disposed you to be a good and kind friend
to me glenroy
you speak a great deal nonsense said
the chief whose wrath having had its full
swing now evaporated but i don't believe
you know what you say and i daresay you
mean well and there's the children calling you
and he graciously extended his hand which
received a kindly pressure from the placable mrs
macauley
o glenroy cried she while tears joy
twinkled in her eyes is it not a great blessing
that you have not cast out with me and that
from no power in me to hinder you well my
dears i'm coming as another call from the
children made her hasten to join them in a little
excursion
 destiny
chapter xxv
if it is difficult to impress truth upon the
minds children it must be owned there is
nothing so easy as to instil prejudice lie
effect produced by these and similar invectives
which the young glenroys were in the daily
habit hearing may therefore be easily imagined
the lochdhu family became gradually
associated in their minds with every thing that
was base and treacherous while ronald in particular
was the object a sort undefined ill
will to the two boys who had already learnt to
ape the chieftain's tone and adopt his sentiments
even the gentle timid loving edith was insensibly
borne along in the stream she was still
too young to comprehend the nature the case
or to conceive how pride prejudice and envy
may distort the fairest and simplest statement
destiny 
neither could so monstrous a supposition ever
enter into her young imagination as that her papa
could be in the wrong she could therefore
only grieve in silence that her once dear friends
should have been so wicked as to have told lies
and cheated and that ronald dear ronald 
who had given her a white owl and was training 
a starling for her should have been such a bad
boy as to rob norman and to want to have her
for his wife when he was only a poor tacksman's
son and she was the daughter the chief
such was the taint already communicated by
pride and prejudice to the young and simple
heart by nature rich in love aiiid sweet humanity

with all glenroy's violence and fascinating
he nevertheless did not proceed to open hostilities
with the lochdhu family when they met
which was but seldom he even felt his spirit so
rebuked beneath the mild and unassuming yet
open and fearless aspect captain malcolm
that his blustering subsided into a dead calm or
merely showed itself in a still haughtier deport
ment his kinsman was at no loss to guess that
 destiny
this accession dignity in his manner was occasioned
by anger and disappointment and he was
aware how unavailing argument or expostulation
would be against prejudice so unreasonable and
inveterate he also knew that offended pride
is only to be propitiated by the humiliation 
the object offence to attempt therefore to
conciliate the chief on the footing equality
he perceived would only exasperate him the
more and as there was nothing on his part which
called for concession he deemed it the wisest
plan to allow matters to take their course without
either seeking or avoiding an explanation
although captain and mrs malcolm were not
so utopian as to attempt to bring up their children
in utter ignorance the wickedness the
world in general still less eie they given to
point out particular living instances it as they
found quite enough on record to serve their
purpose without applying the scalpel to the
characters all their acquaintances glenroy's
behaviour therefore called forth no animadversions
from them in presence their family
they knew that reason and the improvement
destiny 
 the understanding nay religion itself are
often insufficient to destroy prejudices imbibed
in early life and that children cannot possibly
discriminate or comprehend the vast variety 
shades which are to be found in the same character
with them every thing and everybody
is either good or bad and course either
loved or hated with all the ardour unregulated
minds they were therefore unwilling to impress
their young hearts with feelings enmity
and aversion against one who with all his pride
vanity and littleness mind nevertheless possessed
claims upon their forbearance and goodwill

some childish disorder which showed itself in
the family soon afforded a plausible excuse for
the continued estrangement and captain malcolm
trusted that by the time that was over the
chieftain's disappointment would be somewhat
mollified and so it gradually was in some
degree although for want something better
or worse to say he had got into the habit 
regularly abusing the whole family at least five
times aday unless otherwise engaged
l
sadi vis the state msunmhen jmpbaa
makofan received a letter from cqiddn shirley
oacrii to take ronald on board his vn testy
the brilliant thai under orders for north amt
fie the commander and the toyi were
both unexceptionable hot captain and mia
maleofan who had never been tery demooa 
air son's entering on a seafiurii life a life
 such hardship and danger were now decidedly
averse to it when by the diane i ds
cnmstaaces a profession had beginner a very
secondary consideration but in tain iskej
endeavoured to combat this indicating ronald
had conceived that strange and unaccountable
predilection for the sea which like all extraordinary
propensities when once it has taken possession
 the mind is not to be expelled by
any thing short dearbought experience he
said indeed that he would give it up rather
than distress his father and mother but he said
it with sorrow and the disappointment hung so
heavily on his spirits that his parents thought
it wrong to oppose so decided a predilection
and the point was yielded they gave their
destiny 
consent not without hope that a single voyage
would do more to cure him his naval ardours
than all that could be urged against it preparations
were therefore immediately made for
his departure but he said before he went away
he must go to glenroy to give edith her starling
and to take leave them all they had
been very shy late he did not know what
was the matter but he would go and see them
and make it up whatever it was and full kind
feelings ronald set forth
at a little distance from the house he met the
two boys and edith at play upon the lawii and
his heart bounded at sight them he accosted
them with all his wonted gladness and frankness
 manner but the boys reddened and looked at
each other while edith cast down her eyes and
looked sorry if children are sometimes slow to
speak the truth they are commonly quick tp
show it in their behaviour the tongue seems
in childhood the only member which can yield a
ready assent to falsehood the kindling or downcast
eye the blushing cheek the constrained
air all speak the feelings thebeart and tis
 destiny
long ere the ingenuous mind is tutored to regulate
and control them
the young party met ronald's salutation with
cold averted looks unlike the familiarity their
usual manners
 you look as if you did not know me said
ronald with some surprise as his friendly greeting
met with no return although it is a long
while since we have met surely you cannot have
forgotten me 
g no ewe have nok forgot you said
master norman scornfully
 then why don't you speak to me and shake
hands with me 
no answer was returned
and why do none you come to lochdhu 
you need have no fears the measles now for
the little ones have been quite well for more
than a month and 
 it isn't for that said reginald haughtily
 but it's no use to ask any questions we
don't choose to answer them and thaf s enough
so goodmorning to you
 no cried ronald in some agitation
destiny 
i won't go till you have told me why you are
not mends with me jem sure i never did any
 you any ill 
you have though reiterated norman

passionately and papa says we are never to
speak 
 hush norman said edith putting her
hand on his ups and whispering softly you
know papa told us we were not to repeat anything
he said and i'm sure he would not be
angry if we were to bid ronald goodby
 i wish you would tell me what it is i have
done that has made you quarrel with me for
i'm sure i don't know said ronald in vain
trying to recall any offence he had committed
 we shall perhaps make you know some
day said norman
 the sooner the better said ronald boldly 
for i am going away
where are you going
 to sea 
and what have you got in your hand 
 it is edith's starling said ronald displaying
his captive
 destiny
curiosity got the better pride edith uttered
an exclamation pleasure and the boys
drew near with looks eager expectation
 can it speak ronald cried she jn a
flutter delight and quite forgetting her reserve
ronald answered by opening the little
cage he held in his hand when the bird flew out
and perched upon his wrist jabbering something
which he said was forget me not but
which rather puzzled the uninitiated and certainly
was not so plain as the can't get out 
sterne's sentimental starling
such as it was it was a novelty and oon
sequently hailed with eagerness by the young
group who one and all for the moment forgot
their animosity
give it to me make it come to me let me
have it cried all three at once eagerly extending
their hands to it
 you are frightening it cried ronald
raising his arm to save the starling from its assailants

well but i won't frighten it cried the
destiny 
two boys iain attempting to get hold it
give it to me give it to me 
no no i won't give it to either you it
is edith's bird and i will give it to nobody but
her
 if it is edith's bird why don't you give it
to her cried reginald
 well stand away both you said ronald
 for it is frightened it is rather wild yet
to strangers but see how it stays with edith 
now edith give it to me cried reginald
darting forward to seize it but ronald
hastily stretching out his arm to ward him off
the shock threw him back and his head striking
against the branch a tree he fell and the
blood sprung from his nostrils
edith screamed while norman sought to
stanch the blood with his handkerchief and
ronald flew away for some water which he
brought in his cap
 i am very sorry for this reginald said he
as he returned breathless with haste here is
some water drink a little it it will do you

bnt ronald pushed away his hand with in
dignatiot
 i'm sure i didn't intend to hurt you reginald
said he earnestly i was only trying to
save the starling from you
 you had no business to keep it from me
said reginald passionately you had given
it to edith and she had promised it to me and
you ought to have been very proud our touching
your bird or any thing belonging to you
 proud repeated ronald
yes very proud added norman but
we shall not demean ourselves any more so you
may take away your ugly stupid starling edith
is not to take it
 edith is not to be dictated to said ronald
warmly she is to do as she likes and i know
very well that she would like to have the starling
would you not edith 
edith i shall never speak to you if you take
his bird cried reginald so take your choice
edith with tears in her eyes looked imploringly
at her tyrants and then at the starling
you are not to take his bird i tell you
destiny 
edith cried norman in a passion it will
tell lies and cheat
what do you mean cried ronald kindling
 do you mean to say i tell lies and
cheat whoever says so is a liar and if either
 you were as strong as i am you durst not
say so but you know i won't fight with a less
boy than myself
k you hadn't given me this cowardly blow
said reginald i should have fought you on
the spot and so i will yet some day
i did not intend to strike you said ronald
 i told you i was sorry for it i didn't
come here to fight you i came to be friends
with you all and to shake hands with you before
i go away but if you are determined not to doit
i can't help it
the boys looked a little ashamed and walked
sullenly on while edith lingered and cast many
a loving look to her starling
i shall carry home the bird for you edith
said ronald and give it to you there and
mrs macauley will take care it for you at
least you will part friends with me won't you
 detint
and edith with downcast eyes uttered a
affirmative the party walked on in silence
till they reached the castle when ronald said
 here is your starling edith take it and let
us be friends before i go
edith looked with soft earnest eyes as if she
longed to be reconciled and her hand was extended
when reginald interposed
 you must choose then between him and
me said he passionately i shall never
speak to you if you are friends with him
if edith had followed the dictates her heart
she would most probably hare chosen the unvarying
kind generous protecting friendship
 ronald to the somewhat capricious and often
tyrannical preference reginald but too timid
and gentle to dare to have a will her own
she trembled at the thoughts even betraying
her goodwill towards him for fear the displeasure
it would draw down upon her thus
early is the fear man a snare for the young
heart
 i cannot take it ronald said she bursting
into tears and all three walked into the house
destiny 
and shut the door in ronald's face ronald felt
both anger and sorrow at such unkind behaviour
and deeply mortified at edith's joining against
um in a paroxysm disappointment he tossed
up the starling in the air there cried he
 you may go since edith won't have you no
one else shall and in bitterness heart he
retraced his way to his own kindly home
it may be supposed what a sight and a story
this was for glenroy his children all dabbled
over with blood the noble blood his nephew
shed by the plebeian hand the tacksman's son
his own blood boiled to think it dire
were the anathemas uttered against the perpetrator
 this outrage and though not naturally
a sanguinary man yet had the power former
days been in his own hands there is no saying
in what manner he might have thought proper
to avenge this indignity most likely in the
rob roy strain 
 and to his sword he would have said
do thou my sovereign will enact 
 
judge thou law and fact
 destiny
bnt after reginald's ace had been washed with
vinegar and his dress changed there appeared
no injury to redress the traces it did not
however pass so easily from glenroy's mind 
he was never weary detailing and denouncing
the exaggerated statement ronald's
enmities tiu his name became a byword and
reproach throughout the mily

chapter xxvi
but ronald was soon to be beyond the reach
 glenroy's contumely for the day and hour 
his departure had amyed the parting hour 
that hour which even in all its bitterness we
would yet fondly prolong and when past would
many times gladly oh how gladly recall 
there is something peculiarly affecting in the
first separation that takes place in a emily which
amidst many difficulties and privations has ever
preserved in its own bosom the elements 
happiness sweet domestic happiness those
precious elements which once scattered are so
seldom if ever united again 
 my home youth oh if indeed to part
with the ul loved one be a mournful thing
when we go forth in buoyancy heart
and bearing all the glories the spring
 destiny
for life to breathe on is it less to meet
when these are faded who shall call it sweet 
even though love's mingling tears may haply bring
balm as they fall too well their heavy showers
teach us how much is lost all that once was ourselves
 search as we will let us ransack east
and west earth and sea for their peculiar treasures
 it is not these even in their fullest attainment
that bring joy to the heart which can
only find its happiness in the exercise its beast
affections and which when it survives these
lives but to sigh over its withered hopes its
buried love alas if in the long and dreary
interval separation it were foreseen what
griefs were to be borne what ties were to be
severed what hearts were to be seared or broken 
who woman born could bear the sight and
live but tis in mercy these things are hidden
from our eyes 
no foreboding evil greater than the present
filled the hearts the sorrowing family who
were now assembled to part with him who was
felicia hemans
destiny 
the loved one all for his parents hearts were
strong in faith in that almighty power in
the shadow whose wings there is safety for
all who put their trust in him they knew
that it was not in ah arm flesh to save when
the decree had gone forth to smite for they had
seen as who has not the child a thousand
cares the hope some noble house the heir 
some mighty name the only the all the idolized
one whose pillow had been a mother's
heart whose safeguard a father's arms smitten
even when pressed to their hearts and torn
from their unavailing grasp by the stem hand
 death while the wet seaboy whose cradle
had been the waves who had been buffeted by
the stormy winds and tossed on the raging
billows with none to watch over him none to
care for him had been upheld and preserved by
him whose way is in the sea and whose
path is in the greatwaters and in whose
 hands are the issues life and death
it was this heavenly confidence which gave
fortitude to the other and resignation to the
 destiny
mother they blessed again and again the
object their love and their prayers and gazed
upon the treasured features dimmed as they
were by their parting tears years might pass
away before they should behold them again but
the remembrance them they felt would never
pass away till the last hours life
but different from the calm and holy sorrow
 the parents are the feelings the ypxmg
and imaginative upon these solemn occasions
amidst their grief there is still a spirit joy
within their and their heart beat high with
fond anticipations a world their ncy has
pictured so fair and which is fraught to them
with all with more than all the world ever gave
or has to give
and what though there be error and exaggeration
in their romantic dreams and what
though dangers and disappointments are sure to
quell their towering hopes youthful enthusiasm
 the delusion springs from a lofty source
from which all that is great in thought and
noble in action has its rise from those aspires

tons after a higher destiny than that mere
every day existence which seem inherent in
minds noble stamp and
 speak their high descent and glorious 
such were the feelings young ronald as the
pictured joys a sailor's life dwelt upon his
imagination and braced his heart to leave all
those beloved most dearly the stately ship 
the swelling sails the dashing waves the freshening
breeze the unknown lands the excitement
 the perils the renown over all these
his ardent spirit had cast a charm which he
longed to realize yet when the time came
still he lingered amidst the encircling arms and
the linked hands and the fond tones and the
tears and the kisses and mutual promises not to
forget but last and longest did he remain
locked in his mother's arms that mother so
loved so adored must he then leave her 
it was a mighty effort to break away from all
he had ever known and loved the tender
parents the happy playmates the dear familiar
faces and scenes which had stamped the

indignation a polite though peremptory refusal
was returned to his modest proposals
destiny 
chapter xxviii
lise seemed to be now holding its most even
tenor both at the castle and the farm for both
showed so little variety beyond the most common
casualties that for some time not a single
occurrence in either family would have served
to adorn a tale scarcely even to point a moral
the chie although his rancour was gradually
abating still preserved a stately distance towards
his kinsman and as their habits and pursuits
were quite opposite they seldom came in
contact with each other glenroy in spite q
the downfall his hopes still pursued his course
 revelry and reckless profusion while captain
malcolm dazzled by the glare future
wealth and consequence continued his former
simple frugal mode life his chief aim being
 destiny
to render bis children happy virtuous and independent

but the blank ronald had left in the domestic
circe remained a dreary chasm for many a dub
day and long night for ronald had been tike
beloved all and all missed him from the eldest
to the youngest the accounts that had hitherto
been received both and from him had been
highly satisfactory his captain and he were
mutually pleased with each other and the yoimg
sailor's naval ardour had suffered no divination
during the time the ship had remained at the
more after he had joined but soon after that
its destination had been changed and instead 
being dispatched as was originally intended on
a six weeks voyage to a healthy climate it had
been ordered to cruize in distant seas and in
another hemisphere this was a disappointment
to captain and mrs malcolm and an aggravation
to the anxiety they naturally experienced
on their boy's account an anxiety which even
under the influence pious trust could not hjl to
be felt by fond parents for a son such promise
their hearts were indeed occasionally cheered
destiny 
by letters from both ronald and his captain
when they happened to hail a ship in their progress
and the contents were always a gratifying
nature captain stanley was delighted
with ronald and ronald was delighted with the
sea and said he would not exchange his hammock
for all inch orran all he wanted was
to witness a battle and a storm and when he
had seen these he should be satisfied heaven
forbids wishes should be soon gratified said his
mother as she read the young enthusiast's letter
but it seemed as if heaven in its mysterious
decrees had otherwise ordained
many months passed after this without edtbet
letters or tidings and the anxiety the parents
became gradually more intense winter days
and stormy nights and summer suns rolled on
and still all was silence to the watchfulness
 expectation now succeeded the feverishness
 apprehension and then came that awful stillness
the oppressive weight time which we
have loaded with our own dread presentiments
when all nature seems to be wrapt in silence
and in gloom when every object appears to pro

daim the downil our hopes when the gayest
scenes only move ns to tears when the gladdest
tones only sound as the deathknell our happiness
oh many were the midnight prayers
breathed from a sleepless pillow wet with a mother's
tears and duly were the streaming eyes
and supplicating hands raised to heaven while
 thy will be done yet trembled on the lip
in vain the anguished parents strove to hide
from each other the dismal forebodings which
filled their souls the averted look the stifled
sigh the listless step the sudden start the vacant
yet searching eye all betrayed the secret 
those hearts which for the first time were closed
against each other at length the bolt fell and
by one stroke these hearts were laid bare the
ship had foundered and every soul on board had
perished a plank on which were a few letters
 her name and a shattered boat had been
picked up and all was told in the ocean depths
all had gone down and many a wave since then
had dashed over the trackless spot where lay the
young the brave the loved their tale a secret

till that day when the seas shall give up their
dead
oh were her tale sorrow know
twere something to the breaking heart
the pang doubt would then lee gone
and fancy's endless dreams depart
it may not be there is no ray
by which her doom we may expire 
we only know she sail'd away
and never was seen nor heard more 

ah who can tell the anguish a parent's
heart sorrowing for the loss their child he
only to whom all hearts are open and who
remembering we are clay forbids not those
fond and mournful recollections with which wt
invest the perished form the object our
love alas how does our startled fancy recoil
from the first dread thought and seek to cheat
itself by conjuring up and enthroning anew
that image in our hearts which our reason sternly
tells us is no more no more the being all
life and motion and strength and beauty
whom we have so lately held to our breasts 
whose voice even now sounds as sweetest music

 destiny

as in a whose vacant seat still stands
before us whose thousand mementos lie scattered
around us is that being indeed gone
from the bute this bright earth for ever 
still still would we seek the living among the
dead in vain does human sympathy seek to
pour its oil on the dark and troubled waters 
affliction tis a hand divine can alone stem
the torrent which overflows our soulrtis a voice
from heaven alone that can speak peace to our
stricken hearts when it tells us the dust we fio
loved on earth whether it be scattered o'er alia
trackless desert or be buried in the dark and
fathomless abysses the ocean he will again
build up in immortal beauty and restore to that
divine inheritance where there is no more sorrow

the affliction the bereaved family it
would have been no small comfort to them to
have been visited occasionally by a faithful and
spiritualminded pastor one who could have
soothed their downcast spirits and have strength 
ened their religious faith and have recalled to 
their startled minds those cheering promises
which in the first moments anguish are so
apt even by the best to be forgotten or but
faintly remembered but it was not in the house
 mourning that mr mdovs presence was 
wont to shine he called indeed but he saw
only captain malcolm sorrow is a sacred
thing not to be subjected to the common
eye and mrs malcolm and lucy felt as though
the presence mr mdow would only have
 destiny
profited the memory the departed and harrowed
up the feelings the living sorrow
had indeed sunk deep into the soul the benefit
mother ronald had been unconsciously the
idol her affections and in the anguish losing
him she felt that he had been the dearest to her
 all her children she bowed indeed with
meek submission to the will heaven but the
elasticity her mind seemed gone all was calm
and resigned but it was the calm deep suffer
ingi the resignation a silenced heart often
in the dead night there seemed to break upon
her startled ear the sound the raging sea and
the tempestuous winds and the cry the piercing
cry her drowning boy and then to wake to
silence and sad conviction that all was not a
dream but prayer would again bring down
its holy calm to tha troubled mind and the pious
mourner would meekly confess that it was good
for her to be thus brought even by the hand 
sorrow to the throne grace it was at this
time that a visit from the good mr stuart came
to cheer and invigorate her drooping spirit
he was a man whose whole appearance and
destiny 
deportment were so emblematic the sanctity
 his character that even a child would have
felt that there was a holy man he was a pale
thoughtful cast countenance but his thoughts
were evidently such as savoured more heavenly
things than lowborn cares for its expression
was at once elevated and benign he
bore his great commission in his look
and the sense that sacred trust gave a certain
dignified humility to the apostolic simplicity 
his demeanour
it is difficult to describe a piety so consistent
in all its parts and so unvarying in its practice
which sheds a living fiction over the whole
character whose influence is deeply felt in the
daily intercourse life but whose results do
not dazzle by any sudden or powerful impression
human life indeed is composed such an
unceasing succession minute occurrences and
humble duties and undignified occupations that
it would seem tedious and trivial to narrate the
course even a good man's one well spent day 
but as some one has well observed it is fidelity
 destiny
in the aggregate these little things that forms
the true solidity and greatness the christian
character even so it was with the venerable
pastor auchnagoil grandeur worldly grandeur
would have heard with a disdainful smile
the simple annals his obscure life but how
much moral grandeur was there in the selfimmolation
 his christian course a course at
once humble and sublime he was indeed a
 living sermon the truths he taught and to
inculcate these truths by precept and example
was the sole aim his consecrated office to
succour the distressed to minister to the sick ta
help the poor to comfort the mourner to cheer
the penitent to reclaim the wanderer for this
he laboured in the farextended district wudi
his parish contained for this he visited the dii
tant village and the lonely hut seeking out each
individual his widelyscattered flock for this
he braved the winter's flood and summer's heat
for this he crossed many a rough and tempestuous
ferry and climbed many a rugged and dreary
mountain and traversed many an unfrequented
glen
destiny 
 et would not grace one spark pride allow
or cry stand off i'm holier far than thou 
for he was no wild enthusiast nor narrowminded
sectarian nor hotheaded zealot but
he was a man plain artless and simple in deed
and word his highest gifts meekness temperance
patience faith and love and the highest
words wherein he taught them were words from
the god
but though mr stuart's character was thus fair
and consistent in the eyes others in his own
estimation how differently did he view it unworthy
and unprofitable servant that i am he
would exclaim to himself how mixed are all
my motives how selfish are my best intentions
 how polluted my purest affections how
deficient are my best works but thou hast told
the weary troubled soul to come unto thee and
thou wilt give it peace peace how different
and how superior to the outward satisfaction 
the vain selfsatisfied worldly mind 
such are the feelings the true christian
his warfare is within and in proportion as he
 detint
is enabled by the eye sith to discern the
holiness and purity god so shall he also
perceive the guilt and frailty his own imperfect
nature
he spoke and his words came like balm to
the wounded hearts the sorrowing parents
for they came fraught with cheering promises
and glorious hopes eternal life he hade
them turn their thoughts from the contemplation
 that on which at such a time our thoughts
alas are too prone to dwell even the material
part that immortal being once so precious in
our sight
he had known ronald and he knew the good
seed that had been sown in his young heart and
felt convinced that in the hour peril that
would not have failed him
i am far from saying that you ought not to
weep for him you have lost said the good pastor
while his own eyes were moistened with sorrow
such a state even if attainable would be fer
from desirable it would defeat the purpose for
which god hath been pleased to bestow upon us
i
destiny 
warm and kindly affections we know that
afflictions are sent not as punishments but as
messengers love to lead us unto him
i feel it is so said mrs malcolm meekly 
but still my rebellious heart she stopped
but struggling to overcome her emotion
added alas i often think had my boy but
died in my arms i could have yielded him up
with less reluctance to the will god i feel
as if i could then have said with greater sincerity
than i fear i do now the lord gave
and the lord hath taken away blessed be the
name the lord 
 that is a natural feeling said mr stuart 
 the horrors death always come aggravated
to our minds when accompanied as in this case
with any thing suddenness or mystery weare
then apt to imagine it more dreadful than
any reality forgetting that the lord is mightier
than the noise many waters yea than the
waves the sea true the silver cord is
loosened and the golden bowl is broken and
the dust has returned to the dust but the spirit
 destiny
t
has also returned to grot who gave it what
matters it then how we enter on the valley 
the shadow death when we know we are to
pass through it by the light those divine footsteps
which have trod it before us they still
remain and will remain till time shall be no
more to guide us to our heavenly home where
this corruptible shall put on incorruption and
this mortal shall be clothed with immortality 
where we shall enter on glory such as eye hath
not seen nor ear heard and which it hath not
entered into the heart man to conceive 
with such glorious prospects perfect and
endless felicity at the the christian course
said captain malcolm it indeed matters little
whether we enter upon them by lingering decay
or by a stroke the sword orthe shock 
a wave whichever it is we must believe that it
is the means our heavenly father deemed the
best and in that belief let us humbly acquiesce
 and in that simple act acquiescence we
shall feel a sure and certain rest for our souls
said mr stuart time it has been truly said
indeed obliterates sorrow from the worldly
destine 
heart and leaves it no better than it found it 
but religion beautifies and sanctifies affliction
in the heart the christian and causes it even
to bring forth new and more abundant graces 
the fountain bitter water may yet become the
well living water springing up to everlasting
life
 feeling and acknowledging as i do the
truth these things said mrs malcolm how
weak how sinful it seems to allow my soul to
be thus cast down i know the conditions on
which every blessing is bestowed that we must
one day part with it sand i believe that god
knows best when that parting should be and
yet she added while the tears flowed silently
down her cheek my son my son 
 do not judge yourself thus strictly said
the good pastor you do not mourn as those
who have no hope the spirit is willing to
believe all things though the flesh is weak to
endure them you believe that god gives in
love believe that he also takes in love and your
heart will not be troubled beyond measure for
 light is sown for the righteous and gladness
vol i n
 dxstimr
for the upright in heart f be good coumg
then for grot's promise is not made in vain i
 they who sow in tears shall reap in joy 
such though imperfectly detailed was the
tenor the dutiful minister's conversation with
the afflicted parents and he left them soothed
by his visit and cheered by the promise 
repeating it as often as his wanderings brought
him near their dwelling
perhaps the first pleasurable emotions an
outward kind to which the bereaved heart is
awakened are to be found in the deep and simple
enjoyment the beauties nature and
where to the reflective mind and cultivated taste
are not these beauties to be found even on
the barren mountain and the dreary moor on
the ever flowing waters and the everchanging
clouds
 no plot so narrow be but nature there
no waste so vacant but may well employ
each faculty sense and keep the heart
awake to love and beauty 
to those whose eyes and hearts have long been
closed whether by sickness or sorrow but are
destiny 
again opened to the soothing influence and gentle
harmony nature
 the meanest floweret the vale
the simplest note that swells the gale
the common earth the air the skies
are indeed to them as opening paradise and
insensibly they feel that they are happier than
they know

chapter xxx
while the mansion lochdhu was thus
darkened by the shadow death we may turn
to the habitation glenroy which was basking
in the full blaze prosperity ronald's mournful
fate however had not failed to excite its due
share sorrow and sympathy even the
chief's animosity had been greatly softened
and the two boys remembered with shame and
compunction their unkind treatment him at
their last meeting while edith shed many a
tear remorse and regret over the memory 
the loved companion her childhood she was
again permitted to renew her intimacy with the
family at inch orran and her affectionate heartfelt
as though its only reparation could be in devoting
herself to the consolation the mourners
years rolled on and the young people either
destiny 
gradually outgrew their childish faults or exchanged
them as is often the case for others
less obvious to common perception but so it
was the spoiled forward petulant boys were
now transformed into handsome spirited pleasing
youths the pride and delight the chieftain
 the admired and applauded all his friends
and followers not that norman possessed any
distinguishing traits excellence in himself for
he inherited much his father's character along
with his features he was proud overbearing
and selfish but he was handsome lighthearted
active and brave which with his figure and
fortune were requisites sufficient to ensure his
popularity as a future chief had it been
possible for him to have been eclipsed in his
father's eyes or house he certainly would have
been so by his cousin reginald who was a perfect
model manly beauty and seemed in his
person to have realized all that grecian sculpture
had imagined faultless form and feature
the materials his mind and character seemed
also a richer and nobler stamp than norman's
he had good feelings great sensibility an 
destiny
dent romantic imagination and a highspirited
scorn every thing mean and base and al
though he was at the same time headstrong selfwilled
and impetuous the slave impulse and
the sport passion yet as his impulse often
led him to what was good and his passion was a
mere gust these in early life showed scarcely as
defects but seemed merely the natural exuberance
 youthful blood and unchecked spirits
the seeds many good qualities had been
sown in him by nature but not much had been
done by education to bring them to maturity 
the tares had been suffered to grow up with the
wheat and both were now so completely blended
together that it would have required no common
skill and pains to have distinguished and
separated them the attempt however had
not been made and which should predominate
would depend upon the circumstances in which
he might be placed and the temptations to which
he might be exposed hitherto nothing had
occurred to call forth any the latent feelings
 the heart or proclaim the masterpassion 
the soul for his life had merely been that an
destiny 
indulged and pampered boy who had never
known a trial or had a wish ungratified so
bright and sunny an existence then could
scarcely ail to produce a pleasing influence on
e naturally good temper and high spirits ajb
the soil will be richest in gay flowers where the
harrow has never entered but
cc
not only by the warmth
and soothing sunshine delightful things
do minds grow up and flourish
alas who has ever beheld the endowments
 nature and the advantages fortune realize
in the happiness their possessor the splendid
visions they seemed destined to fulfil 
mr ellis had frequently urged on glenroy
lie propriety sending the young men to
finish their studies at an english university
but his remonstrances were always answered by
a quotation from dr johnson the only one the
chief had ever burdened his memory with that
 an english education could only tame a highland
chieftain into insignificance and
i 
 nestivy
air my son shall not be tamed into insignificance
i any your english universities
mr ellis was therefore obliged t give up the
point and having written on die subject to sir
angus he only waited to receive his instructions
as to the future plans to be adopted for the
completing ronald's education bdtore he
took leave his pupils and relinquished what
was now a mere nominal office that their
preceptor
glenroy liked his daughter as well as he could
like any thing incapable holding or transmitting
the chieftainship yet still she was rather an
insignificant person in his estimation he was
however pleased to hear on all hands that edith
was reckoned the prettiest girl in the county
and that reginald and she had already formed
an attachment to each other as that was at
once securing a good establishment for her and
saving himself all trouble as to her future disposal
although it has been said the love which
grows by degrees is more nearly allied to friendship
than to passion nevertheless the attachment
 the cousins seemed to form an exception
destiny 
to this general rule for their love had continued
to grow with their growth and strengthen with
their strength
as the attachment was sanctioned by both
sides the house the course their love conr
tray to that all other loves seemed destined
to run in a very smooth channel and it was
already settled that the marriage should take
place upon reginald's attaining the age twen
tyone no envious cloud therefore marred
the brightness their horizon they stood on
the threshold life and all life's fairest
prospects lay spread out before them
a too strict similarity character is perhaps
not favourable either to love or friendship and
the difference dispositions in the young lovers
seemed only such as would give greater charm to
their attachment reginald was all fire and impetuosity
while edith was all gentleness and
timidity with her father and brother she

chapter xxxi
one the many gifts mrs macauley had
received from nature was her feteulty dreaming
which she piqued herself upon in no small
degree and although it never had been productive
 any good either to herself or others
yet she nevertheless entertained the utmost
respect and veneration for this endowment and
placed the most perfect reliance on her own
oracles
glenroy course affected to treat her dreams
and visions as he did herself with great contempt
but secretly he had rather a relish for
them especially as mrs macauley was not a
public dreamer her dreams always related to
his house and family and there was therefore a
sort importance annexed to the idea having
his own peculiar dreamer in his household it
was a piece state almost equal to that keepdestiny

ing a dwarf or a fool or a henchman or a piper
or any other those prerogatives grandeur
the natural contempt however which is felt
in this enlightened age for old wives dreams and
even for young women's fables together with the
profound respect we entertain for the understanding
 our readers withholds us from relating
upon this occasion the cabalistic narrative with
which mrs macauley one morning regaled the
breakfast table suffice it to say it was all a
dream should or could be it was grand confused
dark incoherent contradictory senseless
and sublime and in spite the ludicrous tones
and gestures the narrator it produced more
or less an impression upon the minds her
audience from the cloud her misty imagination
various distinct images emerged there
was a large raven with a wedding ring in its
mouth there was a troubled sea and a dove
with a bleeding breast there was a shroud
two coffins and a grave and there was the minister
mr m'dow all dressed in white standing
in the kirk with miss edith who was all dressed
in black and somebody else with such a mist
 destiny
upon them she could not make out who it was
c c c
a few days after this memorable dream there
arrived accounts the death sir angus malcolm
he had died the fever the country
just as he was on the point embarking for
britain he had had sufficient warning his
danger however to admit his making arrangements
as to the management his affairs and
the disposal his on sir angus seemed to
have felt that reginald had been left too long to
glenroy's superintendence for he directed that
he should as soon as possible be entered at one
 the english universities under the superintendence
 mr ellis after spending two years
at college he was to set out on a tour to the
continent accompanied by mr ellis to remain
abroad until he came age he was then to
return home and celebrate the event among his
own people in a manner befitting the heir 
an ancient house and noble property a sanction
was given to his marriage with edith and a
hope expressed that he would then settle for life
in his own country
destiny 
 o what a mercer it is i had the good sense
to tell my dream before this came to pass p
whispered mrs macauley to benbowie for
if i had not told it nobody would have believed
me now oh what wonderful creatures we are 
the great black raven i cannot forget it little
did i think that was sir angus poor man and
the wedding ring that he had in his mouth too 
was just to show like that he was coming over to
marry his son to miss edith
on my conscience he was a very lucky
man to have cleared his estate before he died 
responded benbowie
reginald showed much warmth feeling on
the occasion his loss but from the length 
the separation that had taken place between the
father and son it was not to be expected that his
sorrow should be lasting and in due time he
was comforted
glenroy had now arrived at the period life
when any change in the domestic arrangement
is dreaded as the severest evils and the more
so as the gout had now become so frequent in
its attacks as to render him more than ever deem
dcsmrr
pendent on aim mir society it ny
be mtffpotedsa aoga injunction did not acetic
with his jnrimationii and he as nnnl tented his
diipknbiire in sqwstrophisii bmbovie
 finish his studies finish his fiddkstidbs 
 never finished my studies i never was al any
 their english universities i should be glad
to know what my scm cool learn at an english
university ronald may go if he chooses but
i'll be hanged if i'll allow nhman to accompany
him he dial not be tamed into insignificance
if i can help it it is a fine preparation
for a highland chief to be cocked up in me 
their musty colleges with a pack priests and
dominies and sailing about their plaintive ina
blade gown and a trencher skullcap 
 very true responded benbowie on my
conscience if s all very true a philabeg would
set him better
 a fine thing to be sure for a highland
chief to hare b a tacked to his name 
 on my conscience a man need not go so
fax to learn to cry b a said benbowie
 and then the scheme sending him to the
destiny 
continent is if possible still worse continued
glenroy what can he learn there but to
dance and speak gibberish or to be running
after old bridges and broken statues when he
ought to be building new bridges and entertaining
the gentlemen the county statues 
a pack rubbish i would not let one them
within my door
on my conscience i think you're quite
right glenroy i would not give a threeyearold
stot for any stucco babies that ever were
made
such was the style colloquy held by these
two worthy gentlemen and had reginald been
inclined to disregard his father's dying injunctions
plausible pretexts would not have been
wanting for him to have at least postponed the
fulfilling them but reginald was eager to
enter upon the course pointed out to him and
mr ellis lost no time in taking the necessary
steps for getting him entered at oxford whither
he was to accompany him nothing could induce
glenroy to part with norman and as norman
attached no great ideas pleasure to a
 destiny
student's life he was easily prevailed upon to
relinquish it and to remain at home his own
master so called though still more the master
 all around him
edith beheld with meek and silent sorrow the
time approach for the departure reginald
to be separated from him for more than a few
days was an evil she had never contemplated
and now weeks and months were to drag their
slow course along while reginald and she were
to dwell apart oh what a solitude would hers
be the dreariest the saddest all solitudes the
solitude the heart
reginald's sorrow at parting with edith it
might be supposed was pretty much swallowed
up in the anticipated novelty and variety that
awaited him and he strove to comfort and er
assure her as he talked cheerfully the shortness
 the time his probation three years
were nothing besides he should certainly make
a point seeing her often again before he left
england and at any rate he should write to her
constantly every day that she might never fora
single day forget him he would then rites

rate his own vows eternal love and constancy
and call upon edith to repeat the same while
each favourite haunt was visited and hallowed in
their imaginations by the pensive thought that
it would be long ere they should again revisit
them together thus the intervening days glided
away with the rapidity a stream and thus
feeling stamped the value ages upon the
duration moments then swiftly came the
parting hour 

that hour
when love first feels its own overwhelming power
this edith is a ring betrothment said
reginald as he placed one upon her finger
remember there it must remain till i exchange
it for a bridal one edith do you promise
and he held her hand locked in his while edith
tried to smile an affirmative through her parting
tears
again and again the farewell was spoken
sain and again edith was pressed to his heart
and now he was gone and she was left alone
 destiny
chapter xxxii
by degrees the loss reginald's society was
almost atoned for to edith by the new enjoyment
 corresponding with him it was a different
a more abstracted and concentrated feeling
but scarcely a less delightful one than that
which she used to enjoy in his presence true
he was no longer with her but then what
though the image itself was gone the impression
remained almost as vivid as the reality and
she had his ring his picture his letters those
mute but eloquent pledges his faith the
almost daily assurances his love the oftrepeated
vows the fond anticipations their
future happiness deep and earnest in her love
but timid and reserved in her manners her
heart expatiated more freely upon paper than
destiny 
ever it had done in the daily intercourse her
whole life so that she was ready to exclaim 
o fortune
 thou canst not divide
our bodies so but that our hearts are tied 
and we can love by letters still and gifts
and thoughts and dreams
thus was her mind kept in a state constant
excitement more inimical to its repose than
the presence even the object her affection
imagination left to itself had awakened in her
that extreme sensibility so destructive to happiness
which in seeming to give us a sweet
existence in another's being is only fixing more
firmly its barbed arrow in the heart
so passed days weeks and months and when
the college vacations permitted reginald revisited
with delight his early home absence sofar
from abating the attachment the youthful
lovers seemed if possible to have augmented it
and the lapse time had only added new attractions
to each in the eyes the other
but now a longer period absence was to
intervene and seas were to divide them the
 destiny
time for reginald's visit to the continent had
arrived and painful was the parting the lovers
yet the sanguine spirit reginald imparted
comfort to edith as he fondly reminded her that
two out the three years their probation were
over and that this parting should be the last
many was the fond and impassioned letter
she received from reginald and many were the
tender and confiding ones she wrote in reply
at length his letters became less frequent but
that was not surprising considering that he was
constantly moving from one place to another and
then when they did come they were as affectionate
as ever he still reminded edith their
engagement she still assured her that time and
absence only rendered her dearer to him and
that he longed impatiently for the time when he
was to return to her to part no more but after
receiving one those letters breathing all that a
fond lover could say to the idol his heai't a long
pause ensued and then when the next came
edith thought but it must be fancy that the
style was changed it was short too but he
pleaded a headach perhaps he was ill and condestiny

ceased it from her and many an anxious day and
sleepless night she passed till another arrived it
was still shorter but he was just setting out upon
an excursion and had not time to write more thana
mere line to assure dear edith he was well
other long and dreary chasms ensued and were
but faintly attempted to be filled up by meagre
letters full little else than apologies for their
rarity and promises writing oftener and longer
ones but the same excuses continued one
time the heat was so excessive he could scarcely
hold the pen then he was interrupted by a
friend or he was just returned from a fatiguing
excursion or he was setting out upon a pleasure
tour or the time was now drawing near when
he should be returning to scotland and therefore
it was unnecessary to say much more at present
so absorbed was edith in anxiety about reginald
that she was quite unconscious the attentions
or rather intentions another lover in
the person the young lord alloy who from
partaking occasionally glenroy's hospitalities
had now become a more frequent visitor and
having no small opinion himself he concluded
he had only to pay his addresses to have them
 destiny
instantly accepted edith's ideas love were
much too romantic to enable her to construe the
flimsy gallantry a modem fine gentleman into
any thing like a serious passion and her surprise
at his lordship's hasty and selfassured proposals
could only be surpassed by his amazement at the
rejection his suit it was one that in other
circumstances glenroy would have been gratified
with but as edith was engaged to reginald
he could only have the satisfaction chuckling
over it in private or throwing out innuendoes in
public
thus wore away time but still reginald came
not and his birthday the day his coming 
age which his father had recommended him to
celebrate at home among his own people that
day which he himself had so fondly anticipated
and which edith had looked forward to with no
common interest that day passed unnoticed
unheeded on his part and on hers only recorded
as a day disappointment and gloom
glenroy chafed and fumed at this disrespectful
delay norman still more sanguine and impatient
in the selfassumed anticipations his
cousin's return had scarcely been restrained more
destiny 
than once from setting out to meet him mrs
macauley dreamed and wondered in vain neither
dreams nor wondering could solve the
mystery edith sighed and feared she knew
not what for her heart was too simple and guileless
to harbour suspicion she had heard and
read such a thing as inconstancy but to associate
it with the idea reginald never entered
her imagination or if it did it was instantly dismissed
she had only to recall the remembrance
 past days to look at his picture sto meet the
gaze those fond eyes sto read his letters fraught
with vows everlasting love and all her doubts
fled as by the touch a talisman thus imagination
still held sway over her while time as it
moved slowly along
deposited upon the silent shore
 memory images and precious thoughts
which it was the delight her solitary hours to
treasure up in the inmost recesses her heart
she knew not who in early life does know 
that such treasuring up the frail records human
love prove but as landmarks to note where
the tide passion and sorrow hath been

chapter xxxiii
years had passed away since ronald malcolm
had left his native home when one bight
summer's day a tall and smibumt youth coarsely
and scantily clad but with something wild
and noble in his air and aspect stood on the
shores lochdhu and for a moment surveyed
its dark mountains and roaring waters with the
look one to whom they bore no onion
interest
that youth was ronald and many a sad sight
his young eyes had looked upon since last he left
the spot where he now stood and many a
strange and moving accident burned within him
to relate to the dear ones he had left he had
to tell the wonders the raging sea and the
angry heavens which had shivered the stately
ship and sink so many high hearts and brave
destiny 
beneath the devouring billows he had to tell
 his own escape with others the gallant crew
and the hunger the thirst the cold the heat
the hardships and privations they had endured
and under which many those brave spirits had
sunk he had to tell the survivors reaching
the coast africa only to become captives to
the wild and lawless natives by whom they were
driven as slaves to the interior those wild desert
and unexplored regions where his companions
one by one fell victims to the severity their
lot but his youth and dauntless spirit his habits
 endurance and activity the flexibility and
sweetness his temper had under the blessing
 a superintending providence enabled him to
bear the heavy load assigned him and had even
gained him favour in the eyes his barbarous
captors how many a summer's day and winter's
night would it take to tell all that he had seen
and thought and felt and suffered and done
during his dreary captivity and how even in the
depths his desolation he had ever cherished
that trust divine which a mother's lips had early
breathed into his infant soul then came his
 destiny
escape with all its dangers and privations his
wanderings by land his perils by sea all these
and much more had ronald to tell but all was
forgotten in the tumult his feelings as he stood
once more on his native shore and looked on his
father's house and recalled the dear familiar
scenes his childhood
memory flew over the intervening years and
 faded from his mind save the loved ones
whose looks and tones had sometimes haunted
his very heart to agony as fancy pictured the
joys home to the eutdistant captive and
now in a few minutes he should behold them
again already he seemed to feel their kisses on
his lip their tears gladness on his cheek 
their arms enfolding him once more he was
pressed to a mother's beating heart all these
thoughts rushed through the yoimg adventurer's
mind as he gazed for a moment on the wellremembered
features his mountain home
these were unchanged for their stern and
massive outline was unchangeable but some 
thing a still wilder a more desolate and
mournful cast seemed to dwell upon them for
destiny 
all was silent and voiceless ronald stayed not
to conjecture or to fear but in an instant he was
at the house this father's house he had crossed
the threshold his oncehappy home but still
there was none to meet him none to welcome
him every thing was displaced and in disorder
and he sought in several the rooms before
he discovered an old purblind woman who
seemed the sole inhabitant the house he had
left so full life and joy and youth and
beauty
in this ancient crone he recognized an old
pensioner his mover's rare zed for her
fidelity and attachment to the family than for
the sweetness her temper or the urbanity 
her manners in a voice choking with agitation
he enquired for captain malcolm for the
emily but he had to repeat the question three
times before he could obtain an answer for
though not positively deaf her ear was slow to
catch a strange accent and ronald's voice and
accent were both so totally changed that his
own mother could scarcely have recognized
 destiny
them at length in a sharp highland tone
he received the satisfactory reply 
 captain malcolm aye what should hebe
bat in his ain hoofs
 butt this was his honse said ronald verifying
at this information scanty as it was
 aye and wha says it's no us hoofs noo 
but it's no his dwebinghooss if youmean that 
he's ower great a man to dwell here nootaye
that he is
the truth now flashed upon ronald and
with a pang he said what t he bow lives at
inch qrran i suppose 
to be sure what else should he live 
but sit down sit down you maun be stranger
here it seems frae the low country maybe
a friend o the family 
 thank you but first tell me is csqfxtailn
malcolm well and my j and all them
are they all well and ronald's lips quivered
as he put the question
 oo surely surely they're all well what
should ail them 
nothing nothing and my rodestiny

bald's heart fluttered as lie thought his mother 
and he could not find voice to name the name
dearest to his heart
the old woman went on no no there's
nodding aib them noo ey've gotten aw thing
they can want och aye god be praised they
are very prosperous noo an very happy
 they have met with some good fortune
then it seems said ronald trying to apeak
with composure
 och aye i meed an they have done thirty
and well they deserve it not but what they
paid for it too poor craaters aye that they
did god knows their fine fortune cost them
side hearts at the time but that's pastn
noo what should they be but pleased an happy 
ronald's heart heaved and he was silent a few
moments then said but they have been
afflictedthey have suffered 
 odin need they were thatthey were pore
distrest poor people at the drooping o their boy
 fine boys a pretty boy he was och aye 
here old nanny groaned and wiped her eyes
with the corner her apron
 destiny
 but you say they are happy now they
have forgotten him said ronald with emotion
oh surely surely god be thanked he's
forgotten noo an if s time deed is it och
hye and we little know what's for our good
in this world for it was god's merciful providence
after all that the boy was ta'en or they
tell me they would have been but a puir needful
family the daydeed would they 
a strange pang shot through ronald's heart
 what a vile unfeeling creature thought he
 to talk in such a manner and he was about
to leave the house when old nanny resumed 
och aye providence was really kind in
that particular for the drooping o the boy poor
thing that ever i should say't has been the
savin o that whole family deed has it and
weel they deserve it for they're a worthy wellcoin
family and inch orran himself is a goodman
and does a deal o good that he does and
he is a real blessing to the country that he is 
but he might have been a blessing to the
country although his son had not been drown
ed said ronald
destiny 
no no they tell me not that if the boyhad
lived he would have keepit his other poor
man a his days and wou'dna that have been a
sin and a shame no that it wad hae been the
poor boy's fault poor thing but the fault o them
that would have made him keep his father's head
below the water och it was god's providence
to tak the boy out his worthy father's way 
and noo a thing's as it should be and he has
gotten his ain honest man and long long may
he enjoy it 
and you say they are all quite well and
happy said ronald his heart swelling in
spite the contempt he tried to feel for the
unfeeling narrator
aye aye they are that happy they are
and happy may they be and should they be
happy when there's gain to be a grand marriage
amang them miss lucy thaf s her thaf s the
eldest o the family ista she gain to get a
husband and a braw one too no less than the
young laird dunross no but what miss

they tell me forbye this hoofs that they 
coming to dwell in and him painting it all from
top to bottom and making every thing so genteel
for them and all comes o the droeoin o
the bonny laddie och aye 
many little circumstances that had taken place
before he left home here darted into ronald's
mind in confirmation old nanny's words
young dunross and lucy had been lovers even
then and want fortune on her part had been
the cmly obstacle to their union and now that
destiny 
removed and he bad returned only to blast
their happiness 
 but what if he has not been drowned what
if he should yet return said he with agitation

 oeh sorrow bit he'll ever return noon poor
bairn and it would na for him to come back
in the body noo deed an he wad be but a
black sight rnoy no that it would not he's been
owre laing dead to some back noo deed has
he och aye he's dead and gone an it would
na do to bring mm back againao no wae
i was when i heard o the poor thing's drooping
but i was ignorant then i did not know bat
it was god's providence to set up the amuy
like by that sam means and make them all
so comfortable and genteel andhajy oh
aye 
 and my mother said ronald windy ashe
covered his eyes with his hand while his
whole frame thrilled with emotion
 the mother f said nanny oatohiof the
sound imperfectly aye his motbertbat'f
the leyherse fott'u mean look god only
 destiny
knows the mother's sorrow och aye but shea
quiet craater and she knew whose hand it was
that was upon her aye that she did and so she
demeaned herself like a good christian as she
is but they tell me she has never had her ain
dolour since
tears forced their way through ronald's fingers
he started up and was hurrying away
when nanny interposed rather unwilling to part
so soon with a visitor from whom she had as yet
extracted no information in return and visitors
to nanny were few and far between
and what's taking you away my lad in
such a hurry canna you sit toon a wee and
rest you and tak a drap this warm day 
the day is fer spent and i have a long
iralk before me said ronald
aye maybe ye'll be going to inch orran 
i'm taking you'll be a friend o our yotmg
laird's that's mr angus for i guess by your
tongue you're a gentle
 is he at home asked ronald waving the
question and the compliment
 i'm thinking so that he's at home the noo 
destine 
but he goes away for months and months at a
time to one o their places in the low country
where young gentlemen go to learn every thing
they're no schools they're universals or
something like that you'll ken what i mean 
for he's very bookish and they tell me he will
be a great man yet since his father can give
him such a grand education but he's no such a
fine roving spirit craater as the tother poor
boy was what a craater that was nothing
feared him and he was so goodnatured and so
kind to every body och aye he would have
run a mile to flit a sow as they say but no
doubt he has got his reward noo though we
cannot see it for if he can but see what a great
blessing his death has been to his faamuy i'm
sure he'll no begrudge it wherever he be
surely his family would be happier to have
him back again said ronald after a pause
troth then and to tell the truth i'm no
sure o that no but what they were very fond
 him and thought much him when they had
him but now you know like good christians
their minds are made up to want him and maybe
 mbsmnr
they could na want other things o well
room and from the spot he could plainly discern
all that was passing within butt wasscmnetime
ere he could dispel the gathering mists from his
eyes so as to enable him to single out each dear
one numbered in his heart ah 
 there are no looks like those which dwell
on long remembered things 
his eye was first attracted to his whither who sat
nearest to him reading but his back was towards
him and he could only perceive that his figure
was thinner and his hair greyer than when he
had parted from him at one the room
lucy was seated at a piano but it seemed as if
merely an excuse for the lovers to be a little
apart for young dunross leant on the back 
her chair and her sweet face was turned to him
in conversation while now and then she carelessly
touched a few notes the instrument
a teatable was in the middle the room at
which a lovely girl whom ronald recognized as
his sister flora was presiding with the younger
destiny 
part the family who were gaily chatting and
laughing together
over all these ronald's eyes wandered in
search his mother till they riveted themselves
upon that cherished image she sat apart at a
window which looked out upon the lake and the
setting sun her pale brow and still lovely profile
pencilled against the deep flush the evening
sky her air betokened the careless stillness
 a thinking mind one hand hung listlessly
on the shoulder a little boy her youngest
born the image her longlost ronald
who with head curling gold stood by her
side feeding with bits bread ronald's fondlycherished
dog
o how pensive was the look with which she
gazed on the still water and the silent beauty 
the skies it might be that her thoughts were
then sad but holy import that they were 
him who had found a grave in the deep sea a
home in the mansions those glorious heavens 
 him whose place at hearth and board still to
the mother's eye stood vacant scarcely could
ronald restrain himself as his heart heaved

 dstikt
almost to iny and the large tear drops pushed
from his eyes and he thought what rapture it
would be to fell on his mother's neck and weep 
 nooh no she has not forgotten me i
am sure she has not even now perhaps she is
thinking me and in a second he would hare
been in her arms but at that moment his
mother turned towards her little boy a bright
sweet smile lighted up her face at something he
iliad said and she looked and spoke fondly to
him as she parted the air curls from his sunny
brow
presently the young party teadrinkers
started up and flew towards her as if with some
petition they spoke with eager childish gesticulation
they hung upon her with looks 
loving entreaty and one lite feir girl climbing
upon the back her chair laughingly threw
her arms round her neck and kissed her lucy
recalled from her aberrations struck up a lively
air the teatable was pushed aside and all were
in motion for a dance
yes yes they are happy and i am forgotten
 exclaimed ronald in a burst pasdestiny
senate emotion as he rushed from his hiding 
place and fled far from inch orran and all he
loved

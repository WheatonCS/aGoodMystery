a very quiet one no one being present save the
father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral
lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the
younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia
whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been
prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a
woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to
force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging
that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a
painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house
before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast
with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some
comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that
she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an
ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the
footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress
believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his
daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with
the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with
the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which
will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing
had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there
are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the
police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some
other motive she may have been concerned in the strange
disappearance of the bride

and is that all

only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is
a suggestive one

and it is 

that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance
has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a
danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom
for some years there are no further particulars and the whole
case is in your hands now so far as it has been set forth in the
public press

and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would
not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell
watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i
have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not
dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness
if only as a check to my own memory

lord robert st simon announced our page-boy throwing open
the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face
high-nosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about
the mouth and with the steady well-opened eye of a man whose
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his
manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue
impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off
his very curly-brimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin
upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of
foppishness with high collar black frock-coat white waistcoat
yellow gloves patent-leather shoes and light-coloured gaiters
he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to
right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
golden eyeglasses

good-day lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray
take the basket-chair this is my friend and colleague dr
watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this
matter over

a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine
mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you
have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir
though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of
society

no i am descending

i beg pardon

my last client of the sort was a king

oh really i had no idea and which king

the king of scandinavia

what had he lost his wife

you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to
you in yours

of course very right very right i'm sure i beg pardon as to
my own case i am ready to give you any information which may
assist you in forming an opinion

thank you i have already learned all that is in the public
prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correct this
article for example as to the disappearance of the bride

lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it
goes

but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most
directly by questioning you

pray do so

when did you first meet miss hatty doran

in san francisco a year ago

you were travelling in the states

yes

did you become engaged then

no

but you were on a friendly footing

i was amused by her society and she could see that i was
amused

her father is very rich

he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope

and how did he make his money

in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold
invested it and came up by leaps and bounds

now what is your own impression as to the young lady's your
wife's character

the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was
twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she
ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than
from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy
with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of
traditions she is impetuous volcanic i was about to say she
is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the
name which i have the honour to bear he gave a little stately
cough had not i thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i
believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her

have you her photograph

i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the
full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an
ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect
of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the
exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he
closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon

the young lady came to london then and you renewed your
acquaintance

yes her father brought her over for this last london season i
met her several times became engaged to her and have now
married her

she brought i understand a considerable dowry

a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family

and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a
fait accompli

i really have made no inquiries on the subject

very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the
wedding

yes

was she in good spirits

never better she kept talking of what we should do in our
future lives

indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the
wedding

she was as bright as possible at least until after the
ceremony

and did you observe any change in her then

well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had
ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident
however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
bearing upon the case

pray let us have it for all that

oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards
the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it
fell over into the pew there was a moment's delay but the
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not
appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of
the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our
way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause

indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of
the general public were present then

oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is
open

this gentleman was not one of your wife's friends

no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a
common-looking person i hardly noticed his appearance but
really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point

lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less
cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do
on re-entering her father's house

i saw her in conversation with her maid

and who is her maid

alice is her name she is an american and came from california
with her

a confidential servant

a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed
her to take great liberties still of course in america they
look upon these things in a different way

how long did she speak to this alice

oh a few minutes i had something else to think of

you did not overhear what they said

lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was
accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she
meant

american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your
wife do when she finished speaking to her maid

she walked into the breakfast-room

on your arm

no alone she was very independent in little matters like that
then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose
hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she
never came back

but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to
her room covered her bride's dress with a long ulster put on a
bonnet and went out

quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in
company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who
had already made a disturbance at mr doran's house that
morning

ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady
and your relations to her

lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows
we have been on a friendly footing for some years i may say on
a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have
not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of
complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes
flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hot-headed and
devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she
heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the
reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i
feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to
mr doran's door just after we returned and she endeavoured to
push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my
wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the
possibility of something of the sort and i had two police
fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again
she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
row

did your wife hear all this

no thank goodness she did not

and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards

yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as
so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid
some terrible trap for her

well it is a possible supposition

you think so too

i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon
this as likely

i do not think flora would hurt a fly

still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray
what is your own theory as to what took place

well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i
have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may
say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a
social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous
disturbance in my wife

in short that she had become suddenly deranged

well really when i consider that she has turned her back i
will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to
without success i can hardly explain it in any other fashion

well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said
holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have
nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the
breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window

we could see the other side of the road and the park

quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer
i shall communicate with you

should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our
client rising

i have solved it

eh what was that

i say that i have solved it

where then is my wife

that is a detail which i shall speedily supply

lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take
wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a
stately old-fashioned manner he departed

it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting
it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i
think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
this cross-questioning i had formed my conclusions as to the
case before our client came into the room

my dear holmes

i have notes of several similar cases though none as i
remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination
served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial
evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a
trout in the milk to quote thoreau's example

but i have heard all that you have heard

without however the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some
years back and something on very much the same lines at munich
the year after the franco-prussian war it is one of these
cases but hullo here is lestrade good-afternoon lestrade
you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are
cigars in the box

the official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat
which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a
black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated
himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him

what's up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you
look dissatisfied

and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage
case i can make neither head nor tail of the business

really you surprise me

who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip
through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day

and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his
hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket

yes i have been dragging the serpentine

in heaven's name what for

in search of the body of lady st simon

sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily

have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he
asked

why what do you mean

because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
the one as in the other

lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you
know all about it he snarled

well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up

oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in
the matter

i think it very unlikely

then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the
floor a wedding-dress of watered silk a pair of white satin
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked
in water there said he putting a new wedding-ring upon the
top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master
holmes

oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air
you dragged them from the serpentine

no they were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper
they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me
that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off

by the same brilliant reasoning every man's body is to be found
in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope
to arrive at through this

at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance

i am afraid that you will find it difficult

are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i
am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your
deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as
many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar

and how

in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a card-case in the
card-case is a note and here is the very note he slapped it
down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will
see me when all is ready come at once fhm now my theory all
along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora
millar and that she with confederates no doubt was
responsible for her disappearance here signed with her
initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
reach

very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are
very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a
listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he
gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important
said he

ha you find it so

extremely so i congratulate you warmly

lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he
shrieked you're looking at the wrong side

on the contrary this is the right side

the right side you're mad here is the note written in pencil
over here

and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
bill which interests me deeply

there's nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade
oct th rooms s breakfast s d cocktail s lunch s
d glass sherry d i see nothing in that

very likely not it is most important all the same as to the
note it is important also or at least the initials are so i
congratulate you again

i've wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in
hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
good-day mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom
of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them
into the bag and made for the door

just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival
vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady
st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any
such person

lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me
tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and
hurried away

he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on
his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about
outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must
leave you to your papers for a little

it was after five o'clock when sherlock holmes left me but i had
no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a
confectioner's man with a very large flat box this he unpacked
with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and
presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean
little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
lodging-house mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold
woodcock a pheasant a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries
my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian
nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid
for and were ordered to this address

just before nine o'clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the
room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his
eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
conclusions

they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands

you seem to expect company they have laid for five

yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i
am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i
fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs

it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features

my messenger reached you then asked holmes

yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure
have you good authority for what you say

the best possible

lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
forehead

what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of
the family has been subjected to such humiliation

it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any
humiliation

ah you look on these things from another standpoint

i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the
lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of
doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she
had no one to advise her at such a crisis

it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon
tapping his fingers upon the table

you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so
unprecedented a position

i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have
been shamefully used

i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps
on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here
who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a
lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to
introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i
think you have already met

at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand
thrust into the breast of his frock-coat a picture of offended
dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was
as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was
one which it was hard to resist

you're angry robert said she well i guess you have every
cause to be

pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly

oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i
should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of
rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just
didn't know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didn't
fall down and do a faint right there before the altar

perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave
the room while you explain this matter

if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman
we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
already for my part i should like all europe and america to
hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man
clean-shaven with a sharp face and alert manner

then i'll tell our story right away said the lady frank here
and i met in in mcquire's camp near the rockies where pa
was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i
but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile
while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa
wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took
me away to frisco frank wouldn't throw up his hand though so
he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything
about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just
fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and
make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had
as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of
time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived
why shouldn't we be married right away then said he and
then i will feel sure of you and i won't claim to be your
husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had
fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting
that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek
his fortune and i went back to pa

the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then
he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new
mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a
miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was
my frank's name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was
very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took
me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a
year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really
dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london
and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt
all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor frank

still if i had married lord st simon of course i'd have done
my duty by him we can't command our love but we can our
actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make
him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may
imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i
glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the
first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked
again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as
if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i
didn't drop i know that everything was turning round and the
words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
ear i didn't know what to do should i stop the service and make
a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to
know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to
tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper
and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on
the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the
note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a
line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so
of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct

when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california
and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but
to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to
have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before
his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to
run away and explain afterwards i hadn't been at the table ten
minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of
the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park
i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman
came talking something or other about lord st simon to
me seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also but i managed to get away
from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and
away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and
that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank
had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to
frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to
england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the
very morning of my second wedding

i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name
and the church but not where the lady lived

then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all
for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i
should like to vanish away and never see any of them again just
sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it
was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back so
frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we
should have gone on to paris to-morrow only that this good
gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how
he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very
clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and
that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord
st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at
once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if
i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very
meanly of me

lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but
had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
long narrative

excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner

then you won't forgive me you won't shake hands before i go

oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him

i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us
in a friendly supper

i think that there you ask a little too much responded his
lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over
them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a
very good-night he included us all in a sweeping bow and
stalked out of the room

then i trust that you at least will honour me with your
company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an
american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the
folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes

the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our
visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural
than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr
lestrade of scotland yard

you were not yourself at fault at all then

from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that
the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony
the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
returning home obviously something had occurred during the
morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that
something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was
out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she
seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america
because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a
process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an
american then who could this american be and why should he
possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might
be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in
rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got
before i ever heard lord st simon's narrative when he told us
of a man in a pew of the change in the bride's manner of so
transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very
significant allusion to claim-jumping which in miners parlance
means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
claim to the whole situation became absolutely clear she had
gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a
previous husband the chances being in favour of the latter

and how in the world did you find them

it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held
information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
know the initials were of course of the highest importance
but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels

how did you deduce the select

by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate
in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i
learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an
american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking
over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i
had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded
to gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them
some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in
particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i
made him keep the appointment

but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was
certainly not very gracious

ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be
very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and
wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully
and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for
the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
these bleak autumnal evenings



xi the adventure of the beryl coronet

holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bow-window looking
down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather
sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone

my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
in the pockets of his dressing-gown looking over my shoulder it
was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day
before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the
wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed
into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and
on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but
was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer
passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the
metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention

he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a
massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was
dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frock-coat shining
hat neat brown gaiters and well-cut pearl-grey trousers yet
his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
and features for he was running hard with occasional little
springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and
down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most
extraordinary contortions

what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is
looking up at the numbers of the houses

i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his
hands

here

yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i
think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as
he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and
pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
clanging

a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still
gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his
body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his
feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room
sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and sitting
beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy
soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ

you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he
you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have
recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into
any little problem which you may submit to me

the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting
against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his
brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us

no doubt you think me mad said he

i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes

god knows i have a trouble which is enough to unseat my
reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might
have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet
borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man
but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have
been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone
the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
out of this horrible affair

pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a
clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you

my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your
ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder 
stevenson of threadneedle street

the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city
of london what could have happened then to bring one of the
foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we
waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced
himself to tell his story

i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened
here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure
your co-operation i came to baker street by the underground and
hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this
snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who
takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the
facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can

it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means
of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security
is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction
during the last few years and there are many noble families to
whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
pictures libraries or plate

yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a
card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i
saw the name for it was that of none other than well perhaps
even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name
which is a household word all over the earth one of the highest
noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the
honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged
at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
quickly through a disagreeable task

mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the
habit of advancing money

the firm does so when the security is good i answered

it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have
 pounds at once i could of course borrow so trifling a
sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it
a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my
position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
one's self under obligations

for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked

next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most
certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you
think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the
money should be paid at once

i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be
rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do
it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must
insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution
should be taken

i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a
square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair
you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet

one of the most precious public possessions of the empire
said i

precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft
flesh-coloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
which he had named there are thirty-nine enormous beryls said
he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the
lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my
security

i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
perplexity from it to my illustrious client

you doubt its value he asked

not at all i only doubt 

the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest
about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a
pure matter of form is the security sufficient

ample

you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof
of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i
have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to
preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i
need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as
serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the
world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them
i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall
call for it in person on monday morning

seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but
calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty 
pound notes when i was alone once more however with the
precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not
but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it
was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any
misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever
consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter
the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned
once more to my work

when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had
been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how
terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i
determined therefore that for the next few days i would always
carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might
never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a
cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel
with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs
and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room

and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep
out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three
maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy
parr the second waiting-maid has only been in my service a few
months she came with an excellent character however and has
always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has
attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place
that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way

so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it
will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an
only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr
holmes a grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am
myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very
likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i
had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it
would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i
meant it for the best

it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business but he was not of a business turn he was wild
wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the
handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a
member of an aristocratic club and there having charming
manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards
and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again
to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried
more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir
george burnwell was enough to draw him back again

and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george
burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently
brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could
hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than
arthur a man of the world to his finger-tips one who had been
everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of
great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far
away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his
cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that
he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so
too thinks my little mary who has a woman's quick insight into
character

and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but
when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my
daughter she is a sunbeam in my house sweet loving beautiful
a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and
gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know
what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone
against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for
he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i
think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his
whole life but now alas it is too late forever too late

now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and
i shall continue with my miserable story

when we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name
of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am
sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed
mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it

where have you put it asked arthur

in my own bureau

well i hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the
night said he

it is locked up i answered

oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i
have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard

he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of
what he said he followed me to my room however that night with
a very grave face

look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let
me have pounds

no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too
generous with you in money matters

you have been very kind said he but i must have this money
or else i can never show my face inside the club again

and a very good thing too i cried

yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man
said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money
in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try
other means

i was very angry for this was the third demand during the
month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which
he bowed and left the room without another word

when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my
treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go
round the house to see that all was secure a duty which i
usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform
myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself
at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as
i approached

tell me dad said she looking i thought a little
disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out
to-night

certainly not

she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she
has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that
it is hardly safe and should be stopped

you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer
it are you sure that everything is fastened

quite sure dad

then good-night i kissed her and went up to my bedroom
again where i was soon asleep

i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may
have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question
me upon any point which i do not make clear

on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid

i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be
particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety
in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual
about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in
the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an
impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my
horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear
and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door

arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you
touch that coronet

the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy
dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the
light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be
wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry
he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i
snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with
three of the beryls in it was missing

you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have
destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the
jewels which you have stolen

stolen he cried

yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder

there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he

there are three missing and you know where they are must i
call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to
tear off another piece

you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it
any longer i shall not say another word about this business
since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in
the morning and make my own way in the world

you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried
half-mad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to
the bottom

you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such
as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to
call the police let the police find what they can

by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my
voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and
at the sight of the coronet and of arthur's face she read the
whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the
ground i sent the house-maid for the police and put the
investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a
constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with
his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge
him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private
matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was
national property i was determined that the law should have its
way in everything

at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it
would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the
house for five minutes

that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you
have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position
in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only
my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at
stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell
me what he had done with the three missing stones

you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught
in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous
if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling
us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten

keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered
turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened
for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for
it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search
was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the
wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after
going through all the police formalities have hurried round to
you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter
the police have openly confessed that they can at present make
nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think
necessary i have already offered a reward of pounds my
god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son
in one night oh what shall i do

he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
beyond words

sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows
knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire

do you receive much company he asked

none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
arthur's sir george burnwell has been several times lately no
one else i think

do you go out much in society

arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for
it

that is unusual in a young girl

she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she
is four-and-twenty

this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to
her also

terrible she is even more affected than i

you have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt

how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
in his hands

i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of
the coronet at all injured

yes it was twisted

do you not think then that he might have been trying to
straighten it

god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me
but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if
his purpose were innocent why did he not say so

precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie
his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several
singular points about the case what did the police think of the
noise which awoke you from your sleep

they considered that it might be caused by arthur's closing his
bedroom door

a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door
so as to wake a household what did they say then of the
disappearance of these gems

they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
in the hope of finding them

have they thought of looking outside the house

yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has
already been minutely examined

now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now
that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you
to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider
what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came
down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing-room
opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main
force a small portion of it went off to some other place
concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine with such skill that
nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirty-six
into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable

but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of
despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain
them

it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if
you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together
and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
details

my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy
were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i
confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such
faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some
grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client
appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
which had been presented to him and he even broke into a
desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway
journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest
residence of the great financier

fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone standing
back a little from the road a double carriage-sweep with a
snow-clad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates
which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden
thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the
tradesmen's entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the
stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a
public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing
at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the
front down the tradesmen's path and so round by the garden
behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i
went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height
slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against
the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever
seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face her lips too were
bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept
silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
character with immense capacity for self-restraint disregarding
my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
over his head with a sweet womanly caress

you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you
not dad she asked

no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom

but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what woman's
instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will
be sorry for having acted so harshly

why is he silent then if he is innocent

who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should
suspect him

how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with
the coronet in his hand

oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take
my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say
no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in
prison

i shall never let it drop until the gems are found never mary
your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman
down from london to inquire more deeply into it

this gentleman she asked facing round to me

no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in
the stable lane now

the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he
hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir
that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth
that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime

i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may
prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the
snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing
miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two

pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up

you heard nothing yourself last night

nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard
that and i came down

you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you
fasten all the windows

yes

were they all fastened this morning

yes

you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked
to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him

yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room and
who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet

i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her
sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery

but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the
banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with
the coronet in his hands

wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this
girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i
presume

yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i
met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom

do you know him

oh yes he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round
his name is francis prosper

he stood said holmes to the left of the door that is to
say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door

yes he did

and he is a man with a wooden leg

something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you
know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in
holmes thin eager face

i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall
probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps
i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up

he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at
the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane
this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs
said he at last

the banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror
holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock

which key was used to open it he asked

that which my son himself indicated that of the cupboard of the
lumber-room

have you it here

that is it on the dressing-table

sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau

it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did
not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must
have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem
he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the
jeweller's art and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i
have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge
where a corner holding three gems had been torn away

now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which
corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i
beg that you will break it off

the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying
said he

then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but
without result i feel it give a little said he but though
i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my
time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do
you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would
be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this
happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
nothing of it

i do not know what to think it is all dark to me

but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think
miss holder

i confess that i still share my uncle's perplexity

your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him

he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt

thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault
if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your
permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations
outside

he went alone at his own request for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an
hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet
heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever

i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr
holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my
rooms

but the gems mr holmes where are they

i cannot tell

the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he
cried and my son you give me hopes

my opinion is in no way altered

then for god's sake what was this dark business which was
acted in my house last night

if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to-morrow
morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to
make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to
act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you
place no limit on the sum i may draw

i would give my fortune to have them back

very good i shall look into the matter between this and then
good-bye it is just possible that i may have to come over here
again before evening

it was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
about the case although what his conclusions were was more than
i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward
journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always
glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in
despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in
a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned
up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he
was a perfect sample of the class

i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass
above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me
watson but i fear that it won't do i may be on the trail in
this matter or i may be following a will-o-the-wisp but i
shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few
hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this
rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition

i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in
excellent spirits swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
cup of tea

i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on

where to

oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time
before i get back don't wait up for me in case i should be
late

how are you getting on

oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham
since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a
very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a
good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get
these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
respectable self

i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled
and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he
hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of
the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his
congenial hunt

i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so
i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away
for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that
his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he
came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there
he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
other as fresh and trim as possible

you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but
you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
morning

why it is after nine now i answered i should not be
surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring

it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the
change which had come over him for his face which was naturally
of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in
while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered
with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into
the armchair which i pushed forward for him

i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said
he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without
a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured
age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece
mary has deserted me

deserted you

yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was
empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to
her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had
married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was
thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers
in this note

my dearest uncle i feel that i have brought trouble upon you
and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune
might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my
mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must
leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is
provided for and above all do not search for me for it will
be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me in life or in
death i am ever your loving mary

what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it
points to suicide

no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible
solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of
your troubles

ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have
learned something where are the gems

you would not think pounds apiece an excessive sum for
them

i would pay ten

that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter
and there is a little reward i fancy have you your check-book
here is a pen better make it out for pounds

with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes
walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of
gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table

with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up

you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved

the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and
he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom

there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock
holmes rather sternly

owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it

no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that
noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i
should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to
have one

then it was not arthur who took them

i told you yesterday and i repeat to-day that it was not

you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him
know that the truth is known

he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an
interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the
story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was
right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
clear to me your news of this morning however may open his
lips

for heaven's sake tell me then what is this extraordinary
mystery

i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached
it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me
to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding
between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now
fled together

my mary impossible

it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither
you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most
dangerous men in england a ruined gambler an absolutely
desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece
knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he
had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she
alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said
but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
him nearly every evening

i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an
ashen face

i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night
your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room
slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right
through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the
coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he
bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but
there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
other loves and i think that she must have been one she had
hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
about one of the servants escapade with her wooden-legged lover
which was all perfectly true

your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but
he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts
in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door
so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin
walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
into your dressing-room petrified with astonishment the lad
slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the
room again and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed
down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and
slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see
what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the
window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then
closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close
to where he stood hid behind the curtain

as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the
instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
this would be for you and how all-important it was to set it
right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened
the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane
where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george
burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was
a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the
coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son
struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something
suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet
in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your
room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
appeared upon the scene

is it possible gasped the banker

you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not
explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he
took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her
secret

and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have
been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes
the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him

when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went
very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since
the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost
to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmen's path but
found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it
however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood
and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed
that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been
disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was
shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while wooden-leg had
waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time
that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had
already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed
round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable
lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
front of me

there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second
double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the
other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over
the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed
after the other i followed them up and found they led to the
hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while
waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred
yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round
where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle
and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me
that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and
another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that
the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue

on entering the house however i examined as you remember the
sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could
at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the
outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had
brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had
pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged
at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which
neither alone could have effected he had returned with the
prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so
far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who
was it brought him the coronet

it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the
truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down
so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were
the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his
cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should
retain her secret the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and
how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture
became a certainty

and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently
for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your
circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir
george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil
reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots
and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur
had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was
safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
own family

well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took
next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george's house
managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that
his master had cut his head the night before and finally at
the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of
his cast-off shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and
saw that they exactly fitted the tracks

i saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
said mr holder

precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home
and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to
play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our
hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of
course he denied everything but when i gave him every
particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a
life-preserver from the wall i knew my man however and i
clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he
became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give
him a price for the stones he held pounds apiece that
brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why
dash it all said he i've let them go at six hundred for the
three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i
set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at 
pounds apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all
was right and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock after
what i may call a really hard day's work

a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said
the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but
you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your
skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i
must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i
have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my
very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now

i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is
wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that
whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than
sufficient punishment



xii the adventure of the copper beeches

to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock
holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily
telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is
pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped
this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say
occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much
to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which i
have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves but which have given room for those
faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made
my special province

and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved
from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
records

you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing
cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
disputatious rather than a meditative mood you have erred
perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
really the only notable feature about the thing

it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter
i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism
which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
friend's singular character

no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as
was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full
justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a
thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it
is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of
lectures into a series of tales

it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after
breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of
dun-coloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark
shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit
and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for
the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been
silent all the morning dipping continuously into the
advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last
having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very
sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings

at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he
had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire
you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense
at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king
of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the
problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the
incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are
outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i
fear that you may have bordered on the trivial

the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold
to have been novel and of interest

pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant
public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of
analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot
blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at
least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as
to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an
agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
young ladies from boarding-schools i think that i have touched
bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my
zero-point i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across
to me

it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and
ran thus

dear mr holmes i am very anxious to consult you as to whether
i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
to me as governess i shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if i
do not inconvenience you yours faithfully
 violet hunter

do you know the young lady i asked

not i

it is half-past ten now

yes and i have no doubt that is her ring

it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you
remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to
be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation
it may be so in this case also

well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved
for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question

as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room
she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face
freckled like a plover's egg and with the brisk manner of a
woman who has had her own way to make in the world

you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my
companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange
experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort
from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be
kind enough to tell me what i should do

pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything
that i can to serve you

i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching
fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and
his finger-tips together to listen to her story

i have been a governess for five years said she in the
family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel
received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his
children over to america with him so that i found myself without
a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but
without success at last the little money which i had saved began
to run short and i was at my wit's end as to what i should do

there is a well-known agency for governesses in the west end
called westaway's and there i used to call about once a week in
order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me
westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is
really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office
and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom
and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers
and sees whether she has anything which would suit them

well when i called last week i was shown into the little office
as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a
prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy
chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very
earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a
jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper

that will do said he i could not ask for anything better
capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a
comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
him

you are looking for a situation miss he asked

yes sir

as governess

yes sir

and what salary do you ask

i had pounds a month in my last place with colonel spence
munro

oh tut tut sweating rank sweating he cried throwing his
fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling
passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
such attractions and accomplishments

my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i
a little french a little german music and drawing 

tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question
the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are
not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a
considerable part in the history of the country but if you have
why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
accept anything under the three figures your salary with me
madam would commence at pounds a year

you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was
such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman
however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
opened a pocket-book and took out a note

it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant
fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies
half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little
expenses of their journey and their wardrobe

it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so
thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the
advance was a great convenience and yet there was something
unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
a little more before i quite committed myself

may i ask where you live sir said i

hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles
on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my
dear young lady and the dearest old country-house

and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would
be

one child one dear little romper just six years old oh if
you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack
smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back
in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again

i was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement
but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was
joking

my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single
child

no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he
cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would
suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided
always that they were such commands as a lady might with
propriety obey you see no difficulty heh

i should be happy to make myself useful

quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you
know faddy but kind-hearted if you were asked to wear any dress
which we might give you you would not object to our little whim
heh

no said i considerably astonished at his words

or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to
you

oh no

or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us

i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes
my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of
chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of
sacrificing it in this offhand fashion

i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a
shadow pass over his face as i spoke

i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a
little fancy of my wife's and ladies fancies you know madam
ladies fancies must be consulted and so you won't cut your
hair

no sir i really could not i answered firmly

ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a
pity because in other respects you would really have done very
nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more
of your young ladies

the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so
much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting
that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal

do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked

if you please miss stoper

well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the
most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you
can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
opening for you good-day to you miss hunter she struck a gong
upon the table and i was shown out by the page

well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found
little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the
table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very
foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and
expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were
at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few
governesses in england are getting pounds a year besides
what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing
it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was
inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after
i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it
here and i will read it to you

 the copper beeches near winchester
dear miss hunter miss stoper has very kindly given me your
address and i write from here to ask you whether you have
reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you
should come for she has been much attracted by my description of
you we are willing to give pounds a quarter or pounds a
year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my
wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need
not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one
belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which
would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting
here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that
need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no
doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty
during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain
firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary
may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child
is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall
meet you with the dog-cart at winchester let me know your train
yours faithfully jephro rucastle

that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and
my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however
that before taking the final step i should like to submit the
whole matter to your consideration

well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the
question said holmes smiling

but you would not advise me to refuse

i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to
see a sister of mine apply for

what is the meaning of it all mr holmes

ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself
formed some opinion

well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr
rucastle seemed to be a very kind good-natured man is it not
possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the
matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that
he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
outbreak

that is a possible solution in fact as matters stand it is
the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a
nice household for a young lady

but the money mr holmes the money

well yes of course the pay is good too good that is what
makes me uneasy why should they give you pounds a year when
they could have their pick for pounds there must be some
strong reason behind

i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would
understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so
much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me

oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that
your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel
about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt
or in danger 

danger what danger do you foresee

holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if
we could define it said he but at any time day or night a
telegram would bring me down to your help

that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the
anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire
quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once
sacrifice my poor hair to-night and start for winchester
to-morrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both
good-night and bustled off upon her way

at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending
the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
to take care of herself

and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much
mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past

it was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts
turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual
salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to
something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether
the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond
my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat
frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an
abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried
impatiently i can't make bricks without clay and yet he would
always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
have accepted such a situation

the telegram which we eventually received came late one night
just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down
to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a
test-tube at night and find him in the same position when i came
down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope
and then glancing at the message threw it across to me

just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back
to his chemical studies

the summons was a brief and urgent one

please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday
to-morrow it said do come i am at my wit's end hunter

will you come with me asked holmes glancing up

i should wish to

just look it up then

there is a train at half-past nine said i glancing over my
bradshaw it is due at winchester at 

that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the
morning

by eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers
all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he
threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal
spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white
clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining
very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air
which set an edge to a man's energy all over the countryside
away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and
grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
green of the new foliage

are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the
enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street

but holmes shook his head gravely

do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of
a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with
reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered
houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them
and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
there

good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these
dear old homesteads

they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief
watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest
alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside

you horrify me

but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion
can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no
lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of
a drunkard's blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among
the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is
but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these
lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part
with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the
deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on
year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this
lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i
should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of
country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is
not personally threatened

no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away

quite so she has her freedom

what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation

i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is
correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of
the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has
to tell

the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no
distance from the station and there we found the young lady
waiting for us she had engaged a sitting-room and our lunch
awaited us upon the table

i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it
is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i
should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me

pray tell us what has happened to you

i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr
rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into
town this morning though he little knew for what purpose

let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long
thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen

in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole
with no actual ill-treatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is
only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and
i am not easy in my mind about them

what can you not understand

their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just
as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and
drove me in his dog-cart to the copper beeches it is as he
said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself
for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all
stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds
round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which
slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about
a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs
to the house but the woods all round are part of lord
southerton's preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in
front of the hall door has given its name to the place

i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever
and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child
there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to
us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is
not mad i found her to be a silent pale-faced woman much
younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think
while he can hardly be less than forty-five from their
conversation i have gathered that they have been married about
seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by
the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr
rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as
the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite
imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
father's young wife

mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse
she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately
devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey
eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every
little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her
also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they
seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow
this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the
saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her
in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so
utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature he is small
for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large
his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving
pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would
rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he
has little to do with my story

i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they
seem to you to be relevant or not

i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one
unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was
the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a
man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough
uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual
smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been
quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it
his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as
silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most
unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one
corner of the building

for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was
very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after
breakfast and whispered something to her husband

oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to
you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electric-blue
dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in
your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
both be extremely obliged

the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade
of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it
bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not
have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr
and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which
seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for
me in the drawing-room which is a very large room stretching
along the entire front of the house with three long windows
reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the
central window with its back turned towards it in this i was
asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the
other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest
stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how
comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs
rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so
much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad
anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle
suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in
the nursery

two days later this same performance was gone through under
exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i
sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny
stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire and which
he told inimitably then he handed me a yellow-backed novel and
moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not
fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for
about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then
suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and
to change my dress

you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to
what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face
away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire
to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be
impossible but i soon devised a means my hand-mirror had been
broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of
the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst
of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able
with a little management to see all that there was behind me i
confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that
was my first impression at the second glance however i
perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road
a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in
my direction the road is an important highway and there are
usually people there this man however was leaning against the
railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i
lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her
eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing
but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my
hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once

jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the
road there who stares up at miss hunter

no friend of yours miss hunter he asked

no i know no one in these parts

dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to
him to go away

surely it would be better to take no notice

no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn
round and wave him away like that

i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew
down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have
not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor
seen the man in the road

pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a
most interesting one

you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may
prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper
beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp
rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving
about

look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two
planks is he not a beauty

i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a
vague figure huddled up in the darkness

don't be frightened said my employer laughing at the start
which i had given it's only carlo my mastiff i call him mine
but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do
anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then
so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose
every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
upon for goodness sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
foot over the threshold at night for it's as much as your life
is worth

the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to
look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning
it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the
house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was
standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was
aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it
was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging
jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly
across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side
that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not
think that any burglar could have done

and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as
you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a
great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the
child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the
furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things
there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones
empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two
with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was
naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it
struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight
so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very
first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there
was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never
guess what it was it was my coil of hair

i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint
and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing
obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in
the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the
contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two
tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was
it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at
all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer
and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that
i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
locked

i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes
and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited
at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of
the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked
one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle
coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on
his face which made him a very different person to the round
jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his
brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his
temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me
without a word or a look

this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the
grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i
could see the windows of this part of the house there were four
of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the
fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i
strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle
came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever

ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you
without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with
business matters

i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i
you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one
of them has the shutters up

he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled
at my remark

photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my
dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we
have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever
believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest
in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and
annoyance but no jest

well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there
was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know
i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity
though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of duty a
feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
place they talk of woman's instinct perhaps it was woman's
instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there
and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
forbidden door

it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that
besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to
do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large
black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been
drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when
i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at
all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both
downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an
admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock
opened the door and slipped through

there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and
uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end
round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third
of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and
cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so
thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it
had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked
at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with
stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was
not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was
a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the
passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad
unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my
overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ran ran
as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door
and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting
outside

so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it
must be when i saw the door open

oh i am so frightened i panted

my dear young lady my dear young lady you cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner was and what has frightened
you my dear young lady

but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i
was keenly on my guard against him

i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered
but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was
frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in
there

only that said he looking at me keenly

why what did you think i asked

why do you think that i lock this door

i am sure that i do not know

it is to keep people out who have no business there do you
see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner

i am sure if i had known 

well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over
that threshold again here in an instant the smile hardened into
a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a
demon i'll throw you to the mastiff

i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that
i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing
until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i
thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without
some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the
woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible
to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of
course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was
almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would
send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the
office which is about half a mile from the house and then
returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my
mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i
remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of
insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one
in the household who had any influence with the savage creature
or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and
lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you
i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this
morning but i must be back before three o'clock for mr and
mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the
evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you
all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you
could tell me what it all means and above all what i should
do

holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in
his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
his face

is toller still drunk he asked

yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do
nothing with him

that is well and the rucastles go out to-night

yes

is there a cellar with a good strong lock

yes the wine-cellar

you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could
perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not
think you a quite exceptional woman

i will try what is it

we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o'clock my friend
and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will
we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might
give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some
errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate
matters immensely

i will do it

excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of
course there is only one feasible explanation you have been
brought there to personate someone and the real person is
imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this
prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice
rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to
america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height
figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very
possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of
course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you
came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some
friend of hers possibly her fiancé and no doubt as you wore
the girl's dress and were so like her he was convinced from your
laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture
that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer
desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent
him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly
clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of
the child

what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated

my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining
light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
parents don't you see that the converse is equally valid i have
frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
parents by studying their children this child's disposition is
abnormally cruel merely for cruelty's sake and whether he
derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or
from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
power

i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
this poor creature

we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning
man we can do nothing until seven o'clock at that hour we shall
be with you and it will not be long before we solve the
mystery

we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we
reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside
public-house the group of trees with their dark leaves shining
like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were
sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been
standing smiling on the door-step

have you managed it asked holmes

a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is
mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring
on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates
of mr rucastle's

you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now
lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black
business

we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a
passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss
hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the
transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but
without success no sound came from within and at the silence
holmes face clouded over

i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss
hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put
your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our
way in

it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there
was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a
basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner
gone

there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty
has guessed miss hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
off

but how

through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he
swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried here's the
end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did
it

but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not
there when the rucastles went away

he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and
dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were
he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it
would be as well for you to have your pistol ready

the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy
stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the
wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and
confronted him

you villain said he where's your daughter

the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open
skylight

it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies
and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power i'll
serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
could go

he's gone for the dog cried miss hunter

i have my revolver said i

better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed
down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we
heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a
horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an
elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
at a side door

my god he cried someone has loosed the dog it's not been
fed for two days quick quick or it'll be too late

holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with
toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its
black muzzle buried in rucastle's throat while he writhed and
screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and
it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and
carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid
him upon the drawing-room sofa and having dispatched the sobered
toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to
relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door
opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room

mrs toller cried miss hunter

yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he
went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didn't let me know
what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains
were wasted

ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs
toller knows more about this matter than anyone else

yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know

then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several
points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark

i will soon make it clear to you said she and i'd have done
so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if there's
police-court business over this you'll remember that i was the
one that stood your friend and that i was miss alice's friend
too

she was never happy at home miss alice wasn't from the time
that her father married again she was slighted like and had no
say in anything but it never really became bad for her until
after she met mr fowler at a friend's house as well as i could
learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so
quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them
but just left everything in mr rucastle's hands he knew he was
safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming
forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then
her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to
sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use
her money when she wouldn't do it he kept on worrying her until
she got brain-fever and for six weeks was at death's door then
she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her
beautiful hair cut off but that didn't make no change in her
young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be

ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough
to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce
all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this
system of imprisonment

yes sir

and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of
the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler

that was it sir

but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should
be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain
arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his

mr fowler was a very kind-spoken free-handed gentleman said
mrs toller serenely

and in this way he managed that your good man should have no
want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
when your master had gone out

you have it sir just as it happened

i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for
you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and
here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think
watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester
as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
questionable one

and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but
was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of
his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who
probably know so much of rucastle's past life that he finds it
difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were
married by special license in southampton the day after their
flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend
holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further
interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at
walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success

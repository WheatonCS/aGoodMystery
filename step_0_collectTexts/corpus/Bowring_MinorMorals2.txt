i aim aware that in the present volume
there are many parts which may not
at first sight appear suited to the capacities
 children but my own
observation leads me to think that
children are more apt to learn than
parents and instructors generally suppose
 and that their powers mind
are much strengthened by being exercised
with topics which are sometimes
deemed too exalted or abstruse
iv 
for their undeveloped faculties it is
no doubt difficult to draw an exact
line at the point beyond which it is
unwise in the instructor to pursue a
subject but some experiments must
be made and the intellects children
tried and strengthened by excursions
into regions remote from their habitual
walks it is only thus that the
standard mind can be raised or the
path prepared for investigations into
more distant and more elevated studies
yet i have not ventured far nor have
i made my morals as i hope unintelligible
to minors
the storm
many were the happy days which the howard
family enjoyed always busy in improving and
in serving one another kindness became the
habit their daily existence and it was a
kindness without show or parade the natural
flow minds that were training themselves
and one another to enjoyment and gathering
instruction and practising virtue as the best
means enjoyment
no doubt there were now and then exhibitions
 petulance and illhumour but these
were transitory they were the gloomy moments
which were succeeded by sunshine and
they were not without their use for children
are quick in observation and their young minds
are easily taught to reason on the consequences
 conduct edith was once overheard to say
how very foolish i was to be so angry 
how very foolish and arthur after an occasion
on which he had struck his brother with
violence not feeling courage enough to appear
in the presence the gentle edith had
hid himself in the hayloft where he sobbed
and wept as if his heart were breaking and
was found in tears by one the servants who
came to look after the horses and to whom
he confided his sorrow and his penitence
go master arthur george is very forgiving
and arthur went his eyes red with
crying and held out his trembling hand to
george who shook it warmly and edith
smiled it was not necessary for either to
utter a word
one stormy evening the howard family
the storm 
were gathered round the fire and as the wind
blew louder and louder edith said i fancy
mamma that i love you better when the tempest
is so noisy because i think the home
that shelters me and those who make that
home so dear
no doubt my child said mrs howard
for we should soon forget how much we have
to be grateful for were we not sometimes
compelled to think how severe the privation
would be it is pain that teaches us the value
 health hunger and thirst enable us to estimate
the importance food and drink the
biting cold shows us the blessings raiment 
the storm makes the sunshine doubly welcome 
and now that the rain is driving hard against
the windows and the loud blasts shake our
habitation we begin to feel most sensibly what
a privilege it is not to be exposed to the viol
minor morals
hence the weather do you remember the
hurricane we witnessed on the sea shore 
how should i forget it mamma you
recollect we were walking on the beach ancj
the thunderclouds gathered and grew blacker
and blacker and the wind became fiercer and
fiercer and the waves rolled higher and higher
and foamed as if they were in a passion and
flung the stones and shingles on the shore
and we had great difficulty in getting home
and were drenched and almost drowned for
the heavens seemed as full water as the
ocean itself and poured it out with the same
vehemence was it not a terrible day
mamma
and was that all edith 
o no mamma for the dreadful thing
was to see the ships and the boats tossed
about upon the waves and to fancy we could
the storm o
hear the voices the poor sailors and even
that mamma was not the worst oh nothing
like it for don't you recollect how we went
to the fisherman's hut and saw the poor widow
wringing her hands and some the children
crying and you mamma cried too and i
could not help it and even now when i
think it 
poor edith could not proceed she burst
into tears
she wiped them from her cheeks and george
ran and kissed her arthur did the same for
they felt additional love for their sister whenever
her benevolent affections were displayed
but i do wish said arthur that mamma
would tell us the story the poor fisherman

 i do not know much his life my boy
and perhaps his life if i knew it all would
give but little to tell i dare say he was bred
b minor morals
from his boyhood to the sea a fisherman as
were his fathers in the times war no
doubt he like most his fellows was compelled
to serve the state and may have traversed
the ocean for thousands and thousands
 leagues accompanied by sad thoughts 
home wife and family such thoughts no
doubt he had for when he was dead everybody
told us how much he was loved loved
by his wife loved by his children i daresay
the small hut in which they dwelt was
dearer to him than any spot in th world and
if he visited great ports and splendid cities
that he often wished he could exchange the
sight for one glance the little cove in which
he was born and where he had left his family

no doubt he did said mr howard and
mamma will forgive me for interrupting her
to tell you that i have heard an instance in
the storm 
which a sailor after a long voyage became
stoneblind from overstraining the nerve called
the optic nerve by which the eyes communicate
with the brain in an attempt to discover
a point land which was particularly interesting
to him and i knew a case where
the delight revisiting a beloved abode
brought with it a mental excitement so vehement
as to in death joy itself should
be moderated by reflection but go on mamma
there was no such joy to precede the
poor fisherman's death
edith has told you the violence the
tempest it was known that many vessels
had been wrecked for planks and broken
masts and merchandise were driven on the
shore the tempest had continued furiously
through the night and the night was one 
thick darkness the fisherman's wife felt some
anxiety but not much alarm her husband
 minor morals
was a practised mariner and many such storms
had he mastered and come home in safety
misgivings came and went the fisherboat
had gone to sea the day before again and
again had the fisherman returned in high spirits
when ships had been driven ashore and
corpses found on the coast and he said that
his frisky for so he had named his boat
would ride in security through any gale and
he laughed at the fears which he heard sometimes
expressed vowing that frisky had learned
to dance in any waves or waters whether
high or low
in truth he had subdued his wife's apprehension
and imparted to her a portion 
his own courage
at break day the morning after the
storm three his children two girls and a
boy went forth as they were wont to gather
from the beach such fragments as the billows
the storm 
had washed upon the coast there was at
some distance from their hut a rock called
the perilous point which jutted far into the
sea and which could only be passed round at
low water to proceed beyond it was so dangerous
that it was generally the termination
 the walk the tide was ebbing fast
though the billows were still agitated by the
violence the tempest one the children
said let us go home no said another
let us wait to go round the perilous point
we shall soon be able the tide is lowering 
perhaps we shall find something yes perhaps
we shall find something the others answered
they waited they did find something
 it was their father's body
the waves had left it high upon the
sand the children recognised it instantly
father father they shouted to one anon

 minor morals
ther and shouted to the lifeless corpse that
was at their feet they kissed it they lifted
its hands they wiped away the sand from the
face and the bosom they cried they ran
about wildly they threw themselves on the
beach they forgot that the tide was turning
until one them shrieked out we
cannot pass the rock an instinct selfpreservation
stronger than any other instinct
compelled them they had to wade nearly
up to their breasts and every now and then
a wave washed over them they held by one
another and by the rock as they turned the
perilous point they passed it in safety and
ran screaming dolefully as they ran father 
father 
ere they reached the house their mother
heard them the truth rushed into her mind r
 where where she said and she said
the storm 
nothing more the children ran before her
to the rock but the tide had long before
covered it there was no passing
the poor widow tore her hair looked at
her children and while the waves were dashing
around she sat down silent as the rock
and gloomy as death there she waited till the
waters fell and as they fell many and many
a vain attempt did she make to pass round
the point she was beaten back again and
again but at last forced her way while the
children believed she would be carried off by
the waves no corpse was there nor sign
that any corpse had been her children once
heard her shriek no no but could not
join her when the tide had ebbed much
lower they got round the rock and found her
lying senseless near the spot where they had
seen their dead father lie with difficulty
they aroused her and forced her over the
 minor morals
perilous point a widow she and orphans they
walked to their desolate hut people sayshe
has never smiled since then but that she
will not believe her husband is dead she
has never once talked him to her children
because she knows their testimony would interfere
with her delusion he will come
some day she often is heard to whisper
would it not be charity said george
to persuade her the truth and that she
is deceiving herself with idle dreams
i know not why said mr howard
those dreams are hope and happiness to
her perhaps and they do no harm to anyone
else do you remember horace's story
 the maniac who reproached the medical
attendant that visited him for having cured
him the fancy that he heard divinely harmonious
sounds and brought him back in consequence
to all the discords the world i
the storm 
once met in a lunatic asylum a lady whose
illusion consisted in the belief that she was
perpetually in the presence the wise and
good all ages hearing their words wisdom
and herself the object their peculiar
affection she was so happy as to be enviable
and when you meet with calamity
my children do not exaggerate it nor magnify
it either to yourselves or to others your
own calamities especially never attempt to
make greater than they are if others form
too low an estimate their calamities do
not persuade them they are worse than they
think them to be
uses animals to man
among the favourite books the howard
family library was bewick's birds and
quadrupeds again and again had the
leaves been turned over and occasion was
often found by mr and mrs howard to
relate some anecdote in illustration the
characters the different animals which are
so prettily and so truly depicted by the
newcastle woodengraver to observe
was one the constant lessons which was
taught in the howard family to inquire
the children were told was not always 
curious we might be as
our curiosity could not on all occasions
uses animals to man 
be satisfied respect for others and regard
for the variety men's situations and stations
made it often incumbent on us to
restrain inquiry when it might seem intrusive
or impertinent but to observe was
always right and proper and observation
was constantly encouraged as was the communication
 what had been observed
natural history was one the most frequent
and to the children most agreeable
topics conversation imagine then the
howard family gathered together as usual
after the tea had been removed from the
table and mr howard having called edith
to him and placed her between his knees
thus addressing them 
we talked some time ago children 
the services which animals might render toman
 services voluntary and involuntary
and i remember a circumstance so remarks
minor morals
able and so interesting that it will do well
for our evening tale
perhaps you have heard general
rafael riego he was well known during
the war independence in the peninsula
and still better after he and quiroga had
headed an insurrection the spanish troops in
the isle de leon and set up against the despotism
 ferdinand the seventh a popular representative
government i was then a traveller
in spain and saw the constitutional monuments
erected in many the towns and
cities amidst the acclamations the people
in france you know they planted trees
which they called trees liberty while in
spain they erected stones which were denominated
lapide de la constitution at that
time riego was absolutely the idol the
nation he was a man gentle manners
kind affections and made to be loved but
uses animals to man 
in those political vicissitudes through which
men almost always are doomed to pass when
struggling for political change riego perished
 perished on the scaffold one 
his aide camps was an irishman named
george matthewes
it happened that many englishmen were
engaged in these contests which ended in
the subjugation freedom and the reestablishment
 despotic power and many 
these englishmen occupied the prisons 
spain i was called upon to inquire into
the fate one them who was believed
to be immured in the dungeons the
spanish capital i employed a banker 
some influence to ascertain whether any
englishman who corresponded to the description
i gave the party was really
confined in any the jails madrid
he could not be found notwithstanding the
 minor morals
most anxious and persevering search my
friend but while he was engaged in
his investigations a dirty memorandum
was put into his hand by a soldier who
was guarding one the condemned cells in
which a human being had been long kept
in solitary confinement excluded from all
communication except such verbal conversation
as in opposition to the orders his
superior might be charitably entered on by
the soldier stationed at the door the cell
no writing materials no pen ink or paper
no means intercourse with any person
beyond the four walls the dungeon were
ever allowed to the unhappy prisoner the
name the prisoner was unknown to his
guard all he knew was that he had been
captured with riego and confined in the
cell adjacent to that from whence riego had
been led out to execution but the soldier had
uses animals to man 
mentioned to the prisoner that inquiries had
been made about an englishman the name
 harper and the answer had been that no
such person was within the prisonwalls
the prisoner intreated the soldier to convey
the scrap paper that he gave him to the
gentleman who had been making the inquiries
 he consented to do so the banker
received it and sent it to me
it was signed george matthewes it
was scarcely legible but it stated that the
writer had been long in solitary confinement
without accusation without judgment yet
in apprehension sentence death and
that he was an englishman
mr canning was then prime minister
i wrote to him immediately and a despatch
was sent off without delay to madrid directing
the british minister to claim the person
who without the forms legal proceeding
q minor morals
had been thus arbitrarily detained the intervention
was successful and the prisoner
was released
he accompanied the returning messenger
to england he brought with him the funeral
mementos riego the pocket handkerchief
with which he wiped his last mortal but
manly tears and gave it to his widow poor
thing she was then drooping like a lily on
its stem fair and pure and the weight 
grief soon overwhelmed a broken hearty and
loosened the silver cord an existence attenuated
by long disease i remember her a
saintlike beauty disassociated as it were
from earth
matthewes brought with him one other
treasure it was a white dove while excluded
from all knowledge what was passing
in the world hopeless ever communicating
his forlorn condition to any living soul
uses animals to man 
that dove had flown into his cell he
plucked a feather from its wing and with
his teeth and nails shaped it into a pen
he made ink the filth he gathered in the
corners his miserable abode he tore out

account that led to his deliverance that was
the memorandum i received what became
 the dove i know not but george
matthewes died some years afterwards a prisoner
in portugal
i was one day talking with mademoiselle
duvaucel niece the celebrated naturalist
cuvier on the tractableness animals and
she said they had then a curious example 
the influence one bird upon another
though wholly different species a vulture
and a raven were neighbours in the jardin
des plantes the raven was by common
consent allowed to be the most amiable
 minor morals
animal within the gardenwalls and was inconsequence
a universal favourite he had
learnt all sorts tricks such as catching
bread in the air dancing and fluttering
when visited by any his acquaintances
and generally giving evidence a superior
intelligence he was often oversupplied with
food from the contributions his friends
and never failed when he had eaten a sufficiency
to bury the rest for future use and
never forgot the place its concealment
whether the vulture had perceived or not
that his neighbour raven's reputation was
greater than his own and the spirit emulation
grew within him in consequence 
his observations and reflections could not be
positively ascertained but certain it is the
vulture took to imitating the raven and
soon made considerable progress in his fascinating
arts he abandoned animal food and
uses animals to man 
adopted bread nourishment he was greatlyperplexed
however by his curved and crooked
bill the raven easily picked off the dust
from the bread or plucked the bread out 
the dust with his sharp and piercing instrument
and had got into the habit poking
it about till he found a clean place for it
the vulture's difficulties were at first insurmountable
 nature had denied him the tools
which the raven had to work with he succeeded
however at last and after much
twisting and writhing and inexhaustible patience
was able to regale himself comfortably
with his newlyadopted food
among the galley slaves whom i saw depart
for toulon on the st april was
one all whose attention was absorbed by a
little creature that ran up and down his arms
hid itself in his breast played about his
neck and seemed busied in diverting the cried
minor morals
final from the dark and dreary thoughts
which must have been rushing through his
mind i saw him fully occupied with his
plaything and far more concerned in protecting
it from mischief than with any other
care an intruder into his cell he had managed
first to capture and then to tame it
and having no other receptacle for what remained
in him kindness and benevolence
and i never knew kindness and benevolence
wholly eradicated in the most ferocious criminal
he had poured out upon the sleek
skinned mouse all that he had love i
saw him full apprehension lest the poor
little animal should be injured or crushed in
the crowd as the convicts were led forth
one after another and seated in the long line
from which they are to rise with the heavy
iron collar rivetted around their throat and
chained together in companies twenty i
uses animals to man 
watched his eye and fancied i could follow
his thoughts he seemed wholly careless 
what was passing around him he took no
notice the spectators and even when the
hammer smote the rivet upon the anvil he
was watching the courses the little creature
and was perhaps contrasting their mutual
destinies a prisoner too i fancied
he said a fettered prisoner but still with
one being at least to watch over and protect
thee while there are hands to aid and a
heart to feel for thee ever present and ever
thoughtful no hand will be stretched out no
heart will beat in charity for thy keeper
when the wind blows and the rain falls thou
hast a shelter in my bosom its warmth will
be for thee in the cold and wintry season 
but where shall retreat and then he
smiled upon the pretty little animal stroked
vol ii c
 minor morals
its back gently and hid it again in his beating
breast 
do you know what became him
asked edith
no my dear he was probably forgotten
when i visited the bagnes i was told
that it was not allowed to the officers to
mention the names the prisoners the
punishment was intended to remove them
from the world and to break up all their
connections with their old acquaintances
but would it do so papa could they
be made to forget everybody and everybody
to forget them 
the attempt did not always succeed
edith for i found that love and kindred
and other claims brought many people to
the vicinity the bagnes who tried and
sometimes were successful in establishing
uses animals to man 
communications with the prisoners i heard
 an instance where a lady rank had lived
for many months in the neighbourhood for the
purpose obtaining the release a criminal
to whom she was attached and she succeeded
by large and repeated bribes so
strong are the human affections and so illadvisedly
are they sometimes directed but
we must take care not to err by severe judgments
there is often much virtue among
criminals virtue which if it had found time
and place for its proper exercise would have
made them illustrious public benefactors
those who have never known the pressure
 want are often apt to condemn too harshly
if they changed places with the unfortunate
it might be found that the scale merit
would be wholly changed the rich are too
apt to be severe on the errors the poor
 minor morals
could they but fancy themselves smitten
with poverty they would be more charitable
and being more charitable would be more
just to others
love excellence and
love excelling
papa said george one day to mr howard
 alien we are endeavouring at school
to get the highest places in our class i sometimes
observe that the boys who cannot get
on are made uncomfortable by the success
 those who can so that the good fortune
 some cannot be obtained without giving
pain to others ought this to be 
when i was a boy said mr howard
i went to a school in which there was
written in letters more than a foot long let
emulation prevail i was much perplexed
by it for it often happened that the boys
 minor morals
who made the greatest progress annoyed and
tormented others so that this very emulation
was often the cause much vexation and
this led me to consider that there was a
great difference between the love excellence
and the love excelling
oh said arthur indeed there is because
i have seen boys who got to the head
 their class and whom we loved better than
any boys in the school
and i am sure that may well be said
little edith because some the cleverest
and wisest people i ever knew were the
gentlest and the kindest don't you remember
mamma when we were on the sea coast
how pleasant it was to listen to mr harcourt
who was a great philosopher and who knew
all about the causes the rising and falling
 the tides and the different shapes the
moon and the reason the summer's heat
love excellence etc 
and the winter's cold and eclipses and who
told us all the changes the earth had undergone
and the rocks that were oldest
and those later date and the animals
that lived before the deluge and the
strange world they must have had to exist
in and who taught us the causes light
and darkness and how men breathe the air
that is given out by plants and plants breathe
the air that is given out by men and a
great many other wonderful things and yet
he never made us feel uncomfortable we
loved him for his wisdom and we never
feared him and his visits were always most
welcome
oh said arthur that is like our mathematical
friend who talks to us about angles
and triangles and euclid and wrangling at
cambridge and helps us in our algebra difficulties
and in all our sums and cyphers
 minor morals
and yet never says a single word to prove
that he knows more about these matters than
any body else and yet we know he does
but feel quite as happy in his company as if
he knew no more than any us
and happier too said edith because
we can learn so much from his knowledge
which his good nature makes so very
delightful
then my dear children said mr howard
 you will see what is good and what is
evil in that word emulation and the difference
there is between love excellence and
the love excelling the love excellence
gives no pain to others the love 
excelling may give pain and when it does
it is unamiable i will tell you a story
which will show you the difference
in the county devonshire there is an
extensive desert which is called a forest belove
 excellence etc o
cause in remote times there is no doubt it
was covered with woods it is now surrounded
by granite rocks among which many
 those beautiful rivers have their source
whose crystal brightness and wandering
course through a rich variety rocky and
verdant scenery have often excited the attention
and led to the descriptions travellers
on the verge dartmoor by the
borders the dart a river rapid as its
name there was a cottage almost hidden in
the rich variety verdure which the mild
and humid climate devon produces in
great abundance myrtles were there which
dared every season and were equally green
in the wintery as in the vernal months and
in the summer season the blossoms the
pomegranate hung in clusters vermilion
as bright as ever was seen in tropical islands
the cottage was inhabited by a widow who
c
 minor morals
had two daughters whose names were jane
and emily macdonald they had been born
in india where their father had been engaged
for some years in the service the east india
company with happy prospects before him 
future prosperity he had intended to send
his children to europe for education for as
i dare say you know the climate is dangerous
to children european origin and often
anticipated the delight with which he should
watch their progress and welcome them
when their education had been completed 
but death that so often interferes with man's
projects interfered with mr macdonald's 
and he was suddenly carried ois by one 
those reckless and rapid diseases which make
life so shadowy and uncertain in those remote
regions when he died all his brilliant
visions with respect to his children
faded away from the mind their mother
love excellence etc 
and she returned to england a sad and solitary
widow with slender means determined
to seek some spot solitude where she
might devote herself to the education her
daughters she consulted her friends and
found there was no spot where she could
live more economically than in the neighbourhood
i have described she had a
strong love for the charms nature and
hill and mountain forest and river scenery
brought to her mind the thoughts which she
loved to indulge she could fancy there was
a friendly voice in the echoes the hills
and that the music the woodbirds and 
the waters was meant to soothe her sorrows
when she went vrith her daughters into the
fields and gathered wild flowers it seemed
to her as if they were all made to console
and to comfort her if i had not been
here she said nobody would have noticed
 minor morals
them and it was a pleasant thought that
she reckoned for something in a part the
world which without her might have been
neglected and abandoned
jane was only one year older than her
sister emily jane had a great desire to instruct
herself but she cared not low much
she sacrificed others whenever she knew
anything she was not only desirous exhibiting
her knowledge but she always wished
to contrast it with the ignorance her companions
it was not enough for her to put
forth on every occasion all she had read and
heard but she seemed desirous talking on
subjects where she could show her superiority
so for instance she was frequently
blazoning forth that she had been in india 
had seen the ganges had ridden upon elephants
 had had fifty black servants so that
nobody was allowed to talk with her great
love excellence etc 
rivers great animals and great attendants
and if she had only mentioned this by way
 information instead as a display 
pride her conversation would have been interesting
and instructive but she had a passionate
desire to appear to excel and in order
to do so she never thought how much she
humiliated or distressed others i do not believe
she really meant to give them pain
but she was careless about the consequences
 what she said and did
emily's character and conduct was very
different the ambition to obtain the good
opinion others was not wanting to her
she had really and truly the love excellence
but while she was under the influences
 a desire to communicate any information
which might be useful or pleasant to
her companions and friends she was especially
careful so to communicate it as to cons
minor morals
vey no emotions vexation to them she
never intruded observations which could grieve
those who listened to her she was more
desirous gathering from others the information
they were able to communicate than
 displaying her own when her sister
spoke people were doubtful whether she
might not say annoying and disagreeable
things but when emily opened her lips
everybody was sure that her words would be
welcome thoughtful and wellchosen
i have spoken the macdonald companions
for though they lived in a secluded
place there are few places in england so
secluded as to be shut out from that intercourse
which is both refreshing and consoling
there was in the neighbourhood a
dissenting clergyman a modest and benevolent
man whose visits were hailed with delight
whenever and wherever he appeared
love excellence etc 
a newlyarrived neighbour like mrs macdonald
who had seen so much the world
who had inhabited asia touched on africa
and brought with her to europe so many
tales wonder gathered in the oriental
world was a settler whose arrival excited no
little interest in the devonian vales to this
minister she had brought letters and he had
made it his business to seek friends and
acquaintances for mrs macdonald who were
most anxious to show the interest they felt
in her wellbeing it was thus a circle 
social fellowship was created and here it was
that jane and emily displayed the peculiarities
 their character
the good people the neighbourhood
were at first so charmed with jane's vivacity
that they sought all sorts excuses for that
little defect which it was impossible for her
to conceal but which they overlooked at first
 minor morals
out courtesy to a stranger and because
she was really an instructed and intelligent
girl bat alas her defects became more
offensive from being unchecked and the more
timid but more considerate emily imperceptibly
won upon the kind affections the
little social circle her information came ina
modest and gentle guise while jane's voice
was frequently loud and her manner intrusive
little by little those who listened
grew inattentive from being inattentive they
became uneasy and at last they ventured
to tell miss jane that she should not speak
in so peremptory and patronising a manner
all that jane lost in the kind feelings 
their neighbours emily won for emily
though she often felt that she might have
corrected many ignorant or imperfect notions
 those with whom she conversed felt that
she could not always do this without give
 excellence etc 
ing pain but a thousand opportunities
occurred in which she was applied to for
information on matters she had studied and
objects she had seen and all that she said
she said so gently and so gracefully that no
one felt the slightest embarrassment still
less vexation from instruction coming in so
unpretending and attractive a shape
jane was not unobservant what passed
and said to her sister whom she fondly loved
i see emily that you are listened to with
pleasure however much you talk while they
show impatience when i get possession 
the conversation tell me tell me like a
good sister what this means
 indeed my dear jane i have sometimes
thought that they do not sufficiently
estimate all your good qualities and do not
like to acknowledge how much more you
know than they but 
 minor morals
but what retorted jane
 wliy i think answered emily that
sometimes you are a little too much contrasted
with those to whom you speak
 oh i know what you mean you think
i parade myself
 not so my love but i fear that those
who have seen so much less and who know
so much less than you do not always understand
your tone
 most true most true replied jane i
often detect myself in a louder voice and
a loftier manner than is becoming i will
try i will try to mend it
many many years have passed since this
conversation between the two sisters a change
in their fortunes brought them forth from
their retirement into the busy bustling world
jane has lost all that desire for distinction
which could not satisfy itself without become
 excellence etc 
ing a grievance to others it was her lot
her happy lot to be thrown into the society
 those whose information was much greater
than hers and she had the good sense to
see how idle it was to presume upon acquirements
which were eclipsed by those many
who surrounded her she has discovered that
the exhibition fancied excellence is somewhat
different from the possession real
excellence she is rather desirous being
one many to bring her little tribute 
knowledge to the general stock than to appear
the possessor an exclusive fund 
knowledge which she knows is not hers
emily's fate has been perhaps happier
her modesty made her a favourite her information
brought with it respect in her
the love excellence was never linked with
personal parade and as she never sought a place
higher than her deserts but always lower
 minor morals
everybody was desirous honouring her by
elevation how many pains she saved to
herself how many pleasures she created for
herself nobody but herself can know but
sure i am that if you my children strive to
be excellent not from a desire lowering

among the visitors who frequently called on
mr howard's family was a gentleman who
had been a great traveller both by land and
sea having visited the four quarters the
globe he often delighted the children by
the tales he told the countries he had
dwelt in and the sights he had seen the
children called him governor for he had been
governor one the english settlements
on the african coast and whether it was
that he had seen so much injustice alone to
the blacks as to lead him to suppose that on
every occasion when there was any misunderstanding
with white men the white men
 minor morals
were invariably wrong and the black men
right or whether he had a sort instinctive
preference for the ebony race i know not
but his friends were accustomed to say and
to say truly that he was sure to decide
every question in favour the negro and
that the white man lost all his fair chances
when our governor was judge between them
he was a rare exception indeed to white
men in general for in a great part the
world the negro is looked upon as a fair and
fit object for oppression and misdoing his
life his little property his wife his children
are too often considered as at the disposal 
some white tyrant who has obtained possession
 him
in mr howard's family the fate the
poor negroes was often a subject conversation
and the children were in the habit 
inducing the governor to tell them anecdotes
slavery 
 the woollyheaded natives africa whom
he knew better than most men and whom
he always spoke with the feelings a friend
and sometimes even with the affection a
brother
one evening the favourite topic was introduced
and the governor said he would tell
them a little story he had heard from the
lips a french captain engaged in the
african trade assuring them that he believed
every word to be strictly true
ands said the governor you must
fancy me to be the french captain because
i can better convey to you the history if i
speak in his name and person and this is
what the french captain said 
i was coasting near cape palma when
i observed on the shore some those
wooden huts which europeans are wont
hastily to construct upon the burning sand
 minor morals
these cabins are fragile and short duration
but serve as market places for those
bargains in human beings which form the
most lucrative commerce carried on in the
african tropics a large brig painted black
was anchored close to the shore she hoisted
no flag she did not own herself to belong
to any civilized nation her whole appearance
bespoke the purposes robbery which
brought her there in a word she was a
slave vessel endeavouring by stealth to fill
up her cargo misery with which to depart
to other markets where white men would
be found to buy those unfortunate beings
whom in africa black men kidnapped and
white men encouraged them to do so
a young man met me when i landed 
he came out from one the huts clothed or
rather half clothed in that careless and slovenly
manner which is very common in hot
slavery 
climates where no eye fashionable observation
watches the proprieties dress he
approached me with a careless air and in a
lounging and somewhat scornful gait he
had much that cunning distrustful look
which distinguishes those who are engaged
in illicit transactions and which is as it
were the last expression the sense 
shame for the cases are few observed the
governor in which men occupied in misdeeds
fail to betray a sense their disgraceful
employment and i have often seen
added he the expression selfcondemnation
even where success and splendid fortunes had
appeared to recompense nefarious transactions

how astonished i was said the captain
when after looking keenly at me for a few
minutes the negrodealer rushed into my
vol ii d 
 minor morals
arms and is it possible he said that
you are come to this abominable and burning
country what curse sends you here 
i looked in his face and i discovered that
he was one my own relations whom
his family had lost sight for many years
he had always been a bold and adventurous
turn and it was believed he had perished
at sea greatly was i astonished at
the meeting he hastily told me the history
 four or five years during these he had
been engaged in the slave and golddust
trade he had become wealthy and i believe
the joy with which he welcomed me
and the eager interest with which he devoured
the news i gave him were most
sincere he asked me the purpose my
visit which was principally to collect elephants
teeth gums ostrich feathers and
slavery 
other african productions in exchange for
those commodities with which my vessel was
laden
he laughed loudly at this and said a man
must be a fool to come to so detestable a
climate for any purpose but that making
as much money as possible the slave
trade he said was the only good thing
left and he recommended me to change my
purpose offering his best assistance and promising
that i should return to europe with
my pockets full gold not grains gold
dust he said such as you can pick out 
your gums or your feathers but solid ounces
and minores which the people savannah
or the brazils will be delighted to shovel
into your hat
but this did not suit my notions morality
 and though i observed that he felt
great contempt for my rejection his brill
mr morals
liant offers i was not disposed to reject ms
civilities and walked with him to the principal
hut
on our way thither he began to tell me 
all the squabbles he had had with the neighbouring
chieftains and the difficulties he
sometimes found to collect a sufficient quantity
 slaves but i will let you into a
secret he said i have lately made a masterstroke
 a capital speculation i have just married
the daughter long tom the mightiest
 all these rascally african coastkings
married said i why you are married
already and have left your wife who now
believes herself to be a widow ignorant as
she and everybody is your existence 
 so much the better then there will be
no harm done i only wish you had been
here a week ago to have been present at the
nuptials you would have seen a pretty set 
slavery 
ceremonies when i was spliced to my blackfaced
spouse long tom's eldest daughter and
heiress who is between us as worthy
as her father is knavish but never fear 
shall get slaves the cheaper and make my
fortune the sooner ah said he laughing
could you but have seen the grand alafou
with his charms and have heard the howls
and the shouts all the black devils that
were present i
you may believe that i was shocked at
this heartless language but it would have
been useless to have expressed what i thought
and felt
 and what do you mean to do with your
african wife inquired i when you leave
the country has she shown any affection
for you will you abandon her 
 a pretty question truly i will not
 minor morals
abandon her i shall take her with me and
sell her 
 an exclamation astonishment fell from
me
 you have a tenderskinned conscience
indeed dont you think long tom's eldest
daughter the black and the beautiful princess
will fetch a good round sum in the martinique
market besides my royal father has
presented me with a superb dowry and i
shall load my next vessel somewhat more
economically than the last come introduce
you to his majesty
he took me to another the huts in a
corner which in a state drunken stupor
lay an old negro grotesquely clad a cocked
hat with a long green feather had fallen off
his head and he was grasping it with his
right hand he wore an old scarlet uniform

the castoff dress an english serjeant
around his waist was a faded golden belt
and his legs were covered with pantaloons 
dirty chintz upon a barrel near him was an
overturned bottle rum a portion which
had been spilt and on the other side was a
scooped half gourd in which was a quantity
 wetted manioc flour which had been
brought in for that meal which had been interrupted
by the ardent spirits the old man
had been swallowing
the old man was in a state too insensible
to notice us so we withdrew together my
companion hardened by his habits and breaking
out into roars laughter at what he
called his majesty's weaknesses and i musing
upon the scene vice misery and folly
which i had been witnessing
 since his majesty is not in a condition
 minor morals
to receive us said lie let us go to the
princess rarara 
he conducted me to her and i confess
i was surprised at seeing a young and graceful
negress prettily ornamented according to the
custom the country who looked upon him
with smiles kindness and through whose
black cheeks i could perceive a blush as he
introduced me to her he had learned the
language the country and having explained
to her that i was his own race and blood
she appeared eager to show me all those
kindnesses which were at her command she
prepared a simple repast fruit and vegetables
and urged me repeatedly to partake
more and more it in the midst this
how was i shocked to hear my companion
exclaim and don't you think i shall obtain
a good price for my ebony log

the next day we returned to visit the
king he looked dull and exhausted with
the debauch the previous day his soninlaw
talked to him somewhat sternly and
seemed to have obtained great authority over
him his wife trembled when he spoke
poor woman said i thine is a cruel
destiny 
i left that part the coast a few days
afterwards
the following year i was at martinique
oiie sunday evening i went to the slave 
dance at st pierre you have heard 
the strange torchlight exhibitions in which
the poor creatures deliver themselves up to a
delirium which is a frightful contrast to the
wretchedness their daily existence while
i was looking on i heard a terrible shriek 
who should be there but rarara she rushed
d
 minor morals
forward she threw herself at my feet which
she wetted with her tears
 can it be you and here said i
 i wife then slave now and her tears
flowed forth afresh
i made inquiry as to what had happened
my relation was living at martinique with
his first wife whose slave rarara had become

i sought the poor african woman to learn
from her own lips some particulars her
condition she said with great simplicity
that her husband's first wife had the first
claim and that she hoped if thewhite wife
died that she should be the second
i confess i was imprudent enough to smile
at the poor woman's credulity and to tell
her that she was indulging a vain and foolish
hope i was deeply interested in her and
slavery 
offered to intercede for lier redemption intending
to restore her to her native land
she shook her head when i proposed it but
did not utter a word
the following sunday i again went to seethe
torchlight dances it appeared to meas
if rarara were absolutely wild with excitement
but whenever it was her turn to come
near me she rushed away as if she had seen
not a friend but an enemy
the next day she was found dead she
had poisoned herself in her despair
swallows
it was an evening may mild and beautiful
the trees clothed in fresh green the
flowers dancing to the gentle winds the air
mild and balmy and the family the towards
were enjoying the delightful season in
the fields
what a pretty bird is the swallow said
edith how busy how swift how irregular
its course 
the proverb which connects its coming
with the summer season is great antiquity
said mr howard and has passed into all
the languages europe one swallow does
swallows 
not make a summer implying that many
swallows do infallibly denote the arrival 
that bright season
has it a song inquired arthur
oh yes said mr howard and sir
humphrey davy declares that he prefers its
music to that the nightingale
it is a most useful bird too said mr
howard for it clears the atmosphere 
thousands small winged insects which
might otherwise cause great annoyance an
observer calculates that wien a female swallow
is seeking food for her young she returns
to the nest more than a hundred times a
day and has generally caught from thirty to
forty insects in every journey which she collects
at the bottom her throat so that a
thousand swallows will in the course ten
days have destroyed between three and four
millions living creatures
 minor morals
are swallows much spoken by ancient
writers papa inquired arthur
frequently and the song is come down
to us which the young people greece were
in the habit singing on the arrival the
swallows when they announced from door
to door their coming and expected some
present or recompense for the good news
in attica the people made it a rule to doit
their winter garments on the appearance 
the swallow they were accustomed to show
themselves at the beginning march while
with us april and sometimes may is the
time their first presence the latin
poets speak frequently the swallow the
house or chimney swallow virgil calls garrulous
from its being a noisy bird
pliny says that they never show preferences
in feeding their young but take each in
turn and are particularly cautious in giving
swallows 
lessons cleanliness by teaching their progeny
to keep their nests free from impurities

the swallow that builds its nest in chimneys
is careful to place it out the reach 
animals prey and generally descends four
or five feet for that purpose those who
have had occasion to watch the training
 the young to mount the orifice have
been struck with the care and anxiety
with which the first attempts are made 
and the task is so laborious and important
that the little bird allows itself a
day's rest either at the top the chimney orin
its immediate neighbourhood as if nature
were exhausted by its first toilsome effort
there it is watched by its parents which show
anxiety for its early flight the brood is conducted
to the branch some not distant
tree or to the roof some adjacent dwelled
minor morals
ing where they are fed in their accustomed
order for three or four days
they are encouraged to further exertions
they are led by their parents to attempt
a bolder flight to try the strength 
their wings and as they fly they are fed
the mother gathers up their food they follow
her not to join in the chase but to
share the spoil she sings she calls each
by turns the order procedure which began
at their birth is still recognised to her
song a chirrup joy responds they are
supplied but are still on the wing there is
no tarrying no stoppage their earnest

swallows 
divers tribes swallows mingle and mingle
without hostility they are in this wiser
than the races men may we not say better 
they associate and combine for common defence
they drive from among them the intruders
 other habits and though their
quarrels are sometimes vivacious they are never
bloody the shanie bloodspilling belongs
to man 
at blois in and a swallow
built its nest on the top a weathercock
it turned round and round as the wind
changed but the work the labourer and
the cares the mother were never disturbed
there was noise there was rocking but
what were they to the swallows people
said their songs were louder and their triumphs
bolder who should reach them in
that seat restlessness there they fixed
their nest and there they hatched their
 minor morals
young and from thence they launched them
into the free heavens
if a sparrow or other intruder get into a
flock swallows the tocsin is sounded and
the zeal with which all the confederates rush
upon the stranger is curious and amusing
they pluck his feathers they drive their bills
into his body they smite and fly beyond all
power retaliation in a word they almost
always succeed in repelling the enemy
the sparrow sometimes annoys the swallow
by taking possession its nest the
sparrow is a lazy bird and a quarrelsome
one and is on all occasions willing to possess
itself the labours others in order
to save its own exertions it thus frequently
seeks to usurp the property the swallow 
hides itself in the nest it has occupied and
presents its sharp beak against the true proprietor
what does the swallow it is the
swallows 
weaker the two and it cannot dislodge
the intruder by violence its wisdom comes
to the aid its physical inferiority it
blockades the sparrow it makes a mud wall
and compels the enemy to surrender by famine
 it calls others to its help and the
fortifications are the work sympathy at
mezieres in france a case occurred in which
the sparrow was completely immured and suffocated
these practices the swallow have
not only been remarked by europeans they
have been recorded by american observers
what becomes the swallow tribes in the
winter season is stir a mystery whether
they wing their way to distant lands or become
dormant in stagnant waters or both is as
yet undecided great authorities line and
cuvier are in favour the latter opinion
temps avril p 
 minor morals
a few certainly remain in our climates per
haps too weak to undertake the long and
weary travels the great family these
abandoned ones come forth when march or
april have a few hot days to invigorate
them it is in consequence their coming
alone and neglected that the proverb has
had its currency which i will give you in
italian for the sake a lesson 
una iodine non fa primavera
if people would watch the habits animals
they would learn much don't you
suppose that even swallows are interested in
one another's happiness indeed they are
i wil give you an example
a gentleman well known in the scientific
world dupont de memoirs mentions in a
paper read before the french institute that
swallows 
as lie was one day passing in the streets 
paris he saw a swallow which in some way
or other had its leg entangled in a string
hanging from the waterspout the college
 the quatre nations the poor bird was
nearly exhausted with fatigue it cried it
struggled it rose as far as it could and was
again and again dragged down by the fetter
which bound it
soon however its companions became acquainted
with its misfortune they gathered
about their captive fellow by tens thousands
 they came from all sides they even
darkened the sky they repeated one to another
their cries distress and pity they
were bewildered with their anxiety and
seemed says the narrator to hold a tumultuous
council as to what was to be attempted
what was to be done
 minor morals
how interesting exclaimed edith but
what could the poor creatures do
you know said mr howard the
fable the mouse and the lion repeated
efforts very little creatures sometimes
produce a very extraordinary result
and the swallows did find the means 
liberating the prisoner
but pray tell us how pray tell us said
edith hastily who was extremely charmed
by the story and who thought to herself
that if she had been a swallow no useful
suggestion would have occurred to her
you would not have been wanting edith
in good will i perceive though you might
not have been much use as a ready counsellor
 but a counsellor was found and the
counsel was adopted and all joined in the
execution
swallows 
a swallow proposed or if it did not propose
it set the example striking the
string on their rapid flight the first swallow
was soon followed by others every one
 which rushed against the string as it
passed and at the same point they came
thicker and thicker faster and faster and
thus for half an hour the string was worn
gradually away at the place which they all
struck and liberty was at last given to the
prisoner
in the peninsula the swallow is considered
a sacred bird as the stork in some other
countries you know that in many parts 
england there is a superstitious affection for
the redbreast i remember i was taught almost
as soon i could speak to say 
the robin and the jennywren
are god almighty's cock and hen
 minor morals
there is in spain an old legend which says
that when jesus was crucified swallows came
and loosened the crown thorns around his
forehead the superstitions that teach humanity
and kindness are the least pernicious 
all and in ignorant nations have often a
most useful influence i should not wonder
if some them had been invented by benevolent
persons who were unable to discover
any means instruction so efficacious
 m moulin from whose charming papers
i have found so much to say about swallows
mentions that while he was travelling on
the borders the orinoco he desired one
 the indians to shoot an urubu a species
 crow that was attacking a lizard which he
wished to possess the indian had been engaged
by him for the purpose shooting
 temps tli aug 
swallows 
wild animals but lie positively refused to
obey if i were to kill that bird he said
the poison my arrow would lose all its
virtue and m moulin adds that he found
all the indians influenced by a similar superstition
in those sultry climates the animal
matter which this bird removes would if left
untouched soon infect the air with noisome
insects perhaps gratitude for the services 
the urubu was the first cause its finding
that protection which it now obtains
i will tell you one more instance a
swallow's thoughtfulness it is mentioned by
kali in the habitation a lady who is
a friend my own two swallows had constructed
their nest the eggs were duly laid
and as duly did the mother attend to them
we were daily expecting the young brood
one day however we saw the male swallow
violently agitated flying in great convol
 e
 minor morals
fusion and embarrassment about the place 
making a great noise and appearing much
distressed it excited our curiosity the servants
 the house mounted a ladder and
found the female swallow dead upon the eggs
they removed her and we watched the conduct
 the male he took possession but
finding himself ill at ease or engaged in an
affair he did not well understand he soon flew
away but returned in the evening with a
female companion who took charge the
nest who hatched the young and showed
them all the attention they could have received
from their natural mother but it is
time to get home my children
so the towards again returned to their
happy dwelling pleased and instructed with
much to think about and much to enjoy in
the recollection the evening's walk
love home
 is it true said arthur to lies father that
the word home or one with a similar meaning
is not to be found in any language but english 
for that is what i have heard said papa 
no my boy answered mr howard
both the word and the thing are to be found
in many other languages and several them
have even a name for that passionate longing
for home which sometimes accompanies the
absent and which may be translated homeache

do you think the love home is equally
strong among all nations 
certainly not nor is it to be wished that
 minor morals
it should be so i have known many people
made unhappy by it and sometimes the prejudice
in favour a particular spot and the
wish to return to it have even destroyed the
desires the powers usefulness in my
travels in denmark i fell in with an icelander
who was exceedingly uncomfortable
because as he told me he had not heard
the winds roar nor seen the ocean rage ashe
was accustomed to do at home he longed
to look upon mount hecla and the bubbling
 the hot springs mud
perhaps said edith they were as dear
to him as the alpine mountains to the swiss
peasant or the green plains to the friesland
or the vast forest to the american savage
true replied mr howard and the
subject brings one or two little circumstances
which you shall hear to my memory
there is a rich and lovely mountain situated
love home 
close to the town ay which is distinguished
for the exquisite champagne wine it produces
it was once an arid and useless surface bringing
forth nothing but a few coarse weeds such asa
chalky rock and a scant and sandy surface
would allow to grow but in progress time
this hill was found singularly adapted to the
cultivation the most luscious grapes and it
has obtained a value equalled perhaps by no
other landed property in europe the whole
bosom the mountain has been turned to the
production the vine and it now bears the
character one vast garden divided and subdivided
into numerous plots ground many
 which are scarcely larger than a large 
 and these again are subdivided
among the children as the parents die the
french law requiring that all property shall
be equally partitioned without any reference
to sex or to earlier or later birth
 minor morals
i have visited this elevated district and was
much struck with its charming appearance
it overlooks the village ay and the river
marne runs slowly and sluggishly through the
valley below close by the town eternal
whose vaults in which the champagne wine is
treasured have obtained a great reputation
as indeed they well deserve for some them
will hold more than a million bottles and
with their sections and intersections are above
a mile in length mr howard described the
care and caution with which the champagne
wine is brought to its marketable shape and
the children where pleased to hear a fact very
honourable to the workpeople employed that
though this attractive and intoxicating beverage
was constantly accessible to them in any quantity
an instance drunkenness had scarcely
ever occurred it is not therefore the presence
 intoxicating beverages which necessarily
love home 
leads to excess but other causes which maybe
found perhaps in the habits the people
the vineyards on the mountain side areas
was mentioned extraordinary value particularly
those which lie between the summit
and the valley that is to say the line which
is to be traced along the middle the hill
where the sun shines with all its brightness 
and where neither the winds which blow over
the higher nor the humidity the lower
regions interfere with the rich products the
vintage season four or five hundred pounds
sterling per acre is not an uncommon price
to pay for this privileged tract land it
is wholly in the hands small proprietors 
scarcely one possessing even to the amount
 an acre and most not a half a quarter
or even a tenth an acre it is almost
intirely cultivated by the hands its owners 
and the attachment shown to the soil the
 minor morals
eagerness with which each one seeks to extend
his little possessions the unwillingness 
children to consent to any arrangement but
the subdivision however small the land 
their fathers are among the striking circumstances
which excited mr howard's attention
to the desire adding something more to
their landed property almost all the distress 
the district may be traced no sooner has the
peasant amassed a small sum money by a
favourable vintage than he immediately sets
about buying new vineyards he is frequently
embarrassed for want capital but rather than
get rid any inch land he has acquired
he borrows money at enormous interest which
he has the greatest difficulty in repaying and
hence is frequently embarrassed not only by
the claims the lender but by the want
 capital to carry on the necessary labours
 his little possessions this want capital
love home 
however is no check to imprudent adventures
though upon the whole the vinegrowing peasants
 champagne must be considered asa
happy race
during the reign the emperor napoleon
the conscription played sad havoc with the
peaceful peasantry champagne torn away
from their native vineyards to carry on wars
in which they had no concern sad were the
scenes their separation and many were the
curses they flung at those who dragged them
from their homes but soon the general feeling
mastered their local attachments and the
champenois became as enthusiastic in favour
 buonaparte as any their fellows after
the wars the oppression and the cruelty 
the conscription were forgotten and the old
soldiers returned to their homes to talk 
laurels and glories and victories the little
corporal as they called the emperor and all
e 
 minor morals
the other dreams the military mania in
france it was to us said mr howard
no little satisfaction to find the turbulent
tumult warfare settled into the peaceful
pursuits vineyard cultivation and nothing
gratified me more than to be called on to notice
an ancient captain who had followed buonaparte
in all his vicissitudes who had helped
to win his battles and who had shared his
defeats now occupied with laborious industry in
the cultivation a small spot vineyard land
which he had inherited from his father he
had been a peasant and had gone forth conquering
and to conquer he had been crowned
with decorations and honours but still he
yearned for the paternal acre to that he
returned and that he now cultivates with his
own hand a labourer in his old age as he
was in his boyhood and deeming himself
supremely happy to be harboured after so
love home 
many troublous voyages in the port from which
he set out
i found in one the districts i have been
speaking said mr howard a singular
example the love home which no ambition
 no love distinction no attraction 
other countries or even their own could
destroy in the minds the champenois 
seven conscripts who had accompanied buonaparte
in his wars only one had perished and
six had returned to their native cottages one
 the six was blind and the other five were
engaged in cultivating with their own hands
the vineyards from which they had been separated
for so many years
i walked with one the vignerons along
that part the hill or coteau as they call it
which produces the most valuable grapes
he possessed only a few feet square but was
in extacies with his possessions he bid me
 minor morals
observe that there was not a weed to be seen
not a vine which was not as much cared for
as if the owner had but one vine in the world
that there were no white grapes in the
whole plot as you know said he the best
white wine is always made from the black
grape he talked his neighbours who
consented to deteriorate their wine by a manure
which he owned greatly increased the
quantity but damaged the quality and blamed
them severely for sacrificing their reputation
to gain he talked his champagne as if
all the world knew its excellence and his
little vine garden which i could have crossed
with a hopskipandajump as if it were 
importance and interest to the whole race 
man he pointed out to me a spot bigger
than his own belonging to a wealthy neighbour
and seemed to think that neighbour
bound to be the most blessed mankind
love home 
and yet i doubt if the vigneron had tasted
his own wine twice in his life if he had it
was probably in the house the merchant
who purchased his grapes it being the custom
 those who are really the makers and
dealers in wine to have the juice extracted by
their own impresses
i remember hearing you say papa said
george that you had seen the same attachment
shown by the weaver lyons to his
loom as you say is shown by the champagne
peasant to his vineyard
 yes i have renown instances where the
loom has been treated like a pet child called
by tender names ornamented with pictures
and inscriptions and its adventures and productions
made as it were the groundwork 
the family history
and you know mamma said edith
with what delight the old sailors whom we
 minor morals
saw on the coast used to talk the ships
in which they had served why they were
as proud them as if they themselves had
built them
just as the driver the mail is his
coach and horses added arthur
it is a very harmless selflove said mr
howard and often a most useful spur to
exertion
 is not champagne a beautiful country
inquired edith
there are some beautiful spots in it
said mr howard and during the vintage
season all the vine districts look busy and
cheerful a great deal has been done 
late years and there are parts where the value
 the lands has increased ten twenty and
even a hundred fold in the last half century 
but generally speaking the surface champagne
is dry and arid you have heard 
love home 
what are called the artificial grasses such
as lucerne colza clover and others their
introduction has been the greatest service
to france and it is pleasant to watch the
progress improvement with the train 
blessings it brings with it for every one
person who enjoyed independence in france
forty years ago there are now a thousand
the appearance the whole country is
changed and so is that the people they
eat better food they wear better garments
their habitations are more comfortable they
have escaped from the vassalage their
feudal lords and i mention these matters to
you my children and talk with you frequently
 foreign countries because i desire
you to feel and to show that you feel a deep
interest in all mankind nations like individuals
return the friendly acts other
nations and their friendly thoughts and cares
 minor morals
the patriotism which teaches hatred is wickedness
and crime the patriotism which
looks with satisfaction on the happiness 
all men is alone virtuous and exalted
 but inquired arthur ought we not
to love england better than france our own
country better than any foreign one 
that my boy you cannot fail doing 
just as you love your own family better than
strangers yet you know that your loving
us is never a reason for hating others and
if you love us you weill desire we should love
you we shall best love you by approving
 your conduct bit we shall not approve 
your conduct if your words and deeds are
those unkindness and ill will to others
the world has been made a miserable world
by shortsighted and mischievous men who
have talked foreigners as natural enemies
all nations are natural friends to
love home 
say nothing what charity and christianity
teach they have a deep interest in each
other's prosperity they cannot do evil to
one another without bringing the evil back
on themselves the policy war is almost
always shallow and miscalculating the certainty
 a vast loss with the remote chance
 a trifling gain
the spirit good is spreading and will
spread it will proceed from individuals to
families from families to communities from
communities to provinces from provinces to
nations i saw an instance the other day a
gentleman arrived from burgundy to study in
champagne the method making their renowned
sparkling wine the people the
last generation leagued together to prevent
his obtaining the information they would not
forsooth communicate their secrets they would
not sacrifice their provinces what were the
 minor morals
people burgundy to the people champagne
yet there was at chains a wise
and a good man he not only exhibited all
he knew to his burgundy visitor but he said
you shall take with you a set my best
workmen to instruct you how to proceed
my children he did no harm to himself far
from it he did himself much service and he
did much good to others i honour that man
and you will honour him and hope that his
conduct will soon become that one nation
to another
commerce
one morning at breakfast mr howard said to
his children now i should like you to tell
me how many nations have contributed to our
breakfast table and then you will see what a
great blessing commerce has been to the world
try if you cannot find something from all the
quarters the globe to begin with 
asia shouted arthur there is tea from
china
africa exclaimed edith there are the
ivory handles from africa
america said george there's the mahogany
 the table from america
 minor morals
and for europe they had twenty things to
speak about
now see if you cannot go another round 
and you edith for africa first
the gold with which the sugar basin is
lined that may be for gold in greater or
less quantities is the produce all the four
quarters the globe but for asia arthur 
coffee is it not mocha coffee mamma
and then there are the table mats which came
you know from calcutta
are the napkins cotton mamma for
that comes from america no george
but linen which is made flax do you
know where the finest flax comes from is
it not from the netherlands yes answered
mr howard but you have not made
your american discovery george
the tea urn is not copper an american
product yes but it is more likely that
commerce 
this copper was furnished by english mines
was his father's answer
oh papa i see america in the scarlet 
the urnrug it must have been dyed with
cochineal perhaps with laclake boy
which is an asiatic production and which has
nearly superseded the use cochineal however
you have answered well
it is not necessary to go on with the
conversation one after another the origin and
adventures the different articles on the
table were traced one topic led to another
and mr howard talked to his children the
effects commerce as a means making
people better and happier
everyone who makes an exchange said
mr howard if he acts wisely obtains something
 greater value than that which he
gives and this is the case with both parties 
each supplies some want or some desire the
 minor morals
oilier tims the two virtues prudence and
benevolence are exercised prudence inasmuch
as an addition is made to your own enjoyment
benevolence inasmuch as an addition is made
to the enjoyment others and the infinite
variety production with which the world
is covered the boundless differences climate
and soil and national habits and education
give to every part the earth some
means exchange with others the exchange
being a mutual benefit some lands have
their riches on the surface others buried deep
below in some agriculture is the great source
 wealth in others manufactures in some
mines in others navigation out their
peculiar facilities commercial relations grow
they are infinitely happier infinitely wealthier
by their intercourse than they could possibly
be by being insulated and separated the
notion every nation being sufficient to itself
commerce 
is as foolish and far more mischievous than
the notion that every individual should be
sufficient to himself it is but selfishness on
a large scale calling itself by some name as
false as fine patriotism for instance or national
independence the dependence 
nations upon one another affords the true
security for peace a nd cimon prosperity
as a wisely calculating selfinterest would add
necessarily to the wellbeing others if it
were only because their wellbeing would increase
our own so a wise and generous
patriotism would see in the strength wealth
felicity and industry another nation a
reason confidence and a subject rejoicing
it is the destiny commerce to undo what
hatred and war have done out the very
selfishness man it will extract benevolence
it will make nationality itself subservient to
philanthropy i know no profession more
minor morals
honourable than that the instructed merchant's
history is the history contributions
to human pleasures he brings nations into
contact which are placed by nature far apart
he brings to the frozen north the productions
 the burning tropics and makes the whole
world contribute to the daily happiness 
every home he has given to the meanest
enjoyments formerly denied to the mightiest
and the portions the world are small and
few which have not been benefited by the
foreign trader into the obscurest villages 
europe asia and america commerce has
penetrated accompanied by its novelties and
its attractions and in the very heart africa
at the court one the petty princes 
the country a french traveller informed me
that he himself had seen very considerable
quantities european manufacture and had
been able to clothe himself as he would have
commerce 
done in london or paris the desire 
gain in itself a laudable and even a virtuous
feeling when controlled by prudence and
kindness is thus by commerce made subservient
to the happiness man but this leads
me to tell you the history a little boy who
became a great merchant
tom traffic was the most active lad 
the small town in which he was born when
sent on an errand nobody ran so fast as he 
nobody rose earlier in the morning nobody
washed and dressed more expeditiously nobody
was more regular at school more sharp
at his lessons or more ready and active at
play everybody liked tom who was brisk
as a bee and playful as a grasshopper his
whistle was well known in the streets and
his hands were always ready to do service to
others
tom was the only child an aged mavol
ii f
 minor morals
river a pensioner whose pittance just enabled
himself to live in decency and tom was
the son his old age for he had married at
the a long service and the boy was born
to him when he had passed sixty years you
may believe he was proud and fond tom
which indeed he was and having little else
to do his time was almost wholly devoted to
the boy he rocked him in his cradle whether
he lay down at morning noon or night 
carried him about in his arms almost wherever
he went as soon as the boy ran alone
the old mariner seemed to grow young again
so did he share in all the boy's sports and
pleasure he taught him to play at marbles
to trundle a hoop to follow my leader in a
word the father was the son's playfellow and
they were a very happy pair
the first time tom had ever known real
sorrow was when his mother died he was
commerce 
then six years old and her death was the
last real sorrow that the old mariner knew
tom's mother had always been an affectionate
mother and did not like her husband the less
for all the care and attention he bestowed on
their only son she told him often that he would
spoil the boy but said so between jest and
earnest but the old mariner's indulgences
were not a sort to do tom any harm
on her deathbed however she said to her
husband you will always be kind to tom 
and to tom she said you will always be
kind to your father she did not speak to
either as if she doubted or as if she meant to
give them lessons which really they did not
need but she spoke as if foretelling that
they would be kind to each other
the living and the dying the poor is
for the most part a short and simple history
duties to the poor as to others come daily to
 minor morals
be done and are as honourable to the poor
who do them as the more influential virtues
 the opulent are honourable to the opulent
through the years in which tom's
mother had managed her little household she
had managed it well and prudently and
when death removed her from her husband
and her child many there were to praise
and none to blame her and no one can
aspire to a higher privilege among survivors
tian this to be thought with nothing but
affection
there was some danger indeed that the
death his mother might have a baneful influence
upon tom in whom all his father's
cares and thoughts were now centred and
who was little disposed to check any his
son's impulses but tom had been gifted by
nature with a happy temper and he did
not give way to unavailing grief such grief
commerce 
would not have brought back his mother and
have only distressed his father so the tears
he shed were soon dried not that he forgot
his mother not that he failed to think 
her and to remember her kindness to him and
her affection for him but he thought that she
herself would not have wished him to be less
busy less useful than before so he indulged
himself in the habit talking about his mother
and though at first the subject was
painful it became by and by the sweetest 
all subjects to him and his father and by
frequently conversing his memory became
impressed with a thousand little circumstances
that he would otherwise have forgotten and
the recollection was a delight to him through
the remainder his life
one day the old mariner said to tom
i am unusually out spirits i have
been thinking my boy what your future
 minor morals
fate may be and that it is time for you
to be thinking about it too for i am growing
old and fear i shall not last long and
i shall not die in peace unless i know that
you have some business and some prospects
in life
now tom had himself often thought 
this for he was nearly twelve years old but
did not like to speak to his father lest he
should give him pain by appearing desirous 
leaving one he loved so well but as his
father now mentioned the matter tom said
father i am glad you have spoken this
if i knew your wishes perhaps i might be
doing something to fit myself for some honest
trade
the old man hoped tom would have
hinted at some line life that he preferred
and tom wished that his father should speak
out their thoughts and wishes were in
commerce 
deed the same but each feared to suggest
what might be unacceptable to the other
 when you were at sea said tom did
you ever carry on any trade with the natives
 foreign countries the inquiry showed the
bent tom's mind and the old mariner answered
 oh yes my boy and have turned
many an honest penny in that way should
you like to go to sea tom indeed should
i if i could establish a little business with the
natives distant countries
after this the subject was often talked
 and the old man told tom how barter was
conducted with people various lands he
taught him too all he knew the art 
navigation explained to him as far as he
was able the trade winds and the ocean currents
and the equinoctial gales he loved to
recount the dangers he had seen and the risks
he had run he spoke the different moneys
used in different countries and taught tom
 minor morals
many a foreign word wmcli lie had picked
up when abroad tom listened with great
attention and stored in his mind everything
that was likely to be useful and his father's
conversation became more and more interesting
as it became more and more instructive
sometimes indeed the old man felt
that by these conversations he was preparing
tom for his early departure and even when
tom was most excited by an account the
way in which when a young sailor he had
exchanged with a naked negro a string 
beads for a noisy parrot the old man suddenly
stopped he thought dangerous climates
and the shipmates he had buried on the
african coast he stopped suddenly and told
tom that he would the story some other
day
 a short time after this while tom was reading
to his father from the bible as he was used
to do the old man's face grew pale and he fell
jc crojc
commerce 
back in his chair tom fanned his cheeks with
the he held in his hand and after a few
minutes his father was able to say faintly and
feebly to bed tom to bed tom helped
him in ran to the neighbours for help but
soon perceived by their countenances that
matters were in a sad way and so indeed
they were the old mariner became speechless 
once he stretched his hand to tom tom
seized it and kissed it in a few hours the
mariner was dead in a few days his body
was laid in the churchyard by the side his
wife and a small white gravestone was raised
over it on which tom had roughly engraved
with his own hands the initials his father's
and his mother's name
tom had many friends they came and
offered their services and would have kept him
among them but tom's thoughts were wandering
through the wide world the neighed

 minor morals
hours bought the little furniture at its value
for tom told them he had determined to seek
his fortune afar off about eight or nine pounds
he received for the small possessions his
parents he said to himself i hope the people
will not forget me if i should come back again 
i have nothing now left me to care for the
wind may blow from the quarter it will all
ports are alike to me tom paid one visit
to his parents grave it was then he took leave
 the place his birth
he went to liverpool and lost no time in
inquiring out a respectable shipbroker to
whom he told his short but simple story it
was his good luck to fall in with a kindhearted
and clever man who said he would give him a
berth on a vessel bound for the coast africa
tom remembered how suddenly his father had
stopped when telling him his own african
adventures but tom was not superstitious the
commerce 
climate he said he did not fear the bargain was
made tom felt as if his life and history were
now begun and as the kind shipbroker had
offered to assist him in investing his little
capital tom fancied himself the luckiest ashe
was then one the proudest mortals
on the voyage tom obtained the good
opinion the captain and the confidence 
all the crew the adventure was successful
and when he arrived in england he had
doubled his wealth he had got experience
too and as the vessel was to return to africa
tom's observations were great value to the
shipbroker and to the owners to whom the
captain had reported the cleverness and activity
 young tom
tom remained on board the vessel during
three voyages he was now nearly nineteen
years old and his fortune was accumulated to
somewhat more than a favourite with
 minor morals
everybody because willing to be a friend to
everybody there was nobody on board whose
good fortune was witnessed with so much pleasure
on returning from the third voyage the
captain told tom that the owner had been
talking him that he desired to see him and
he believed would make to him an agreeable
communication tom went it was at the time
when the supplies timber were checked by
the war and the merchant after many inquiries
about tom's success reminded him that he had
once spoken the vast forests on the shores 
the african rivers and expressed an opinion
that the negroes might be induced to fell the
trees and barter them with europeans the
idea has often occurred again to my mind
said the merchant and if you still think so
we will make the experiment we will find
ships and capital and you shall have an interest
in it in truth it was a favourite project 
commerce 
tom's he was delighted to see it adopted
and soon after a vessel was fitted out which
tom had the charge
 he sailed for africa and i have often heard
tom describe the toil and trouble which it cost
him to teach the africans how best to fell and
saw the trees and bring them to the river's
edge but tom succeeded and the speculation
succeeded at first only a few straggling
blacks came to cut down the forest trees but
as they were liberally recompensed they afterwards
came in great numbers and built their
huts in the neighbourhood the place where
tom fixed his own habitation and where he
dwelt for many years the trade became a
very large one and tom dwelt like a prince
surrounded by his subjects he taught them
many arts and reclaimed them from many
barbarous and savage habits he administered
justice among them settled their misunder
 minor morals
standings and though so young was always
called by them their father
 six years tom lived in africa he had become
wealthy and the desire to revisit his
native country grew stronger and stronger
he fancied too that he was beginning to feel
the effects the climate so having made
arrangements for supplying his place he returned
to england and visited the spot where
he had seen his father and mother buried
he ordered the grave to be surrounded with
iron railings and a stone to be erected to the
memory his parents with their names and
ages at length but he would not allow the
stone to be removed on which he himself had
cut the first letters their names
ait is the beginning a successful career
that is most difficult not its progress mr
thomas traffic is still living a rich and
honourable merchant and magistrate he
commerce ill
has not forgotten nor is lie likely to forget
that he was the son a poor old mariner
he often speaks it not for the purposes
 pride and parade but for the encouragement
 others and the young especially
showing them that they must learn to conquer
difficulty and that those who endeavour
to gain the good opinion and confidence 
others seldom fail to obtain them
fishes and friendly
counsels
did you ever wateli the graceful motion 
the joyous activity the rapid gliding a trout
or grayling in the stream did you ever
see it showing its various tints beauty to
the sun resting for a few moments and then
darting away like an arrow as if it had detected
you intruding upon its privacy like
a vain person delighted to have an opportunity
 exhibiting a mock modesty
standing by the side one the fishponds
in the tuileries i was amused by the
exhibition various character which the gold
fishes displayed among themselves for not
fishes and friendly counsels 
only were the gravity age and the levity
 youth easily distinguishable but it appeared
to me very obvious that every fish had some
peculiar qualities whose union was called idiosyncracy
by the greeks which gave it individuality
i fancied that i could trace something
 those different dispositions which we call
vice and virtue in that society was there
not something to be studied something to be
learned 
peace was there no one the community
seemed willing to injure another their disputes
were not settled by violence even in
the competition for the food that was sometimes
scattered on the surface or floating in
the water or buried in the deep beneath 
there was no hostility no war the success
 one did not disturb the good humour 
the rest
virtue was there for what is virtue but the
exhibition and exercise virtuous qualities
 minor morals
prudence was there employing wisely all its
little means and benevolence was there for
i observed again and again that a gold fish
shared with its neighbour a common fare
happiness was there happiness the best
 all happiness sportive vigorous multiform
it could be seen in every motion
whether fin or frame even the caprices
 the little creatures seemed to be the result
 joy they sprang forward like a ray 
light then suddenly rested then darted off
in another direction sometimes they moved
on as slowly through the water as moved
the swan upon its surface at other times they
fled as rapidly as the swallows that dipped
their wings in the ripples above
a distinguished poet fancied that the
flowers might have their affections and passions
so he wrote a in which he describes their
loves do you know his name edith
was it not dr darwin
fishes and friendly counsels 
 yes and he introduced into lies poem a
great deal natural philosophy and knowledge
 many kinds and set i have no
doubt many persons thinking on account 
the oddity his subject
i remember said george that there is
a passage in it which has been called prophetic
because it speaks the wonderful results 
steam which were then hardly dreamed 
but have now been realised
now if flowers can be fancied to have
private and social feelings don't you think
that fishes may with far more justice
 i think so indeed said arthur
well then mr howard continued fll
tell you a sort a fancy that passed through
my mind while i was standing on the verge
 the fishponds in the tuileries gardens
i fancied i was the personification 
friendship in two gold fishes about an
 minor morals
equal size one which was gaudily painted
with scarlet was exceedingly active and lively
while its companion was distinguished by hues
far less bright and swam through the water
with staid and sober gravity
i watched them and saw the scarlet fish
dash among its many companions splash
about in the water with extraordinary friskiness
 stop now for an instant to communicate
with one or other the other gold fishes 
and then return in a hurryskurry topsyturvy
course to its more sedate friend
 methought i overheard the conversation that
passed between them my imagination gave
the fishes names the one was laetus the
other placid
 what a strange fancy laetus is thine 
to be everlastingly bustling about always occupied
with the concerns others thou
canst not pass by a neighbour without a greetfishes
and friendly counsels 
ing and however important the subject on
which thou art engaged off thou hurries
whenever an excuse for interruption can be
found
 why really i don't think thou placid
art less interested than i am in the wellbeing
 our neighbours only thou hast the art 
not appearing so much interested
 not quite so dear lsetus there are many
subjects in which i take no interest at all
they don't concern me in the least and too
much curiosity may be sometimes annoying
to those who are the objects it
 don't be so vague placidusus i can bear
a little more frankness
 well then yesterday our friend venustus
rose to the surface and seized a delicate bit
which he hurried away with and hid himself
behind the lotus leaf thou knowest venustus
is a dainty feeder and fond solitary
 minor morals
meals thou couldst not leave mm to his
habits i know thou didst not mean to do
him any mischief but he told us afterwards
he could have loved thee much better hadst
thou allowed him to enjoy his privacy and i
mention this because i am sure venustus is
much too courteous and urbane to mention it
himself
 indeed i never thought it said lsetus
and much obliged am i for thy hint
which i will not forget in the future and
now i pray thee give me some other instances
 my infirmity
 thou art in such a beautiful humour
lsetus that i will even avail myself it to
unbosom more my thoughts and observations
i am sure thou wilt not take them
amiss
 no kind placidusus but gratefully welcome
them
fishes and friendly counsels 
 listen then last evening thou wert
flying as it is thy usage through the water
not thinking i am assured doing anybody
any harm and thou rushed heedlessly
against old canus whom thou didst so violently
shake that he complained sadly this
morning an intolerable pain in the fins i
need not tell thee the poor fellow is nearly
blind so he knew not whose want care it
was that had aggrieved him but he said he
thought some explanation was due that he
should have been very willing to forgive but
that whoever had done the mischief had scampered
away in perfect indifference i was
told it was thou lsetus and those who told
me and who were lookers on animadverted
rather sharply on what they called thy
cruelty i said they were wrong in turn that
it was only thy carelessness
 indeed indeed it was nothing worse
 minor morals
and i will instantly go and apologize to the
poor old canus and round did lsetus turn
his rudder tail in order to visit the hoary
gold fish
 precipitate always said placidusus with
an expression that would have been a smile
if fishes could smile thou wilt find time
for canus by and by but thou art in so
virtuous a mood that thou hadst better listen
a little longer to my moralising
 be it so be it so placidusus with such
a teacher i shall be well taught but let me
ask thee a question was i not very useful
to improved when he was wounded on
the back by the pebble which the boy threw
at him so wickedly 
 useful yes but less useful than thou
lightest have been for he was rather wearied
with thy too many attentions he wanted
rest he wanted quiet thy excess kindfishes
and friendly counsels 
ness was an annoyance a little less kindness
aid attention would have been more acceptable
i know thy motives were good but neither
fishes nor men care much about motives
they see actions and feel their consequences
and by the consequences actions they judge
they recompense they condemn
 go on placidusus hast thou any other
accusation against me 
 remember lsetus i am not accusing 
i am narrating dost know thou didst disturb
a friend ours in his meditations
yesterday 
 oh said lsetus that was socius
but he was in such a melancholy mood that
it was but kindness to rouse him
 true if the disturbance did not make
the matter worse as thine did for thou didst
vex him sorely and he fell into gloomier
musings than before

but continued mr howard while i
was figuring or fancying these conversations
between the golden fishes i heard the trampling
 horses the drums and trumpets were
approaching and the sight ten or fifteen
thousand troops filled my mind with far different
thoughts from those with which i had
been occupied
war
the troops were escorting the king to the
chamber deputies i followed them thither
and sat in the tribune listening to the debates
i heard an orator eulogize one his countrymen
by saying his was the noble baptism
 blood the words were received with
unqualified admiration the sentiment and the
phrase seemed equally acceptable to the representatives
 france
baptism blood what a thrilling expression
 said edith
and to call it noble too what an idea
responded arthur
 minor morals
and to think added george that a large
assembly should not only not disapprove but
show signs satisfaction 
but notwithstanding my children i you
must not be too hasty in judging another
nation words have frequently a meaning
which is not rendered by translation in the
mind the orator there was perhaps no other
thought than that with which hundreds thousands
 englishmen would speak trafalgar
or waterloo the ideas glory and victory
the exhibitions power absorb the mind and
throw all the misery and crime and folly
which accompany war into the shade thus
it is that if we employed words more fitting
the occasion we should sooner reform opinion
but the mischief is wide and deep which grows
out improperly chosen words
respect for human life is one the greatest
evidences improvement and civilization
war 
death is really a solemn thing because it is
the destruction all those pleasures and pains
 which the living are susceptible if it be
vicious to inflict unnecessary suffering or to
prevent possible enjoyment the extinction 
all the sources suffering and enjoyment by
violence must when unjustifiable be the
heaviest all offences war would be impossible
if the value and the sacredness life
where fitly estimated it would be found that a
justification for such a sacrifice as war brings
with it is really and in the nature things
almost impossible that until every conceivable
means discussion debate inquiry forbearance
generosity had been wholly exhausted
until no shadow a chance remained for peaceful
and pacific arrangement no excuse could
be sufficient for venturing upon the vast ocean
 miseries which national hostility creates
strolling over the scenes the late riots
 minor morals
 paris i tarried before the house in the rue
transnonain where many persons had been
killed and i was curious to hear the observations
 the people who were gathered
in groups recounting to one another the
horrors the day i observed that the
observation most general among them was
that french blood had been shed many
said if it had only been the blood 
foreigners i was struck with the mingling
 nationality and philanthropy philanthropy
which had abundant sympathy for the sufferings
 the people to which it belonged but which
seemed anxious to exclude every body else
from its benevolence and i thought again
as i had often thought before on the wretched
education which nations receive how the field
 brotherhood is narrowed how all sentiments
 beneficence are chilled and contracted by
the influences war 
war 
nations that are accustomed to hold life in
little value and who employ barbarous punishments
as a means terror are invariably addicted
to cruelty in china for example
infanticide is not considered a crime and murder
in all its forms is habitual and constant
occurrence yet there is no country that
employs such a variety tortures as instruments
 legislation there are volumes upon
volumes which represent the penal inflictions 
the chinese laws and ingenuity itself seems
almost exhausted in the countless shapes 
misery which men have thus invented for subjecting
others to agony a friend mine
who in a voyage round the world landed at a
chinese town in the yellow sea told me that
he had witnessed the punishment a parricide
who eighteen years before had destroyed his
father and the exhibition he saw was the
seventeenth to which the murderer had been
 minor morals
exposed his sentence condemned him to
solitary confinement to nakedness to the deprivation
 light his food was let down from
a hole through the top the cell where he was
immured and his hair beard and nails were
left to grow on the anniversary the murder
he was dragged forth a horrible object
and exposed for a day in a barrel blood on
a public stage he was compelled to feed himself
with rice drenched in the blood which wa
forced into his throat by the executioner if
he refused to eat seventeen times he had
undergone the punishment and there was
scarcely left about him a single fragment 
humanity this was horrible enough but the
effect was far different from that which was no
doubt intended by the legislature the extravagance
 the suffering had merely gratified
the sufferer while the effect upon the spectators
was by no means salutary
war 
how impossible would such inflictions become
if men had any sentiment the value
 pain and pleasure if they weighed them
in the balance as being worthy their
anxiety if they determined to waste none
 them but to employ them to some good
 i tell you the story children as i
heard it as a striking example illjudged
punishment happy for you happy for us
to have been born in a better country and
under the protection more beneficent
laws 
 lived continued mr howard in the
spanish peninsula during the war independence
nobody who had not witnessed
the frightful reality could form an idea 
all the sufferings created by longenduring
hostilities i have passed through villages
almost wholly deserted so deserted that no
living being was to be seen but some poor

among the ruins often and often have i
looked in the distance on splendid mansions
and on drawing near have found them unroofed

 i entered st sebastian after the siege
you know how long and obstinate was the
resistance the garrison it was taken bystorm
and i followed the conquering army
the road by which they entered was strewed
with dead there was a stream flowing at
the bottom the citadel and it was almost
stopped by mutilated corpses but when
we reached the breach the sight was horrible 
shattered limbs broken muskets slices 
human flesh fragments garments were
spread about in horrible confusion we entered
the town it had been set on fire by
the infuriated combatants we saw the dead
war 
lying under the walls which had fallen on
them their hands frequently exposed grasping
in their deathagony the earth beneath
them there was a dead mother with a
living child on her bosom it was a scene
 revelry and horror drunkenness and
death noise and fearful silence ferocity
and fear madness and misery i
was sick and weary scenes which i have
since heard honoured as glorious but after
the first frenzy was over when the eye
looked round on the ruin and the devastation
 nobody would venture to talk the
glory so frightful a catastrophe the
tale mischief the story destruction
i made my way to the house a respectable
goldsmith in the town the soldiery
had broken into it they met the
mother the family at the top the stair
and brutally knocked her down from the sum

mit to the doorsill she was nearly killed
by the wounds she received with my own
ears i heard her lips tell the terrible story
atrocities far worse than this i witnessed 
and they have been justified by warriors 
and they form part the natural and necessary
results war war all plagues the
most pestilential the most prolific war
compared to which all other crimes are small 
all other follies trifling war the opprobrium
 humanity the scandal religion war
the perpetual insult to man's brotherhood and
god's paternity my children i hope the
time is at hand in which it will be as impossible
to league men to destroy as it would
be to devour one another if the sufferings
caused if the blood spilt in useless and
wicked conflicts could be made present to
many a thoughtless one who has never dreamed
 the price paid for that delusion which
war 
is called victory i am sure the feelings 
delight would soon be changed into those 
disgust and instead turning with granulation
to the history destruction the eye
would be offended and the heart wounded
by the contemplation so much frenzy and
so much crime
one day remembering what i had seen
i wrote the following lines which you may
commit to your memories 
children i was a traveller once
before i was a man
and went to see a town besieg'd 
twas st sebastian 
there was a field pd often cross'd
adorn'd with poppies red 
i pass'd it it was red with blood
and garments the dead 
there was a stream i oft had heard
run singingly along 
twas choaked with corpses and in vain
i listen'd for its song
 minor morals
there was a cottage oft had i
enjoy'd its homely fare 
then some charred beams and ashes black
were all i witness'd there
there was a garden in its walks
oft had i mus'd alone 
the gates the fences were destroy d 
its flowers its shrubs were gone 
i had seen many a happy dance
heard many a cheerful word 
then nought but misery could i see
and nought but misery heard 
my children happy happy ye
from such sad scenes afar 
and know ye what such mischief did 
such ruin caus'd twas war
my children man on earth below
with sin and shame is curst 
but all sin and shame my dears 
that horrid war s the worst 
sense and sensitiveness
what a shocking thing it is to see misery
that we cannot relieve said edith to her
mamma one day as a poor cripple passed
before the door what a shocking thing it
is that there should be so many sufferings for
which there is no relief is it right mamma
to accustom ourselves to look at pain and
sorrow is it most likely to harden the heart
or to improve it 
my love the state which is most likely
to lead to proper and to virtuous conduct is
that where the desire to be useful is not interfered
with by a susceptibility which deprives
us the power active exertion
 minor morals
some people are so sensitive that they lose
the very means doing good others so
careless that the disposition to do good is
almost extinguished one defect is nearly as
bad as the other but there is more misery
caused by that foolish agitation which makes
a person helpless than even by the hardheartedness
which turns away with indifference
they are alike useless to the sufferer 
but in the case the oversensitive their
own misery is to be added fidgety people
are very mischievous they make matters worse
to others and are a perpetual annoyance to
themselves
i have known persons who as if they had
not real annoyances enough were always on
the lookout for vexations and grievances attributing
all events to the most unfavourable
and irritating cause if an answer does not
come to a letter it is sheer neglect if a
sense and sensitiveness 
visit is not returned it is an intended slight
if an observation is made it is to prevent
them from speaking if a person is silent
it is because he has no regard for them if a
joke is uttered it is construed into a matter
 grave offence and if serious words are
spoken they are not intended to be sincere
and now i will give you two characters
and you shall choose which you like for your
model an old lady whose delight and habit
it was to make everything sweet and an old
gentleman the business whose life it was
to turn everything sour
they lived in the same village its name
was briony the gentleman was mr thaddeus
tarte the lady was mrs margaret
manna they were as unlike one another as
they could well be but being the principal
people briony they often met and as
mrs manna was the only person whom mr
 minor morals
tarte never succeeded in driving into a passion
she was frequently favoured with his
visits he had such a love for wrangling
and jarring that he was sometimes in a rage
because he could not make mrs manna angry
he often stormed against this person and the
other and was vexed and waspish because
mrs manna would not agree with him he
sometimes said he would never go to her
house again for that she cared nothing about
his opinions and would not blame the most
blameable things but mrs manna was singularly
indulgent to mr tarte with others
she would be sprightly and sportive because
she knew they could bear it and would not
misunderstand it she never made experiments
on mr tarte's illtemper she put a
double check upon every expression when
mr tarte was at hand i do not mean to
say that mr tarte had or could have all the
sense and sensitiveness 
benefit which the conversation an amiable
and instructed woman would have conveyed
had he allowed her spirits and friendly habits
full play and had she not perceived how
eagerly he sought every occasion to misconstrue
the meanings other people it is
possible to tolerate it is possible to disarm
the illnatured but it is not easy to love them
they must pay the penalty their disagreeableness
but because they are disagreeable
we have no right to be uncourteous or uncivil
it was a wet and windy day in april when
mr tarte put on his great coat took his
stick in his hand and went forth to make a
morning call on mrs manna the weather
which was a little like the temper 
his mind cold stormy and gloomy had put
him particularly out humour and so off he
went to vent his spite upon his goodnatured
neighbour a pretty intrusion you will say 
 minor morals
and so indeed it was which nothing but the
excellent temper mrs manna would have
made tolerable
he knocked at the door as the servant did
not immediately open it new fuel was added
to his discontent he knocked violently a second
time the servant came running to let
him in i beg your pardon sir but i was
in a distant part the house when i heard
your first knock allow me to take your coat
into the kitchen to dry yes said mr
tarte you were attending to anything
but your business a pretty thing to keep
people drenched and drowning in the street
i shall mention your inattention to your mistress
there and so saying mr thaddeus
tarte threw his coat on the balustrade
without paying any attention to the man's
civility and followed him into the craving

sense and sensitiveness 
mrs manna was then turning over the
leaves an annual obviously much delighted
with the succession beautiful engravings
which she found in it
 madam said mr tarte good morning
sir responded mrs manna madam 
repeated mr tarte very stiffly i told your
servant i should mention his incivility it is
high time that such carelessness should be
noticed i hope madam in charity to your
visitors you will require your man to be a
little more on the alert i hope said
mrs manna thomas has not been wanting
in civility towards you he is generally
so very attentive yes madam so civil
and attentive as to leave me to be soaked
through and through by this abominable
rain knocking knocking and not able to
get in
 i am sure thomas could not have in
 minor morals
tended it intended it or not said mr
tarte so it was but in truth replied
mrs manna the fault is mine i sent him
to the garret and forgot to desire one 
the women to attend to the door what
detestable weather exclaimed mr tarte
but seasonable and useful responded mrs
manna no madam such disagreeable and
violent storms are never seasonable i see
no reason in the world why if we are to
have rain it should come overwhelming us
like a deluge mrs manna was about to
answer with some animadversion for to her
mind nothing was a more irresistible evidence
 the foresight and the benevolence
 the divine being than the orderly and
regular distribution the seasons to each
its task good is committed by each in
turn is it fulfilled thus to the humid spring
belongs the calling forth the buds and the
sense and sensitiveness 
flowers and the fruits to summer and
autumn and mrs manna lead been just
thinking the beneficial influences storms
and showers when any remarks were made
in her presence which seemed to impugn the
kindness or the wisdom providence her
mind received a painful shock yet she felt
this did not warrant her being out humour
 so she made no answer whatever to
mr tarte's observation thinking some fitter
occasion might occur for communicating her
opinions she introduced other subjects there
were one or two on which mr tarte liked to
dilate he was fond fishing and loved
to talk his fishing exploits and in the
course the conversation he dropped the
word that this fall rain would induce him
to go out angling on the morrow mrs manna
smiled as he spoke and mr tarte who was
half disposed to take the smile amiss behaved
 minor morals
prudently for once and even said thank
you to thomas as he brought him his greatcoat
warm from the kitchen fire and put
into his hands the umbrella neatly folded
and dried the rain was over above the
village church a rainbow hung one 
which was lost in the blue heaven the
sloping street the village had been washed
clean by the storm and mr tarte as he
ruminated upon the sport the next day
recollected too with how much discontent
he had spoken the deluge and its disagreeable
alas all these impressions were
transitory mr tarte had the habit discontent
 and a most melancholy habit it is
my children 
another day it was at the the
summer season when the trees begin to put
on their brown garments and to shake off
their leaves mrs manna was walking by
sense and sensitiveness 
the side a stream that ran close to the
village and she discovered mr tarte seated
upon a bank with his shirtfrill ruffled his
hat off his gloves and stick at some distance
from him and looking more than usually discomposed
her first impression was to turn
back and not subject herself to be annoyed
by his peevishness but on second thoughts
she determined to accost him because as he
had probably seen her approach he might
be offended by her sudden retreat and as it
was her general habit to walk by the bank
where mr tarte was now exhibiting his illhumour
mr tarte would be more likely to
notice her conduct so she advanced with a
quiet step and taking no notice whatever 
mr tarte's embarrassment said she had
been delighted with her evening's walk
so have not i with mine madam responded
mr tarte stretching out one hand
vol ii h 
 minor morals
to gather np his stick and gloves while with
the other he buttoned up his waistcoat and
then took a handkerchief from his pocket
and wiped his forehead dry mrs manna
waited to hear some terrible grievance and
found that the amount the mischief was
merely this that mr tarte had stumbled
over a stone and fell but he said he could
have borne this it was a common accident
had he not reason to believe that the whole
was a plot some mischievous boys to annoy
him for when he was on the ground
he heard some young scoundrels cry out
well done old taddy tarte and they
burst into loud laughter and clapped their
hands with delight the subject mr
tarte's meditations while on the bank was
how he could revenge himself on the boys he
first thought following them and punishing
them with a hearty drubbing but he found
sense and sensitiveness 
they could run faster than he then he would
go to the village school and obtain for them
a handsome flogging from the master but as
far as he could distinguish them they did not
belong to the school what was to be done 
for punished they should be
the truth was that mr tarte who was
called old taddy tarte by all the young people
 the village was an object no little dislike
he was so much in the habit interfering
with the sports and checking the enjoyments
 the children he was so spare in his praises
so severe in his animadversions that they
were always rather pleased when anything
with him went wrong if his hen roost were
robbed well tis a good thing twas old
taddy sj they said if his chimney were on
fire better old taddy's than mrs manna's
was the exclamation once when returning
home late his foot slipped and he rolled
 minor morals
into the gutter and reached his house covered
with mud the accident was a subject 
universal mirth and i am afraid almost
universal satisfaction
but was this right asked edith who was
also desirous learning what duty required
and who was far too kind and generous to
rejoice in any human being's misfortune
oh no love it was very wrong but it
was inevitable restrain our own feelings as
we may there will be always too many in the
world to feel pleasure in the misfortunes 
those whom they dislike and if there were
no other and better means checking the evil
dispositions others it would be right to use
these means but a sufficient reason against
using them is that they are not the best means
however mr taddy had mistaken the matter
 the boys had really nothing to do with
the accident the stone had not been put in
sense and sensitiveness 
the middle the road by them it had fallen
accidentally out a pavior's cart and the whole
amount the blame due to the boys was their
having laughed at old taddy
now mrs manna was just as much an
object affection in the village as mr tarte
was dislike every body from youngest
to eldest was delighted to do her a service
it was the natural consequence her constant
habit doing services to others
she endeavoured but in vain to pacify
mr tarte he was determined that he would
not be induced to consider the whole affair as
anything but a premeditated insult at first
and a wicked mockery afterwards mrs manna
found there was no use in arguing against a
man whom nothing could convince she did
not however utter an angry word but continued
her walk by the banks the stream
as she walked a dog sprung out a
 minor morals
farmyard and ran towards her barking as if
it meant to bite her two boys followed the
dog one them seized him by the collar
and the other said it is not old taddy tarte
he must not hurt the lady mrs manna
looked the urchin in the face who said to her
laughingly it shan't touch you madam we
thought old taddy was coming this way and
we meant to frighten him and why
said mrs manna oh ma'am he is such
an illnatured old fellow we were coming
along the road and saw him fall over a stone
and we could not help laughing he was in
such a passion and then he began to abuse
us and said we had put the stone there for
the very purpose throwing him down and
when we said we did not he only got the more
angry and so we ran away and determined
that if he came this way we would frighten
him with the dog and that's the whole truth
sense and sensitiveness 
ma'am for we would not tell you anything
but the truth
 but you would please me much better
said mrs manna if you would behave differently
to old mr tarte you should not have
laughed at him because he had the misfortune
to fall but rather have offered to be any
use to him and if you had done so kindly he
would certainly not have thought that you
were the cause the accident and you would
not have required a lesson from me you know
she said with a smile
a lady's smile has a great charm in it 
and if ladies knew how to use their smiles
prudently and benevolently i do not know
what wonders edith might not be worked in
the world
the boys both said no ma'am we
would not do anything to vex you very
well then you always vex me when you annoy
 minor morals
mrtarte and when she said this the boys
scampered away shouting we shan't forget 
we shan't forget 
it was not very long after that mr tarte
was walking through the village and he
fancied he recognized one the boys who
had been laughing at him he determined
not to appear to notice the boy thinking that
if he were the guilty person he would again
misbehave himself and mr tarte had made
up his mind to learn who the boy was and to
get his father or his master to punish him
the boy was one the two to whom mrs
manna had spoken a warmhearted and
a generous boy and a brave one too the
boy expected that mr tarte would notice him 
he thought even that he should get a blow
over his shoulders from mr tarte's cane but
as mr tarte passed the boy made a bow
this astonished mr tarte who said to him
sense and sensitiveness 
was it not you who behaved so ill to me
the other day was it not you who laughed
at me when i fell yes sir said the boy
and i wish i had not done so why
my good boy said mr tarte who was much
struck with the manly frankness the lad
why sir because i do not believe you are
so illnatured as i thought and besides mrs
manna desired i would not vex you and i
won't vex you again if you'll not be angry
with me for doing so before not i said
mr tarte give me your hand my boy
and i think i have learnt a lesson as well as
you
the habit had been too long indulged by
mr tarte to enable him to get completely
ri his querulous disposition but it was
moderated and soon after his conversation with
the boy he called on mrs manna
thomas came to the door and was not a
h 
 minor morals
little surprised to hear the very gracious tones
in which mr tarte addressed him it was
a new thing indeed for mr tarte to speak to
any servant dth courtesy not that mr tarte
really desired to show his scorn or pride or
ill humour but a certain severity manner
had become almost a part his nature and
very very difficult it was to restrain it
 did he learn to restrain it mamma
asked edith
not wholly edith for as i mentioned
his temper would frequently get the better
 his intentions but he found it was quite
for his interest to check himself and he often
had to do so
did mrs manna ever compliment him
on his improvement mamma
never dear by any direct observation
upon it as that might have hurt his selflove
but mr tarte was not insensible that mrs
sense and sensitiveness 
manna had perceived a change his visits
were more frequent and they were never
disturbed as thes used to be by outbreaks 
bad humour
mushroomhunting
in russia said mr howard to the children
after a ramble in the country a great number
 species mushrooms are used for food
in england little attention is paid to this
curious fungus
their collection would not alone be a
source pleasure but the study their
different characters would be useful instructive
and even profitable
some them are delicious others dangerous
to eat some pleasing to the palate
and others absolutely poisonous
i have seen a pretty written by a
french author m rogues in which he 

scribes a great variety mushrooms and
instructs his readers to distinguish the wholesome
from the deleterious
he shows for the use the poor in times
 famine or when the price food is verydear
that large quantities vegetable fungi
may be collected which will be found nutritive
and excellent nourishment but m
rogues's costs twentyfour francs which
is one pound sterling how should such a
 reach the poor 
if a man were bent on doings a useful
thing he could hardly find one more useful
than to write and circulate a small volume
on the means obtaining cheap food
nature has done far more for man than man
has yet discovered and all his discoveries in
one part the world have not reached other
parts old and foolish prejudices have prevented
many improvements some nations
 minor morals
that will not eat a hare have no objection
to snakes and serpents others that will
not touch a pig will devour frogs or snails
our habits create strange prejudices and our
prejudices perpetuate themselves from one generation
to another if wee could but accustom
ourselves to reason how very different
an estimate should we form on thousands 
matters 
there lived in the neighbourhood moscow
a family serfs which had obtained
from their lord the permission to gather
mushrooms and to take them to the ochotnoi
iliad which is the great market the russian
capital
 obtained from their lord inquired
edith what does that mean 
in russia said mr howard there
are many millions serfs or peasants who
are considered the property their feudal
mushroomhunting 
master they cannot indeed be removed
from the soil on which they were born but
they are sold as the trees or the cattle there
they cannot possess property and even
their little gains are not their own but may
at any time be taken possession by their
lords those lords are sometimes humane
enough to allow them to get money by their
industry and there are among them some
who make it their pride and boast that they
possess slaves whom they can call opulent
but now to our story
 the busiest and the cleverest the
serf family was a young girl called 
she had learnt little for it is very
seldom that learning enters the logbuilt cottages
 the russian peasants but nature
had given her an active mind and she had
always taken a sort pleasure in mushroomgathering
when very young she used to
 minor morals
request her father to put her into the talega
or little cart in which he carried his mushrooms
to the ochotnoi read and amused herself
often for which she sometimes got well
scolded in separating the different sorts 
mushrooms more carefully than her father
had been used to do
one day in coming home from the
market her father said that he had sold his
mushrooms more easily and the price he
asked was more willingly paid than usual
for i should tell you my children that there
prevails throughout russia the foolish and insincere
habit asking a price much above
that which it is intended to take i have
often known the russians abate half or twothirds
 what they have demanded
do you think anything is got papa 
said george by this custom
no george but much is lost by it
mushroomhunting 
time patience and what is far worse a
habit sincerity i fear there are few
bargains made in russia about which many
lies are not told lies to induce the purchaser
to give a price beyond the value the
article
 mashenka to proceed with our story said
she verily believed the reason her father's
success consisted in the trouble she had taken
and asked leave to assort the mushrooms in
future as she gathered them the old man
smiled and stroked his beard for all the russians
wear beards and said kharasho which
means in english it is well or so be it
this gladdened mashenka and she began
to apply herself with great attention to the
separation the mushrooms into different
sorts and as her father really found much
profit in her knowledge he gave her a copeck
or two and she was encouraged to be
 minor morals
thoughtful and careful by the success her
thoughts and cares
mashenka had never been taught by the
lessons others but experience led her to
make many important distinctions she found
that the mushrooms which grew under the
shadow the birchtree were different from
those she found in the pinewoods that some
species loved the sun and some the shade 
and that various soils produced mushrooms
almost as various she made her little experiments
she transferred the mould from one
spot to another she learnt to distinguish by
the taste between the wholesome and the deleterious
sorts mushrooms the russians
call the funguses which grow on trees and
which they do not eat gribi and the mushrooms
which grow in the ground gull 
made many experiments on the way 
dressing the various qualities and at last
mushroomhunting 
her father allowed her to have a little stand
in the ochottioi read near his own which
now became celebrated for the variety and
excellence the ubi which were sold there
the lord upon whose estate mashenka's
family lived was one who had some benevolence
and much ostentation in his character
he did not give himself much trouble in visiting
his vassals but whenever he did his language
was that kindness and he was called
by the peasants milostivy gouda or gracious
master when they spoke him
while his neighbour who was a far richer
nobleman than himself was known universally
by the title nemilostivy or the ungracious
milostivy had however one the great and
too common vices the russian nobility he
was a reckless gambler he had seen all the
vicissitudes between great and moderate opulence
 he had in fact more than once lost
 minor morals
everything but his estate and more than
once added enormously though only for a
short time to his possessions he had often
been tempted to gamble with his estate 
but a sense pride a respect for his forefathers
 a wholesome fear consequences had
always checked him when temptation said
try once more and win temptation was
not for a long time strong enough to breakdown
all the barriers prudence
nemilostivy had however been watching
the growing prosperity his neighbour's
peasantry and mashenka's family was remarkable
among the prosperous the gradual
accumulation wealth by frugal industry
is sometimes quite surprising and
mashenka's example had spread its influence
through the serfs on the milostivy
estate which had in a few years obtained
celebrity for its superior mushrooms and
mushroomhunting 
do not wonder children that even so seemingly
trifling an article became a source 
comparative opulence to those who collected
it had you seen the hundreds waggons
which convey mushrooms to market the
great and general use this sort food
the variety ways in which it is prepared
preserved and cooked for table its universal
consumption from the tables the mightiest
down to those the meanest you would not
wonder that a little fortune might be made
out mushrooms but so it was and
symptoms mashenka's bettered condition
were very visible she added a gold chain
to the ornaments she had been accustomed
to wear round her neck and was seen one
evening dancing the alaska with two large
bracelets amber ornamenting her arms
milostivy had been too much engaged in
the pleasures no rather the perplexities 
 minor morals
the capital to give much attention to what
was passing on his estate the peasants paid
their pogolovnaja podat or polltax with
great regularity and he appeared satisfied
with them and with himself as his steward
who happened to be a kindhearted man
made the regular collection the annual
tribute from the peasant vassals
but the passion for display and the far
more dangerous passion that the gaminghouse
obtained more and more possession 
his thoughts he was as restless as a feverish
child and the unhappy propensity began
to drown all his better feelings in that
state which is more like the drunkenness or
the insanity the mind than anything else
milostivy had been at an evening party playing
one desperate game after another it
was with nemilostivy who availed himself
 the frenzy and excitement the man
mushroomhunting 
whom he had called friend to urge him onwards
he lost larger and larger sums at
last he put his estate upon the game luck
as it is called luck deserted him and the
noble was penniless the necessary forms
for the transfer the estate were drawn up
next morning and signed by milostivy he
left moscow immediately afterwards and
made his way to mashenka's cottage
the visit a russian signior to the
shales or hut one his peasants is an
event very rare occurrence so vast a
distance is there between the lord and the
vassal so remarkable is the contrast between
their mode life that the appearance a
noble in the house his serf is in many
parts russia considered what that a
sovereign would be to a shopkeeper and
in truth so wretched and so dirty are the
habitations the peasants so suffocating
 minor morals
from the heat so offensive from the noisome
smells and generally so crowded with living
and offensive things that it is not to be
wondered at if they are generally avoided
milostivy had never before entered mashenka's
dwelling he scarcely knew what took him
thither he had a vague recollection having
heard the prosperity the family
but his mind was troubled and his heart was
almost broken he was not clad as usual 
he had a wild and weary look he walked
into the cottage and sat down without saying
a word
nobody was there he looked round him
and was astonished at the neatness and comfort
on every side i do not mean that it
was comparable to an english peasant's happy
home but to milostivy it was a sight such
as he had never seen in the habitation his
mushroomhunting 
serfs it almost aroused him from lies gloomy
meditations
 bore ishav heaven protect us said
mashenka as lie entered and saw her lord
seated on the lejanka or top the stove
which is found in all russian dwellings
 ne tai bog what can be amiss exclaimed
mashenka starting back as if she
had seen a spirit
but milostivy was silent he hung down
his head milosivjeishii gouda most
gracious sir uttered mashenka with a soft
voice and bowed herself to the ground and
kissed her lord's feet as she rose
 not so mashenka not so i am no
longer your master and you are no longer
my vassal know that i am as poor oh
how much poorer than you 
mashenka had only that imperfect feeling
vol ii i
 minor morals
 the rights property which characterises
those who possess nothing that is really their
own gouda i she answered i do not
understand you but all that we have is yours
 alas it was so yesterday but today
this hut and its inhabitants and its possessions
 your family you all all belong to
another
it was not for mashenka to inquire how
the calamity had happened tears came into
her eyes while she opened a small chest and
took from it a roll paper money she trembled
violently she was unable to speak
milostivy saw her purpose and a smile 
a cold smile came over his countenance 
 matters are not so bad as that yet but you
are transferred to another master may he be
kind to his vassals 
the nobleman uttered a benediction and
departed many a time was his name 

bounced and his memory blessed for the
serfs lead sad reason to regret his loss
the new lord was altogether a different
temper it was his purpose to drain the peasants
 their last copeck he immediately
raised the polltax he extorted everything
on which his cupidity could lay hold the
people who had no longer any recompense
for their toil fell into their ancient habits 
indifference even mashenka neglected her
mushroom gatherings she went less frequently
to market her little store gradually lost its
reputation all exertion was damped and
destroyed for all motive to exertion was taken
away by the rapacious lord
some years passed on the peasants that
had been the model the country the happy
and prosperous race sunk down to their
former lethargy the oppression and cruelty
that were practised towards them only 
minor morals
iced them the more but mashenka was
soon to witness new vicissitudes
a ukase for a conscription among the
peasants had been issued and among those
whose lot it was to be summoned to the army
was a young man who had long been plighted
to mashenka at times mashenka made an
effort to adorn the hut and always looked
cheerful when ivan was expected or when
h appeared but the spring hope was dried
within her
it was at the time when the emperor
alexander was founding his military colonies
the first news the conscription was a terrible
shock to mashenka for she imagined ivan
would be comprehended in it and so he was
wretched was the day but still more
wretched the night when she was told the news
but ivan had heard a report that in the military
colonies soldiers were allowed to marry
mushroomhunting 
and without communicating his purpose to
any one he went to the neighbouring village
made his way to the serjeant the troops
that were stationed there who happened to
be an acquaintance told him his story and
inquired with wet eyes and a timid voice
whether it were possible that mashenka should
accompany him
the serjeant answered him in a friendly
tone on which ivan broke out into a long
description mashenka's merits and virtues
and the service she could do and her present
unhappiness and intreated the serjeant
to plead for her
 kharasho well that will i and i will
lend you music for the wedding if a wedding
there be 
light was the step ivan as he hurried
to mashenka's hut but she could hardly
hope the dream as she thought it would
 minor morals
ever prove a reality the gouda will
never consent no ivan you will go alone 
and you will leave me to weep and to die 
the moment was however a propitious
one the emperor was very desirous extending
the military colonies it was one 
his most favoured projects and the serjeant
knew it he spoke to the lieutenant above
him the lieutenant to the superior officers 
and authority was obtained for the celebration
 the marriage and for the departure the
bride with her husband to the interior
i shall not tell you children all that
passed on the journey ivan was a kind husband
and mashenka a happy wife severe
and even cruel though the army regulations
 russia are ivan was never a defaulter
and the presence mashenka enabled him
to bear much which otherwise might have
seemed unbearable
mushroomhunting o
the military colonies were intended to
unite the agricultural with the military life
ivan was not only a diligent but an intelligent
peasant and mashenka soon found that
her former habits and engagements might be
beneficial to both they had now also escaped
from vassalage for the moment a serf becomes
a soldier the right the lord over
his person ceases any profits he can make
belong to himself and the seignior cannot
take them away
ivan's good behaviour soon led to his
advancement and he was allowed a small
spot ground to cultivate for himself the
day when he obtained it was one the very
happiest mashenka's existence in it she
saw their future fortunes and she was not
deceived
she was clearing away the snow one
morning in winter when an officer's kibitka
 minor morals
stopped suddenly and she heard mashenka 
m a voice that seemed familiar to her ear
it was count milostivy he was the
commander a regiment in a neighbouring
colony and had heard that the moscow 
was only a few verses away he
had passed through many scenes vicissitude
but having through tke interference 
some old acquaintance obtained a commission
from the emperor had intreated that he
might be stationed at the military colonies 
first because he wished to remove himself
far away from all the scenes where selfreproach
and sorrow went with him at every
step and secondly because he thought it
was really a scene great usefulness where
he might reestablish a credit that was broken
and regain the peace mind that had long
ago abandoned him he had determined to
forget the past for in it there was no 

more pleasure it seemed to lii a dark
and dreary spot to which it was misery to
turn he avoided every occupation which
could remind him former scenes i will
begin he said a new existence i cannot
alter the past nor undo that which has been
done but i can make it as if it had never
been i can i will rase it all from my recollection
and to a great extent he had
succeeded
but the past cannot be wholly forgotten
the mind is not completely its own master
mashenkas name had brought out the past
some thoughts which were more bright because
they came forth from darkness the visit to
the shales flashed upon him in striking contrast
to all the other events that memorable
and melancholy time he longed to
see mashenka and he drove off to visit her
i 
 minor morals
almost as soon as lie had heard her
arrival
milostivy had acquired influence though
he had not amassed wealth adversity had
made him thoughtful and he restrained the
momentary impulse which would have offered
at once to change the condition ivan and
mashenka he wisely calculated that he could
make them far more happy by opening to
them more widely the door future though
distant prosperity than by any sudden or unexpected
change
he desired mashenka whose delight broke
through the accustomed marks servile respect
with which the russian serfs salute
their masters to tell him her story since she
had quitted his ancient estate many a time
he passed his hand over his eyes as mashenka
told him the distressing changes in the
mushroomhunting 
condition the peasantry since he left but
mashenka did not tell all for why should
she give sorrow to a master who had never
given sorrow to her or hers
 have you forgotten the ochotnoi riadv
inquired the count no indeed my gracious
lord answered mashenka and ivan
and myself have often thought that if i could
be permitted 
 i know what you mean mashenka 
you shall have permission and patronage too
it was for that i came when the season
arrives you shall be set up in the world
the promise was faithfully kept the
count obtained mushroom spawn from different
parts the empire he studied the
matter as if his own happiness had depended
on it he helped ivan and mashenka to
various modes culture he added the observations
 science to those mashenka's
 minor morals
experience he assisted them to produce and
to sell their productions the groundwork
was again laid a little fortune which
mashenka was not again to be despoiled
year after year added something to their welldoing
and the count was enabled to recompense
their meritorious efforts in a thousand
ways ivan reached the highest grade among
noncommissioned officers so popular was
he that none complained his advancement
mashenka and he have many children and
they are the children not now serfs but
 free people for ivan's term military
service is over and he has been enabled to
buy a small tract land close to the colony
through the whole extent which the 
 moscow is a title fame
selfishness
 i wonder wliy you cry said a young
prince to his governess one day i wonder
why you cry for i am quite well 
so much adulation and misconstruction turned
aside the natural current his affections that
the boy thought only himself and thought
too that everybody else was occupied in
thinking him alone it is by such mistakes
that all the generous feelings are eradicated
and it is thus that the mischiefs and
miseries caused by wicked princes have their
origin in the foolish flatteries those who
form their characters
this observation fell from mr howard one
 minor morals
day and produced a great impression on the
children it set them thinking on the distinction
between selfishness and prudence 
qualities very different but very ipt to be
confounded
what a bad opinion the governess must
have had the prince said george
but how badly she must have taught
him edith ejaculated for such a selfish
notion would never have got into the boy's
head itself it must have been put thereby
somebody
i don't think edith responded george
 that the way to make people wise and good
is to flatter them so foolishly and to talk to
them as if all the world were made to be subservient
to them
let's ask papa whether the governess reproved
the prince whispered arthur to hls
sister 
selfishness 
 we want to know papa said edith
if the governess corrected the prince and
how
i am afraid not answered mr howard
though it would have been very fitting to
tell the lad who had then every expectation
 being a king that there were other persons
in the world besides himself who were
intitled to some thought and care but do
not judge the poor prince too harshly he
was but what his teachers made him he
was trained and taught to consider himself
as everything and everyone else as nothing
nothing but in the proportion in which they
could minister to his desires and gratifications
not long after he used the expression which
showed what an unfortunate training his mind
had received the race was dethroned to which
he belonged and the discipline adversity
will perhaps have taught him that selfishness
 minor morals
and a regard to selfinterest are far different
things
i know a selfish man and i will give you
some traits in his character he will not do
another man a service if he can help it because
he fancies that in doing a service without
an immediate return he is giving something
away in waste he forgets that he obtains
for the service the desire to do him other services
he forgets that the gratitude others
is fertile in acts kindness in what is the
sentiment gratitude but thoughts kindness
 thoughts which will become deeds 
kindness when the occasion offers but the
selfish man fancies he is poorer because he
has transferred something to another even
though that something cost him nothing but a
friendly will or a friendly word while really
by adding to the happiness others the virtuous
man strengthens and increases his own
selfishness 
the selfish man wants to establish an instant
barter for all the good he does not reflecting
that though the good he does may not produce
immediate fruits it is in the permanent nature
 good to be fruitful albeit the harvest is
often distant the selfish man on the other
hand exacts services and kindness from others
without considering himself obliged to repay
them while he lends nothing on the fair
chances profit so he will borrow without
intending to pay either principal or interest
the selfish man is a bad calculator even on
his own selfish grounds he might if he chose
give much to others without making any
the least sacrifice himself he might obtain
much from others the return for which would
cost him nothing at all
but the man whose selfishness is prudent
and wise will be benevolent because he is
prudently and wisely selfish he will see that
 minor morals
benevolence is the best selfish calculation 
that he realizes more by it than he could do
by any other habit he finds that he gets
great interest upon all the outlay his friendly
and generous feelings he discovers were
it nothing but an estimate profits and losses
that he gains more and sacrifices less by his
disposition to serve others than he could gain
or save by a contrary disposition all truths
are linked to all other truths and there is
nothing in the chain more beautiful or harmonious
than the communion and identity 
the selfish with the benevolent principle the
selfish when regarded in its widest bearings
the benevolent when brought home to individual
sway all the disorders society spring
from the quarrel between the fancied interests
 the one or the few contending with the
interests the many every error every
crime is but the representation a man or
selfishness 
men who set themselves up in hostility to
public opinion and the general weal what
a result peace and felicity will be produced
when the moralist can demonstrate
that there is nothing so prudent as benevolence
 nothing so benevolent as prudence 
i will exemplify my meaning by an anecdote
or two continued mr howard though
i believe you will understand my meaning
and as i hope feel the distinctions i meant
to point out
a poor man had been greatly wronged
by his master his master was a particular
friend mr ego whose servant the poor
man had been and he fancied that mr ego
who had great influence with his master might
without mischief to himself or anybody repair
the vitong the poor man went to mr ego
and told his story adding that he doubted not
if mr ego would mention the matter that
 minor morals
lies master would reconsider the grievances
under which he was suffering and it was
a case in which mr ego might have interfered
without intrusiveness but when the poor
man applied to him he answered in a surly
tone what shall i get by meddling in your
affairs cannot you settle your own quarrels
without involving me 
 now mr ego had he been really a prudent
person would have considered that he
did get something by obtaining the good
opinion the grateful opinion the poor man
and he might further have inquired whether
supposing the claim one strict justice he
was doing a service alike to the poor man's
master to the poor man and to himself as
peacemaker between them but he left the
poor man indignant with him and his friend also 
he left his friend in the path wrong when
he might have led him into that right
selfishness 
and he lost the claim he might have established
on the thankfulness the servant and the
master by causing an act justice to be
done to both
the memory imagined wrongs that are
done and imagined rights that are denied
lives long in the mind the poor man left
mr ego with bitterness thought which if
it had found safe occasion at that moment
would have broken out into violence and
you will suppose my children in order to
complete the moral my tale that i shall
tell you some instance in which the poor man
being able to do mr ego some act kindness
refused it and thus punished him for his unwillingness
to discharge an obvious duty
and such truly was the first impulse the
poor man's reflections but he reflected again 
and he asked himself what motive he had
disapproving mr ego's conduct to make
 minor morals
that conduct the guide and model his own 
was the punishment the past or a better
example for the future most likely to influence
mr ego or to serve the poor man's interests
who could doubt
and the occasion occurred which put the
poor man's philosophy to the test it was
some time after the circumstance i mentioned
and time had been given to the poor man
to meditate on the past
there was a contested election in the town
parties were pretty evenly balanced so evenly
that a few votes might turn the scale and
the poor man was in a position to decide the
fate either candidate
 the candidates mr ego was one oh
how bitterly did he repent having refused
a friendly and reasonable service to the poor
man what would he not have given to have
had that hour his existence to pass over
selfishness 
again to pass it over with the benefit his
present experience now he felt that there
might be something in future events to repay
present conduct now he saw that the friendly
deeds men do to one another are not so
much loss but so much gain upon the whole
mr ego's ambition was raised to the highest
pitch his desire success his dread 
disappointment were both tormenting his
existence and in the man whom he had
refused to serve he saw the arbiter his
fate
that poor man however he determined
to visit making up his mind to the humiliation
 a bitter reproof and doubting whether
his known political opinions which were those
 the elector he was about to seek would
obtain favour at the hands one whom he
knew had such reason to complain but so
much depended on the poor mean's conduct
 minor morals
that it was necessary at all events to attempt
to conciliate him
with his hat in his hand and a smile
upon his countenance mr ego entered the
poor man's dwelling abashed and selfreproved
he hardly knew how to ask for the
support the poor but honest elector he
was soon relieved from his embarrassment by
the poor man's offering him his hand and saying
 sir my first impulse was to give you
a lesson punishment and to recall to your
mind the words that once fell from your lips 
but
 but no more my friend no more
said mr ego the lesson is severe enough
already i want no other monitor than my
conscience
 my vote is yours answered the elector 
he who has the courage to own he was wrong
gives the best evidence that he has resolved
selfishness 
to he right the poor man lent his support
to mr ego and mr ego won his election
i have watched mr ego closely added
mr howard he is not quite the man that
a wise and thoughtful prudence would make
him but his very selfishness has rooted out
a portion selfishness from his mind and
he feels now that he has more profit to
himself from kindness than he could have from
unkindness he feels that benevolence is a
nobler and more gainful policy than selfishness 
while every calculation that he makes advances
him one step farther on the path real virtue
do you understand my meaning my gentle
edith
indeed papa i think i do you mean
that we do not get anything by being illnatured
but that we get something by being
kind and good
yes love answered mr howard and
vol ii k
 minor morals
why should we not for if we are made happier
by our kindness and goodness and others are
made happier then all are made happier because
there is nobody in the world but ourselves
and everybody else but i have been rather
dry and ethical this evening and was afraid
you would not be interested in what i was
saying
 indeed we were interested said george 
for though now and then you used some
words we did not quite comprehend yet we
saw the drift all you said and we shall
not confound the selfishness that is wise with
the selfishness that is foolish
affection for inanimate
objects
the conversation the previous night deeply
impressed the minds the young people 
and they were rather flattered with the idea
that mr howard had been talking to them
in a manner complimentary to their intelligence
 reasoning with them rather than
amusing them it was indeed mr howard's
purpose so to blend information with enjoyment
as to make both them as palatable
and pleasurable as possible pleasure
 solid substantial pleasure was the
 he proposed to himself and his children
not a pleasure leaving pain behind
it he would have preferred a pain that left
 minor morals
a pleasure but pleasure which when sifted
and sifted again was pleasure still pleasure
unaccompanied by vexation reproach or
regret
in this temper as we have seen the
howard family gave to their conversations
the widest range by and by we may pourtray
them in their more serious studies as
we have done in their leisure hours
but papa said george you said
that kindness brought back kindness in return
may not kindness sometimes fail in doing
so
surely replied mr howard but the
habit kindness will never fail and the
habit you know is the result acts
yes said edith but may we not love
persons and things that cannot love us 
persons that are dead and things that cannot
feel
affection for inanimate objects 
undoubtedly you may answered lier
father but that very disposition to love
wins the love others men cannot help
loving those who give them evidence that
they love them what i would have you
encourage for your own happiness is an
amiable and loving temper and let that
temper be displayed wherever it can in
our intercourse with other human beings and
with a considerable part the brute creation
we have always as i have said a strong
motive for rendering them friendly services
inasmuch as they are able and will be willing
to render us friendly services in return
but there are also thousands objects
which are sources pleasure and subjects
 sympathy independently any positive
good they can do us attachment to inanimate
things with which pleasure has been
associated sometimes becomes almost a passion
 minor morals
there is a famous passage in one the
moorish poets expressing in strong terms the
sentiments with which the sioht the first
palm tree introduced into spain inspired one
 the moorish monarchs it was the renowned
alderman he made for himself a
beautiful garden in the most beautiful part
 which he planted a palm tree the palm
tree which the moors maintained to be the
prolific parent the multitudes palm trees
that now ornament andalusia and granada
he had erected a temple for the purpose
 meditation and was wont to sit there
hour after hour contemplating his favourite tree
his melancholy says an arabic historian
which he thought allaying by all the
pleasant thoughts and stories which the palm
tree would bring to his mind only increased
upon him and the following is a faithful
version one the soliloquies he uttered 
affection for inanimate objects 
beautiful palm thou chief trees
thou wert a stranger tree
but now the sweet algerian breeze
salutes and worships thee
sin fertile soil thou art rooted deep
thy head is in the sky
but thou would'st weep how sadly weep 
couldst thou but feel as i
the tempesttorrent shakes thee not
thou stances in thy pride
while by the storms time and thought
my troubled mind is tried 
and i waste tears while fortes stream
waters each favourite tree
but trees and fort's river seem
oblivious all me 
 me whom alabaz has driven
from mine own seat rest 
 me whom alla's will has riven
from all i loved the best
thou voiceless palm no memory
 country dost thou keep
so i most weep for thee for me 
i cannot choose but weep
 minor morals
when i was travelling in spain the palm
trees were shown to me which alderman
was said to have planted they were the
stateliest i ever saw and were tall as the
towers cordova near which they stood
two them then remained venerable as
oriental banyans recalling to my mind the
history the moorish conquest spain
but since i left cordova i am told that one has
been uprooted by the tempest and with it a
thousand interesting recollections i own that i
have often turned towards these trees with something
like respect and affection and that i
think them still as distant and departed
friends one belonging to the living and the
other to the dead
once while i was looking at the palm
trees a fancy came across my mind that i
was present at one the scenes described in
the civil wars spain by the romantic hisaffection
for inanimate objects 
tories or rather the poets that country
 imagined i saw the moor abdallah as he
is described by the chronicler sad and very
thoughtful and all his hopes departed surrounded
by followers who had sheathed their
swords and who looked mournfully at one
another and at their chieftain having heard
that their last and strongest fortress had been
taken by the spaniards and that the succours
they had long expected had returned to africa
in despair abdallah's companions were few
and none them illustrious there was
scarcely a straggler in the roads except shrieking
women and miserable children even the
warriors who had acquired the most renown
had abandoned all human habitations and were
wandering in the byeroads the mountains
hungry and unsheltered
it was under one the pain trees now
so venerable that abdallah gathered his last
 minor morals
council war i fancied i saw the chieftains
assemble there and heard the harangue which
the chronicler has put into the mouth their
monarch valiant men and brethren we
have toiled and triumphed in vain algiers
has betrayed turkey has deserted us fez
and morocco have been deaf to our supplications
we have lost our citadels and our
ships hunger has destroyed us more mercilessly
than arms our wives and children
perish they invoke either captivity or death 
surrender then though i cannot surrender
another sun is rising while mine is darkening
into night the vow that i have vowed to
the prophet i must keep it only brings with
it the doom perpetual solitude where i will
meditate on your virtues and mine own adversity
the women says the chronicler all
burst into tears and the warriors said let us
have peace and the word peace peace 
affection for inanimate objects 
passed from lip to lip as a fragrant flower might
pass from hand to hand and habaqui the
valiant with a white flag which he placed on
a lance went to the christian king and
a treaty peace was made made to be
broken abdallah deserted by his ancient
followers wandered long among the mountains
where he was hunted like a beast 
prey and being at last discovered was ordered
to granada there to die as he passed near
one the palm trees that reminded him 
other days he broke out into bitter lamentations
and was much more sorrowfully affected
than he had been by all the misery he had
witnessed the chronicler says that as he
was descending on his mule down the precipitous
side a mountain where there was
a deep ravine below he took a last look at
the palm trees and flung himself into the
abyss being dashed to pieces among the sharp
 minor morals
and cruel rocks the spaniards found his
corpse there and decapitated it suspending
his head in an iron cage with an insulting
inscription which an historian spain says
he himself had seen calling abdallah a
traitor dog
often does some inanimate object become
as it were the text history places which
have been the scenes great and interesting
events are dear to individuals and to nations
they have the celebrated spots they love as
well as the illustrious men they honour all
the feelings may be called into action where
there is no real response to them from inanimate
nature but to fancy such responses
is one the most pleasing and most powerful
attributes genius and sometimes the
impression is so strong as to give a sort
 vitality to introduce a living principle 
amidst the very silence and stillness nature
affection for inanimate objects 
i recollect papa said arthur when you
showed us runnymede that i could not but
fancy all the barons assembled there for the
signing magna charta
and said edith when we went to the
tower and you papa pointed out the place
where the infant king edward and his brother
were murdered i could hardly help shrieking
for it seemed to me as if the murderers were
there and that i could hear the cries the
poor children
on such occasions answered mr howard
the imagination is very busy as it is assisted
by the presence objects which become
like outlines to be filled up by recollections
i well remember when i was travelling to
forces in scotland near the spot where i
fancied that macbeth had met the witches
it was in the twilight evening that three
witchlike forms appeared in the mist before
 minor morals
me standing on the lieatli near a fire i
looked and looked again and felt as if i
were in the presence the weird sisters
they seemed to be solemnly walking round
the burning cauldron into which they threw
the charms as they moved along and i
heard their deep and solemn voices and saw
every nowandthen with more distinctness
their haggard forms i approached nearer 
the illusion vanished which had been created
by the associations the dramatic poet and
the dreary place there were three peasants
who had been making themselves a fire 
gorse upon the heath and in the state my
mind at that time it required little to make
the scene and the action verify what shakspeare
has so strikingly imagined
prudence
 there was a philosopher in ancient time
who taught that there is only one virtue
namely prudence if he had said that there
were only two prudence and benevolence
he would have been quite right
 i think papa said george we all 
us begin to see pretty clearly that the other
virtues are not much value
my friend the philosopher not apollos
rejoined mr howard used to say that
there are only two persons in the world you
and everybody else mr self and mr allbesides
mr self s business with himself is in concerns
 minor morals
 prudence his business with mr allbesides is
mostly in concerns benevolence when they
have transactions together they interchange prudence
and benevolence in all the affairs where
mr allbesides is not concerned all that mr
self has to do is to take care himself he is
to take care himself too when he has todo
with mr allbesides but in order to get as
much as he can out mr allbesides mr self
must do him as much service as he is able
all this means that it is prudent to be prudent
and prudent to be benevolent so that in fact
there is one sense in which the ancient philosopher
was right in saying that there is no
virtue but prudence or rather that all virtues
when thoroughly understood are but prudence 
for unless benevolence itself gave a man
pleasure no man would be benevolent and it
is certainly prudent to get as much pleasure
as possible as much pleasure which is
prudence 
not followed by pain the pleasures benevolence
are as much a man's own as any
other pleasures and he has the same interest
in possessing them as in possessing any others
if i were called upon to point out that portion
 man's nature which most clearly exhibits
how much he was designed to be made
happier by virtue would refer to that which
proves his own interests to be so intimately
connected with the wellbeing his fellows
no man so certainly provides for his own
happiness no man obtains for himself so
much happiness no man lays in a stock
 happiness so pure and perfect a character
as he whose happiness is most intervened
with the happiness mankind i hope my
children said mr howard that i make
myself understood will you each explain
to me what he supposes is my meaning
i understand you perfectly papa said
 minor morals
edith i feel pleased when others are
pleased i am always uncomfortable when i
see that mamma or you are unhappy if anybody
were to offer to take some your
happiness away and to give it to me instead
i don't think i should thank them for it
no my dear girl and it would be a
foolish proposal for generally speaking the
more we give happiness to others the more
we keep for ourselves every kind word we
utter and every kind act we do is a proof
that we really understand how to be as happy
as possible somebody has said do nothing
wrong in society for you will lose the good
opinion others do nothing wrong in solitude
for you will lose your own you have
therefore in both cases a very decided interest
in good conduct for nobody loses the good
opinions others and still less his own good
opinion without suffering
prudence 
the great moral distinction between men
and brutes is that men depend for their own
pleasures more than brutes do upon the conduct
 others many animals live lonely or
solitary lives and even when they are associated
together it is for purposes selfdefence
it is very rare that they do one
another mutual services perhaps the instinct
that one service may bring another in return
never occupies their attention they show prudence
and that often in a most remarkable degree
in avoiding dangers in obtaining food
in sheltering themselves from the inclemency
 weather in the care their young 
and in all the arrangements necessary to their
preservation they often show exemplary patience
tact and sagacity in domesticated
animals education brings them close to the
regions virtue the fidelity and watchfulness
 some the dog species the cheerfulness
minor morals
ness with which they will undergo privation
and fatigue and even endure chastisement for
the purpose obtaining the good opinion
 their masters show that such good opinion
is necessary for their comfort their obedience
their docility their delight on receiving
praise may indeed have become a habit but
the habit could not have been formed without
many many little acts which created it
i will to impress this matter upon your
minds my children give you a short character
 a prudent child and show you how
thoughtful virtue may obtain friends for those
who possess it
martha martin was born in a workhouse
she was the daughter a profligate
mother who treated her from her very infancy
with little kindness her mother had seen much
affliction but that had not made her discreet
she had lost her husband with whom her
prudence
life had been miserable for she was careless
 her dress careless her house accustomed
to spend all she had regardless the coming
 the morrow so that when the morrow
came and her husband was out work
hunger came with it and wretchedness and
wretchedness was soon followed by apathy
and recklessness she sold or pledged the
little furniture they had and then her small
stock clothes and in the midst her privations
her husband died and the overseers
 the parish who had long been wearied
with her importunities forced her to enter the
workhouse and as i said before in the workhouse
martha was born
martha was a sickly child and small was
the attention she received from her mother
often as the visitors passed by they said
that poor child cannot live long but there
was an old woman a pauper in the ward who
 minor morals
made up for the mother's want kindness and
acted the part a parent to the poor infant
much indeed it wanted care but in the mere
involuntary motions its lips the old woman
fancied she saw a smile and soon it really
smiled and then the old woman said it was
the image a child she had lost fiveandforty
years before and she would kiss it and
fondle it with exceeding affection well it
was that the helpless baby found such a friend 
its mother gave herself no concern about it
one day she left the workhouse it was
supposed course she would return to
her child but she did not nor was she heard
 again nor from that day to the 
 martha's existence had she ever tidings 
her mother
martha was less than twelve months old
when thus deserted by her mother the old
woman applied to the overseer to be allowed
prudence 
to take charge the child and permission
was granted and martha never experienced
the want a mother's presence true a
poorhouse is a sad scene whether for childhood
or age but she had known nothing
better and had not to contrast its wants with
any memory greater enjoyments it was
in many respects a useful though a hard education
for from her cradle martha was
trained to privation she was fed with coarse
food and clothed in common garments but
she grew stronger and stronger she was a
happy little creature and was a favourite
among all the inmates the poorhouse
is not a poorhouse a wretched place 
asked edith
it would seem wretched very wretched
to you edith but that which is wretchedness
to some is comfort to others and happily the
standard enjoyment and suffering is accom
 minor morals
rotated by providence to our habits and our
circumstances
martha was not four years old before
she exhibited marks that prudence which
distinguished her through afterlife when
eating the porridge that was provided for the
paupers she was observed never to spill a
drop and when she had done she replaced
the vessel on the shelf with the greatest care
if at any time she could spare a portion 
the food that was brought her she laid it
aside for another occasion she had never
heard the proverb waste not want not
but it seemed as if a thoughtful care the
future was a part her very nature
nobody knows how much good may be
done by a little prudent care i will give
you an instance one the paupers in
cutting her bread injured her hand very seriously
there was no surgeon at hand no
prudence 
means dressing the wound or assuaging
the pain little martha who was then only
six years old came into the room and saw
what the poor woman was suffering she had
picked up and preserved with her usual
attention the remains some ointment which
she had seen used but which had been
thrown out the window as no value
she spread it on a rag and gave it to the
woman it answered the it healed the
wound do not think these things trifling
my children for martha's prudence was benevolent
too and in little instances like this
it was exhibited
in matters where the cultivation useful
habits is concerned there is really nothing
that is unimportant the means which the
the poor possess doing good are small 
and the means which the children the
poor possess are smaller still but prudence
vol ii l
 minor morals
and benevolence do not depend so much for their
merit on the number persons who benefit
by them as on their intrinsic value for they
who possess them will exercise them whenever
and wherever they are able and they
can only be exercised in that station which
it is our lot to occupy
you may fancy that in the humble sphere
in which martha lived with so few the
pleasures and with none the luxuries 
life she had few occasions to exhibit abstinence
or temperance or any the virtues
 restraint but it was not so there is no
situation without temptations foolish thoughts
occur to all discontent and murmuring are
almost the natural result the privations 
the poor the inequality conditions is hard
to bear and harder perhaps to explain
a circumstance occurred in the poorhouse
which interfered with martha's peace mind
prudence 
and troubled her with painful reflections 
which she could not for a long time get rid
a relation one the girls the poorhouse
had returned from abroad having amassed
considerable wealth and had sent for this
inmate the poorhouse who returned dazzled
with all the gay and rich things she
had seen to tell her companions her good
fortune and that she was to be taken into
the house her rich relation and to be
made a lady at once martha was at this
time between eleven and twelve years old
she listened at first with delight but afterwards
in silence and sorrow to all her companion
told her splendid apartments and
furniture and gay beds and liveried servants
and carriages and horses and all the gorgeous
things that riches buy one thought took
possession poor martha's mind a thought
that grew darker and darker what have
 minor morals
i done that all these enjoyments are denied
to me how can god whom i am taught
to consider so good and so just deal so unequally
with his creatures martha's reflections
 this sort now imbittered her
existence though so young she had heard
enough to show her that she was among the
lowest and meanest the human race she
had not seen much but whenever she had
eft the poorhouse all that she observed looked
happier more comfortable than that she was
accustomed to see on one occasion she was
invited and obtained leave to visit her former
companion who was no longer dressed in
the coarse garb the workhouse but wore
handsome clothes and had even servants to
attend her martha trembled as she mounted
the carpetcovered stairs her friend spoke
kindly to her and said she had mentioned
her name to her relation and she hoped he
prudence 
would interest himself about her martha
could hardly say she thanked her for the
thought her own inferiority came across
her at that moment with such bitterness that
she returned to the poorhouse in tears and
fancied she should never be happy again
but martha's grief poignant though it
was was gradually lessened by reflecting that
instead rendering her condition better
grief would only make it worse what do
i get she said to herself by the discontent
which is but another evil added to all the
rest why should i increase my privations
by depriving myself my peace mind
and thus martha did really drive away her
gloomy reflections and in the place them
she indulged in hopes that some day or other
her lot might be more fortunate
and so it turned out for a few days
afterwards a notice came from the overseer
l 
 minor morals
that a situation was found for martha she
went to it accompanied by the best wishes
 all the poor people among whom she had
been born and bred and they said as she
left them she always was a good girl and
let good luck be with her always 
martha was soon found to be a treasure
in the family into which she had entered
grateful for all kindness she made a grateful
return the prudence which had before but
little to exercise itself on now became a
most useful and important virtue her thriftiness
and care found ample employment and
her trustworthiness obtained for her more and
more the confidence all she could not
bear to waste any thing and her previous
situation had trained her to attach some value
to trifles which are too often wholly
disregarded
experience had taught martha the imprudence

prudence and the folly indulging in painful
thoughts as she grew older she found that
we may habitually if we please dwell upon
pleasant thoughts and this experience made
martha one the wisest women she
was always cheerful because her mind was
constantly occupied with cheerful reflections
and her hands engaged in cheerful duties
her labours were lightened by a perpetual
gaiety not a thoughtless or a frivolous indifference
 but a disposition which would find
in every exertion something to encourage
hope or to reward with happiness i did
not intend my children to tell you much 
a story in speaking martha martin i
wanted to show you by an example the value
 thoughtful prudence martha occupies now
though still young the highest situation
in the family where she filled the lowest she
is an object general respect i may say

hereafter but sure i am she has laid up
for future time great stores happiness

be delighted to contribute
flowers
in ancient gardens flowers were few civilization
and travel the consequence and cause
 civilization have brought with them innumerable
beautiful things as well as useful
ones and the variety flowers and fruits
are among the most delightful evidences 
improvement
i remember said george having read
that in the decorations and ornamented festivals
 tarquin the proud roses were the
only flowers employed
the love flowers said mr howard
 minor morals
was so strong in ancient times that there
was a law which prohibited any flower
garlands being worn except by patrician or
privileged brows but the law was so constantly
violated that it was impossible to
enforce its observance and in the course 
time the strength habit became mightier
than the law
we laughed the other day said arthur
when we read cicero's reproach verres
because he was escorted about sicily upon a
litter covered with roses wearing a crown
 flowers and having all his garments festooned
with flowery wreaths
the romans learnt the custom from
the greeks said mr howard the greeks
perhaps from the oriental nations at
athens we know the use flowers was
almost universal and the favourites seem to
have been the rose the pink the violet the
flowers 
narcissus and the iris they were employed
in the dresses women for the adorning
the altars for the priestly costume and
above all for the ornaments social festivals
it was believed the fragrance flowers had
occult virtues and that it dissipated the effects
 excess that it stimulated fancy brightened
the intellect and disposed the mind
to cheerfulness and gaiety
the emperor augustus spent large sums
in flowers and heliogabalus employed them
in the most extravagant profusion his beds
were covered with their leaves his apartments
and porticos almost hidden beneath
the quantities flowers used for their decoration

there is an account a supper given
by cleopatra in which she spent a talent
nearly our money on which occasion
it was said the saloon was made into a

real bed roses the floor being completely
covered by the quantity leaves
 flowers too formed a great portion 
the expence the famous repast nero
which cost four millions sesterces nearly
 sterling historians tell us that
flowers and particularly roses were imported
at an enormous price from asia and cultivated
in costly style great expense was
incurred by the attempts to have early flowers
and to obtain them after the period ordinary
bearing
you have heard i dare say the passion
which was so general in holland for
tulips and hyacinths and the wonderful prices
which were sometimes paid for them a
few flowers the rarer species were a fortune
even in these days there are vestiges
 this flowerloving mania in no part 
the world are the gardens so richly provided
flowers 
with costly flowers and there is still a large
trade carried on in the exportation roots
from harlem and other places
harlem interrupted emily is that
not the place where the renowned organ is
whose pipes are so large and its sounds so
harmonious 
yes exclaimed arthur and there it
was that the inventor printing was born
whose name was inquired mr howard

coster said arthur wittenberg 
said george and edith hung down her
head and said she did not know
it is a disputed point said mr howard
and will continue so perhaps there was a
succession improvements for it often happens
that the original idea is older than is
supposed invention has been as useful to
mankind in the happy and novel application
 minor morals
 what is already known as in the first
discovery facts unknown before
now as we were talking flowers 
what numberless and beautiful species are
familiar to us which ancient greece and
rome knew nothing in those days years
followed years without the introduction a
novelty but now hundreds and hundreds 
new plants are added every generation to
those known before every country that is
discovered has its botanical characteristics
aid men science are happily now so
widely spread that the whole field nature
is investigated and its separate beauties imported
into our own country
flowers have been the groundwork 
many an allegory and very naturally so
they are so various in form and size and
colour they are so universally objects 
attention they are so lovely and so transflowers

story they afford such images to the poet
such lessons to the moralist they are so
associated with daylight and sunshine spring
and summer with nature whether rude or
cultivated with fields and gardens with childhood
and domestic thoughts that few minds
however high and noble have neglected them
even as sources enjoyment bacon loved
flowers bentham cultivated flowers and
christ himself often made them the subject
 touching parables and eloquent lessons 
truth
i one day fancied continued mr howard
that a camellia and a wild honeysuckle
held discourse together
the camellia was proud its waxlike
coronal proud all the attention that was
paid to it by the gardener proud the admiration
it excited and the place it occupied
the wild honeysuckle grew unnoticed in the
 minor morals
garden hedge unnoticed by the passengers
though it gave sweetness to the breezes as
they glided by
 the camellia was a vain flower and its
vanity was wounded as it remarked that though
the gardener and the garden visitors often
gave it their word praise it had no constant
and everpresent admirers as the honeysuckle
had the unobtrusive honeysuckle that
blossomed on the garden's hedge
 now and then indeed a bee or a butterfly
hovered for a moment over the camellia but
scarcely had it heard the bee's song or begun
to admire the butterfly's beautiful pinions ere
they fled and the camellia saw in jealous
spite that they lingered near the honeysuckle
that bees and butterflies drank in its sweet
breath and fanned the fragrant flower with
their restless wings
in vain the camellia tried all the arts 
flowers 
coquetry not even a bluebottle would exhibit
any marks attachment bluebottles
came indeed with their buzz and their boldness
but if they lighted for an instant on the
leaves the camellia off they immediately
started trumpeting their regardless song which
the camellia was too fond interpreting
into an impudent insult when in truth it
was nothing but the humming lighthearted
indifference
at last the camellia broke out upon the
honeysuckle in these words wild and illbred
creature who planted thee there why
intrude into my master's presence why
weed the field as thou art art thou clambering
into the garden ground
 i meant no intrusion answered the
honeysuckle meekly where we were
planted we each us grow i too have my
master and i experience his care i know
 minor morals
my humble destiny too well to force my
way unbecomingly into the presence my
betters
 modesty indeed said the camellia a
pretty sort humility thine dallying all day
with every winged creature thou canst stop
and occupied in nought but listening to the
idle songs flies and wasps and robberbees
or in kissing gaudy and donothing
butterflies 
 i have not stirred replied the honeysuckle
but as the winds have moved me
and no visitor have i courted i hope by
levity or misconduct
who art thou again i ask shouted the
camellia who art thou that fittest there
overlooking the abode superior flowers 
 i the honeysuckle quietly said am
i well know but a wild though not what
you called me an illbred flower i was
flowers 
born like you from the bosom earth i
have been fed like you with water and with
dews i have been taught to flower as you
have by the rays the sun and like you
i shall fade ere long and wait the renovation
 another spring we have both us
been helped by nature more robust than
you i required no other care while you
have had the privilege being attended
by the watchfulness man never seduced
away from you either bee or butterfly you
have your admirers and lowlier and less
aspiring flowers may have theirs
but it was in vain the honeysuckle
sought to reason defeated pride soon becomes
active hate the camellia complained
 the honeysuckle to the gardener he
snapped off the flowers as they were growing
on the hedge just raised them to his nose
 minor morals
to enjoy their sweet scent and threw them
carelessly upon the ground
did the camellia get any recompense
for its selfishness and spite none at all
it heard less the music bees saw less
 the beauty butterflies for while the
honeysuckle was blowing they often passed
near the camellia but now the honeysuckle
being removed they came no more
the fragrance was gone and the melody
and the bright colours that shone in the
sun
another spring came round modestly
as ever the honeysuckle peeped forth no
camellia was there it had been nipped by
the frost its place was occupied by an
azalea a sweetsmelling azalea
 will there be any jealousy now any
illnature for the azalea will win admirers
flowers 
with its perfumed petals and golden garb 
and i shall be left at peace
so it turned out the azalea bloomed 
was an object admiration and felt and
expressed no annoyance at the neighbourhood
 the honeysuckle on the contrary a sort
 communication was established between
them and they lived and blossomed on the
same spot for many a long year without
a thought unkindness
and why my children should discontent
and jealousy imbitter our existence
we have all so much to enjoy so much
to enjoy in the very enjoyments others 
if the breath the azalea is sweet so is
that the honeysuckle if we have pleasures
 our own others have pleasures too
pleasures which we may blend with those
that belong to ourselves and thus increase
our portion far beyond the amount which
 minor morals
any solitary pleasures could give benevolence
does not beggar but enrich and the
mote we confer kindness the more we
shall retain happiness
filial affection
the more closely the world is looked into
said mrs howard one day to her children
the more strange things will be found in it
in all and every part it a gentleman
who has lately been in britany told your
papa a few days ago that one the principal
means which the breton peasant girls have for
obtaining ornaments is the sale their long
hair which is regularly collected by a numerous
class haircutters their harvest time being
in the months april and may in france
altogether about lbs weight human
hair is annually sold at a price about eight
shillings per lb in paris alone there are 
 minor morals
persons employed who receive in wages nearly
oooooz sterling at the the year and
it is said that on an average the hair is increased
by human labour four or five times in
value
the gentleman narrated to your papa a
little history which had lately occurred in britany
and which i will repeat to you for it
is pleasant to speak the patience and virtues
 the poor it is useful too for it
teaches us to think them and to act
towards them with kindness it raises them in
our estimation our pride refuses not to regard
them as our brethren when they distinguish
themselves by honourable actions
in honouring them we honour the race to
which we ourselves belong
in the outskirts the town vannes
which the bretons call quenelt and is the
capital the department morbihan a
filial affection 
breton word meaning the small sea lived a
family a father mother and two daughters
katell and cana
the bretons preserve a strong provincial
or what may be more properly called a national
spirit they do not treat their french
neighbours as if they were the same people
but call them gauls and their language gallic
while they denominate themselves bretons
they never speak france but as a foreign
country and with their peculiar language they
have preserved many peculiarities their forefathers
in many districts their costume has
undergone no change for hundreds years
and there is the greatest unwillingness to introduce
novelties however useful or convenient

 the family i have spoken was like too
many the race trained in all the prejudices
 the country looking with suspicion

 minor morals
on everything that was new or foreign and
desirous resisting all improvements that came
from strangers
the father the family was a small farmer
he gained a bare subsistence by the
cultivation a little tract land that ms
father had bought during the revolution but
agricultural improvements had been introduced
especially in the neighbourhood the towns
 brittany new instruments had found
their way new produce was cultivated the
whole face the country was bettered the
value land rose but our farmer's affairs
became more and more involved in consequence
 the general improvement others
could turn their lands to better account than
he and though the prices corn and cattle
fell they could reap profit while jann for
that was the farmer's name found himself
unable to pay the charges his family but he
filial affection 
persisted in shutting his eyes to the real cause
 he first began to borrow money at a
heavy interest giving a portion his farm asa
security but this only made matters worse
and he was forced to borrow more in order
to pay the additional charge he sank deeper
and deeper in embarrassment his wife and
children had remarked a change in his manner
he had become silent and stern the sunday
dress which the bretons preserve for generation
after generation had been used for daily
service on several occasions when he had
been asked for some small sum money to
buy garments for the girls he answered
gloomily not now in the simple usages
 brittany a farmer's house generally provides
what is wanting for the daily food the
family coarse bread and cider potatoes
salt and now and then a little dried fish laid
in when the markets are well stocked i
 minor moral
wish said his wife to jann one day i wish
from my heart's centre a greiz va chaloun
a very common expression in brittany
you would tell me if things are going on as
usual this morning a man came and looked
in at the door the farm and walked about
as if he had a right to know more our circumstances
than a stranger should inquire
into what does it mean is anything
wrong silence said jann and trouble
me not nor could another word be forced
from him he hung down his head and left
the room
if his wife had been anxious before how
much more anxious was she now on his
return she intreated him to tell her what had
happened but in vain he looked about him
sat down in silence and when his two daughters
spoke he made signs that they should leave
him in fact he was ruined he had re
filial affection 
civet notice that he must surrender his farm
and he was penniless in the world
at this time one the girls was thirteen
and the other fifteen years old their mother
had not spoken to them the anxieties
that troubled her she was afraid that their
first proposal would be to leave her and
seek their fortunes in the world and she
could not bear to think being abandoned
or that her girls should be exposed to what
she had heard for from her own experience
she knew little or nothing the temptations
and the corruptions large tomtis nor
as i said was she quite aware the real
state things nor the extent her
husband's embarrassments and the inevitable
distress to which they were to be subjected
but she told her daughters that she was
sure some misfortune had happened to their
father that a storm was gathering somewhere
 minor morals
we must be prepared for affliction said
she and it will come but too soon
the next day katell and oana went
out together that they might talk over what
they had heard oana said katell have
you not seen how unhappy our mother is
and how changed our father
 that indeed have i answered oana and
 this i wanted to talk to you when i
see our father and mother looking at one
another tdl ouch tal or forehead to forehead
is the breton expression there is so much
sadness in one and so much mystery in the
other that think we ought to be doing
something
 but what can we do what service can
we render where can we get work how
can we find money do you know anything
that we can do 
 we can do little katell but perhaps
filial affection 
we can do something i have thought that
if matters reached their extremity we had
one little resource
 what is it oana is it yours or mine
or could we both us unite 
 yes both us and you even more
than i for that beautiful hair yours is
more valuable than 
 nay oana my locks i cannot but
here the poor girl blushed she was indeed
proud as she might be her fine flaxen
hair and her pride resisted for a moment 
but it was for a moment only anything
anything oana and whenever the time is
come we will go together to vannes and
my hair shall be disposed without a murmur
nay more with a cheerful willing
heart pleased that i have something to offer
in the day tribulation
the girls returned home together happier
 minor morals
than they had been for many a day for if
any frame mind be happy it is that in
which after a struggle a known sacrifice
has been willingly made to virtue
matters grew worse and worse at last
jann could conceal from nobody the coming
evil he said to his wife and children 
we are ruined we are houseless we are
penniless we are worse than penniless our
farm we must leave and that is not all i
owe debts that i cannot pay i have seen
the little stock food consumed i dared
not say i could not replenish our store it
is almost exhausted the order for our ejectment
is arrived i know not whither to go
poverty is come upon us like one that
traveller and want ars an armed man 
there are no poor laws in france there
is no provision for sudden privation jann's
spirit was so humbled and broken that he
filial affection 
would willingly for his family's sake have
submitted to the shame asking for some
short supply food and raiment so utter
and so hopeless was their destitution but
such resource there was none and tomorrow
said he we must go forth miserable
beggars in an inhospitable world 
katell whispered to her sister the time
is come she left the house and was followed
by oana they walked together to
the town vannes
it was in the month may to young
hearts the sweetest month the year they
saw many flowers on the banks but they
gathered them not they heard many songs
 many birds but they noticed them not
they scarcely opened their lips to one another
though in that moment they felt each
 them a stronger affection to the other
than they had ever felt before but as they
 minor morals
entered the town oana inquired her sister
where they were to go
katell looked at oana whose soft
and wavy hair fell in circling ringlets over
her shoulders and there was another instant
 doubt and hesitation
the struggle was soon over she took
oana's hand and led her through the
gates the city to a narrow street where
one the itinerant purchasers human hair
had taken up his usual temporary abode during
the season in which the girls brittany
are used to bargain for their long tresses
katell was the spokeswoman and long
was the discussion between her and the hair
merchant at last he agreed to give seven
francs for oana's and five for katell's hair
he cut it off and while the operation was
performing some tears natural tears dropped
from the sisters eyes
filial affection 
shorn their beauty they spent one
franc the twelve to buy themselves caps to
hide their changed appearance they turned
homewards with feelings in which the approving
voice duty silenced many thoughts
 distress their absence had caused their
father and mother much disquietude but they
no sooner entered than their mother for
mothers are always quick in discerning all
the movements children's minds perceived
what the girls had done and broke out into
exclamations sorrow
 oh no mother said oana if you only
knew the pleasure we have felt in doing
something for ourselves and for you in a
moment like this 
and katell placed the eleven francs on the
table eleven francs in their then condition
were no small treasure and now let us
depart for there is nothing but affliction left
 minor morals
to us here in fact the officers justice
were then in possession the place and
jann well knew that all it contained would
be insufficient to satisfy the warrants against
him
they were allowed to take with them their
scanty wardrobe it scarcely sufficed for a
change the wornout garments had not
been renewed even in better times their
supply had been but scant and now it bespoke
the dreariness poverty
they reached quimper and it was at
a fortunate moment when agricultural labourers
were required for carrying on some
large experiments that were making in the
department finisterre and jann and his
family found no difficulty in obtaining an
engagement in new scenes old sufferings
were more easily forgotten and necessity
forced upon jann much knowledge which
filial affection 
 his own accord he would never have
acquired he spent four or five years in
the department the finisterre he learnt
the value those improvements which he
had before despised and he summoned up
courage enough to apply to the owner 
his farm in the morbihan to be allowed to
become a tenant this request was granted
and in the strange vicissitudes life jann
is again become the possessor the property
he had lost both katell and oana married
prosperous men who united to raise for jann
a sum money sufficient for him to redeem
his farm he turned it to the best account
he cultivated it with superior implements
and he has been able not only to repay
the sums lent him by his sonsinlaw but
he is laying by enough to provide comforts
for the old age himself and his wife he
often says that he should have sunk in despair
 minor morals
but for the timely succour wliicli his daughters
brought him in the moment his severest
distress by the sale their hair
and often as he strokes the head his
grandchildren whom there are six or seven
he has been observed to wipe the falling
tears from his cheeks and has been heard
to say god bless thee and thy beautiful
locks
songs the people
as the looking for happiness said mr
howard one day is the best employments
and the finding it the best good
fortune i am always delighted my children
 when any new occasion offers for discovering
enjoyment but very much depends
on our own willingness to be pleased and
on our own susceptibility to pleasure some
minds have a tendency to habitual gloom
in a flower they see nothing but the thorn
in the bee nothing but its sting in the
sky but the thunderstorm in the world but
its sorrows others more happily trained
find that 
in nature there is nothing melancholy
 minor morals
it is strange that artists have been so much
occupied with the representation misery 
so little with that joy the other day
going to the famous museum pictures at
antwerp i observed that there was scarcely a
face which did not express pain annoyance
suffering disgust i heard one person say 
i would rather visit a butchery for the
painters illustrious as they were and are
seem to be thinking nothing but human
calamity cruel inflictions frightful martyrdoms
 all the horrible and miserable exhibitions
 violent death i confess i shared
in the universal sentiment the representations
were so vivid as to be nearly approaching
to reality and to leave an impression not
far different from what would have been excited
by the scenes themselves and weariness soon
came over me
among sources pleasure the songs 
songs the people 
the people are prominent well do i remember
being roused from gloomy thoughts
by my muleteer when skirting the pyrenean
mountains there was an outbreak spontaneous
music to which he had adapted
extempore verses it was during the peninsular
war and we were travelling in some
 those narrow defiles where sudden night
sometimes overtakes one and the sunset is
followed almost without twilight by gloomy
darkness and this was his song 
my horse is tired and so am i 
how wearily we go 
i wish the venta now were nigh 
the sun is sinking low
and through the boxwood tree i peep
the venta to discover 
i fain would rest i fain would sleep 
the day is almost over
i know the venta from afar
a chestnut tree stands by it 
the venta has an evening star
and soon i shall espy it
venta a small inn
 minor morals
often have i heard the peasants spain
sing songs like this composed on the spur
 the moment and hummed to a monotonous
but characteristic tune
in all times poetry has had great influence
with the people and pleasant would
be the task to gather out history examples
 what a german poet calls the power 
the might song there is a pretty tale
told by jusuf ben harun el arrayed one
 the arabic poets spain in the
following words i went forth after our
holy festival and crossed the cordova stream
i sought the beautiful gardens beni mernan
and there i saw the loveliest women
the loveliest women a slave nothing
so fair nothing so graceful had i ever seen
before i bowed myself down before her
and she answered me with inconceivable
schiller die yacht des ganges
songs the people 
courtesy and readiness her voice was all
sweetness it fell on my ears like music
it penetrated my very soul her person
tone and language wholly subdued me in
the name allah fair creature said i to
her art thou a sister or a mother a
mother if it please you she graciously answered
 but tell me then i pray the
name thou dearest halewa she replied
and rejoined i may the fates bless
thee that gave thee so dulcet a name and
the poet goes on in this style to the detail
 all he suffered for the beautiful slave 
what a long and perilous journey he undertook
to borrow the money for her ransom that
having effected it he found she had long
before been pledged to another how the
king was appealed to who became enamoured
in his turn and then bribed the great orator
 the day to detain by his eloquence the
 minor morals
husband the beautiful slave in order that
he the king might pay his court to halewa 
while the poet for his portion was condemned
to chains and left to tell his miseries to
the walls a prison such stories have
been preserved through many generations
i have heard them in many lands living
through all vicissitudes i have seen children
youths and grown up people listening
with eager beating hearts and eyes intensely
bright to the narrator for man is everywhere
the same interested in man's history
alive to man's suffering and sympathising
in man's pleasures
whenever i travel it is one my
habitual and favourite occupations to ascertain
what is the poetry the people and what
their proverbs which are often condensed
poetry there is poetry and beautiful poetry
everywhere i remember once when in the
songs the people 
woods finland i heard a song manycenturies
old which described what song could
do do you recollect george what is narrated
by the classic poets orpheus
ay papa that he stopped by his
music the swiftest rivers made the mountains
dance and tamed the wild beasts the
forest that he forced his way into the regions
 pluto charmed the very furies 
and soothed the agonies those who were
suffering torture there
and i have read too added arthur
that the people thrace claimed the honor
 possessing his tomb on mount libethrus
around which they said nightingales built
their nests and thus became the most melodious
 birds
the song i heard from the flanders
reminded me the classical fable for it
told the powers the harp whose strings
 minor morals
were made the tail the wild horse and
its body from the oldest oak tree the
woods and it is said that when played on
by a mighty hand the birds gathered round
the musician the beasts crouched before him 
the fishes looked out the ocean and all
the auditory wept
why said edith that is something
like the story the eloquence the catholic
saint whom we saw a picture in
which he was preaching to all the beasts
on the earth all the birds in the air and
all the fishes in the sea and they were
listening with unanimous attention
yes said mr howard the same sort
 exaggeration prevails everywhere and the
farther we go back the more startling and
incredible it is
the poetry the people is one the
most delightful resources and comforts nasongs
 the people 
tons that have been subjugated by strangers
in it they often give expression to thoughts
which would otherwise find no vent
you may have heard rhigas who
wrote the national hymn the greeks and
who was so cruelly put to death by the
turks when he was returning homewards from
a journey into austria a friend mine
m laurel mentions an instance the
influence rhigas's poetry on his countrymen
a traveller in macedonia was struck with
the intelligent expression countenance 
a baker's boy his person was a model 
grace and beauty he looked the traveller
in the face and said can you read being
